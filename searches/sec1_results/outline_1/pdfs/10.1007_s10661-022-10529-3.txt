Abstract
Agriculture is a distinct sector of a country’s economy. In recent years, new patterns have evolved in the agricultural industry. In conjunction with sensor scaling down and precision agriculture, the field of remote sensor networks, such as the wireless sensor network (WSN), was developed. Its major purpose is to make horticultural operations simpler to identify, assess, and manage. This paper uses the proposed DCNN to predict soil moisture and plan irrigation for precision agriculture farmers to reduce water consumption used for cultivation and increase production yield by comparing water content during various stages of plant growth and integrating IoT applications into agriculture. It also optimizes the water level for future irrigation decisions to maintain crop growth and water stability. The data must be served and stored in the form of a grid view, according to Apriori and GRU (gated recurrent unit). Using numerous sensor and parameter modelling methodologies, this system assists in the prediction of irrigation planning based on irrigation needs. The predicted parameters include soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. This observed experimental data supports smart irrigation in crop production with a high yield and little water use. DCNN has a 98.5% experimental result accuracy rate and the MSE value is predicted in DCNN 99.25% of the time.

IntroductionBy installing IoT devices in the field, the agricultural industry is focused on IoT technology to get benefits rapidly and with low investment, making farming innovative and high-tech. Sensors, which are part of the overall environmental monitoring and management system, are essential to WSNs. Sensors in the irrigation fields collect data and store it for later use in the operation. Different types of sensors are used in smart sensor irrigation systems such as light, temperature, rain, level, soil moisture, and flow. Big data analysis (BDA) is a term used to describe analytical workloads that include complex analyses and many data types and a mix of data volume, velocity, and range. Agriculture necessitates crop production prediction models, economic models, pest and crop disease prediction models, and other types of data analysis. In agriculture, big data analytics may be used to analyze large amounts of structured and unstructured data to create quicker and more reliable results that can assist farmers in making better choices as shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Graphical abstractFull size imageClimate research and forecasting for agriculture, environmental change, determining on modifications in trimming designs, producing benchmarking datasets, data reconciliation and interoperability provided by sensors and equipment used in greenhouses, and accuracy horticulture, agro-warning frameworks, text, voice, picture, and video preparation, water system and water appropriation composts and pesticides and their effects, geographical analysis for agribusiness, continuous announcement and derivation for horticulture, farming fund and yield protection, showcasing, and flexibly chain the executives and agribusiness. Climate predictions estimate weather averages and other climatic features from a few months to a few years in the future. Forecasters are increasingly turning to extensive Earth’s climate system models that generate such forecasts. Forecasts aid farmers in risk management since production choices are sometimes made before prices are known. Consumers profit from the availability of high-quality, low-cost food. It also helps to guarantee that markets work fairly by providing information on predicted rates.The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of connected objects – “things” – embedded with sensors, computers, and other capabilities that connect to and share data with other devices and systems over the internet (Anbarasan et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2018). Further, smart irrigation is a novel technique for watering that is enabled through networked sensors, devices, and remote controls. Farmers and their staff gain real-time visibility into the irrigation process and the ability to automate their operations. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) is a type of recurrent neural network that uses connections between nodes to accomplish machine learning tasks like memory and grouping, such as voice recognition.The main contributor of the paper is as follows: this study uses the suggested DCNN to forecast soil moisture and plan irrigation for precision agriculture producers to minimize water consumption utilized for cultivation and boost crop yield by analyzing water content throughout various phases of plant growth and integrating IoT applications into agriculture. According to Apriori and GRU, data must be delivered and stored in the form of a grid display (gated recurrent unit). This system aids in the prediction of irrigation planning based on irrigation demands by utilizing different sensor and parameter modelling approaches.The paper is discussed as follows: the “Introduction” section discusses the introduction; the “Literature survey” section discusses the literature survey; the problem statement and objective of the proposed method are discussed in the “Problem statements” and “Objective” sections, respectively; the “System model” section describes the system model; the “Result and discussion” section discusses the result and discussion; finally, the “Conclusion” section describes the conclusion of the work.Literature surveyA multiple WSN data collection technique for edge computation was used to increase valid data volume while reducing data collection time (Li et al., 2020a). WSN architecture is established first by merging edge computing and data gathering models into a WSN for many jobs and sensors. WSN uses the sensor network architecture. This sort of architecture may be seen in a range of places, including hospitals, schools, highways, and buildings, and it is used for a variety of purposes, including security, disaster management, and crisis management. A data administration system with an edge computing differential data management system. It protects sensor cloud privacy and addresses sensor cloud storage concerns (Wang et al., 2020). In terms of time, data quality, and energy usage, the findings suggest that the proposal outperforms traditional data gathering techniques.Agriculture underwent a big data study investigation, especially from a technical standpoint. The 34 research papers analyzing the issue, the solution that may be implemented, the tools/methods employed, and the data used were discovered and examined (Kamilaris et al., 2017; Khan et al., 2018). In light of big data and the necessity to clean up multi-dimensional function data, mobile edge nodes are being utilized to clean data. The training data for the cleaning model is obtained using the ABOD algorithm (Sharma et al., 2018). Angle-based outlier detection (ABOD) is a relatively new approach for detecting outliers in large datasets. ABOD evaluates the broadness of a point’s angle spectrum as an outlier factor, rather than looking at neighbourhoods as proximity-based ideas.In this study, modified Z-SEPs for varied agricultural contexts were used. Area 0 divides the field into 2 areas such as heading Area 1 and direction Area 2 (Singh et al., 2019). Data is sent to BS using the clustering process. The proposed simulated data demonstrate that utilizing modified Z-SEP enhances node stability by around 23% in agricultural usage when compared to LEACH and 27% when compared to SEP (Shah et al., 2016). For an Agro Advisory Program, a Big Data research framework is presented. For the creation of big data applications, an analytical framework is also being created and deployed. The Big Data Analytical Tool is a highly valuable systematic tool that helps to understate data and understand data from many viewpoints (Kumar & Nagar, 2017; White et al., 2018). This framework offers and uses an analytical tool to design applications for big data (Wachowiak et al., 2017). A formal way for analyzing massive data, improving judgments, and increasing animal precision is the predictive analytical approach. Predictive analytics is a type of advanced data analytics that involves evaluating historical data to make predictions about future outcomes. This method uses statistical modelling, data mining, and machine learning tools and techniques to evaluate previously collected data and provide accurate and actionable insights. The predictive analysis technique completes the final model evaluation by providing a predictive accuracy assessment, which includes an estimated chance that events and non-events described in the target variable would be observed (Harish Kumar et al., 2017).As a new topic in agriculture, the paper examines the continuous nature of a variety of difficulties, including data security, data quality, availability, initial investment, infrastructure, and associated knowledge (Sarker et al., 2019; Surendran et al., 2019). Additional hardware and software information is used to convey data from smartphones. The farmer may operate the mobile phones at any time and from any location. It is more relevant to agriculture-dependent nations, such as India (Saxena & Dutta, 2020). The cloud sensor paradigm for data collecting has been studied and published in recent research endeavors. Then, we classified and categorized material using taxonomy (Li et al., 2020b; Ang & KahPhooiSeng, 2021). To
get a better grasp of the most current applications of Big Data in smart agriculture, social and economic challenges must be addressed. This article covers data generating techniques, technology accessibility (Bhat & Huang, 2021), device accessibility, software tool accessibility, data analysis approaches, and appropriate big data applications in precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a management technique that collects, organizes, and evaluates temporal, geographical, and interpersonal data before combining it with other data to enable management decisions based on estimated variability for improved resource utilization economy, production, dependability, competitiveness, and long-term growth of agricultural production. Apart from that, there are a few drawbacks to using big data technology extensively in agriculture (White et al., 2020; Rao & Yuan, 2021). This study also uses comparison trials to illustrate the algorithm’s dependability in terms of accuracy and time efficiency (Campos-Guillén et al., 2020). The collecting and analysis of big data, the creation of new models, and the practical and uncomplicated deployment of these models are all part of a new agricultural revolution. It will provide agronomical research with a new viewpoint (Velmurugan et al., 2021).For each action detailed in the paddy rice production and post-production phases, an approach was created that maps the activities stated in rice smart farming, the data utilized in data modelling, and the machine learning techniques used per activity. The post-production step is necessary for the items to be delivered from the manufacturer to the customer. Producers, resellers, wholesale, rural retailers, and suppliers, as well as delivery, flow on marketing functions, are all engaged in product distribution (Alfred et al., 2021).According to the mapping approach, integrating these three technologies efficiently and effectively is crucial for changing conventional rice-growing techniques into a new level of intelligence in rice precision agriculture (Cravero & Sepúlveda, 2021). Precision agriculture makes use of data from a number of sources to improve agricultural yields and reduce the cost of crop management activities such as fertilizer inputs, irrigation, and soil improvement. Precision agriculture has reduced food insecurity by allowing farmers to grow more agricultural food crops with less input than in the past. These technologies increase transparency in farming by improving record-keeping, food traceability, and documentation. It also helps in planning.The use of Big Data and Machine Learning in agriculture, as well as the detection of hurdles, adjustments, and system architecture design. This review may be of interest to computer or data scientists, as well as electrical or software engineers. The results show that manipulating large volumes of data is no longer a problem because of cloud technology (Fathi et al., 2021; Su & Wang, 2021). Proposed to utilize big data in agriculture, using the egg price of a city’s wholesale market as the study object, to investigate the influencing causes and price variations of egg price by mining and analyzing relevant agricultural big data, and then displaying the big data, in order to give a relevant scientific basis for creative e-commerce economic management.The whole generation chain is covered, including day-to-day agricultural activities (Wang et al., 2006). Farmers commonly deal with information overload, which necessitates the creation of a new data source (Sorensen et al., 2010). Temperature, soil moisture, and humidity are monitored by the sensors, and the data is communicated to farmers through third parties such as meteorological stations (Wang et al., 2007). Farmers were able to readily integrate information and make clear decisions about how to deliver certain items at the moment, so boosting their pay and meeting legislative requirements (Lan, 2012; Razi & Nath, 2019). Furthermore, the farmer’s internal arrangement and similar thinking data suggest that knowledge is developed to learn and establish a real intellectual framework (McCown et al., 2012). In a wireless sensor network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) setup employing ZigBee (Gutierrez et al., 2013), several sensor nodes in a given area are employed. Temporary climate fluctuations and the elements in issue, such as evapotranspiration, affect the incidence of rains (Rawal, 2017). As a consequence, assessing climatic variables connected to agricultural productivity is crucial in avoiding a global water calamity and food shortages. The most visible agricultural initiative is to increase crop water productivity (CWP) (Lan, 2012), which allows farmers to produce more food with less water.Problem statementsAs a result, the apparent diversity in the agricultural environment may be controlled by customizing inputs to the specific regions where they are needed. As a result, this study used and enhanced the precision agriculture model to track crop growth while accounting for variables such as air temperature, soil moisture, and soil type in the field. Precision agriculture increases agricultural income and resource utilization by reducing the use of traditional management practices. Precision farming, which is focused on production yield and soil types, has an impact on crop growth. Precision agriculture can revitalize India’s agricultural economy. The presentation of erroneous estimations on water-based soil conditions is one of the limiting factors that impact crop output. Recommendations for various irrigation methods are based on socioeconomic characteristics. Some of the elements that determine irrigation farmers’ ability to use agricultural information and knowledge include socioeconomic, social, psychological, and geographical aspects. Irrigation farmers’ actions are influenced not only just by farm-related and management-related issues, but also by external institutions and socioeconomic factors.ObjectiveThe goal of the proposed research is to find limiting variables that impact agricultural productivity. The major goal is to provide practical advice to farmers that use IoT in precision agriculture to increase crop output by predicting different soil conditions. Soil moisture is influenced by a variety of factors, including precipitation, plant water consumption intensity, and air temperature. Because appropriate soil moisture is critical for yields, plants will not grow and develop if the soil moisture is insufficient. For the crops, high doses of radiation may be necessary. Excessive temperatures may have an unfavorable influence on the yield as the stages develop. During these times, farmers employ a ventilation system to keep the temperature in check. If the humidity is excessive, the illness will worsen. Soil water influences productivity as well. These components were regarded as significant data information in this research as a consequence of the prior reasoning concerning the impact of temperature, humidity, and water level on cultivation. The main purpose is to provide accurate temperature, humidity, and water data. Predicts soil moisture and adjusts irrigation as appropriate. Improving irrigation practices in precision agriculture will help to ease water constraints. Deliver timely, accurate, trustworthy, and valuable information to farmers to increase their productivity.System modelThe soil, which is recognized as a fundamental component in farming, is the key to its success. Precision agriculture detects and monitors soil moisture in real-time. To monitor soil conditions, modern agricultural monitoring technologies such as gamma-radiometric soil sensors, a soil moisture sensor, and electrical conductivity sensors are available. Gamma radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation with a short wavelength and a high energy level. It can penetrate solid things more deeply than light and has a spectrum of several hundred meters in the air. It refers to the detection of natural sources of gamma radiation released from the earth. Gamma radiometric measurements also distinguished doleritic, lateritic, and granitic soil parent materials efficiently. The multiple sensors used to monitor weather conditions count the crop’s physiological status. A farmer should estimate the amount of water needed for cultivation ahead of time. Water availability is influenced by climate, season, soil type, crop variety, and growth stage. The crop loses water via transpiration and evaporation in general during cultivation. Environmental factors such as terrain, climate, soil properties, and soil water all have an impact on crop yield. Because of the interplay of these four factors, certain crops can only be grown in specific locations. The system model flow graph is shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Proposed work flowchartFull size imageAs demonstrated in the flow graph, the S-Linear Kernel Analysis Algorithm (S_LKA) is employed to anticipate soil moisture. The K SLinear Kernel Analysis Algorithm (K_SLR) for Prediction of Current Soil Moisture (CSM) with Minimum Standard Error is used to predict soil moisture (PSM Value). Sends an “On” status to start irrigation if (Tmax > GSM) is fulfilled. The recommended deep Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm was used to assess the parameters.Precision agriculture shown in Fig. 3, for example, uses the Internet of Things to increase agricultural output over time. Precision farming makes use of the Internet of Things to collect and communicate massive quantities of field data, evaluate it, and make the best agricultural decisions possible. Table 1 shows agronomist recommendations for acceptable environmental variables that impact crop development.Fig. 3Proposed system modelFull size imageTable 1 Environmental factors affecting various cultivation stagesFull size tableData aggregationWith the use of agricultural datasets, Apriori Data Aggregation allows for prediction and call characteristics. The data is then accurately translated to determine the constant value as well as the situation, while the user is notified by phone call. Apriori Data Aggregation represents the ultimate yield level of everything developed in the horticulture zone based on information analysis. The Apriori algorithm is a foundational approach for discovering Boolean association rules from frequently occurring itemsets. It investigates the level-wise mining Apriori condition that any nonempty subsets of a frequently occurring itemset must likewise be often frequent. Accumulation and anticipation techniques use a few factors to anticipate obscure or future estimates of the different factors, using the Open Grid Service Hash-Based Validation method, which allows the user perception and value of the dataset to the viewed as a table so that the prediction of the field area is easily calculated. At the field level of the region in which the node setup occurs, the global positioning system (GPS), computer modelling, ground-based/airborne/satellite remote sensing, variable rate technology, and sophisticated information processing are utilized to detect and maintain the field level implementation for timely in-season and between-season crop management.S-linear kernel analysisConvert the observed raw sensor data to a vector representation using the sparse linear regression (SLR) method. The sparse linear regression (SLR) problem aims to calculate a k-sparse n-dimensional vector tau that minimizes the error ||M tau – q|| given a d x n matrix M and a d-dimensional query q. This issue is the geometric equivalent of the following: find the nearest k-dimensional subspace to q that is covered by a subset of k points in P, given a collection of n points P and a query point q in d dimensions. A similarity function is used by the kernel to compare two data points. Sequential data, images, and vectors are no longer accepted by the kernel function. Kernel approaches are named from the fact that they operate in high-dimensional, ambiguous feature space by generating the linear combination of all pairings of data in the feature set rather than finding the coordinates of the data. When compared to manually computing the coordinates, this approach is generally less computationally demanding. The “kernel trick” is the name for this method. Equation (1) describes the weighted similarity measure form, the similarity function, Si training sample, and S', the unlabeled input.$${S}^{\wedge}=sgn\sum_{i=1}^nW_iS_i{}^m\left(S_i,S^\prime\right)$$

The irrigation will be timed to coincide with the farmer’s soil moisture threshold. Soil moisture thresholds are precise SWC values that indicate the availability of water for plant consumption. These levels are used to calculate when and how often irrigation is essential. The irrigation work is scheduled based on the threshold T and previous precipitation data, as well as the expected ground soil moisture trend. It is possible to switch on or off the water motor control. This gadget controls the relay that turns the water motor on and off. Based on the collected observations, the lowest and highest thresholds “Tmin” and “Tmax” defined in the previous algorithm will start and stop irrigation. Ground soil moisture (GSM) was predicted using MSE, and the difference between GSM and Tmax was used to determine whether irrigation should be done manually or automatically. The moisture content of the soil will normally range from 10 to 45%, although it will be higher during and after irrigation. Water is trapped in the pores of your soil, which are openings or gaps between sand grains and the interface of the sand grains. Tensiometer, moisture block, feel, and appearance are the most common ways to measure soil moisture. The motor receives the signal “1” signalling “ON.” To switch off the irrigation, it transmits the signal “0.” As a result, the system can forecast how much water is required for agriculture. Because of the lack of water, the system has a lot of potential for supporting farmers who rely on the terrestrial tank.Deep convolution neural networkThe approach may be used by farmers to identify irrigation-based decision-making by looking at the present irrigation schedule throughout the whole crop’s growth. Crop growth characteristics are utilized as input datasets in this module, which forecasts precipitation, rainfall, and evapotranspiration ranges that may sustain crop output while ensuring future soil water stability, allowing irrigation to be planned and scheduled. This system was built using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are created using deep learning, a machine learning technology. It is based on the idea of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are designed to perform complex analyses on large amounts of data by routing it through several layers of neurons. The most common type of image and video pattern recognition system is deep convolutional neural networks (CNN or DCNN). The hydrological cycle and weather prediction both rely on soil moisture (SM). Satellites are the primary realistic tool to investigate large-scale SM dynamics on a regular basis. The radiative transfer hypothesis and satellite observations are frequently used to determine SM. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can improve SM retrievals even more than the NN model.The suggested deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), a high-performance deep learning model, has been presented. Effective features data may be retrieved from challenging spectrum data using the proposed DCNN, and the important structure of feature data can be determined. Convolutional neural networks offer a higher modelling power than surface learning approaches. The suggested DCNN was utilized to evaluate soil moisture content using near-infrared spectroscopy in this study. For spectral regression, an effective DCNN modelling technique was presented. This modelling strategy reduced the time it took to preprocess spectrum data and increased the accuracy of spectral prediction.Structure of DCNNThe capacity of multilayer networks to tackle a range of real-world problems with levels of accuracy that typical machine learning approaches have yet to attain has renewed interest in them. Proposed deep convolutional neural networks have achieved a lot of success in image analysis. The name refers to a neural network with a special network design in which each so-called hidden layer includes two unique layers: the first one is the result of a localized convolution of the preceding layer, and the next is a max-pooling stage, which drastically decreases the number of units by retaining just the maximum response of many units from the first stage. Following a series of concealed layers, the last layer is usually fully linked. Each network-predicted class has its unit that takes input from the others. Figure 4 shows the proposed DCNN structure.Fig. 4Structure of DCNNFull size imageThe MSE based accuracy expressed in Eq. (3).$$MSE=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n\left(z_i-z_i^\wedge\right)^2$$
                    (3)
                The coefficient of determination R, which is used to identify the soil qualities exploited by rainfall and runoff, is represented by the R factor. The R factor changes depending on how much rain falls each day.Every month, the R factor calculation methodologies outlined in equations are supplied.$${R}^{2}=1-\frac{\sum \left(z-{z}_{m}{}^{2}\right)}{\sum \left(z-{z}_{0}{}^{2}\right)}$$

The approach, which is based on the new CNN_ Algorithm, enables users to evaluate and implement irrigation schedules that are most advantageous to their agricultural conditions. By predicting precipitation and evapotranspiration range estimates and creating soil water stability via regulated irrigation, the system’s complexity is tempered and integrated, resulting in increased output yield. As a consequence, the system’s uniqueness comes from the hybridized mix of the artificial neural network (ANN) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). ANN is a commonly used machine learning approach that analyzes previous data to forecast patterns, whereas GA is an algorithm that can locate better subsets of input parameters for integrating into ANN, increasing the accuracy of prediction through optimized feature selection. The proposed DCNN makes advantage of the irrigation water that is pushed. The precipitation event had been well projected, notwithstanding the necessity to alter rainfall depths. The crop increase version of the soil water content tiers tracked the trend of soil humidity measurements while effectively predicting canopy cover patterns and seed cotton output, particularly on drip-irrigated plots. The proposed DCNN-based feature determines the best parameter, in this case, resulting in a classification system. The decision unit function of a neural network evaluates incoming input and initializes the population function. The population measures the yield at the senescence (Maturity) stage when the crop reaches its greatest height. The plant’s fruits and vegetables are now ready to be picked. After utilizing the proposed DCNN Algorithm to initialize the population, the mutation starts measuring irrigation levels in the field, which are dependent on plant development stages. Emergence, fast growth, lag growth, and senescence are the four phases of plant development. Finally, the fitness function was evaluated by determining the system’s MSE error rate, as well as identifying variations and evaluating performance using R2, RMSE, and other prediction measures. The water level in the field is checked. As a consequence, the system’s crop suggestions assist farmers in making the greatest precision agriculture selections possible.Result and discussionData collection and experimental setupThe environmental factors that are monitored include soil temperature, soil humidity, and water level. The data were collected utilizing several irrigation treatment sub-plots on a cotton-growing field in Southern Tamilnadu. Irrigation Area Guaranteed Historically, the satta system was used in several parts of Eastern India. Farmers had to apply for water each season under this arrangement, but they did not have to indicate which crops they wanted; paddy was assumed. Water had to be given to each farmer in sufficient quantities to allow the crop to mature. For a month, sensor observations were made at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 12 p.m., 2 p.m., and 4 p.m. The humidity sensors were utilized to gather data on moisture every 60 min regularly. In addition, statistical downscaling of precipitation was investigated to forecast accurate readings and provide decision-making support for irrigation resource management. The sensor-based system on the agricultural field, as well as the many soil parameters it monitors Matlab 2019 was used to run the simulations on the Windows 10 operating system (a). Irrigation water takes around 55% of the water utilized for crop growth in an average farmed area, therefore this is a significant component. When water is transported to the field, it loses 12% of its volume. The major purpose was to keep track of soil moisture content and irrigation levels as the crop progressed. The VH-400 sensor measures soil moisture, whereas the DHT22 sensor measures soil temperature and humidity. Moisture determination enables the quantification of irrigation requirements before a crop begins to exhibit indications of distress. Knowing the soil moisture condition enables extremely effective irrigation, supplying water just when it is needed and reducing excessive water consumption when irrigation is not necessary. The amount of moisture in a product impacts its processibility, shelf life, usefulness, and quality. Accurate moisture content assessment is so critical in maintaining quality in a variety of sectors, including food, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. To begin the main function, the datasets are collected and given for processing.GPS view of the fieldThe field area view is shown in Fig. 5, where the vision indicates the data to be begun with the use of the sensing area, the road describes the environmental region, and the camera view is the agricultural field area sensing level.Fig. 5Simulation view of fieldFull size imageAggregation, on the other hand, seems to be a time-saving strategy in the agricultural sense, including data from many parameter measurements such as air, humidity, temperature, and land change from a field region, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The sensor levels in the environmental sensing regions in the agricultural field are established based on the acquired data, and the overall seems level within each item set in the agricultural area is established.Fig. 6Aggregation of sensing fieldFull size imageThe GRU unit, restrictions, framework perception, and behavior patterns will all be followed throughout the Apriori Grid Round (Open Grid Service Architecture-Hash Based Validation). OGSA specifies a core set of standard service interfaces and their associated semantics for applications such as state management, fault management, and service creation and management. To construct interoperable and reusable services, interfaces and semantics are both necessary. Grid service refers to a service’s common and standard semantics and interface. A grid service is an OGSA-compliant Web service. In the GRU system, the role of examining data objects is emphasized in the form of grid services. The blue line represents the field area along this grid, while the diagonal box within the field specifies the yield area's table value. Aggregation at the grid level is seen in Fig. 7.Fig. 7Grid level histogramFull size imageFigure 8 shows a cross-correlation based on land modification in the sensor field region, where the wind direction deviation detects irrigation data in the field.Fig. 8Specification of water levelFull size imageThe precision and call occur to forecast environmental changes in the field; the time/sec changes are shown in Fig. 8. The deviations of user perception are shown in Fig. 9 where the grid service senses and sends data, and the field area represents the sensing of area changes. The dry soil’s weight is subtracted from the wet soil’s weight, which is then divided by the dry soil’s weight to get the soil moisture in the field area. Despite its simplicity, assessing soil moisture content is crucial for better understanding soil characteristics. The validation of the field when the area is to be sensed is specified in Fig. 10, as well as the accuracy that allows the field’s data to be processed.Fig. 9Train, test validation, and precisionFull size imageFig. 10Sensor values from depth along with outliers and tide levelFull size imageThe depth in feet, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11, determines the suggested system’s assessment metrics, as well as the outlier's ad tide, which will forecast the real and residual levels of the land area of the field.Fig. 11a Sensor values from water, b air, and temperatureFull size imageSensors are used in the SLR and K_SLR algorithms to conduct the agricultural land environmental parameters. For 3 weeks, the algorithm’s effectiveness was shown by measuring irrigation elements including humidity, soil moisture, and temperature on an hourly basis. This observation is carried out for 12 days and group growth is monitored for 170 days from 14 July 2021 to 31 December 2021. The approach for measuring the predicted soil moisture (PSM) value is provided by Algorithm SLR. This method aids in forecasting soil moisture, for the future days. With the correlation coefficient and least mean square error, the K_SLR method promotes excellent accuracy. The SLR Algorithm is trained independently with observed sensor data and recorded data for the future day’s soil moisture differential prediction. The training was during December 2021 (from 05–12-2021 to 20–12-2021). In addition, as shown in Tables 2 and 3, the SLR method’s statistical assessment of projected soil moisture is compared. Figures 12 and 13 illustrate a graphical depiction. The SLR approach offers greater accuracy and lower MSE when using the variables in Table 2.Table 2 SMD based on sensor data and prediction algorithmsFull size tableTable 3 Soil moisture based on sensor data and predicted algorithmsFull size tableFig. 12SMD based on sensor data and prediction algorithmsFull size imageFig. 13Soil moisture based on sensor data and predicted algorithmsFull size imageThe SLR algorithm predicts and generates the prediction soil moisture (PSM) value, which is then compared to the web-based interface for real-time monitoring to acquire the ground soil moisture value (GSM). Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the final projected soil moisture difference used in smart irrigation, which is depicted in Figs. 14 and 15. The quantity of water used for automatic irrigation (1250 ml) is less than that utilized for manual watering (1550 ml). The manual irrigation system has a hole in it. Automated irrigation is typically the best option.Table 4 Final predicted soil moisture using KSLR algorithm with observed sensor dataFull size tableTable 5 Final predicted soil moisture using K_SLR algorithm with sensor dataFull size tableFig. 14Final predicted soil moisture using KSLR algorithm with observed sensor dataFull size imageFig. 15Final predicted soil moisture using K_SLR algorithm with sensor dataFull size imageFarmers in poor nations are oblivious to the advantages of proper irrigation. In addition, the ideal water level is sufficient for good crop growth. Farmers will be able to determine the ideal water level point and increase crop yields with this irrigation planning strategy. During the seasons, the system will aid farmers with irrigation planning, enabling more efficient water usage in large agricultural fields.The proposed algorithm should be able to schedule smart irrigation based on anticipated soil moisture predicted by current approaches and provide optimum irrigation. Table 4 shows the experimental investigation that resulted in a reliable estimation of soil moisture based on field data and forecast information. This information might be used to predict how much water is required for effective irrigation and the most efficient use of natural rain. The suggested technique’s estimation error rate is calculated using statistical metrics like R squared and mean squared error. The farmer set the soil moisture threshold level in auto mode. Depending on the threshold level, the system will automatically design the irrigation chart based on weather forecast (precipitation) information and predicted soil moisture. The user is in control of scheduling choices in manual mode, which are based on precipitation data and projected soil moisture.Based on sensor data, a comparison of correlation coefficient (R) and mean squared error (MSE). Soil moisture prediction. The difference is compared to the recommended creative approach to measure their prediction accuracy, as shown in Table 6 and Fig. 16.Table 6 Comparison between SLR and K_SLR algorithmsFull size tableFig. 16Comparison between SLR and K_SLR algorithmsFull size imageFigure 16 shows the graphical result of the moisture level measured throughout a few days during the month in question. The results of the prediction made using SMD and the K_SLR show that the K_SLR has a higher accuracy of 99.75%. The suggested innovative K_SLR method outperforms the SLR algorithm, demonstrating the irrigation planning module’s effectiveness.The method simulates crop development in the context of a given crop’s soil profile, improving water stability. The procedure started at 6:00 a.m. and lasted all day, preparing the server to check the harvest. The hourly examination of the technology, which captures soil water content levels and projected precipitation variations, focuses on the crop development stages. The data acquired in the field is used to define the irrigation schedule and uniformity of the crop marinating water stability, so increasing the overall performance of the proposed DCNN version of the existing system. The R2, RMSE, and VIF of the suggested system were utilized to assess irrigation optimization. The emergence, fast growth, lag, and senescence phases of crop development take around 170 days and are separated into four stages: emergence, rapid growth, lag, and senescence. The performance of the recommended strategy was assessed based on its R2 of (0.974), low RMSE of (0.051), and VIF (98.789). As a consequence, in the performance metrics that were evaluated, our system beats the present artificial neural network (ANN) system. The proposed DCNN model replicates the amount of water in crop-growing areas. Equation (7) expresses the daily transpiration Ts.$${T}_{s}={S}_{k}*M{A}_{x}{K}_{m}{T}_{s,x}*E{T}_{0}$$
                    (7)
                where ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration, KmTs the midseason crop coefficient, Sk the crop coefficient, and MA micro-advective adjustments.The MA is expressed in Eq. (8).$$MA=1.72MA-M{A}^{2}+0.30C{C}^{3}$$
                    (8)
                Everyday utilized Ts and ET0 the water productivity (WP), the biomass calculation expressed in Eq. (9).$$B={W}_{p}*\sum \frac{{T}_{r}}{E{T}_{o}}$$
                    (9)
                Finally, the crop yield is calculated using Eq. (10).$$Y=B*{H}_{1}$$
                    (10)
                where H 1 is the percentage ratio of crop yield to the above-ground dry biomass. Based on Eq. 10 the crop yield was measured.Table 7 shows the evapotranspiration measurements, rainfall, and soil moisture forecast for different phases of a plant. When compared to the existing ANN, the proposed DCNN has a higher score of 96.32%.Table 7 Comparison of ANN predictions with proposed DCNNFull size tableWhen ET0 and R data were compared, the ET0 surpassed the R at all stages of plant development, as seen in Fig. 17. Evaporation from the open surface is frequently greater than evaporation from the soil surface. Instead of plant roots drawing up water, decreased rainfall caused more water to evaporate, as illustrated in the graph. Then, throughout the third and fourth phases of plant development, you will need to use a precise watering strategy.Fig. 17ET0 and R comparisons of ANN predictions with proposed DCNNFull size imageThe findings demonstrated that the proposed DCNN approach outperformed the current ANN model in all phases of plant development, indicating it to be superior to the other, as shown in Fig. 18. The soil moisture projection values for days (1–14) − 0.9741, (15–70) − 0.8965, (71–113) − 0.9026, (114–170) − 0.9632 are shown below.Fig. 18Predicted moisture comparisons of ANN predictions with proposed DCNNFull size imageThe performance indexes of the whole dataset are looked at. For both training and testing datasets, R2, RMSE, and VIF are utilized to score the performance metrics. The discriminating coefficient, abbreviated R2, is a popular regression performance indicator. It is a measure of how well a regression model explains the fluctuation of a dependent variable. A typical statistic for comparing predicted and actual outcomes is root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) or root-mean-square error (RMSE). The variance inflation factor (VIF) is a statistic that assesses how multicollinear a set of multivariate regression variables is. The VIF for a regression model variable is the ratio of overall model variance to the variance of a model with only that single independent variable. To evaluate the associations between the proposed DCNN and the ANN, the testing and training datasets were employed. Table 8 compares the proposed DCNN’s performance to that of the current ANN model for the measurement metrics R2, RMSE, and VIF at various stages of plant development. Despite having a huge number of data, the proposed DCNN system performs better in anticipating daily irrigation water requirements. In terms of representability and accuracy, the proposed DCNN surpasses the existing ANN model, and it has a low MSE.Table 8 Comparison of existing ANN with the proposed DCNN for the various performance metricsFull size tableWhen the results were compared to the present ANN model, it was observed that the proposed DCNN technique has a high R2 throughout all stages of plant development, suggesting that it is superior to the other, as shown in Fig. 19. Below are the R2 values for the days (1–14) − 0.961, (15–70) − 0.969, (71–113) − 0.962, and (114–170) − 0.974. As a consequence, the technology successfully optimizes the water level for future precision agricultural irrigation decision-making to guarantee optimum crop development and water stability.Fig. 19R2 comparisons of ANN predictions with proposed DCNNFull size imageThe proposed DCNN technique has a low RMSE error rate in the first three stages of plant development, as shown in Fig. 20, when compared to the present DCNN model, demonstrating that it is superior to the other. Below are the RMSEs for days (1–14) − 0.042, (15–70) − 0.038, and (71–113) − 0.035. As a consequence, irrigation may be scheduled ahead of time during the early stages of plant development.Fig. 20RMSE comparisons of ANN with proposed DCNNFull size imageThe findings were compared to the current ANN model, and it was discovered that the proposed DCNN approach has a high VIF at all phases of plant growth, demonstrating that it is superior to the other, as shown in Figs. 21 and 22. A confusion matrix is a table that shows how well a classification model performs on a set of test data when the true values are known. Although the confusion matrix is simple to understand, the terminology used to explain it can be difficult to understand. Count values are used to sum the number of correct and incorrect predictions and divide them by class. This is the key to comprehending the confusion matrix, which causes forecasters to get confused. The VIF readings for days (1–14) − 95.21, (15–70) − 96.84, (71–113) − 97.364, and (114–170) − 98.789 are shown below. As a result, the suggested DCNN has a strong correlation in terms of forecasting and planning irrigation for the parameters in consideration.Fig. 21VIF comparisons of ANN with proposed DCNNFull size imageFig. 22Confusion matrixFull size imageConclusionPrecision agriculture is a relatively new technology that demands the purchase of costly and complicated equipment like yield monitoring sensors and GPS receivers. Such facilities are out of reach for precision agricultural producers. As a consequence, many individuals opt to shun precision farming practices, especially if their goods are low in value. This work uses an IoT-based intelligent irrigation infrastructure and a hybrid machine learning-based approach to predict soil moisture. Based on prior observations made using weather forecast data, the recommended algorithms provide forecasts for future demand and soil moisture level studies. As a consequence, the research focuses on providing an automated and effective way of water usage, as well as assisting in the creation of water-saving devices based on the proposed algorithm and cost-effective analysis. The strength and quality of performance of the models have been improved, allowing for further advancement in the agriculture sector for lifelong use. The improved version of the created system has an R2 value of 97.4% as a consequence of the suggested modules. The total outcome of the suggested study effort provides favorable suggestions for farmers that employ IoT in precision agriculture to boost crop yield in future implementation.Farmers will be able to communicate information with the recommender system in the future using computer software or a mobile phone. Furthermore, intelligent agricultural planting, fertilizing, and harvesting decisions may be considered future research routes to effectively employ data to boost yields and profits. Furthermore, to precise agricultural requirements, the system was designed with soil conditions in mind.

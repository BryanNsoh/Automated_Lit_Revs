中文摘要:针对温室番茄无法按需灌溉问题，提出了随机森林(Random forest, RF)结合门控循环单元(Gated recurrent unit, GRU)神经网络的温室番茄结果前期蒸腾量预测方法，并开发了一套基于番茄蒸腾量的智慧灌溉系统。基于物联网实时获取数据，采用RF算法对影响温室番茄蒸腾量的变量进行特征重要性排序，选取作物相对叶面积指数、温室内空气温度、相对湿度、光照强度、光合有效辐射、基质含水率和基质温度作为模型的输入变量，在此基础上，构建了基于GRU的番茄蒸腾量预测模型。试验结果表明：RF-GRU在番茄蒸腾量预测中具有准确的预测效果，决定系数(R2)、均方根误差(RMSE)、平均绝对误差(MAE)分别为0.9490、10.96g和5.80g。同时，基于此模型进行指导灌溉相比于定时灌溉，在番茄长势基本相同的情况下，灌溉量降低了20%，可为实际生产提供参考。

Abstract:Taking greenhouse tomatoes as the research object, a forecasting method of transpiration of greenhouse tomatoes was proposed based on the real-time data of the Internet of things and random forest (RF) combined with gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network. Firstly, the main factors affecting transpiration change collected by the sensor were preprocessed and RF was used to order the characteristic importance of the variables affecting the transpiration of tomato in greenhouse. Crop phenotypic parameters, including relative leaf area index, ecological parameters in greenhouse and cultivation environment parameters, including air temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, photosynthetically active radiation, substrate moisture content and substrate temperature were chosen as the input variables of the model. On this basis, a prediction model based on GRU was established to predict the transpiration of tomato. Finally, this model was compared with other models. At the same time, based on this model, a set of intelligent irrigation equipment was developed, which took the substrate water as the irrigation starting point and the predicted transpiration as the irrigation amount. The experimental results fully showed that the RF-GRU model had accurate prediction effect in tomato transpiration prediction and showed good feature learning ability in agricultural big data mining. The determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.9490, 10.96g and 5.80g, respectively. Compared with RF-LSTM and RF-RNN methods, the R2 was increased by 1.46% and 3.78%, the root mean square error was decreased by 1.38g and 3.24g, and the mean absolute error was decreased by 1.77g and 0.14g, respectively. At the same time, compared with regular irrigation, the intelligent irrigation system designed based on this model reduced the irrigation amount by 20% when the tomato growth was basically the same. This study could provide a reference for the research of greenhouse crop water requirements and it can be applied to water-saving greenhouse irrigation.


Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agriculture Machinery (CSAM), in charged of China Association for Science and Technology (CAST), sponsored by CSAM and Chinese Academy of Agricultural Mechanization Science(CAAMS), started publication in 1957. It is the earliest interdisciplinary journal in Chinese which combines agricultural and engineering. It always closely grasps the development direction of agriculture engineering disciplines and the published papers represent the highest academic level of agriculture engineering in China. Currently, nearly 8,000 papers have been already published. There are around 3,000 papers contributed to the journal each year, but only around 600 of them will be accepted. Transactions of CSAM focuses on a wide range of agricultural machinery, irrigation, electronics, robotics, agro-products engineering, biological energy, agricultural structures and environment and more. Subjects in Transactions of the CSAM have been embodied by many internationally well-known index systems, such as: EI Compendex, CA, CSA, etc.

 AbstractThe biggest problem facing contemporary agriculture today is the enormous and ongoing growth of the world population, which necessitates a bigger production of agricultural goods to meet the needs for food. Also, there are more challenges facing agriculture, like the recent rise in inefficiency brought on by global climate change, reduced irrigation water, increasing soil contamination, plant diseases, and heat waves, all of which have a negative impact on agriculture sectors. In order to retain efficiency, sustainability, and quality, the agricultural sector needs to make investments in modern technologies and infrastructure that will allow it to evolve into a smart industry capable of addressing these difficulties through lean operations supported by industrial digital technologies. The manufacturing industry has fully embraced the industry 4.0 strategy, allowing them to achieve increased optimization, efficiency, responsiveness, and autonomy supported by the digitization approach. In order that to make a paradigm shift in the future of the agricultural industry, this paper deals with the digitization of agriculture, which is based on IOT, AI, and artificial neural network (ANN) technologies. The use of these technologies in agriculture will lead to the production of many services, such as data collection and analysis, pattern recognition, and independent decision-making based on artificial intelligence, added to existing agricultural automation as result of these processes. The agricultural industry is currently one of the most inefficient industries, and its use will lead to a technical revolution in the agricultural sector to improve productivity, quality, and sustainability.KeywordsSmart farmingIndustry 4.0Artificial Intelligence (AI)

1 IntroductionThe World Food Organization estimates that the world population will reach 9.15 billion by 2050, with an increase of another 2 billion, while the area that can be added to arable land will only be 4% [15]. And according to a paper published in 2018 by the World Government Summit, “Population growth = more food. The same paper estimated that the world's population will increase to 10 billion in 2050 [1, 7]. Due to the increasing world population and the challenges facing the agricultural sector (which will be discussed below), it is not possible to achieve agricultural practices with the required efficiency except by using the latest technological solutions, relying on modern agricultural techniques to improve resources and increase consumer demand, as well as high quality standards such as food safety, security, and traceability. Agricultural production needs many activities, such as soil monitoring, temperature, relative humidity, vegetation conditions, carbon dioxide levels, pest control, supply management, and infrastructure. IoT-based technology can add value in terms of quality, sustainability, and production increase as it performs a range of operations and helps with decision-making [7]. The goal of this research is to use fuzzy logic to integrate human informal knowledge into control techniques for protected agriculture. Early prediction of plant disease using an ANN-based system, networking of smart sensors, and IoT technology networking to facilitate and control large amounts of data, as well as collecting the data from sensors and integrating them in real-time to allow monitoring and control from anywhere and at any time by all process participants and also calculating biotic and abiotic stresses using UAVs and multispectral cameras Smart control of plant irrigation and fertilization using ANN, These It is considered one of the main questions of this research. However The main idea or focus of the current study program is to implement the Industry 4.0 strategy in farming through the integration of Internet of Things (IOT), ANN, fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the industry's infrastructure to make it possible to achieve the following goals and milestones: Using fuzzy logic, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things in agriculture has many advantages for helping and developing agriculture, and it will also facilitate farms in reducing manufacturing costs and thus increasing profitability and sustainability [3]. The research will make it possible to include human informal knowledge into the control strategy using fuzzy logic, creating human-like control over the greenhouses' parameters. With the combined application of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT), it will be easier to reach a higher level of efficiency in the use of resources like water, fertiliser, pesticides, energy sources, etc. On the farm, (IoT applications will lead to environmental protection). Also, this study dealt with the use of fuzzy logic techniques, which will enable the integration of informal human knowledge into the control strategy, thus developing human-like control of the parameters of farm entities (greenhouses). Through the joint use of AI and IoT, they will facilitate an enhanced level of efficiency in the use of water, fertilizers, pesticides, energy sources, etc. on the farm (artificial intelligence (AI), and IoT applications will protect the environment). This study also focused on the importance of integrating technology. The research enables farms to adopt more effective environmental protection strategies. by combining fuzzy logic and AI technology. However, IoT is a key component of smart farming as well, as this study shows. This is considered one of the main problems in this sector, and this study seeks solutions to these problems to enable farmers to use modern agricultural industry technology on their farms as well as provide practical steps to agricultural companies. It also gives the farmers solutions and good ideas for the researchers about how to pay attention to this important sector. These are the main issues addressed in this study. Also, the paper presents a rationalization of the benefits and useful information about Industry 4.0 as well as the obstacles related to the implementation of the latest technological solutions in smart agriculture. The importance of this research lies in the fact that it provides important technological solutions for the significance of using Industry 4.0 in the agriculture sector, particularly using IOT, AI, and fuzzy logic in smart farming, as well as recommending researchers pay attention to this important sector. It will also enable farms to lead in adopting more effective environmental protection strategies through the combined use of fuzzy logic and AI techniques. This is one of the most important technical recommendations that must be worked on and developed.2 Previous ResearchThe widespread use of wireless communication will raise the bar for agricultural automation, and wireless communication will alter communication standards. Sensor networks are defined by a variety of IEEE standards, including IEEE 802.15.1 PAN/Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee, and many others. These standards must be understood when developing sensor network applications. The use of the IPV6 Internet Protocol for wireless communication and a significant amount of hardware to establish a WSN are currently under debate. Precision agriculture and the creation of optimal strategies are both made feasible by using WSN.However, the IoT concept has made it possible to build a network of intelligent sensors that can quickly and effectively cover large areas. The IOT gateway has been forked by the authors, Sridevi Navulur et al., into various nodes such as actuators, sensors, interfaces, and wireless links that enable communication between them [26]. To monitor agricultural land and alert farmers via email or SMS or if the system detects any anomalies, Kodali et al. presented the Losant platform [20, 21]. An automated irrigation system that uses the GPRS module as a communication tool was created by Gutiérrez-Rodrguez et al. [10]. The system has been programmed into a microprocessor-based gateway that regulates the flow of water and has the system encoded into it. It has been shown that the water savings are 90% greater than the irrigation technique used traditionally. Kim et al. used a distributed wireless network to remotely sense and control irrigation processes [27]. To decrease human intervention, time, and cost while improving efficiency, productivity, and the global market. Malavade et al. focused on the IoT's impact in agriculture and how it results in smart framing [23].Artificial neural networks (ANN) have recently been used by the agricultural industry due to their advantages over conventional control systems. Artificial neural networks can predict the behaviour of the system through the training process [11]. Gliever and Slaughter utilized ANN to recognize weeds in crops. The authors, Maier et al., utilized artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict water resource variables [22]. To send data to the server so that domain operators can make appropriate decisions [30], Song & He et al. combined expert systems and artificial neural networks to estimate the nutritional value of crops, while Ravichandran & Koteshwari suggested using ANN algorithms for crop. They also suggested an expert farming system that uses IoT to send data to the server so that domain operators can make suitable decisions [30]. The effectiveness of the model depended on the number of hidden layers. To assess soil moisture in the Badi fields with significantly less meteorological data, two ANN models were created. By examining the observed and estimated soil moisture values, both models were proven to be accurate. It led to a more efficient use of less meteorological data, a lower consumption of labor and time, and an accurate and trustworthy estimation of soil moisture in rice fields [2]. Hinnell et al. [12], in their discussion of drip irrigation systems, mention that ANNs have been developed to predict the spatial distribution of groundwater [12].The membership function of each system variable used in fuzzy logic is an effective technique for representing informal knowledge [13, 14]. Sannakki et al. created a novel technique for classifying leaf diseases that separates the healthy from the diseased portions of the leaf with the help of image segmentation and a set of k means [29]. To determine the ideal N fertiliser rates based on field and crop variables, Tremblay et al. developed the fuzzy inference system (FIS) [25]. Based on the weather data, the model predicted plant illnesses [16]. The technique was created to prevent diseases in plants because they only appear when the temperature and humidity in the atmosphere are within a specified range. Wall and King created an intelligent system that uses field temperature and humidity sensors to control sprinkler valves [14, 17]. A distributed irrigation system that measures soil moisture was developed by Miranda et al. [3, 15], and Greenhouse developed a multi-variable fuzzy controller for the Greenhouse system. The developed fuzzy inference engine integrates the correlation of input variables and incorporates informal knowledge from field experts [14].3 Definition of Industry 4.0A paper was proposed in 2011 titled “Industry 4.0: Intelligent Manufacturing of the Future.” Industry 4.0 is defined as “the name of the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, including smart factory construction, the IoT, cloud computing, cognitive computing, and electronic physical systems” [12, 22, 27]. Industry 4.0 refers to the technological evolution from embedded systems to electronic physical systems [31]. Note that there are many definitions for “industry 4.0”, and not all the definitions are the same, but “industry 4.0” is also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution [1]. Decentralized intelligence helps create intelligent networks and manage autonomous operations, with the interaction of the real and virtual worlds representing a new and important aspect of the manufacturing and production process. The first industrial revolution began in the late eighteenth century in Britain, enabling the mass production of water and steam power rather than human and animal power. A century after the first Industrial Revolution, Industrial 2.0 began, introducing assembly lines and the use of oil, gas, and electric power as important energy sources in the industry, along with more advanced communications by telephone and telegraph and a certain degree of automation of manufacturing processes [28]. The third industrial revolution began in the mid-twentieth century, contributing to the manufacture of computers, advanced communications, and data analysis [31]. In addition, the digitization of factories has started with the integration of control units (PLCs) into machines to automate certain processes and collect and exchange data. The world is currently experiencing the fourth industrial revolution, which is the latest transformation in the industrial sector. (Increasing automation and the use of smart machines and smart factories), this data helps produce more efficient and productive goods. Flexibility is improved so that manufacturers can meet customer demands with mass customization; in pursuit of efficiency, by collecting more data from the factory floor and combining it with other enterprise operational data, a smart factory can achieve information transparency and better decision-making. The Fifth Industrial Revolution (Industry 0.5) is expected to bring humans back to the centre of operations through a human-electronic-physical system of value creation [28]. Tables 1 and 2 show the development roadmap of industrial and agricultural revolutions from the 18th century up to date. Table 3 shows the concepts of Industry 4.0 technology and Agriculture 4.0 technology.Table 1. The history of industry revolutions from steam to sensors [18, 28].Full size tableTable 2. The history of agriculture revolutions from 18th century up today [18, 28, 32].Full size tableThe agricultural revolution brought an important shift in human history and helped in the development of agriculture and the domestication of plants and animals. It also enabled people to stay in their places and establish permanent and stable settlements, which helped civilization development (1960s to the early 2000s).Table 3. The concepts of industrial and agricultural revolution technologies [1].Full size table4 Agriculture 4.0 and Food IndustryDespite the big evolution in the agricultural field, there are many issues and challenges that need to be addressed, such as environmental issues, a lack of digitalization, and the issue of food safety. Industry 4.0 was marked by the synthesis of all emerging technologies, bringing together the IoT (IoT), robotics, big data, and blockchain technology [7], Using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Autonomous Robotic Systems (ARS), Cloud Computing (CC), Simulation and System Integration (SI), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Twin (DT), and Additive Manufacturing (AM), industry can be digitalized and make agriculture smarter. The integration of Industry 4.0 and agriculture provides the opportunity to transform industrial agriculture into Agriculture 4.0, or the “next generation”, also called “digital agriculture.” Agriculture 4.0 can be achieved by collecting precise variables in real-time as well as processing and analysing data related to the agricultural industry from food production, processing, and distribution to consumer use [1]. Such a smart agro system would greatly improve productivity, food supply chain efficiency, natural resource utilization and food safety [7, 19]. Sensors are used to detect crop stages, recommend timely inputs and treatments, and control the level of irrigation. The food industry needs more research on food security, transparency, and the required documentation. Smart sensors are used as a tracking system in addition to collecting human and product data. Agriculture 4.0 means a transformation of the production infrastructure: it contributes to the creation of connected farms, new production equipment, machinery, and connected tractors, enabling increased productivity, quality, and environmental protection [19]. Smart agriculture concept is shown below in Fig. 1.Fig. 1.Smart agriculture concept [1].Full size image5 From Industry 4.0 Toward Agriculture 4.0The methodology behind this study is to develop a smart farm prototype using digital technologies, implementing the industry 4.0 strategy in farming. The study also identifies challenges and evaluates unsolved problems, potential applications, and the uses of AI and architectures for the IoT in the agricultural industry. With the help of Internet of Things (IoT), fuzzy logic, and artificial neural networks (ANN) technologies, the study will develop an integrated digital tool that will allow the agricultural sector to collect, process, and transmit data as well as take independent decisions and actions based on incorporated informal knowledge obtained through the use of fuzzy logic without the need for human intervention [10]. The Internet of Things provides the communications infrastructure required to connect and link smart devices to user-mobile devices over the Internet, such as sensors, vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles to user-mobile devices [5]. This study also highlights many of the challenges exposed to contemporary agriculture, such as the continually increasing demand for quality food, shortages of labour and arable land, increased soil contamination, irrigation water reduction, and loss of yields due to plant diseases and pests [7]. Along with this, the agricultural sector is currently facing difficulties brought on by climate change, which have increased existing inefficiencies in the field. These are besides the challenges the agricultural industry currently faces due to global climate change, which has added to the inefficiencies of the agricultural industry. In such circumstances, to maintain efficiency, quality food, and healthy and sustainable production and cultivation of healthy food Environmentally, the agricultural industry needs to invest in new techniques and infrastructure to transform into a smart industry comprised of smart farms capable of responding to challenges through lean operations supported by industrial digital technologies (IDTs), irrigation water reduction, increased soil contamination, and yield loss due to plant diseases and pests [4, 10]. This research can be useful to farmers, researchers, and professionals working in agricultural businesses for intelligent farming.Newness/ originality of the study: Several prominent researchers have made efforts for smart agriculture using IoT concepts in agriculture. But a set of revealed challenges remains in the queue for effective resolution. This study makes some effort to discuss previous research and open challenges in IoT-based agriculture, artificial intelligence, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic to develop smart farming. However, using industry 4.0 techniques in farming will give farmers and agriculture companies many benefits:

1.
By using the Internet of Things in farming, it can make it easier to manage and collect large amounts of data from sensors, as well as control and integrate them from anywhere and at any time, allowing communication among all participants in the process.


2.
Using fuzzy logic, the research will allow the incorporation of human informal knowledge into the control strategy, resulting in human-like control of the farm entities (‘greenhouses’) parameters.


3.
With the combined of AI and IoT, the farm will be able to achieve a higher level of efficiency in the use of water, energy sources, fertilisers, pesticides, etc.


4.
Internet of Things applications will lead to environmental protection.


5.
The research enables farmers to adopt more efficient environmental protection strategies by combining fuzzy logic and AI techniques.


6.
Using Internet of Things (IOT) sensors and AI-enabled equipment such as drones and agriculture robots, farmers can increase food production by more than 70% by 2050.


Figure 2 shows the system's structure. The central unit receives and collects the data from autonomous measurement stations, local weather forecasts, professional knowledge from local agronomists, pre-processed images received from multispectral crop cameras utilising UAVs, and data obtained from mobile device applications. The central unit generates control actions for the actuators based on previously collected, processed, and stored data, The central unit generates control actions for the actuators. This system is suitable for both outdoor and protected agriculture (in greenhouses and indoors). Actions are taken in accordance with the type of plant under supervision. The system controls the internal temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide enrichment, irrigation, and fertilisation in the case of protected cultivation. In the case of outdoor cultivation, the system regulates watering and fertilisation and computes the severity index to allow for early pest detection. AI-based solutions will also be utilised to optimise resource utilisation [32].6 Technology-Driven AgricultureIndustry 4.0 changed the industrial and agriculture sectors and offered several advantages across many industries, but especially in agriculture industry fields, farmers are now using Industry 4.0 technology in smart agriculture by utilising modern devices like agriculture robots, drones (UAVs), sensors, AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc.Fig. 2.The structure of the proposed system.Full size image6.1 Internet of Things in AgricultureMajority of research publications discussed the influence of IoT devices on system automation, including how they can determine soil texture, automate irrigation systems, and detect environmental change. Such as temperature and humidity, detecting pests and weeds, and assessing damage to the soil. Smart agriculture contributed to the development of the agricultural sector. Farmers are now utilising modern technologies in agriculture to make it smarter and more productive, using IOTs and AI and linking agriculture with satellites, the internet, sensors, etc. To increase the benefits of the IoT [5]. The data connection varies from sensor to sensor. First, the sensors gather the information, share it with the IoT gateway, connect through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to the database, and store the data in the cloud. Then the user finally gets the processed information (or data) and uses it to make smarter decisions. Wireless Sensor Network (WNS) helps make the right decisions in relevant situations, and thus WNS supports decision-making to find solutions to problems related to agriculture [1, 18]. Despite technological development, many challenges must be faced when using modern technologies in smart agriculture. Among those challenges, most people are ignorant of how to use technology in the agriculture sector due to a lack of knowledge about dealing with mobile devices and a lack of reading and comprehension knowledge. There are also other factors, such as a lack of energy supply, changes in weather or climatic conditions, and funding sources [1]. But the development of the agricultural field using modern technologies has helped to overcome obstacles and solve many problems in modern agriculture. In the Agriculture 4.0 sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) is commonly utilized in various ways, such as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in agriculture, as well as the IOT for monitoring soil and water quality, optimizing crop irrigation, employing precision agriculture techniques like remote sensing, humidity, and temperature monitoring, and implementing autonomous greenhouses and these are the important and common uses of IOT in agriculture [8, 18].6.2 Wireless Sensor Networks in AgricultureWireless sensor network technology is used on the IoT. WSN is defined as a group of spatially dispersed sensors that monitor environmental conditions, store data obtained, and send information collected to a central point [1]. A wireless communication module connects several sensor nodes to form a WSN for smart agriculture. These nodes can self- self-configure, self-organize, and self-diagnose [24, 32]. These nodes have a variety of capabilities (such as processing, transmission, and acquisition). WSNs can be divided into various sorts based on the environment in which they are found. These comprise mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs), underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN), underwater wireless sensor networks (WUSN), and terrestrial wireless sensor networks (TWSN) [1, 20]. For agricultural applications, TWSN and UWSN sensor networks are often used [1, 20, 32]. TWSN nodes are positioned above the surface of the earth and consist of sensors to collect surrounding data. A second alternative to WSNs is their underground counterpart, WUSNs. Nodes are inserted into the soil, where they easily perform low-frequency functions while exhibiting very weak higher-frequency capabilities. As a result, it takes a lot of knots to cover a big area. Several research publications that have been addressed in the literature have covered the use of WSNs for various farm applications, such as irrigation management, water quality evaluation, and environmental monitoring. Additionally, there are several WSN-related issues that require more focus and attention, including interoperability, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and maintenance [1, 5].6.3 Artefactual Intelligence in Agriculture 4.0The agriculture sector is experiencing the rapid customization of both artificial intelligence and machine learning in seasonal agricultural outcomes and field agriculture techniques. The development of computer systems that can carry out tasks that require human intelligence, such as decision-making and sensory perception, is known as artificial intelligence [24]. Combined with cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things, this is seen as one of the main drivers behind the digitization of the agriculture industry 4.0. Many smart farming systems that use machine learning [ML] and deep learning [DL] algorithms have been developed to determine various parameters such as crop and soil control, diagnosing plan. Diseases, detecting weeds, intelligent spraying, aerial surveys, and photography that are used to improve crop production. In addition to ongoing monitoring, harvesting, processing, and marketing [17]. Learning and responding to special situations (based on learning) to increase efficiency [1]. Providing some of these options to farmers as a service, such as Chabot or different conversation principles, will assist them in properly supporting the pace of technological improvements, such as identifying similarities in everyday farming. Agricultural robotics organizations recognize the value of robots that depend on and manipulate themselves to handle key agricultural services such as assembly plants on a more prominent scale, at a faster pace, and with more proactivity than personal workers [19].6.4 Advance RoboticAgricultural robots have been developed to perform precision farming operations and to replace humans in certain tasks. Advanced robots have been used in recent years for purposes such as cultivation and harvesting, water supply, targeted spraying, and environmental control. Robots equipped with lasers and cameras are used to identify and remove weeds without the need for human intervention. These robots move autonomously through the rows of crops, resulting in higher yields when labour is reduced [9]. It can also be used in the fields to complete specific farming tasks. Recently, robots for plant growth and fruit picking have emerged to bring new levels of efficiency to traditional methods. Stationary robots are usually the most popular alternative in industrial applications [29]. However, in the context of agriculture, mobile robots may offer greater utility, as they can traverse different types of terrain that are not otherwise easily accessible, cover large fields, and automate agricultural tasks. In the agricultural sector, mobile robots are widely used to improve farm management, increase farm efficiency, and reduce labor needs, especially in harsh environments inaccessible to humans [19]. These robots perform a variety of agricultural activities, such as harvesting, field cultivation, mechanical weeding, precision spraying, irrigation management and soil sampling [9].6.5 Machine Learning in AgricultureMachine learning techniques are classified into three categories: (1) Supervised learning (regression trees, linear regression, nonlinear regression, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial logistic regression, and vector regression support). (2) unsupervised learning (K-group means, hierarchical clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks, principal component analysis, independent component analysis, prior algorithms, and singular value decomposition) and (3) re-informative learning (Markov decision processes and Q learning) [1, 24]. Technologies and algorithms implement machine learning in agriculture. Crop yield forecast by sector, diseases, weed detection, and weather forecast (precipitation), estimation of soil properties (such as moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, calculating lawn fertiliser application rates, and livestock production and care of animals. Management Rates are used for a wide range of agricultural applications. The analysis shows that “crop yield prediction” is a topic that has been extensively studied. The most popular ML technologies for smart agriculture are support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and linear regression. There have been no reports of commercial applications yet for the listed use cases, which are currently in the research stage. Additionally, it has been discovered that indoor vertical farming systems, particularly hydroponic, aquaponic, and aeroponic systems, are hardly researched using AI and machine learning approaches [24]. Technology from ML is applied. Given the difficulties of digital transformation in terms of cybersecurity and data privacy, new approaches such as such as federated learning and privacy-preserving methods, are being developed to enable digital agriculture. And mitigate security issues [1].6.6 Drones (UAVs) Technology in Agriculture 4.0Drones (UAVs), known as drones or aerial robots, are widely used by farmers to monitor crop growth, and combat hunger, and adverse environmental impacts. It is called “unmanned” because there is no human pilot on board [1]. Unmanned aerial vehicles are used efficiently to take pictures, spray water and pesticides, consider rugged terrain, etc. It has proven its value in terms of spray speed as well as accuracy, when compared to conventional machines for the same purpose, UAV technology can be used for gathering information that helps farmers make decisions. With recent developments in drone technology, a group of UAVs equipped with 3D cameras and heterogeneous sensors can work together to provide farmers with comprehensive capabilities and tasks to manage their lands and farms [5]. By using these drones in agriculture, farmers can set their eyes on the sky. However, using drones in agriculture can carry out large and difficult tasks and reach remote and rugged places with the necessary speed and time, but there are still many challenges that need to be addressed to take advantage of this technology, especially the integration with other technologies and how to use it in bad weather conditions [21]. UAVs, and radio-controlled model aircraft can be flown at lower altitudes for increased spatial resolution, possibly at a lower cost [19]. The advantage of the image using drones for agriculture is their accuracy (very high pixels), compared to other traditional methods [6]. Drone images are used in many things, including mapping grass types, measuring shrub biomass, mapping crop strength, monitoring crop water stress, recording crop biomass, and evaluating nitrogen treatments. On crops [21], in addition, the UAV is also used as a geo-fence to repel animal attacks by alerting the owner in a timely and safe manner [19] (see Fig. 3).Fig. 3.The types of drones used in agriculture (https://www.iberdrola.com/web/guest/innovacion/smart-farming-agricultura-precision).Full size image7 The Benefits of Industry 4.0 in AgricultureUsing modern technologies in the agriculture sector has many advantages related to the economic, social, and environmental fields. This paper will briefly cover all the fields mentioned above. First, the environmental field: These technologies contributed to reducing pollutants (such as agricultural chemicals and various fertilizers), which led to the sustainability [1, 3] or increase of soil quality, reduced water pollution, reduced carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and reduced air pollution. Secondly, economically, it has many advantages, including operational efficiency, maximising resources, and providing high-quality product results, such as increased yields, improved soil quality, and high selling prices of raw materials. Smart farming systems also enable accurate management of demand forecasts and timely delivery of goods to market to reduce waste. In addition to the various benefits in terms of efficiency, there are lower costs involved, less water consumption, less use of technical inputs, and lower overall costs. In terms of social benefits, it reduces time and effort (reducing physical labor) and increases quality, as well as reducing worker stress and improving their well-being and safety at work. Overall, Agriculture 4.0 helps reduce costs and improve product quality, quantity, and sustainability [18].8 Challenges Facing Agriculture 4.0To introduce the new technology (Industry 4.0 to Agriculture 4.0) in a specific environment, there are many challenges and obstacles, such as technical and technological challenges related to the application of smart agriculture, technical problems related to modern equipment, weather problems, rugged lands in some areas, and a lack of knowledge for some farmers about how to use the modern techniques in agriculture [4, 8]. Agriculture 4.0 requires great economic effort; financing sources consider it most important to farmers. However, funding sources are one of the most important challenges in some developing countries. Implementation challenges: Using Agri4.0 in the agriculture sector requires skills. Cultural and organisational challenges: Due to the introduction of digitalization in agriculture, Agriculture Revolution 4.0 will require skills related to introducing digital solutions in companies [18]. However, weather conditions, energy sources, and financing, the ruggedness of some areas, and the lack of sufficient knowledge to use modern technologies for some farmers is considered the most important challenge facing smart agriculture. Moreover, for a successful implementation of ANN, fuzzy logic control systems, other artificial intelligence engines, to train Artefactual Intelligence (AI) models in the agricultural sector, a huge amount of data is needed [4].9 DiscussionsSmart farming depends on advanced technology systems in management, analysis, processing, data collection, decision-making, etc. to reduce costs and make farming more productive, profitable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. Smart agriculture can contribute significantly to meeting the food needs of the world's population [1]. This study aims to highlight the importance of using new technologies in farming. Using Industry 4.0 in agriculture can make agriculture smart and available, as well as contribute to solving many agriculture problems. We have clarified part of these challenges and solutions in this paper, which shows the importance of resorting to researchers, farmers, and agricultural companies to contribute to the development of this important sector. And shows that it is not as required. And there are many issues and challenges, such as the issue of food safety, a lack of digitization, and environmental problems. Sources of financing and support, a lack of resources, and the lack of knowledge of many farmers on how to use new technologies on farms., which is considered one of the most important challenges facing smart agriculture in developing countries. (Industry 4.0) was distinguished by doing a lot of things and tasks with less effort and in a short amount of time. Industry 4.0 spawned all the emerging technologies, bringing together BDMM, IoT technologies, robotics, big data, and blockchain technology [7, 8, 18, 19], are making production and supply processes smarter and now more autonomous. The integration of smart Industry and Agriculture offers the opportunity to transform industrial agriculture into the next generation. Smart farming can be achieved by collecting precise variables in real time, in addition to processing and analysing data related to agricultural industries from food production, processing, and distribution to consumers, through artificial intelligence (AI), Big data, sensors, IOTs, (UAVs), agriculture robots), etc. Such a smart ecosystem in the agricultural field would contribute significantly to improving productivity, food supply chain efficiency, natural resource utilization and food safety. Industry 4.0 towards Agriculture 4.0 means a shift in production infrastructure: it contributes to the creation of connected farms, new production equipment, tractors, and tying machines, enabling increased productivity, quality, and environmental protection [28], as well as giving recommendations to those who are interested in smart farming and to the researchers to combine the use of AI techniques and fuzzy logic, which will enable the farms to lead in adopting more effective environmental protection strategies. And this point is one of the most important recommendations that must be worked on and developed.10 ConclusionsThis paper provides a future vision, an overview, and objective solutions for Industry 4.0 applications in agriculture. It highlights the significance of using modern technologies in agriculture to contribute to those interested in developing and knowing the places of imbalance in the agriculture sector, as well as identifying the challenges facing smart agriculture to find solutions and innovate new ways, contribute to opening research and innovation issues, and therefore be useful in identifying prospects and knowledge of the gaps in agriculture 4.0. The study's goal is to respond effectively to global climatic changes, fluctuations in the global economy and environmental fields, a lack of resources, and an increase in the global population, all of which affect agricultural development and prevent us from achieving food self-sufficiency. However, the technologies provided by Industry 4.0 for agriculture field refer to many creative solutions that can be used to develop this important sector. In this paper, the challenges facing farmers are highlighted, and logical solutions are presented to meet future expectations and make agriculture more efficient and smarter. In this context, Internet of Things, drones, micro-communication technologies, agriculture robots, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence are discussed. The study introduces our current research in the field of applications of AI, IoT, ANN, fuzzy logic, and early detection of plant diseases. In addition to IOT for smart communication in data collection, processing, and analysis, it is considered one of the powerful tools that enable agricultural management, so farmers and researchers should pay close attention to move this sector to a qualitative new level. It will provide a new ecological approach to environmental protection, although there is still much research to be done. The design above demonstrates that the approach enables the integration of expert human knowledge into control strategies by using fuzzy logic to facilitate control in protected agriculture. Additionally, various expert-based strategies can also be simulated, compared, and analyzed [13]. In conclusion, this study also highlights that humans can use fuzzy logic to facilitate the integrated control of protected agriculture through their formal knowledge. Future work in this research is to combine the uses of IOT and AI to achieve the highest level of sustainability, quality, and efficiency in the use of water, energy sources, fertilizers, pesticides, soil type, soil temperature, etc., on the farm. With the knowledge that IoT applications in the agriculture sector will lead to environmental protection. And additionally, the study enables the farms to adopt more effective environmental protection tactics by advancing the combined use of fuzzy logic and AI technology.

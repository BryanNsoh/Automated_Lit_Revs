This chapter explores the comprehensive application of IoT and ML in automating indoor cultivation practices, examining their diverse benefits and practical uses in comparison with the traditional farming methodologies. IoT enables the indoor farmers to create controlled environments through interconnected sensors, monitoring crucial variables but not limited to temperature, humidity, and light intensity. Complemented by ML algorithms, data analysis becomes efficient, providing predictive models for crop growth, pest detection, and disease outbreaks. Automated environment climate control systems optimize resource utilization, while precision irrigation minimizes water usage. Real-time monitoring and early detection of plant health issues reduce crop losses, ensuring high-quality produce.Request access from your librarian to read this chapter's full text.Request AccessYou do not own this content.

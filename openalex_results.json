Quantum computers with 50-100 qubits may be able to perform\ntasks which surpass the capabilities of today\u2019s classical digital computers, but\nnoise in quantum gates will limit the size of quantum circuits that can be\nexecuted reliably. NISQ devices will be useful tools for exploring many-body\nquantum physics, and may have other useful applications, but the 100-qubit\nquantum computer will not change the world right away \u2014 we should regard\nit as a signi\ufb01cant step toward the more powerful quantum technologies of the\nfuture.\nQuantum technologists should continue to strive for more accurate\nquantum gates and, eventually, fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.\n1\nIntroduction\nNow is an opportune time for a fruitful discussion among researchers, entrepreneurs, man-\nagers, and investors who share an interest in quantum computing. There has been a recent\nsurge of investment by both large public companies and startup companies, a trend that\nhas surprised many quantumists working in academia. While we have long recognized the\ncommercial potential of quantum technology, this ramping up of industrial activity has\nhappened sooner and more suddenly than most of us expected.\nIn this article I assess the current status and future potential of quantum computing.\nBecause quantum computing technology is so di\ufb00erent from the information technology\nwe use now, we have only a very limited ability to glimpse its future applications, or\nto project when these applications will come to fruition.\nWhile this uncertainty fuels\noptimism, our optimism should be tempered with caution. We may feel con\ufb01dent that\nquantum technology will have a substantial impact on society in the decades ahead, but\nwe cannot be nearly so con\ufb01dent about the commercial potential of quantum technology in\nthe near term, say the next \ufb01ve to ten years. That is the main message I hope to convey.\nWith that said, I\u2019m sure that vigorous discussion among all the interested parties can help\nlight the way toward future progress.\n2\nOpportunities at the entanglement frontier\nI am a theoretical physicist with a background in particle physics and cosmology, but\nfor more than 20 years much of my research e\ufb00ort has been directed toward quantum\ninformation science. I\u2019m drawn to this \ufb01eld because I feel we are now in the early stages\nJohn Preskill: preskill@caltech.edu, Based on a Keynote Address at Quantum Computing for Business, 5 De-\ncember 2017.\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n1\narXiv:1801.00862v3  [quant-ph]  31 Jul 2018\nof exploring a new frontier of the physical sciences, what we might call the complexity\nfrontier or the entanglement frontier. This new frontier, while di\ufb00erent than the frontier\nof particle physics or cosmology, is very fundamental and exciting. Now, for the \ufb01rst time\nin human history, we are acquiring and perfecting the tools to build and precisely control\nvery complex, highly entangled quantum states of many particles, states so complex that\nwe can\u2019t simulate them with our best digital computers or characterize them well using\nexisting theoretical tools. This emerging capability will open the door to new discoveries.\nFor a physicist like me, what is really exciting about quantum computing is that we\nhave good reason to believe that a quantum computer would be able to e\ufb03ciently simulate\nany process that occurs in Nature. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s not true for classical (i.e., non-\nquantum) digital computers, which (as far as we know) can\u2019t simulate highly entangled\nquantum systems. With quantum computers we should be able to probe more deeply into\nthe properties of complex molecules and exotic materials, and also to explore fundamental\nphysics in new ways, for example by simulating the properties of elementary particles, or\nthe quantum behavior of a black hole, or the evolution of the universe right after the big\nbang.\nOur con\ufb01dence that exploration of the entanglement frontier will be rewarding rests\nlargely on two principles: (1) quantum complexity (our basis for thinking that quantum\ncomputing is powerful), and (2) quantum error correction (our basis for thinking that\nquantum computers are scalable to large devices solving hard problems). Underlying both\nof these principles is the idea of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is the word we use\nfor the characteristic correlations among the parts of a quantum system, which are quite\ndi\ufb00erent from the correlations we encounter in everyday life. To understand the concept of\nentanglement, imagine a system with many parts, for example a book which is 100 pages\nlong. For an ordinary classical 100-page book, every time you read another page you learn\nanother 1% of the content of the book, and after you have read all of the pages one by\none you know everything that\u2019s in the book. But now suppose instead that it\u2019s a quantum\nbook, where the pages are very highly entangled with one another. Then when you look\nat the pages one at a time you see only random gibberish, and after you have read all the\npages one by one you know very little about the content of the book. That\u2019s because the\ninformation in the quantum book is not imprinted on the individual pages; it is encoded\nalmost entirely in how the pages are correlated with one another. If you want to read the\nbook you have to make a collective observation on many pages at once. That\u2019s quantum\nentanglement, the essential feature making information carried by quantum systems very\ndi\ufb00erent from information processed by ordinary digital computers.\n3\nThe potential of quantum computing\n3.1\nWhy we think quantum computing is powerful\nAn ordinary computer processes bits, where each bit could be, say, a switch which is either\none or o\ufb00.\nBut to build highly complex entangled quantum systems, the fundamental\ninformation-carrying components of a quantum computer must be quantum bits, what we\ncall qubits. A qubit can be realized physically in many di\ufb00erent ways. It can be carried\nby a single atom, or a single electron, or a single photon (a particle of light). Or a qubit\ncan be carried by a more complicated system, like a very cold superconducting electrical\ncircuit in which many electrons are moving.\nWhen we speak of quantum complexity, what springs to mind is the staggering com-\nplexity of using ordinary classical data to describe highly entangled quantum states of\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n2\nmany qubits. Giving a complete description of all the correlations among just a few hun-\ndred qubits may require more bits than the number of atoms in the visible universe. It\nwill never be possible, even in principle, to write that description down, or to faithfully\ndescribe the processing of a few hundred qubits using classical language.\nThis apparently extravagant complexity of the quantum world, though highly sugges-\ntive, does not by itself ensure that quantum computers are more powerful than classical\nones. But we have at least three good reasons for thinking that quantum computers have\ncapabilities surpassing what classical computers can do.\n(1) Quantum algorithms for classically intractable problems. First, we know of problems\nthat are believed to be hard for classical computers, but for which quantum algo-\nrithms have been discovered that could solve these problems easily. The best known\nexample is the problem of \ufb01nding the prime factors of a large composite integer [1].\nWe believe factoring is hard because many smart people have tried for many decades\nto \ufb01nd better factoring algorithms and haven\u2019t succeeded. Perhaps a fast classical\nfactoring algorithm will be discovered in the future, but that would be a big surprise.\n(2) Complexity theory arguments. The theoretical computer scientists have provided ar-\nguments, based on complexity theory, showing (under reasonable assumptions) that\nquantum states which are easy to prepare with a quantum computer have super-\nclassical properties; speci\ufb01cally, if we measure all the qubits in such a state we are\nsampling from a correlated probability distribution that can\u2019t be sampled from by\nany e\ufb03cient classical means [2, 3].\n(3) No known classical algorithm can simulate a quantum computer. But perhaps the\nmost persuasive argument we have that quantum computing is powerful is simply\nthat we don\u2019t know how to simulate a quantum computer using a digital computer;\nthat remains true even after many decades of e\ufb00ort by physicists to \ufb01nd better ways\nto simulate quantum systems.\nIt\u2019s a remarkable claim \u2014 one of the most amazing ideas I\u2019ve encountered in my\nscienti\ufb01c life \u2014 that there is a distinction between problems that are classically hard and\nproblems that are quantumly hard. And it is a compelling challenge to understand better\nwhat problems are classically hard but quantumly easy [4, 5]. We should recognize in\nparticular that the power of a quantum computer is not unlimited. We don\u2019t expect, for\nexample, that a quantum computer will be able to solve e\ufb03ciently the hard instances of NP-\nhard problems like the traveling salesman problem. For such hard combinatorial search\nproblems we probably can\u2019t do much better than exhaustively searching for a solution.\nQuantum computers can speed up exhaustive search [6], but only modestly [7], so NP-\nhard problems are likely to be quantumly hard as well as classically hard.\nFor a physicist seeking problems which are classically hard and quantumly easy, the\nnatural place to look is the task of simulating a many-particle quantum system. As two\ngreat physicists, Bob Laughlin and David Pines, put it some years ago [8], we have a \u201cthe-\nory of everything that is relevant to ordinary life.\u201d We have high con\ufb01dence this theory\nis correct, and we can write down the equations precisely \u2014 they are the equations that\ndescribe how atomic nuclei and electrons interact electromagnetically. But we can\u2019t solve\nthose equations. And so as Laughlin and Pines put it: \u201cWe have a theory of everything only\nto discover that it has revealed exactly nothing about many things of great importance.\u201d\nThose things of importance they envisaged are the situations in the quantum world where\nentanglement has profound consequences. Dramatizing the futility of the task they pro-\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n3\nclaimed: \u201cNo computer existing, or that will ever exist, can break this barrier\u201d of solving\nthe equations describing many entangled particles.\nBut in fact, years before Laughlin and Pines wrote these words, the physicist Richard\nFeynman had articulated a rebuttal [9]. As Feynman put it: \u201cNature isn\u2019t classical dammit,\nand if you want to make a simulation of Nature you better make it quantum mechanical, and\nby golly it\u2019s a wonderful problem because it doesn\u2019t look so easy.\u201d Feynman had envisioned\nusing a quantum computer to solve the quantum physics problems that physicists and\nchemists had failed to solve using digital computers. Laughlin and Pines knew well that\nFeynman had made this proposal years earlier, but had dismissed his idea as impractical.\nNow, some 35 years after Feynman\u2019s proposal, we\u2019re just beginning to reach the stage\nwhere quantum computers can provide useful solutions to hard quantum problems.\n3.2\nWhy quantum computing is hard\nSo why is it taking so long? What is it about quantum computing that\u2019s so di\ufb03cult? The\ncore of the problem stems from a fundamental feature of the quantum world \u2014 that we\ncannot observe a quantum system without producing an uncontrollable disturbance in the\nsystem. That means that if we want to use a quantum system to store and reliably process\ninformation, then we need to keep that system nearly perfectly isolated from the outside\nworld. At the same time, though, we want the qubits to strongly interact with one another\nso we can process the information; we also need to be able to control the system from the\noutside, and eventually read out the qubits so we can \ufb01nd the result of our computation.\nIt is very challenging to build a quantum system that satis\ufb01es all of these desiderata. It\nhas taken many years of development in materials and control and fabrication to get where\nwe are now.\nEventually we expect to be able to protect quantum systems and scale up quantum\ncomputers using the principle of quantum error correction [10].\nThe essential idea of\nquantum error correction is that if we want to protect a quantum system from damage\nthen we should encode it in a very highly entangled state; like that 100-page book I\ndescribed earlier, this entangled state has the property that the environment, interacting\nwith parts of the system one at a time, is unable to glimpse the encoded information and\ntherefore can\u2019t damage it.\nFurthermore, we\u2019ve understood in principle how to process\nquantum information which is encoded in a highly entangled state. Unfortunately, there\nis a signi\ufb01cant overhead cost for doing quantum error correction \u2014 writing the protected\nquantum information into a highly entangled book requires many additional physical qubits\n\u2014 so reliable quantum computers using quantum error correction are not likely to be\navailable very soon.\n4\nThe NISQ era unfolds\n4.1\nThe 50-qubit barrier\nEven with fault-tolerant quantum computing still a rather distant dream, we are now\nentering a pivotal new era in quantum technology. For this talk, I needed a name to describe\nthis impending new era, so I made up a word: NISQ. This stands for Noisy Intermediate-\nScale Quantum. Here \u201cintermediate scale\u201d refers to the size of quantum computers which\nwill be available in the next few years, with a number of qubits ranging from 50 to a\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n4\nfew hundred.1 50 qubits is a signi\ufb01cant milestone, because that\u2019s beyond what can be\nsimulated by brute force using the most powerful existing digital supercomputers.2 \u201cNoisy\u201d\nemphasizes that we\u2019ll have imperfect control over those qubits; the noise will place serious\nlimitations on what quantum devices can achieve in the near term.\nPhysicists are excited about this NISQ technology, which gives us new tools for ex-\nploring the physics of many entangled particles. It might also have useful applications of\ninterest to the business community, but we\u2019re not sure about that. We shouldn\u2019t expect\nNISQ is to change the world by itself; instead it should be regarded as a step toward more\npowerful quantum technologies we\u2019ll develop in the future. I do think that quantum com-\nputers will have transformative e\ufb00ects on society eventually, but these may still be decades\naway. We\u2019re just not sure how long it\u2019s going to take.\n4.2\nQubit \u201cquality\u201d\nI\u2019ve emphasized the number of qubits as a measure of how di\ufb03cult it is to do the simulation\nof a quantum computer on a classical device, but the number of qubits isn\u2019t the only thing\nwe care about. We also care about the quality of the qubits, and in particular the accuracy\nwith which we can perform quantum gates \u2014 well-controlled entangling operations acting\non pairs of qubits. With the best hardware we have now for controlling trapped ions [14] or\nsuperconducting circuits [15], the error rate per gate for two-qubit gates is above the .1%\nlevel (and often much worse). Furthermore, we don\u2019t yet know whether error rates that low\ncan be maintained in larger devices with many qubits; perhaps we\u2019ll \ufb01nd out soon. Naively,\nthen, and as I\u2019ll say later this might be too naive, with these noisy devices we don\u2019t expect\nto be able to execute a circuit that contains many more than about 1000 gates \u2014 that is,\n1000 fundamental two-qubit operations \u2014 because the noise will overwhelm the signal in\na circuit much larger than that. That limitation on circuit size imposes a ceiling on the\ncomputational power of NISQ technology. Eventually we\u2019ll do better, using quantum error\ncorrection to scale up to larger circuits. But as I\u2019ve already emphasized, since quantum\nerror correction imposes a heavy overhead cost in number of qubits and number of gates,\nscaling up using quantum error correction is a more distant goal. When I speak of the\nNISQ era, I\u2019m imagining quantum computers with noisy gates unprotected by quantum\nerror correction.\nThere are other things we care about, too, aside from the number of qubits and the\ngate error rate. The time it takes to execute a single gate is also important for setting\nthe time scale needed for a quantum computer to solve a problem, and it is noteworthy\nthat superconducting circuits are about a thousand times faster than ion trap quantum\nprocessors. We need to be able to prepare and measure qubits accurately; currently the\nmeasurement error probability is about 1% for superconducting qubits, and much better\nthan that for trapped ions.\nWe care about the connectivity among the qubits \u2014 for\nwhich pairs of qubits in our device can we perform an accurate two-qubit gate? It is also\nimportant to know how reliably we can fabricate qubits \u2014 if we attempt to construct a\nmany-qubit device, how many of the qubits actually perform well enough to be useful?\nThese considerations and others, too, should be kept in mind when we make comparisons\nacross di\ufb00erent quantum computing platforms.\n172-qubit and 50-qubit devices, based on superconducting circuits, have been announced recently by\nGoogle and IBM, respectively.\n2This \u201cmilestone\u201d is actually a bit fuzzy, in several respects. In particular, the resources needed in a\nclassical simulation depend on the depth (number of time steps) of the quantum circuit, as well as on the\nnumber of qubits [11, 12, 13].\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n5\n5\nWhat I won\u2019t say much about\nBefore moving on to the main focus of this article, I want to include a disclaimer to avoid\nmisunderstanding. There are some very interesting and important aspects of quantum\ntechnology that I\u2019m not really going to talk about, but I\u2019ll mention them so you\u2019ll know\nI\u2019m not going to talk about them.\n(1) Quantum-resistant cryptography. We foresee disruptive e\ufb00ects of quantum computers\non how we protect our privacy \u2014 the public key cryptosystems that are in widespread\nuse today will become obsolete in the years ahead because they can be easily broken\nby su\ufb03ciently powerful quantum computers. We should be thinking now about how\nwe\u2019re going to protect our privacy in the future. One possible way is to replace our\nexisting cryptosystems with new ones which we\u2019re con\ufb01dent are resistant to attacks\nby quantum computers [16].\n(2) Quantum key distribution, quantum networks, and quantum repeaters. We might also\nuse traveling qubits \u2014 most likely photons \u2014 to create shared keys that can be used\nfor encryption and decryption. Quantum key distribution exploits the principle that\nyou cannot eavesdrop on quantum communication without producing a detectable\ndisturbance [17]. But we don\u2019t yet have the technology to distribute quantum entan-\nglement, and hence secret key, around the world; that\u2019s another interesting techno-\nlogical challenge [18]. It is also notable that, aside from applications to key exchange,\na global quantum network might be used for other purposes, like sharing information\namong quantum devices.\n(3) Quantum randomness expansion.\nUnlike deterministic classical devices, quantum\ndevices can generate intrinsic randomness.\nRemarkably, this feature of quantum\nphysics can be exploited to expand a short random seed to a much longer string of\ncerti\ufb01ably random bits, even if one distrusts the equipment used for this purpose \u2014\nit su\ufb03ces to assume that spacelike separated parties are unable to communicate with\none another [19], or to make suitable assumptions about (quantum) computational\nhardness [20]. Certi\ufb01able randomness has many potential applications, for example\nto secure communication protocols, unbiased statistical sampling, and Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n(4) Quantum sensing. Quantum technology has advantages for some kinds of sensing.\nQuantum systems can sense weak forces with better sensitivity and higher spatial\nresolution than other sensing technologies [21]; thus quantum sensing could have\nrelatively near-term high-impact applications, to medicine for example.\nQuantum communication, networking, randomness expansion, and sensing cannot be\ncleanly separated from quantum computing, because similar technological challenges are\nfaced by all these quantum-information goals. Nevertheless, I\u2019ll give short shrift to these\ntopics here.\n6\nQuantum speedups?\nWhat I would like to focus on instead is whether quantum computers will have widely\nused applications, particularly in the relatively near term. The main question is: When\nwill quantum computers be able to solve problems we care about faster than classical\ncomputers, and for what problems?\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n6\nAt least in the near term quantum computers are likely to be special purpose devices,\nwhich most users will access via the cloud. When we speak of a quantum speedup, we\ntypically mean that the quantum computer solves the problem faster than competing\nclassical computers using the best available hardware and running the best algorithm which\nperforms the same task. (Arguably, though, quantum technology might be preferred even\nif classical supercomputers run faster, if for example the quantum hardware has lower\ncost and lower power consumption.)\nIn any case, we should recognize that the power\nof classical computers will continue to increase, with exascale systems (surpassing 1018\nFLOPS) expected to be available in a few years. Quantum computers are striving to catch\nup with a moving target, as both classical hardware and classical algorithms continually\nimprove.\nA few years ago I spoke enthusiastically about quantum supremacy as an impending\nmilestone for human civilization [22]. I suggested this term as a way to characterize com-\nputational tasks performable by quantum devices, where one could argue persuasively that\nno existing (or easily foreseeable) classical device could perform the same task, disregard-\ning whether the task is useful in any other respect. I was trying to emphasize that now\nis a very privileged time in the coarse-grained history of technology on our planet, and I\ndon\u2019t regret doing so. But from a commercial perspective, obviously we should pay at-\ntention to whether the task is useful! Quantum supremacy is a worthy goal, notable for\nentrepreneurs and investors not so much because of its intrinsic importance but rather as\na sign of progress toward more valuable applications further down the road.\nWe should also bear in mind that, because of the imperfect performance of NISQ\ntechnology, it may be hard to validate that a quantum computer is really giving the right\nanswer. That\u2019s particularly true for the quantum simulation problems physicists are excited\nabout. So it\u2019s important for researchers to continue seeking better methods for verifying\nthe output of a quantum computer.\n6.1\nQuantum optimizers\nI have already emphasized that we don\u2019t expect quantum computers to be able to solve\ne\ufb03ciently worst-case instances of NP-hard problems like combinatorial optimization prob-\nlems; still, it\u2019s conceivable (though not guaranteed) that quantum devices will be able to\n\ufb01nd better approximate solutions or \ufb01nd such approximate solutions faster. For example,\nwe might formulate m constraints on n bits, and seek an n-bit string which solves as many\nof the m constraints as possible. We may say we have solved this optimization problem\nexactly if we can \ufb01nd the maximal number k of constraints that can be satis\ufb01ed simulta-\nneously, and that we have an approximate solution if we can guarantee that the maximal\nnumber of satis\ufb01able constraints is at least k\u2032 for some k\u2032 < k; the approximation ratio\nk\u2032/k is a measure of the quality of our approximate solution.\nFor some optimization problems, even \ufb01nding an approximation solution is NP-hard\nif the approximation ratio is su\ufb03ciently close to one [23], and in those cases we don\u2019t\nexpect a quantum computer to be able to \ufb01nd the approximate solution e\ufb03ciently for\nhard instances of the problem. But for many problems there is a big gap between the\napproximation achieved by the best classical algorithm we currently know and the barrier\nof NP-hardness. So it would not be shocking to discover that quantum computers have an\nadvantage over classical ones for the task of \ufb01nding approximate solutions, an advantage\nthat some users might \ufb01nd quite valuable.\nWhether that quantum advantage really exists is currently an open question, but we will\nsoon have the opportunity to explore the question experimentally using quantum hardware.\nOf course, even if there is such a quantum advantage for approximate optimization, NISQ\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n7\ntechnology might be inadequate for demonstrating the advantage; still, it will be fun to\ntry it and see how well it works.\nThe emerging paradigm for solving optimization problems using near-term quantum\ntechnology is a kind of hybrid quantum-classical algorithm.\nIn this scheme, we use a\nquantum processor to prepare an n-qubit state, then measure all the qubits and process\nthe measurement outcomes using a classical optimizer; this classical optimizer instructs\nthe quantum processor to alter slightly how the n-qubit state is prepared. This cycle is\nrepeated many times until it converges to a quantum state from which the approximate\nsolution can be extracted. When applied to classical combinatorial optimization problems,\nthis procedure goes by the name Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)\n[24]. But it can also be applied to quantum problems, like \ufb01nding low-energy states of\nmany-particle quantum systems (large molecules, for example). When applied to quantum\nproblems this hybrid quantum-classical procedure goes by the name Variational Quantum\nEigensolver (VQE) [25].\nWill NISQ technology running QAOA or VQE be able to outperform classical algo-\nrithms that \ufb01nd approximate solutions to the same problems? Nobody knows, but we\u2019re\ngoing to try it and see how well we can do. It\u2019s an ambitious goal, because the classical\nmethods we use to solve these problems are well honed after decades of development. On\nthe other hand, even if early-generation NISQ devices are not yet ready to compete with\nthe best classical computers, experimental results might encourage our hopes that QAOA\nand/or VQE can surpass classical methods in the future, and so spur further technological\nimprovements.\n6.2\nHow quantum testbeds might help\nThe history of classical computing teaches us that when hardware becomes available that\nstimulates and accelerates the development of new algorithms. There are many exam-\nples of heuristics that were discovered experimentally, which worked better than theorists\ncould initially explain. We can anticipate that the same thing will happen with quantum\ncomputers.\nFor example, theorists eventually explained why the simplex method for linear pro-\ngramming works well in practice [26], but only long after it had been found to be useful\nexperimentally. A current example is deep learning [27]; we lack a good theoretical expla-\nnation for why it works as well as it does. In the quantum case, too, experiments may\nvalidate the performance of heuristic algorithms, where we don\u2019t understand why they\nwork. That might happen in particular for the quantum optimization algorithms we\u2019re\nplanning to test.\nBut I emphasize again that the imperfect gates in NISQ systems will severely limit\ntheir computational power, because circuits with many gates will be too noisy to give\nuseful results.\nNear-term experiments will explore what we can do with of order 100\nqubits, and with circuit depth (number of time steps) less than 100, maybe much less. A\nvibrant discussion between quantum algorithm designers and application users might point\nthose experiments in promising directions; I hope that this article can help to facilitate\nand inspire that discussion.\n6.3\nQuantum annealing\nI have emphasized 50 to 100 qubits as a coming milestone for quantum technology, but in\nfact we have a 2000-qubit quantum device now, the D-Wave 2000Q machine. This machine\nis not a circuit-based quantum computer. Rather it is what we call a quantum annealer; it\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n8\nsolves optimization problems using a di\ufb00erent method than execution of a quantum circuit,\nand it often solves these problems successfully.\nBut as of now we don\u2019t have a convincing theoretical argument or persuasive experi-\nmental evidence indicating that quantum annealers can really speed up the time to solution\ncompared to the best classical hardware running the best algorithms for the same problems\n[28, 29]. The situation is a bit nuanced. The quantum annealer is the noisy version (with\nrather poor quality qubits, in the case of the D-Wave machine) of what we call adiabatic\nquantum computing [30]. We actually do have, for the case of noiseless qubits, a theoretical\nargument showing that adiabatic quantum computing is as powerful as circuit-based quan-\ntum computing [31]. However, the argument demonstrating the equivalence of adiabatic\nand circuit-based quantum computation applies only if the adiabatic method is executed in\na form that requires a high overhead cost in additional physical qubits, which is quite dif-\nferent from the way quantum annealers are used today. In any event, this formal argument\napplies only to noiseless qubits, and (in contrast to circuit-based quantum computing),\nwe don\u2019t have a good theoretical argument attesting that quantum annealers are scalable.\nThat is, for the case of noisy qubits we don\u2019t know how to show that quantum annealers\nwill continue to work successfully as the problem size increases, even if we are willing to\naccept a sizable overhead cost to enforce robustness against noise.\nSo far quantum annealers have been applied mostly to cases where the annealing is\nstoquastic \u2014 that means it might be relatively easy for a classical computer to simulate\nwhat the quantum annealer is doing [32, 33].\nWhat\u2019s coming soon are non-stoquastic\nquantum annealers, which may have greater potential for achieving speedups over what\nthe best classical algorithms can do.\nSince theorists have not settled whether quantum annealing is powerful, further exper-\niments are needed. Experiments with quantum annealers over the next few years are likely\nto be quite informative. In particular, aside from the applications of quantum annealers to\nclassical optimization problems, applications to quantum simulation problems should also\nbe explored [34].\n6.4\nNoise-resilient quantum circuits\nI\u2019ve emphasized that eventually we are going to use quantum error correction to extend\nthe size of the computations we can execute reliably using noisy quantum computers. But,\nbecause of the high overhead cost of quantum error correction, NISQ devices will not make\nuse of it in the near term. Nevertheless, methods for mitigating the e\ufb00ects of noise may\nbe an important consideration during the NISQ era.\nNaively one might expect that, for a generic circuit with G gates, a single fault anywhere\nin the circuit could cause the computation to fail; if so, then we cannot execute the circuit\nreliably if the error rate per gate is much larger than 1/G. However, at least for some\nproblems and algorithms, that conclusion might be too pessimistic.\nIn particular, for some of the quantum simulation algorithms of interest to physicists,\nthere are only a relatively small number of circuit locations where a faulty gate can cause\nthe computation to fail badly. This feature could arise because the circuit has low depth,\nand we can tolerate a constant probability of error per qubit in the \ufb01nal measurement out-\ncome, or because the damage caused by an error occurring early in the circuit decays away\nby a later time. Such noise resilience is characteristic of some tensor network construc-\ntions which can be invoked for solving quantum optimization problems using Variational\nQuantum Eigensolvers [35, 36].\nThere is a substantial opportunity for experimentalists and theorists, working together\nover the next few years, to \ufb01nd better ways of making quantum circuits noise resilient,\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n9\nand so extend the computational reach of NISQ technology. We should be wary, though,\nof a potential tradeo\ufb00 \u2014 making a quantum circuit more noise resilient may also make it\neasier to simulate classically.\n6.5\nQuantum deep learning\nMachine learning is transforming technology and having a big impact on science as well, so\nit is natural to wonder about the potential of combining machine learning with quantum\ntechnology. There are a variety of di\ufb00erent notions of \u201cquantum machine learning.\u201d Much\nof the literature on the subject builds on quantum algorithms that speed up linear algebra\nand related tasks [37, 38], and I\u2019ll address such applications in the ensuing subsections.\nFirst, though, I\u2019ll comment on the potential of quantum deep learning [39]. Deep learn-\ning itself has become a broad subject [27], but to be concrete let us contemplate a restricted\nBoltzmann machine. This may be regarded as a spin system in thermal equilibrium at a\nlow but nonzero temperature, with many hidden layers of spins separating the input and\noutput. (The word \u201crestricted\u201d means that there are no couplings among spins within a\ngiven layer; instead only spins in successive layers are coupled.) The system may have\nmillions of coupling parameters, which are optimized during a training phase to achieve\na desired joint probability distribution for input and output. The training may be super-\nvised, for example the network might be taught to recognize a labeled set of photos, or\nunsupervised, in which case the goal is to identify patterns in an unlabeled training set of\ndata. The quantum analog of such a machine could have a similar structure and function,\nbut where the spins are qubits rather than classical bits. It may be that quantum deep\nlearning networks have advantages over classical ones; for example they might be easier to\ntrain for some purposes. But we don\u2019t really know \u2014 it\u2019s another opportunity to try it\nand see how well it works.\nOne possible reason for being hopeful about the potential of quantum machine learning\nrests on the concept known as QRAM \u2014 quantum random access memory. By QRAM we\nmean representing a large amount of classical data very succinctly, by encoding a vector\nwith N components in just log N qubits.\nBut typical proposals for quantum machine\nlearning applications are confounded by severe input/output bottlenecks. For applications\nto large classical data sets one should take into account the cost of encoding the input\ninto QRAM, which can nullify the potential advantages. Furthermore, the output from a\nquantum network is itself a quantum state; to get useful information we need to measure\nthe state, and we can acquire no more than log N bits of classical information in a single-\nshot measurement of log N qubits.\nThese bottlenecks arise when we try to train a quantum network to learn about cor-\nrelations in classical data. Perhaps it is more natural to think about quantum machine\nlearning in a setting where both the input and the output are quantum states. Hence we\nmight expect a quantum network to have advantages over a classical one when used, for\nexample, to control a complex quantum system. More broadly, it seems plausible that\nquantum deep learning would be more powerful than its classical counterpart when trying\nto learn probability distributions for which quantum entanglement has a signi\ufb01cant role.\nThat is, quantum deep learning networks might be very well suited for quantum tasks, but\nfor applications of deep learning that are widely pursued today it is unclear why quantum\nnetworks would have an advantage.\nOn the encouraging side, it\u2019s worth noting that a quantum deep learning machine won\u2019t\nnecessarily need to be a general purpose circuit-based quantum computer. It might be a\nspecial purpose device \u2014 perhaps a quantum annealer, if not too noisy.\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n10\n6.6\nQuantum matrix inversion\nQRAM has further implications for quantum algorithms. In particular, the task of matrix\ninversion admits an exponential quantum speedup, which could have many applications.\nThe algorithm we call HHL [40] (after the three authors who \ufb01rst discussed it nine years\nago) takes as input a succinct representation of a very large N\u00d7N matrix A, which has\nto be su\ufb03ciently sparse and well conditioned, and also as input an N-component vector\n|b\u27e9, encoded in QRAM as a quantum state of log N qubits. The output of the quantum\nalgorithm is (with a small error) the quantum state |A\u22121b\u27e9, the result of applying the\ninverse of the matrix A to the input vector |b\u27e9. This quantum algorithm runs in time\nO(log N), an exponential speedup relative to classical matrix inversion (for \ufb01xed error and\nfor \ufb01xed sparsity and condition number of A).\nHowever, aside from the caveat that the matrix A must be sparse and well conditioned,\nnote that both the input vector |b\u27e9 and the output vector |A\u22121b\u27e9 are quantum states. Once\nwe have the output state, we can perform measurements to learn features of the output\nvector A\u22121b, and by repeating the scheme many times we can learn about the output vector\nin greater detail. But if we are trying to apply this matrix inversion algorithm to classical\ninput data, we need to take into account the potential cost of loading that classical data\ninto QRAM, which could nullify the exponential speedup. Alternatively, loading classical\ndata into QRAM might be avoided by computing |b\u27e9 on a quantum computer rather than\nentering it from a database.\nWe do have good reason to believe this quantum matrix inversion algorithm is powerful,\nbecause it solves what we call a BQP-complete problem. That is, any problem that can be\nsolved e\ufb03ciently with a quantum computer can be encoded as an instance of this matrix\ninversion problem. And a number of potentially useful applications have been suggested.\nFor example, we can use this matrix inversion algorithm to \ufb01nd approximate solutions to\nclassical linear \ufb01eld equations [41, 42, 43] (after discretizing the \ufb01eld on a spatial lattice,\nand applying a suitable preconditioner). This procedure could be used, say, to solve the\nequations of electromagnetism in a complex three-dimensional geometry, for the purpose\nof optimizing the performance of an antenna.\nI expect HHL to have high-impact applications eventually, but it is not likely to be fea-\nsible in the NISQ era. The algorithm may just be too expensive to be executed successfully\nby a quantum computer which doesn\u2019t use error correction.\n6.7\nQuantum recommendation systems\nAnother recently proposed quantum algorithm [44] provides an exponential speedup over\nthe best currently known classical algorithm for a useful task: making high-value recom-\nmendations. The goal is to recommend a product to a customer that the customer will\nprobably like, based on limited knowledge of the preferences of that customer and other\ncustomers.\nTo formulate a simpli\ufb01ed version of the problem, consider m customers and n products,\nand let P be a binary m\u00d7n preference matrix such that Pai = 1 if customer a likes product\ni and Pai = 0 if customer a dislikes product i. In practice we might have m \u2248 108 users and\nn \u2248 106 products, but the rank k of the matrix is relatively small, perhaps k \u2248 100. This\nsmall rank indicates that there are only a limited number of customer types; therefore,\nonce we know a few of the preferences of a new customer, we can accurately recommend\nother products that customer will like.\nAn algorithm for recommendation systems has two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, performed\no\ufb04ine, a low rank approximation to the preference matrix P is constructed. In the second\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n11\nstage, performed online, a new customer reveals some preferences, and the system outputs a\nrecommendation which that customer will like with high probability. It is this second online\nstage that admits a quantum speedup. The quantum runtime is O(poly(k)polylog(mn)),\nwhile the best classical algorithm known requires time poly(mn) to return a high-value\nrecommendation. Crucially, the quantum algorithm, in contrast to the classical one, does\nnot attempt to reconstruct the full recommendation matrix, which would take too long.\nInstead it samples e\ufb03ciently from the low-rank approximation to P.\nThis is a signi\ufb01cant quantum speedup for a real-world application of machine learning,\nencouraging the hope that other such speedups will be discovered. However, we don\u2019t cur-\nrently have a convincing theoretical argument indicating that the task performed by quan-\ntum recommendation systems (returning a high-quality recommendation in polylog(mn)\ntime) is impossible classically.3 Formulating such an argument would strengthen our con-\n\ufb01dence that quantum computers will have a signi\ufb01cant impact on machine learning. Here\ntoo, though, the algorithm is probably too costly to be convincingly validated during the\nNISQ era.\n6.8\nQuantum semide\ufb01nite programming\nSemide\ufb01nite programming is the task of optimizing a linear function subject to matrix\ninequality constraints.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, given as input the m+1 N\u00d7N Hermitian matrices\n{C, A1, A2, . . . , Am} and real numbers {b1, b2, . . . , bm}, the problem is to \ufb01nd a posi-\ntive semide\ufb01nite N \u00d7 N matrix X that maximizes tr (CX) subject to the m constraints\ntr (AiX) \u2264 bi. Convex optimization problems of this type have widespread applications,\nand can be solved classically in poly(m, N) time.\nA recently discovered quantum algorithm [46, 47] \ufb01nds an approximate solution to\nthe problem in time polylog(N), an exponential speedup. In the quantum algorithm, the\noutput is a quantum state, a density operator \u03c1 which approximates the optimal matrix\nX. This quantum state can then be measured to extract information about X, and the\nprocedure can be repeated many times to learn about X is more detail.\nHowever, in the analysis of the quantum algorithm one assumes the availability of\nan initial quantum state of a particular form, the thermal Gibbs state associated with\na Hamiltonian which is a linear combination of the input matrices for the semide\ufb01nite\nprogram. Whether the exponential speedup can actually be realized, then, depends on\nwhether this Gibbs state can be prepared e\ufb03ciently using a quantum computer.\nFor semide\ufb01nite programs with the right structure, the e\ufb03cient preparation of the\nGibbs state is possible, and therefore the exponential speedup really is feasible. In par-\nticular, the quantum algorithm achieves an exponential speedup if all the input matrices\nfor the semide\ufb01nite program have low rank, or if the corresponding Hamiltonian system\nthermalizes rapidly. It is not yet clear to what extent these properties apply to semidef-\ninite programs of practical interest; clarifying that issue is an important goal for further\nresearch.\nIt is intriguing that the crucial step in the quantum algorithm is the preparation of\na thermal state at a nonzero temperature.\nThat may suggest that the algorithm has\nsome intrinsic robustness against thermal noise, or that the thermalization stage of the\nalgorithm could be executed by quantum annealing. Conceivably, then, a quantum solver\n3Note added: After this paper was submitted, Tang [45] exhibited a \u201cquantum-inspired\u201d classical algo-\nrithm which returns a high-value recommendation in runtime O(poly(k)polylog(mn)); thus the quantum\nalgorithm proposed in [44] does not in fact achieve an exponential speedup compared to the best classical\nalgorithm performing the same task.\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n12\nfor semide\ufb01nite programs might be within reach of NISQ technology.\n6.9\nQuantum simulation\nAs I have already emphasized, we expect quantum computers to be very well suited for\nstudying the properties of highly entangled systems of many particles. As Laughlin and\nPines [8] emphasized in the statement I quoted earlier, we think that simulating such\n\u201cstrongly correlated\u201d matter is a di\ufb03cult computational problem, because many very good\nphysicists have tried to solve it for decades and have not succeeded. Thus, as Feynman\nargued [9], the simulation of highly entangled quantum matter is the natural arena where\nquantum computers seem to have a clear advantage over classical ones.\nIn the long term, quantum simulation using quantum computers has great potential\nto wield a broad in\ufb02uence on the world [48, 49, 50].\nAdvances in quantum chemistry,\nfacilitated by quantum computing, might precipitate the design of new pharmaceuticals,\nand new catalysts that improve the e\ufb03ciency of nitrogen \ufb01xation or carbon capture. New\nmaterials arising from quantum simulations might lead to more e\ufb00ective power transmission\nor improved collection of solar energy. We probably lack the imagination to anticipate the\nmost transformative discoveries which will \ufb02ow from more powerful quantum simulators.\nBut this promise is not so likely to be ful\ufb01lled in the NISQ era, because quantum algorithms\nfor accurately simulating large molecules and exotic materials may be too expensive to\nsucceed without error correction.\nClassical computers are especially bad at simulating quantum dynamics \u2014 that is, pre-\ndicting how a highly-entangled quantum state will change with time. Quantum computers\nhave a big advantage for that task, and physicists hope to learn interesting things about\nquantum dynamics using NISQ technology in the relatively near term. It is instructive to\nrecall that the theory of classical chaos (the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions in clas-\nsical dynamical systems, which accounts for our inability to predict the weather more than\ntwo weeks out) advanced rapidly in the 60s and 70s after it became possible to simulate\nchaotic dynamical systems using classical computers. We may anticipate that the emerging\nability to simulate chaotic quantum systems (those in which entanglement spreads very\nrapidly) will promote advances in our understanding of quantum chaos. Valuable insights\nmight already be gleaned using noisy devices with of order 100 qubits.\n6.10\nDigital vs. analog quantum simulation\nHaving emphasized the potential value of simulating quantum dynamics, I should comment\nabout the distinction between analog and digital quantum simulation. When we speak of an\nanalog quantum simulator we mean a system with many qubits whose dynamics resembles\nthe dynamics of a model system we are trying to study and understand. In contrast, a\ndigital quantum simulator is a gate-based universal quantum computer which can be used\nto simulate any physical system of interest when suitably programmed, and can also be\nused for other purposes.\nAnalog quantum simulation has been a very vibrant area of research for the past 15\nyears, while digital quantum simulation with general purpose circuit-based quantum com-\nputers is just now getting started.\nBut some of the same experimental platforms, for\nexample trapped ions and superconducting circuits, can be used for both purposes. Ana-\nlog quantum simulators have been getting notably more sophisticated, and are already\nbeing employed to study quantum dynamics in regimes which may be beyond the reach of\nclassical simulators [51, 52]. But analog quantum simulators are hampered by imperfect\ncontrol \u2014 the actual quantum system in the lab only crudely approximates the model\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n13\nsystem of interest. For that reason, analog simulators are best suited for studying fea-\ntures that physicists call universal, properties which are relatively robust with respect to\nintroducing small sources of error. A major challenge for research using analog quantum\nsimulators is identifying accessible properties of quantum systems which are robust with\nrespect to error, yet are also hard to simulate classically.\nWe can anticipate that analog quantum simulators will eventually become obsolete.\nBecause they are hard to control, they will be surpassed some day by digital quantum\nsimulators, which can be \ufb01rmly controlled using quantum error correction. But because\nof the hefty overhead cost of quantum error correction, the reign of the analog quantum\nsimulator may persist for many years. Therefore, when seeking near-term applications\nof quantum technology, we should not overlook the potential power of analog quantum\nsimulators.\n6.11\nQuantum games\nAdvances in classical computing launched a new world of digital games, touching the lives\nof millions and generating billions in revenue. Could quantum computers do the same?\nPhysicists often say that the quantum world is counter-intuitive because it is so foreign\nto ordinary experience. That\u2019s true now, but might it be di\ufb00erent in the future? Perhaps\nkids who grow up playing quantum games will acquire a visceral understanding of quantum\nphenomena that our generation lacks. Furthermore, quantum games could open a niche for\nquantum machine learning methods, which might seize the opportunity to improve game\nplay in situations where quantum entanglement has an essential role.\n7\nThe daunting climb to scalability\nI\u2019ve already emphasized repeatedly that it will probably be a long time before we have\nfault-tolerant quantum computers solving hard problems. Nevertheless, we can make sig-\nni\ufb01cant progress in the near term by developing better methods and hardware for im-\nplementing quantum error correction, guided by relatively small-scale experiments with\nquantum error-correcting codes. We expect that, in the next few years, enhanced control\nof an error-corrected qubit will be demonstrated convincingly in the lab for the \ufb01rst time.\nFurther near-term experiments exploring quantum error correction are bound to advance\nour understanding of noise in quantum devices, and to suggest more e\ufb00ective techniques\nfor noise mitigation [53, 54] and device validation [55].\nNevertheless, solving really hard problems (like factoring numbers which are thousands\nof bits long) using fault-tolerant quantum computing is not likely to happen for a while,\nbecause of the large number of physical qubits needed. To run algorithms involving thou-\nsands of protected qubits we\u2019ll need a number of physical qubits which is in the millions,\nor more [56]. That\u2019s a very large leap from where we will be for the next few years, with of\norder a hundred qubits. Crossing the \u201cquantum chasm,\u201d from hundreds of physical qubits\nto millions of physical qubits, is going to take some time, but we\u2019ll get there eventually.\nThroughout the NISQ era it will remain important to strive for lower gate error rates in\nthe various quantum platforms. With more accurate quantum gates, quantum computers\noperating without error correction will be able to go further by executing larger circuits.\nBetter gates will also lower the overhead cost of doing quantum error correction when\nwe eventually move on to fault-tolerant quantum computing in the future. (Microsoft\u2019s\ncurrent program [57], focused on advancing topological quantum computing, is founded\non the notion that much lower gate error rates will pay o\ufb00 handsomely sometime in the\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n14\nfuture.)\nIt is important to realize that we will need signi\ufb01cant advances \u2014 in basic science as\nwell as in systems engineering \u2014 to attain fully scalable fault-tolerant quantum comput-\ners. Therefore, the challenge of scalability poses compelling problems for scientists and\nengineers. Because we still have so far to go, new insights, developments, and innovations\nhave the potential to substantially alter the long-term outlook.\n8\nSummary\nThis article is the result of an uneasy compromise. I hope the content provides a useful\noverview for technically informed readers, but I\u2019ve tried to minimize jargon and technical\ndetails which could be distracting or o\ufb00-putting for a broader audience. I have not at-\ntempted to compile a comprehensive list of references; instead I have referred to just a few\npapers that amplify or clarify points I wanted to make, or that might provide instructive\nfurther reading. I apologize to many colleagues whose highly valuable contributions are\nnot properly acknowledged here.\nLet me now summarize the main points I\u2019ve tried to convey.\nNow is a privileged time in the history of science and technology, as we are witnessing the\nopening of the NISQ era (where NISQ = noisy intermediate-scale quantum). We\u2019ll\nsoon have the opportunity to experiment with NISQ technology to see what it can\ndo. Perhaps NISQ will allow us to speed up the time to solution for problems of\nbroad interest in the near future, but we don\u2019t know yet whether that will happen.\nWe have some speci\ufb01c ideas of things we\u2019d like to try, such as hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms for solving optimization problems, both classical and quantum ones.\nWe can expect that, once we have quantum computers to experiment with, the develop-\nment of quantum algorithms will accelerate. Perhaps new heuristics will be discov-\nered for solving useful problems, although we may not be able to explain why these\nheuristics work so well, at least not right away.\nAlthough we probably won\u2019t be able to use full-blown quantum error correction to protect\nNISQ-era devices from noise, we should design near-term quantum algorithms with\nnoise resilience in mind. Clever design of noise-resilient algorithms may extend the\ncomputational power of NISQ devices.\nClassical computers are especially bad at simulating the dynamics of highly entangled\nmany-particle quantum systems; therefore quantum dynamics is a particularly promis-\ning arena where quantum computers may have a signi\ufb01cant advantage over classical\nones.\nWe should continue to focus on building quantum hardware with lower gate error rates.\nImproved quantum gate accuracy will lower the overhead cost of quantum error\ncorrection when it is eventually implemented. In the nearer term, more accurate\ngates will allow us to execute larger quantum circuits, and so extend the power of\nNISQ technology.\nNISQ is not likely to change the world all by itself. Instead, the primary goal for near-\nterm quantum platforms should be to pave the way for bigger payo\ufb00s which will be\nrealized by more advanced quantum devices down the road.\nAccepted in Quantum 2018-07-30, click title to verify\n15\nThe truly transformative quantum technologies of the future are probably going to have\nto be fault tolerant, and because of the very hefty overhead cost of quantum error\ncorrection, the era of fault-tolerant quantum computing may still be rather distant.\nNo one really knows how long it will take to get there. As the quantum community\neagerly seizes the impending opportunity to experiment with NISQ devices, we must\nnot lose sight of the essential longer-term goal: hastening the onset of the fault-\ntolerant era.\nI\u2019ve adopted a cautionary stance in these remarks, because I think we should face the\nonset of the NISQ era with well-grounded expectations. But please don\u2019t misunderstand\nme \u2014 like many of my colleagues, I\u2019m eagerly anticipating the discoveries that will ensue as\nthe NISQ era unfolds over the next few years. Quantum technology is rife with exhilarating\nopportunities, and surely many rousing surprises lie ahead. But the challenges we face are\nstill formidable. All quantumists should appreciate that our \ufb01eld can ful\ufb01ll its potential\nonly through sustained, inspired e\ufb00ort over decades. If we pay that price, the ultimate\nrewards will more than vindicate our e\ufb00orts.\nAcknowledgments\nThis article is based on a Keynote Address delivered at Quantum Computing for Business\non 5 December 2017.

Whereas Shor's algorithm requires both superposition and entanglement of a many-particle system3, the superposition of single-particle quantum states is sufficient for Grover's algorithm4. Recently, the latter has been successfully implemented5 using Rydberg atoms. Here we propose an implementation of Grover's algorithm that uses molecular magnets6,7,8,9,10, which are solid-state systems with a large spin; their spin eigenstates make them natural candidates for single-particle systems. We show theoretically that molecular magnets can be used to build dense and efficient memory devices based on the Grover algorithm. In particular, one single crystal can serve as a storage unit of a dynamic random access memory device. Fast electron spin resonance pulses can be used to decode and read out stored numbers of up to 105, with access times as short as 10-10 seconds. We show that our proposal should be feasible using the molecular magnets Fe8 and Mn12.

Usually it takes N/2 queries on average to be successful. Even if the N entries were encoded in binary, a classical computer would need approximately log2N queries to find the desired phone number2. But the computational parallelism provided by the superposition and interference of quantum states enables the Grover algorithm to reduce the search to one single query2. Here we will show that this query can be implemented in terms of a unitary transformation applied to the single spin of a molecular magnet. Such molecular magnets, forming identical and largely independent units, are embedded in a single crystal so that the ensemble nature of such a crystal provides a natural amplification of the magnetic moment of a single spin. However, for the Grover algorithm to succeed, it is necessary to find ways to generate arbitrary superpositions of spin eigenstates. For spins larger than 1/2 this turns out to be a highly non-trivial task as spin excitations induced by magnetic dipole transitions in conventional electron spin resonance (ESR) can occur only in discrete steps of one \u210f (Planck's constant divided by 2\u03c0), that is, single steps by two or more \u210f values are excluded by selection rules. To circumvent such physical limitations we propose an unusual scenario which, in principle, allows the controlled generation of arbitrary spin superpositions through the use of multifrequency coherent magnetic radiation in the microwave and radiofrequency range. In particular, we will show by means of the S-matrix and time-dependent high-order perturbation theory that by using advanced ESR techniques it is possible to coherently populate and manipulate many spin states simultaneously by applying one single pulse of a magnetic a.c. field containing an appropriate number of matched frequencies. This a.c. field creates a nonlinear response of the magnet through multiphoton absorption processes involving particular sequences of \u03c3 and \u03c0 photons which allows the encoding and, similarly, the decoding of states. Finally, the subsequent read-out of the decoded quantum state can be achieved by means of pulsed ESR techniques. These exploit the non-equidistance of energy levels which is typical of molecular magnets. The method we propose here is interesting in its own right since there has never been an experimental or theoretical attempt, to our knowledge, that shows that the states of spin systems with s > 1/2 can be coherently populated. We implement the Grover algorithm in a single-spin representation with the level spectrum of a spin system as shown in Fig. 1. First, a strong magnetic field in the z direction must be applied to prepare the initial state |\u03c80\u3009 = |s\u3009. Then this field is reduced almost to zero (up to the bias \u03b4Hz) in such a way that all |m\u3009-states are localized, say, on the left side of the potential barrier. Thus, the magnetic moment pointing along the z axis assumes its maximum value and the single spin of a molecular magnet is described by the hamiltonian Hspin = Ha + V (see Fig. 1). To mark specific states, for example, with a certain occupation amplitude (including phases), we could apply weak oscillating transverse magnetic fields H\u22a5 to induce multiphoton transitions via virtual states, which can usually be calculated in perturbation theory in H\u22a5. However, the Grover algorithm requires that all the k-photon transitions, k = 1,2,\u2026, s - 1, have (approximately) the same amplitudes (and possibly different phases). Thus, this would require that all terms of power V1, V2,\u2009\u2026, Vs-1 must be of comparable magnitude. Obviously, perturbation theory breaks down in such a case. Figure 1: Double well potential seen by the spin due to magnetic anisotropies in Mn12. Arrows depict transitions between spin eigenstates driven by the external magnetic field H (see below). Molecular magnets have the important advantage that they can be grown naturally as single crystals of up to 10\u2013100\u2009\u00b5m in length containing about 1012 to 1015 (largely) independent units so that only minimal sample preparation is required. The molecular magnets behave like single spins: for example, Mn12 (refs 7, 8) and Fe8 (refs 9, 10) have a spin s = 10 ground state. Thus, they can be described by a single-spin hamiltonian of the form Hspin = Ha + V + Hsp + HT15,16, where Ha = -AS2z - BS4z represents the magnetic anisotropy (A \u226b B > 0), that is, the easy axis of the spin lies along the z direction. The Zeeman term V = g\u03bcBH\u00b7S describes the coupling between the external magnetic field H and the spin S of length s. The calculational states are given by the 2s + 1 eigenstates |m\u3009 of Ha + g\u03bcB\u03b4HzSz with eigenenergies \u03b5m = -Am2 - Bm4 + g\u03bcB\u03b4Hzm, -s \u2a7d m \u2a7d s. The corresponding classical anisotropy potential energy E(\u03b8) = -As\u2009cos2\u03b8 - Bs\u2009cos4\u03b8 + g\u03bcB\u03b4Hzs\u2009cos\u03b8, shown here, is obtained by the substitution Sz = s\u2009cos\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the polar spherical angle. We have introduced the notation \u210f\u03c9m,m\u2032 = \u03b5m - \u03b5m\u2032. The hamiltonian HT induces tunnelling between (quasi) degenerate |m\u3009-states with tunnel splitting energy Emm\u2032. However, applying a bias field \u03b4Hz such that g\u03bcB\u03b4Hz > Emm\u2032, tunnelling can be completely suppressed and thus HT can be neglected15,16. We also assume temperatures of below 1\u2009K such that transitions due to spin\u2013phonon interactions (Hsp) can also be neglected. In this regime, the level lifetime in Fe8 and Mn12 is estimated to be about \u03c4d = 10-7\u2009s, limited mainly by hyperfine and/or dipolar interactions10,15,16. Full size image To bypass this problem, in our method, all the transition amplitudes between the states |s\u3009 and |m\u3009, m = 1,2,\u2026, s - 1, are of the same order in perturbation V. This allows us to use perturbation theory. It works only if the energy levels are not equidistant, which is typically the case in molecular magnets owing to anisotropies (in contrast to, for example, a harmonic oscillator potential). In general, if we choose to work with the states m = m0,m0 + 1,\u2026,s - 1, where m0 = 1,2,\u2026,s - 1, we have to go up to the nth order in perturbation, where n = s - m0 and n - 1 is the number of computational states used for the Grover search algorithm (see below), to obtain the first non-vanishing contribution. Figure 2 shows the transitions for s = 10 and m0 = 5. The nth-order transitions correspond to the nonlinear response of the spin system to strong magnetic fields. Thus, a coherent magnetic pulse of duration T is needed with a discrete frequency spectrum {\u03c9m}, say, for Mn12 between 20 and 120\u2009GHz and a single low-frequency \u03c90 around 100\u2009MHz (for pulse-shaping techniques see ref. 11 and references therein). The low-frequency field Hz(t) = H0(t)cos(\u03c90t)ez, applied along the easy axis, couples to the spin of the molecular magnet through the hamiltonian  where \u210f\u03c90 \u226a \u03b5 m 0 \u2212 \u03b5 m 0 + 1 and ez is the unit vector pointing along the z axis. The \u03c0 photons12 of Vlow supply the necessary energy for the resonance condition (see below). They give rise to virtual transitions with \u0394m = 0, that is, they do not transfer any angular momentum, see Fig. 2. Figure 2: Feynman diagrams F that contribute to S(5)m,s for s = 10 and m0 = 5 describing transitions (of 5th order in V) in the left well of the spin system (see Fig. 1). The blue (red) arrows indicate the transitions induced by the high-(low-)frequency magnetic fields Hm (H0) shown in equation (2) (equation (1)). Whereas the Hm fields transfer angular momentum to the spin of the molecular magnet by means of \u03c3- photons, the H0 field provides only energy without angular momentum by means of \u03c0 photons. In this way all the transition amplitudes S(5)m,s are of similar magnitude (see text). We note that S(j)m,s = 0 for j < n, and |S(j)m,s| \u226a |S(n)m,s| for j > n. For example, the transition from |10\u3009 to |7\u3009 arises from the absorption of five photons in total, comprising three \u03c3- photons and two \u03c0 photons. As it does not matter in which order the five photons are absorbed, there are (52) = 10 different kinds of diagrams. Also, it is essential that the levels are not equidistant; if they are, this scheme for multiphoton absorption does not work, because then resonances can already occur in lower orders of the S-matrix leading to incoherent populations of the levels. There is a global phase factor due to the unperturbed time evolution of the spin system, given by e - i \u03b5 m ( t - t 0 ) / \u210f , which can easily be accounted for and shall thus be ignored here. For a first test of the nonlinear response described here, we can irradiate the molecular magnet with an a.c. field of frequency \u03c9s-1,s\u2009/2, which gives rise to a two-photon absorption and thus to a Rabi oscillation between the states |s\u3009 and |s - 1\u3009. We note that for stronger magnetic fields it is in principle possible to generate superpositions of Rabi oscillations between the states |s\u3009 and |s - 1\u3009, |s\u3009 and |s - 2\u3009, |s\u3009 and |s - 3\u3009, and so on (to be published elsewhere). Full size image The perturbation hamiltonian for the high-frequency transitions from |s\u3009 to virtual states that are just below |m\u3009, m = m0,\u2026, s - 1, given by the transverse fields H-\u22a5(t) = \u03a3s-1m=m0Hm(t)[cos(\u03c9mt + \u03a6m)ex - sin(\u03c9mt + \u03a6m)ey], reads with phases \u03a6m (see below), where we have introduced the unit vectors ex and ey pointing along the x and y axes, respectively. These transverse fields rotate clockwise and thus produce left circularly polarized \u03c3- photons which induce only transitions in the left well (see Fig. 1). In general, absorption (emission) of \u03c3- photons gives rise to \u0394m = -1 (\u0394m = +1) transitions, and vice versa in the case of \u03c3+ photons. Anti-clockwise rotating magnetic fields of the form H-\u22a5(t) = \u03a3s-1m=m0Hm(t)[cos(\u03c9mt + \u03a6m)ex - sin(\u03c9mt + \u03a6m)ey] can be used to induce spin transitions only in the right well (see Fig. 1). In this way, both wells can be accessed independently. Next we calculate the quantum amplitudes for the transitions induced by the magnetic a.c. fields (see Fig. 2) by evaluating the S-matrix perturbatively. The jth-order term of the perturbation series of the S-matrix in powers of the total perturbation hamiltonian V(t) = Vlow(t) + Vhigh(t) is expressed by which corresponds to the sum over all Feynman diagrams of order j, and where U ( t , t 0 ) = e - i H ( t - t 0 ) / \u210f is the free propagator, \u0398(t) is the Heavyside function. The total S-matrix is then given by S = \u03a3\u221ej=0S(j). The high-frequency virtual transition changing m from s to s - 1 is induced by the frequency \u03c9s-1 = \u03c9s-1,s - (n - 1)\u03c90. The other high frequencies \u03c9m, m = m0,\u2026,s - 2, of the high-frequency fields Hm mismatch the level separations by \u03c90, that is, \u210f\u03c9m = \u03b5m - \u03b5m+1 + \u210f\u03c90, see Fig. 2. As the levels are not equidistant, it is possible to choose the low and high frequencies in such a way that S(j)m,s = 0 for j < n, in which case the resonance condition is not satisfied, that is, energy is not conserved. In addition, the higher-order amplitudes |Sm,s(\u2009j\u2009)| are negligible compared to |Sm,s(n)| for j > n. Using rectangular pulse shapes with Hk(t) = Hk, if -T/2 < t < T/2, and 0 otherwise, for k = 0 and k \u2a7e m0, we obtain after lengthy but straightforward calculation (m \u2a7e m0) where \u03a9m = (m - m0)! is the symmetry factor of the Feynman diagrams F (see Fig. 2), qF = m - m0 - rs(F), pm,s(F) = \u03a0sk=m \u3008k|Sz|k\u3009rk(F)\u03a0s-1k=m \u3008k|S-|k + 1\u3009, where rk(F) = 0,1,2,\u2026 \u2a7d m - m0 is the number of \u03c0 transitions directly above or below the state |k\u3009, depending on the particular Feynman diagram F, and \u03b4(T)(\u03c9) = 1/2\u03c0 \u222b+T/2-T/2 ei\u03c9tdt = sin(\u03c9T/2)/\u03c0\u03c9 is the delta-function of width 1/T, ensuring overall energy conservation (the resonance condition) for \u03c9T \u226b 1. The duration T of the magnetic pulses must be shorter than the lifetimes \u03c4d of the states |m\u3009 (see Fig. 1). For illustration, we now focus on the case s = 10, m0 = 5, and thus n = 5, described by S(5)m,10, since this is most relevant for the molecular magnets Mn12 and Fe8 (see Fig. 2). In general, the Grover algorithm requires that the levels are simultaneously populated with roughly equal amplitudes, that is, |S(n)m,s| \u2248 |S(n)s-1,s|, for all m \u2a7e m0, from which we can deduce the required field amplitudes using equation (4) This means that the fields H0 and H9, and the frequency \u03c90 can be chosen independently. We note particularly that the amplitudes Hk do not differ too much from each other, which can be traced back to partial cancellations in equation (4) owing to the factor ( \u2212 1 ) q F . This fact is most useful for applications. Next, we estimate the transition rate needed to coherently populate the five levels with one single pulse with Vlow + Vhigh. As [\u03b4(T)(\u03c9)]2 \u2248 (T/2)\u03c0\u03b4(T)(\u03c9), the transition rate wm,s = |S(n)m,s|2/T from |10\u3009 to |5\u3009 at resonance (with \u03b4(T)(0) = T/2\u03c0) reads where p5,10 = \u03a09k=5 \u3008k|S-|k + 1\u3009. We then insert the parameters \u03c90 = 5 \u00d7 108\u2009s-1, T = 10-7\u2009s, H0 = H9 = 20\u2009G giving the transition rate w5,10 = 9 \u00d7 106\u2009s-1, which is of the order of \u03c4d, that is, Tw5,10 = 1. For our purpose it is sufficient to choose Tw5,10 \u226a 1. If \u03c90 = 5 \u00d7 107\u2009s-1, T = 10-7\u2009s and H0 = H9 = 2\u2009G, we obtain the transition rate w5,10 = 9 \u00d7 104\u2009s-1, and thus Tw5,10 \u2248 0.01. Thus we have shown that the required amplitudes and frequencies of the fields given in equation (1) and (2) are experimentally accessible. We adapt now the Grover scheme5 to describe the quantum computational read-in and decoding of the quantum data register a. For simplicity we set the relative phase \u03a60 = 0 of the low-frequency field Hz(t); see equation (1). (1) Read-in. We start from the ground state |s\u3009 as initial state. Then, in order to introduce the desired phases \u03a6m for each state |m\u3009 we need to irradiate the system with a coherent magnetic pulse of duration T containing the n - 1 high-frequency fields Hm[cos(\u03c9mt + \u03a6m)ex - sin(\u03c9mt + \u03a6m)ey] (see equation (2)) with \u03a6m = \u03a3m+1k=s-1 \u03a6k + \u03d5m (\u03d5m are the relative phases), and the low-frequency field Hz(t) (see equation (1)), yielding S(n)m0,s = \u2026 = S(n)s-2,s = S(n)s-1,s = \u00b1\u03b7, \u03b7 > 0, that is, \u03d5m = 0,\u03c0, depending on the number to be encoded. For example, to encode the number 1310 = 11012 in Fig. 2, we need \u03d59 = \u03d58 = \u03d57 = 0 and \u03d56 = \u03d55 = \u03c0, where the states m = 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 represent the binary digits 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, respectively. We note that S(n)m,s can be either positive or negative, depending on the explicit Feynman diagrams F. In this way we can prepare the quantum data register a = (as,as-1, \u2026, am0), where the bits as = 1, am = \u00b1 \u03b7 are the amplitudes of the state |\u03c8\u3009 = \u03a3sm=m0am|m\u3009. This pulse performs a unitary transformation up to order \u03b7, that is, Um,s + O(\u03b72) = S(n)m,s. In this way an arbitrary integer between 0 and 2n-1 can be stored. (2) Decoding. In order to decode the phase information stored in the data register a, a universal single pulse (see equations (1) and (2)) leading to S(n)m0,s = \u2026 = S(n)s-2,s = S(n)s-1,s = - \u03b7 must be applied, which performs approximately a unitary transformation for \u03b7 \u226a 1. The accumulated error is about n\u03b72, which must be kept smaller than 1. Because \u03b7 > \u03b70 > 0, with \u03b70 given by the precision of the detection, we require that n \u226a 1/\u03b720. We note that this decoding works also if the bits am, with \u03b70 < |am|\u226a 1, have different amplitudes (but still of similar magnitude). This pulse amplifies the flipped bits, which have amplitude -\u03b7, and suppresses the rest of the bits with amplitude +\u03b7. For the example shown in Fig. 2 the relative phases in equation (2) must be set \u03d59 = \u03d57 = \u03d55 = 0 and \u03d58 = \u03d56 = \u03c0 (irrespective of a). (3) Read-out. Once a state has been marked and amplified, that is, decoded, we must be able to read out this information physically. This task can be accomplished by standard spectroscopy with, say, pulsed ESR, where the circularly polarized radiation can now be incoherent because we need the absorption intensity of only one pulse. Full spectral analysis of Mn12 has been performed with ESR13 and neutron scattering14. Thus, we can assume that the spectrum is known. Now, irradiation of the magnet with a single pulse of duration T containing the frequencies \u03c9m-1,m, where m = s - 2,\u2026, m0, induces transitions that are described by the first-order amplitudes S(1)m-1,m (higher-order multiphoton effects can now be neglected for sufficiently small fields). For instance, let us assume that the state |7\u3009 is marked, that is, populated. Then, we would observe stimulated emission for the transitions from |7\u3009 to |8\u3009 at the frequency \u03c9 = \u03c97,8 and stimulated absorption of approximately the same intensity for the transition from |7\u3009 to |6\u3009 at \u03c9 = \u03c96,7, which uniquely identifies the marked level, because the levels are not equidistant. Generally, if the states |m1\u3009,|m2\u3009,\u2026,|mk\u3009, where 1 < k < n, are marked, the following absorption/emission intensity in leading order is measured: This spectrum identifies all the marked states unambiguously. We emphasize that the entire Grover algorithm (read-in, decoding, read-out) requires three subsequent pulses each of duration T with \u03c4d > T > \u03c9-10 > \u03c9-1m, \u03c9-1m,m\u00b11. This gives a \u2018clock-speed\u2019 of about 10\u2009GHz for Mn12, that is, the entire process of read-in, decoding, and read-out can be performed within about 10-10\u2009s. Finally, so far we have used only the left well of the potential in Fig. 1. As both wells can be accessed separately during read-in, decoding and read-out by magnetic fields that rotate either clockwise or anti-clockwise, a single molecular magnet represents a two-digit number. Every digit can store N = 2s-1 elements at most, which allows us to store a number between 0 and 22s-2 = 2.6 \u00d7 105 in a single crystal made of molecular magnets with spin s = 10. If M > 2 phases can be distinguished for \u03d5m (depending on the experimental resolution)5, a number between 0 and M2s-2 can be stored in a single crystal of molecular magnets with spin s. We note that the experimental overhead required by the Grover search algorithm involves only the control of logMN frequencies, which, once available, can decode any number between 1 and N by means of a single magnetic pulse. Our proposal for implementing Grover's algorithm works not only for molecular magnets but for any electron or nuclear spin system with non-equidistant energy levels. Although such spin systems cannot be scaled to arbitrarily large spin s\u2014the larger a spin becomes, the faster it decoheres and the more classical its behaviour will be\u2014we can use such spin systems of given s to great advantage in building dense and highly efficient memory devices.

The protocol by Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn [2001, Nature (London) 409, 46] explicitly demonstrates that efficient scalable quantum computing with single photons, linear optical elements, and projective measurements is possible. Subsequently, several improvements on this protocol have started to bridge the gap between theoretical scalability and practical implementation. The original theory and its improvements are reviewed, and a few examples of experimental two-qubit gates are given. The use of realistic components, the errors they induce in the computation, and how these errors can be corrected is discussed. 30 More Corrected 30 May 2007 DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.79.135 \u00a92007 American Physical Society CORRECTIONS 30 May 2007 ERRATUM Publisher's Note: Linear optical quantum computing with photonic qubits [Rev.

Although it was in principle scalable, the massive resource overhead made the scheme practically daunting. However, several simplifications were followed by proof-of-principle demonstrations, and recent approaches based on cluster states or error encoding have dramatically reduced this worrying resource overhead, making an all-optical architecture a serious contender for the ultimate goal of a large-scale quantum computer. Key challenges will be the realization of high-efficiency sources of indistinguishable single photons, low-loss, scalable optical circuits, high-efficiency single-photon detectors, and low-loss interfacing of these components. SIGN UP FOR THE SCIENCEADVISER NEWSLETTER The latest news, commentary, and research, free to your inbox daily SIGN UP Over the last few decades quantum information science has emerged to consider what additional power and functionality can be realized in the encoding, transmission, and processing of information by specifically harnessing quantum mechanical effects (1). Anticipated technologies include quantum key distribution (2), which offers perfectly secure communication; quantum metrology (3), which allows more precise measurements than could ever be achieved without quantum mechanics; and quantum lithography (4), which could enable fabrication of devices with features much smaller than the wavelength of light. Perhaps the most startling and powerful future quantum technology is a quantum computer, which promises exponentially faster computation for particular tasks (1, 5). The quest to develop a quantum computer will require formidable technical mastery of the fabrication of devices at the nano and possibly atomic scale, and precision control of their quantum mechanical states. The task is also daunting owing to the inherent fragility of quantum states and the fact that quantum entanglement, and its role in a quantum computer, is not yet fully understood. As we engineer devices that exploit quantum mechanical effects, we will gain an unprecedented control over the fundamental workings of nature as well as a deeper understanding of them. The requirements for realizing a quantum computer are confounding: scalable physical qubits\u2014two-state quantum systems\u2014that can be well isolated from the environment but also initialized, measured, and controllably interacted to implement a universal set of quantum logic gates (6). However, a number of physical implementations are being pursued, including nuclear magnetic resonance, ion, atom, cavity quantum electrodynamics, solid state, and superconducting systems (7). Over the past few years, single particles of light\u2014photons\u2014have emerged as a leading approach. Single Photons as Qubits Single photons are largely free of the noise, or decoherence, that plagues other systems; can be easily manipulated to realize one-qubit logic gates; and enable encoding in any of several degrees of freedom, for example, polarization, time bin, or path. Figure 1A shows how a qubit can be encoded in the polarization of a single photon. An arbitrary state of a single qubit \u03b1|H \u3009 + \u03b2|V \u3009 (|\u03b1|2 +|\u03b2|2 = 1) can be represented on the Poincare\u0301 (or Bloch) sphere (Fig. 1B). One-qubit logic gates are straightforward, using birefringent wave plates (Fig. 1C), and converting between polarization and path encoding can be easily achieved using a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) (Fig. 1D), where |0\u3009 or |1\u3009 now represents a photon in the upper or lower path, respectively. Fig. 1. Single-photon qubits. (A) A horizontal (H) photon represents a logical \u201c0\u201d and a vertical (V) photon represents a logical \u201c1\u201d:|0\u3009 \u2261 |H\u3009;|1\u3009 \u2261 |V\u3009. (B) An arbitrary state can be plotted on the Bloch (or Poincare\u0301) sphere. Examples of diagonal (|D\u3009 \u2261 |0\u3009+|1\u3009), antidiagonal (|A\u3009 \u2261 |0\u3009\u2013|1\u3009), right circular (|R\u3009 \u2261 |0\u3009+i|1\u3009), and left circular (|L\u3009 \u2261 |0\u3009\u2013i|1\u3009) are shown. (C) Single-qubit gates are easily realized using birefringent wave plates that retard one polarization by a fraction of a wavelength \u03bb relative to an orthogonal polarization, causing a rotation of the state on the Bloch sphere, with the axis of rotation determined by the orientation of the wave plate. For example, a Hadamard (H) gate (defined by its operation on the logical states: |0\u3009\u2192|0\u3009+|1\u3009;|1\u3009\u2192|0\u3009\u2013|1\u3009 or |H\u3009\u2192|D\u3009;|V\u3009\u2192|A\u3009) causes a \u03c0 rotation about an axis running through the midpoint between the |H\u3009 and |D\u3009 states and can be realized by a \u03bb/2 wave plate oriented at 22.5\u00b0. An arbitrary rotation requires a \u03bb/4-\u03bb/2-\u03bb/4 sequence. (D) Converting between polarization and path encoding requires a PBS, which transmits H and reflects V, and a \u03bb/2 wave plate oriented at 45\u00b0, which transforms |\u3009\u2194|\u3009. Expand for more A major difficulty for optical quantum computing is in realizing the entangling logic gates required for universal quantum computation. The canonical example is the controlled NOT gate (CNOT), which flips the state of a target (T) qubit conditional on a control (C) qubit being in the logical state \u201c1.\u201d Figure 2A shows why this operation is difficult. The two paths used to encode the target qubit are mixed at a 50% reflecting beam splitter (BS) (or half-silvered mirror), which performs the Hadamard operation (Fig. 1C). If the phase shift is not applied, the second Hadamard (BS) undoes the first, returning the target qubit to exactly the same state it started in (this is an example of \u201cclassical\u201d wave interference). If, however, a (\u03c0) phase shift is applied, that is, |0\u3009 +|1\u3009 \u2194 |0\u3009 \u2013 |1\u3009, the target qubit undergoes a bit-flip or NOT operation. A CNOT must implement this phase shift only if the control photon is in the \u201c1\u201d path. No known or foreseen material has an optical nonlinearity strong enough to implement this conditional phase shift [although tremendous progress has been made with single atoms in high-finesse optical cavities (8\u201310)]. Fig. 2. An optical CNOT gate. (A) Schematic of a possible realization of an optical CNOT gate. (B) In the notation of quantum circuits, the BSs each implement a Hadamard (H) gate. In 2001, a major breakthrough showed that scalable quantum computing is possible using only single-photon sources and detectors and simple (linear) optical circuits consisting of BSs (11). This is a truly remarkable discovery, because the argument above suggests that a strong optical nonlinearity is required to realize the most basic logic element. Linear Optical Quantum Computing A diagram of a nondeterministic (probabilistic with success signal) CNOT is shown in Fig. 3C. The control and target qubits (encoded in polarization, say), together with two auxiliary photons, enter an optical network of BSs, where the four photons' paths are combined. At the output of this network, the control and target photons emerge, having had the CNOT logic operation applied to their state, conditional on a single photon being detected at both detectors. This detection event occurs with probability P <1(1/16 in the original scheme); the rest of the time (P = 15/16), another detection pattern is recorded (none, only one, two photons at one detector, and so on) and the CNOT logic is not applied. In fact, a single photon may not even emerge from the control and/or target outputs in these cases. Fig. 3. An optical CNOT gate by teleportation. (A) Quantum interference of two photons at a BS. (B) Teleportation of a CNOT. Ignoring the Probabilistic Gate, a qubit in an unknown state |C\u3009 and one of two photons prepared in a maximally entangled state |\u03d5\u3009 are subjected to a Bell measurement (B). This measurement leaves the third qubit in the state |C\u3009, or the bit (X), and/or phase (Z) flipped version of |C\u3009, depending on which of the four maximally entangled states is measured. An unwanted X and/or Z flip can be trivially corrected by applying a second X and/or Z as required. Still ignoring the Probabilistic Gate, the unknown input state of the control and target qubits can both be teleported and the CNOT performed on the output qubits. This seems like a lot of extra work for no gain; however, performing the CNOT before the (possible) X and Z flip has the tremendous advantage that we could repeatedly attempt the CNOT on the two halves of two entangled states, and only when the gate works would we proceed with teleportation. In this way, the control and target qubits are preserved until the gate works (on average, 32 entangled states will be consumed) and we can implement the CNOT deterministically. In quantum mechanics, the order in which operations are performed is important; performing the CNOT earlier means we must add the X and Z flips indicated in red (). () A diagram of a measurement-assisted nondeterministic CNOT gate. Expand for more A nondeterministic CNOT is of little use for quantum computing because the probability that a computation succeeds decreases exponentially with the number of CNOTs. Fortunately, the success probability of the nondeterministic CNOT can be boosted by harnessing quantum teleportation (12), a process whereby the unknown state of a qubit can be transferred to another qubit. The idea is to teleport a nondeterministic gate that has already worked onto the control and target qubits (13) (Fig. 3). Quantum teleportation has been realized with single photons (14). An important omission from the above discussion is that, because the Bell measurements required for teleportation (Fig. 3B) measure maximally entangled states, they require a similar optical nonlinearity as a CNOT (although the photons can be destroyed in the measurement) and therefore fail some of the time. When they fail, they measure the state of the control and target photons in the {|0\u3009,|1\u3009} basis. The final component is an encoding against this \u201cmeasurement error\u201d: A single logical qubit is encoded in several physical qubits such that if one of the physical qubits is measured, the original logical qubit can still be recovered. These encoded states are entangled and therefore require entangling gates to realize them. However, by using more and more photons, a CNOT with a probability of success approaching 1 can be realized (11). Reducing the Resource Overhead These developments were expanded upon (15\u201319) and soon followed by several proof-of-principal experimental demonstrations of CNOTs (20\u201323) and encoding against measurement error (24, 25). Despite this great progress, optical quantum computing was still widely regarded as impractical owing to the large resource overhead required to realize a near-deterministic CNOT: >10,000 pairs of entangled photons to achieve a success probability of >95%. The reason that all-optical quantum computing is today a promising route to practical quantum computing is due to new schemes that dramatically reduce this worrying resource overhead. Quantum computations (regardless of physical realization) are typically formulated using the quantum circuit model (e.g., Fig. 2B), a generalization of the circuit model for Boolean logic: Qubits are represented by wires propagating in time from left to right, subjected to a sequence of quantum logic gates, and finally measured (1). In 2001 a remarkable alternative was proposed in which the computation starts with a particular massively entangled state of many qubits (a cluster state) and the computation proceeds by a sequence of single-qubit measurements, from left to right, that ultimately leave the rightmost column of qubits in the answer state (26) (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Cluster state quantum computing. For photons, it is practical to start measuring the qubits while the cluster is still being grown. The blue qubits are in a cluster state, where the bonds between them represent entanglement. The green qubits are being added to the cluster, whereas the gray qubits have been measured and are no longer entangled. The measurement outcome determines the basis for the measurement on the next qubit. In 2004, it was recognized that the cluster approach offered tremendous advantages for optical realizations (27)[see also (28)]. Because preparation of the cluster state can be probabilistic, nondeterministic CNOTs are suitable for making it, removing much of the massive overhead that arises from the error encoding used to make near-deterministic CNOTs. It turns out that a similar advantage can also be gained in the circuit formulation of optical quantum computing by using more sophisticated error-encoding techniques (29). These, and other techniques that dispense with CNOT gates entirely (30), reduce the resources required by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, making an all-optical approach far more attractive. There have already been experimental proof-of-principle demonstrations of these new schemes [e.g., (31\u201334)]. Fault Tolerance The final, and arguably most important, consideration (for all physical realizations) is fault tolerance (1). In contrast to conventional computers, quantum computers will be very susceptible to noise, which must be encoded against (in addition to the encoding described above). The threshold theorem says that if the noise is below some threshold, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be realized. One of the most encouraging results for all approaches to quantum computing was the high threshold of 1% recently reported by Knill (35). Because cluster state approaches do not conform to the standard model, the threshold theorem does not apply; fortunately, analogous thresholds have been shown to exist (36). Recent results give cause for optimism: They show that if the product of source and detector efficiency is >2/3, then optical quantum computing is possible, provided all other components operate perfectly (37) (photon loss can in some cases be incorporated into source or detector efficiency). More complete treatments that consider more sources of noise give thresholds of 10\u20133 to 10\u20134 (38). The true number will likely lie somewhere in between. Sources, Detectors, and Circuits There are very stringent requirements for single-photon sources for optical quantum computing. In a general linear optical network (e.g., Fig. 3C) there are places where photons arrive at both inputs to a BS where quantum interference of two (or more) photons can occur. An example is shown in Fig. 3A where a photon enters each input of a 50% reflective BS. The probability of detecting a single photon at each output is given by the square of the sum of the probability amplitude for both photons to be transmitted and that for both photons to be reflected: P =|r.r + t.t|2. Because a phase shift occurs on reflection r.r = \u2013t.t and so P = 0, in contrast to our (classical) expectation: P =1/2 (39). For quantum interference to occur, the two photons must be indistinguishable from one another in all degrees of freedom. To date, small-scale tests of optical quantum computing have relied on indistinguishable pairs of photons generated by a strong laser pulse in a nonlinear crystal. Unfortunately, this process is spontaneous and not readily scalable (40). Solid-state sources of single photons hold the promise of ready integration, and quantum interference between subsequent photons emitted from a semiconductor quantum dot has been observed (41). However, an optical quantum computer will require quantum interference between photons emitted from independent sources. This has very recently been achieved for a pair of trapped atoms (42) and ions (43), a tremendous advance that bodes well for optical quantum computing. Impurities in diamond may offer the best of both worlds\u2014a solid-state host and atom-like energy levels\u2014and have emerged as very promising candidates (40). It is actually the inherent nonlinearity of photon measurement, combined with quantum interference of photons, that makes linear optical quantum computing possible. Single-photon counting modules are commercially available and have been used for almost all demonstrations to date; however, they cannot distinguish between one or more photons and have a limited efficiency (\u223c70%). Higher efficiency will be required for scalable optical quantum computing, whereas photon number resolution will be desirable. Ongoing work indicates that such high-performance detectors will become available, with superconductor-based devices holding great promise (44). Finally, almost all demonstrations of linear optical logic circuits have relied on large-scale BSs and mirrors, with photons propagating in air; improved performance, miniaturization, and scalability will likely require low-loss microscopic optical waveguide circuits. A promising approach is integrated optics, an analog of electrical integrated circuits, which has been developed by the photonics industry. Outstanding challenges are to realize quantum interference in these devices and to integrate them with single-photon sources and detectors. Nonlinear and Hybrid Approaches Recently, attention has been given to the idea of combining linear optics with optical nonlinearities that would not allow a CNOT gate to be realized in the manner suggested in Fig. 2 but would nevertheless offer considerable advantages. One way is to use a two-photon absorber to implement the quantum Zeno effect, whereby repeated measurement inhibits the emission of two photons into one of the outputs of a CNOT gate (45)\u2014the failure mode of the linear optical CNOT gate proposed in (16). Another way is to use a strong optical nonlinearity that is significantly weaker than that required in Fig. 2: Single photons are made to interact with one another by means of a bright laser pulse and the nonlinear medium (46). Finally, recent developments suggest that a hybrid approach may have many advantages (47\u201350): Because single-photon sources are inherently quantum mechanical, it is promising to consider storing quantum information in the sources themselves; already, spins associated with impurities in diamond have shown great promise in this direction (51). Such systems are particularly suited to the small-scale quantum processors that will be required in the nodes and quantum repeaters of quantum communication networks (52). Future Prospects Despite great progress, much work remains to be done if a large-scale optical quantum computer is to be realized. It is not yet known whether the circuit or cluster model (or some other approach) is most promising. Indeed, a combination of these approaches has been described in which error encoding is achieved using cluster techniques but the computation proceeds through conventional CNOT gates (53). Further, the role of nonlinear optics approaches in any future optical quantum computer will depend on their efficacy and practicality. The majority of experimental demonstrations to date have relied on nonscalable single-photon sources, large-scale optical elements, and modest-efficiency single-photon detectors. Scaling to useful devices will require high-efficiency single-photon sources and detectors that are efficiently coupled to low-loss microscopic optical waveguide circuits [optical memories may not be required (54)].

The one-way quantum computer proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel is entirely different. It has changed our understanding of the requirements for quantum computation and more generally how we think about quantum physics. This new model requires qubits to be initialized in a highly entangled cluster state. From this point, the quantum computation proceeds by a sequence of single-qubit measurements with classical feedforward of their outcomes. Because of the essential role of measurement, a one-way quantum computer is irreversible. In the one-way quantum computer, the order and choices of measurements determine the algorithm computed. We have experimentally realized four-qubit cluster states encoded into the polarization state of four photons. We characterize the quantum state fully by implementing experimental four-qubit quantum state tomography. Using this cluster state, we demonstrate the feasibility of one-way quantum computing through a universal set of one- and two-qubit operations. Finally, our implementation of Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that one-way quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks.

Such a device will be far more efficient at factoring3 or database searches4 compared to its classical counterparts5. Considerable effort has been directed towards understanding the role of measurement and entanglement in quantum computation6,7,8,9,10,11,12. A significant step forward in our understanding was the introduction of the one-way quantum computer13,14,15,16,17, which highlights the importance of both measurement and entanglement in a striking way. In this model, all of the entanglement is provided in advance through a highly entangled multiparticle cluster state13. The quantum computation on the cluster state proceeds via local, single-qubit projective measurements with the outcomes potentially affecting those measurement settings that follow. It is a strength of the cluster state model that the intrinsic randomness of quantum measurement results creates specific types of errors that can be corrected through this classical feedforward. Most importantly, feedforward makes cluster state quantum computation deterministic. In the present proof-of-principle experiment, we perform measurements using fixed single-port polarizers, making our computations probabilistic. Different algorithms require only a different pattern of adapted single-qubit operations on a sufficiently large cluster state. As it is entirely based on single-particle measurements instead of unitary evolution, the computation is inherently not time-reversible\u2014it is one-way. Most importantly, cluster state quantum computation is universal14,17 in that any quantum circuit can be implemented on a suitable cluster state. Open theoretical questions remain about the scalability under realistic noise conditions required for fault-tolerant one-way quantum computation. Although a threshold has been proved to exist18, it is unknown whether cluster state quantum computation will be more or less sensitive to noise than the standard model. The one-way quantum computer does not perform quantum logic on the individual qubits of the cluster state. In order to describe the computational circuit, we need to distinguish between the physical qubits (in our case, the polarization state of photons), which make up the cluster state and on which actual measurements are carried out, and encoded qubits, on which the computation is actually taking place. Owing to the specific entanglement of the cluster state, no individual physical qubit carries any information about an input state. Instead, each encoded qubit is written on the cluster state non-locally; that is, the information is carried by the correlations between the physical qubits. As the quantum computation proceeds, the encoded input qubits are processed in the imprinted circuit, whose output is finally transferred onto physical readout qubits. Interestingly, whereas the entanglement between the physical qubits in general decreases as a result of the measurement sequence, the entanglement between encoded qubits may increase. A cluster state can be thought of as emerging from an array of equally prepared independent qubits, which then interact via controlled-phase (\u2018CPhase\u2019) gates with their nearest (connected) neighbours. Specifically, a cluster state can be built up as follows: a large number of physical qubits are each prepared in the superposition state | + \u3009 = ((|0\u3009 + |1\u3009))/\u221a \u221a(2) , where |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 are the computational basis of the physical qubits. A CPhase operation |j\u3009|k\u3009 \u2192 (- 1)jk|j\u3009|k\u3009, with (j,k\u22080,1), is then applied between pairs of neighbouring, connected qubits and effectively generates entanglement between them. The choice of which physical qubit neighbours are entangled by the CPhase operations, drawn as connecting \u2018bonds\u2019 (Fig. 1), determines the structure of the cluster state, which defines the basic type quantum circuit it can implement. This construction provides an intuitive understanding of the graphical representation of cluster states as connected arrays of physical qubits, in which each line corresponds to a previous nearest-neighbour interaction. We will later demonstrate how the highly entangled cluster states can be generated in a different way\u2014directly from nonlinear optical processes. Figure 1: Few-qubit cluster states and the quantum circuits they implement. For each three- and four-qubit cluster, its quantum state and the computation carried out in the one-way quantum computer model are shown. For the case of the linear clusters |\u03a6lin3\u3009 (a) and |\u03a6lin4\u3009 (b), consecutive measurements on the qubits 1, 2 and 3 will perform a computation as a series of one-qubit rotation gates. The encoded input state undergoes single-qubit rotations with controllable angles, and the output is left on physical qubit 4. In contrast, the horseshoe clusters |\u03a6\u22824\u3009 (c) and |\u03a6\u22834\u3009 (d) and the box cluster |\u03a6\u25a14\u3009 (e) form more complex circuits containing both single-qubit and two-qubit gates, both of which are necessary to form a universal set of logic gates for quantum computation. In particular, measurements on two of the physical qubits (2 and 3 in the case of |\u03a6\u22824\u3009, and 1 and 4 in the case of |\u03a6\u22834\u3009 or |\u03a6\u25a14\u3009) will perform the circuit defined by the particular cluster and transfer the logical output onto the remaining two physical qubits (1 and 4 in the case of |\u03a6\u22824\u3009, and 2 and 3 in the case of |\u03a6\u22834\u3009 or |\u03a6\u25a14\u3009). When these cluster states are not a part of a larger cluster, the encoded input states are always |\u03a8in\u3009 = |+\u30091E for the one-qubit gates and |\u03a8in\u3009 = | + \u30091E| + \u30092E for the two-qubit gates. f, General input states can be prepared and processed through these operations when these clusters are subunits of larger clusters. Full size image Given a cluster state, two basic types of single-particle measurements suffice to operate the one-way quantum computer. Measurements in the computational basis { ||0\u3009j,|1\u3009j | }have the effect of disentangling, that is, removing, the physical qubit j from the cluster, leaving a smaller cluster state. Such operations can be used to modify the structure of the cluster and thus the imprinted circuit. The measurements that perform the actual quantum information processing are made in the basis Bj(\u03b1) = || + \u03b1\u3009j,| - \u03b1\u3009j | , where | \u00b1 \u03b1\u3009j = ((|0\u3009j \u00b1 ei\u03b1|1\u3009j ))/\u221a \u221a(2) (\u03b1 is a real number). The choice of measurement basis determines the single-qubit rotation, Rz(\u03b1) = exp(- i\u03b1\u03c3z/2), followed by a Hadamard operation, H = (( \u03c3x + \u03c3z ))/\u221a \u221a(2) , on encoded qubits in the cluster ( \u03c3x,\u03c3y,\u03c3z being the usual Pauli matrices). Combinations of rotations about the z axis and Hadamard operations can implement Rx(\u03b1) = exp(- i\u03b1\u03c3x/2) rotations through the matrix identity Rx(\u03b1) = HRz(\u03b1)H . General quantum logic operations can be carried out by the correct choice of Bj(\u03b1) on a sufficiently large cluster state. We define the outcome sj of a measurement on the physical qubit j as 0 if the measurement outcome is | + \u03b1\u3009j , and as 1 if the outcome is | - \u03b1\u3009j . In those cases where the 0 outcome is found, the computation proceeds as desired. However, in those cases where the 1 outcome is found, a well-defined Pauli error is introduced. Feedforward, such that the output controls future measurement, compensates for these known errors. For the implementations of single- and two-qubit quantum logic, we post-select only those cases where the 0 outcome is found. In these cases the computation proceeds error-free and requires no feedforward. In the final section, where we report the implementation of Grover's search algorithm, the feedforward determines the final, classical, measurement. There we measured all possible combinations of the measurement results individually, and applied the feedforward relation in such a way that the earlier measurement outcomes define the meaning of the final ones. Even a small cluster state suffices to demonstrate all the essential features of one-way quantum computing. Each of the three- and four-particle cluster states shown in Fig. 1 can implement the quantum circuit shown to its right that consists of a series of single- and two-qubit quantum gates. The computation proceeds via single-particle measurements carried out from the left side of the cluster to the right side, where the final readout takes place. The important feature of the quantum circuits is that the output of one circuit can be fed into the input of a subsequent one if their cluster states are bonded together by CPhase operations. Thus these small circuits, which form a universal set of logic gates, can be used as subunits for a fully functional quantum computer. As an example, consider the four-particle box cluster state |\u03a6\u25a14\u3009 on a two-dimensional lattice (Fig. 1e). The encoded input to the two-qubit quantum circuit is the product state |\u03a8in\u3009 = | + \u30091E| + \u30092E , where the numerical subscript labels the qubit and the subscript E is used to distinguish encoded qubits from physical qubits. The circuit processes this pair of encoded qubits through a sequence beginning with a CPhase gate, followed by single-qubit rotations Rz(- \u03b1) and Rz(- \u03b2) on encoded qubits 1 and 2, then a Hadamard operation, H, on both qubits, ending with a second CPhase operation. The values for \u03b1 and \u03b2 of the rotation gates are set by the choice of measurement bases B1(\u03b1) and B4(\u03b2) on the physical qubits 1 and 4 respectively. The output of the quantum computation is transferred onto physical qubits 2 and 3. This kind of two-qubit quantum gate is essential for universal quantum computation, as it can generate entanglement between the encoded qubits. On the other hand, by changing the geometry of the cluster state to the one-dimensional cluster |\u03a6lin4\u3009 (Fig. 1b), it now results in a different quantum circuit corresponding to a set of single-qubit rotations on one encoded qubit. Consecutive measurements B1(\u03b1), B2(\u03b2) and B3(\u03b3) on the physical qubits 1, 2 and 3 transform the input state, in our case |\u03a8in\u3009 = | + \u30091E , to |\u03a8out\u3009 = HRz(- \u03b3)Rx(- \u03b2)Rz(- \u03b1)|\u03a8in\u3009 and store the output on qubit 4. In order to demonstrate all the circuits shown in Fig. 1a\u2013e, it is sufficient to produce first a linear cluster state of four qubits. The particular circuit implemented is then determined by the order of the measurements performed. Specifically, the one-dimensional linear structure (Fig. 1a and b) is implemented by sequentially measuring qubits 1, 2 and 3, with the final result then being available at qubit 4. The two-dimensional \u2018horseshoe\u2019 structures (Fig. 1c and d) are implemented by measuring either qubits 2 and 3 or 1 and 4, with the final result then being available at qubits 1 and 4 or 2 and 3, respectively. The four-qubit box cluster (Fig. 1e) can be obtained from the four-qubit linear cluster by Hadamard rotations and by swapping (that is, relabelling) the physical qubits 2 and 3. This will be described in more detail in the next section, and in the section \u2018Two-qubit gates\u2019. The difficulty of one-way quantum computing lies with the cluster state preparation. Cluster states arise naturally in spin chains or spin lattices by way of nearest-neighbour Ising interaction13, a well-known interaction model in solid-state physics. The first proposals to achieve cluster states were based on analogues of dipole\u2013dipole coupling between atoms in optical lattices15,19. Although photon\u2013photon interactions are negligible, recent proposals have nevertheless shown that optical systems may be well suited for implementing the cluster state model. These schemes use sequences of probabilistic quantum-logic gates8,20,21,22,23 based on linear optical elements to construct large photonic cluster states24,25. These optical one-way quantum computation proposals are less demanding of resources than the comparable optical implementation in the standard model8. In the present work, we have used nonlinear optics to directly produce four-photon cluster states. This method exploits a mode- and polarization-entangled four-photon state26 produced in pulsed-pump spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) (see Methods). We reconstructed the density matrix of the four-qubit cluster state using quantum state tomography, and studied the state's entanglement properties relevant for quantum computation. We then implemented all of the quantum circuits shown in Fig. 1a\u2013e, and demonstrated a two-qubit quantum search algorithm. In doing so, we have demonstrated the first universal set of gates and an important algorithm in a one-way quantum computer. Creation and characterization of the cluster state Our cluster state is produced experimentally using the mode- and polarization-entangled output of nonlinear spontaneous parametric down-conversion and linear optical elements, as described in detail in the Methods section. When four photons are emitted into the output modes of the polarizing beam-splitters 1, 2, 3 and 4, they are in the highly entangled cluster state where |H\u3009 and |V\u3009 represent respectively horizontally and vertically polarized photon states, and the subscript labels the spatial mode. This state, |\u03a6cluster\u3009, is equivalent to the four-qubit linear cluster, |\u03a6lin4\u3009, and the horseshoe cluster states, |\u03a6\u22824\u3009 and |\u03a6\u22834\u3009 (Fig. 1) under the local unitary operation H1\u2297I2\u2297I3\u2297H4 on the physical qubits, where Hi (Ii) is a Hadamard (identity) operation on qubit i. The four-qubit linear cluster can easily be reduced to a three-qubit linear cluster by measuring qubit 1 in the computational basis of the cluster and thus disentangling it from the rest. The state, |\u03a6cluster\u3009, can be converted to the box cluster state (Fig. 1e) by the local unitary operation H1\u2297H2\u2297H3\u2297H4 and a swap (or relabelling) of qubits 2 and 3. Note that the four-qubit cluster state thus realized is also the smallest cluster state that represents a new kind of entanglement27, while the two-qubit and three-qubit cluster states are locally equivalent to a maximally entangled Bell state and the three-qubit Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger (GHZ) state, respectively. State tomography We have completely characterized our state via quantum-state tomography (which is a method for extracting the density matrix of a quantum state) from a discrete set of experimental measurements. Although quantum process and state tomography has been performed with up to three qubits28,29 this is, to our knowledge, the first time that a four-qubit density matrix has been determined from a complete, experimentally obtained density matrix. For a four-photon polarization state, like our cluster state, the full density matrix, \u03c1, is a 16 \u00d7 16 dimensional object that can be reconstructed by linear combinations of 256 linearly independent four-photon polarization projections. We performed each of these 256 measurements for 600\u2009s using all combinations of { ||H\u3009,|V\u3009,| + \u3009,|R\u3009| }, where | + \u3009 = ((|H\u3009 + |V\u3009))/\u221a \u221a(2) and |R\u3009 = ((|H\u3009 - i|V\u3009))/\u221a \u221a(2) . A maximum of 127 fourfold coincidence counts in 600\u2009s were measured in the case of the setting |H\u30091|H\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 . Instead of a direct linear combination of measurement results, which can lead to unphysical density matrices owing to experimental noise, we use a maximum-likelihood reconstruction technique30,31,32. The resulting density matrix is shown in Fig. 2. The dominant diagonal elements represent the four components |H\u30091|H\u30092|H\u30093|H\u30094 , |H\u30091|H\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 , |V\u30091|V\u30092|H\u30093|H\u30094 and |V\u30091|V\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 as expected from equation (1), while off-diagonal elements indicate strong coherences between them. The negative coherences are due to the required \u03c0 phase shift in the amplitude for the |V\u30091|V\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 term. Our reconstructed state is in good qualitative agreement with the target state, |\u03a6cluster\u3009. This can be quantified by the state fidelity F = \u3008\u03a6cluster|\u03c1|\u03a6cluster\u3009 = (0.63 \u00b1 0.02), which is the state vector overlap with the ideal state |\u03a6cluster\u3009. At present, no theoretical results exist concerning the fidelity requirements in cluster state quantum computation, so the full implications of the value that we found for the fidelity are unclear. Nevertheless, it has been proved that bi-separable four-qubit states cannot have a fidelity greater than 0.5 with our target cluster state. Our measured fidelity is clearly above this threshold, and therefore the observed fidelity is proof of the fact that the state contains the required four-particle entanglement33 to a significant degree. Our cluster state is a coherent superposition of four different terms, each from a different physical origin (see Methods). The fidelity of our state is not perfect, because of partial distinguishability of these terms and because of imperfect phase stability in our set-up. We expect that achieving high fidelity with the target state will become rapidly more difficult as the size of the Hilbert space is increased. However, the acceptable amount of noise per qubit is independent of the size of the cluster, whereas it becomes exponentially small for GHZ states34. Thus the problem of noise does not increase for larger clusters34. Figure 2: Density matrix of the four-qubit cluster state in the laboratory basis. Shown are the real (top) and imaginary (bottom) parts of the density matrix for the ideal case (a) and the reconstruction from the experimental four-photon tomography data (b). In both cases, there are four large diagonal components corresponding to HHHH, HHVV, VVHH and VVVV. The coherences between each of these diagonal elements show up as off-diagonal contributions, and are necessary for quantum entanglement. The real density matrix was reconstructed by way of a maximum likelihood method using four-photon coincidence rates obtained in 256 polarization projections. Full size image Entanglement properties One-way cluster state quantum computation is based entirely on the entanglement properties of the physical qubits of the initial cluster state. For three-qubit states, there are only two classes of entanglement typified by the GHZ state35, |GHZ\u3009 = ((|H\u30091|H\u30092|H\u30093 + |V\u30091|V\u30092|V\u30093 ))/\u221a \u221a(2) , and by the W state36,37, |W\u3009 = ((|V\u30091|H\u30092|H\u30093 + |H\u30091|V\u30092|H\u30093 + |H\u30091|H\u30092|V\u30093 ))/\u221a \u221a(3) . As such, the three-qubit cluster state cannot represent a fundamentally different class of state and is, in fact, a GHZ state. On the other hand, our four-qubit cluster state cannot be converted via local unitary operations to either the four-qubit generalizations of the GHZ or the W state, but combines important characteristics of both. As in a four-qubit GHZ state, we can make local measurements on one or two of the qubits and, with only classical communication, leave the remaining qubits in a three-qubit GHZ state or in a two-qubit Bell state, both of which can serve as an entanglement resource for quantum communication. For an explicit example, we reconstructed the density matrix of qubits 2, 3 and 4 by considering only the subset of our full tomographic measurements where qubit 1 was successfully measured in the state | + \u30091 . Its fidelity compared to an ideal three-photon GHZ state was (0.60 \u00b1 0.02), which is above the local realism threshold38 of 0.56. Whereas the loss of one qubit in a GHZ state is already sufficient to completely disentangle the state, N/2 particles have to be removed from an N-particle cluster state in order to leave a separable state. The cluster states share this persistency of entanglement13 with the W states, which show an even stronger robustness against such decoherence. We demonstrate this property by considering the reduced density matrix of qubits 2, 3 and 4, \u03c12,3,4red , after ignoring qubit 1\u2014that is, after tracing out the first qubit. This trace has been implemented by summing the two subsets of our tomographic measurements in which the first qubit was measured in the state |H\u30091 or |V\u30091 . To test for entanglement in the remaining three-qubit state, we used the entanglement-witness operator , where Tr(W\u03c1) \u2265 0 for all separable states, but is negative for some entangled states. Our state gives a value of (- 0.115 \u00b1 0.007), which is negative by 16\u03c3 and thus proves that entanglement in qubits 2, 3 and 4 persists even after \u2018loss\u2019 of qubit 1. This remaining entanglement is between qubits 3 and 4. The loss of another particle destroys all entanglement and leaves a separable two-qubit state. We test this by calculating the eigenvalues of the partial transpose reduced density matrix of qubits 3 and 4, which are \u03bb1 = 0.49, \u03bb2 = 0.45, \u03bb3 = 0.05 and \u03bb4 = 0.008. These values are all positive, and thus fulfil the necessary and sufficient conditions for separability in two-particle systems39,40. A one-way quantum computer Given a cluster state, quantum gates are implemented on the encoded qubits using only a series of single-qubit measurements and classical feedforward. In this section, we demonstrate the essentials of cluster-state quantum computation. In the present experiment, we created a cluster state and performed fixed polarization measurements, that is, projections onto the state | + \u03b1\u3009j in the bases, Bj(\u03b1), which require no feedforward or subsequent corrections given a successful measurement. This reduces the success rate of the computation by a factor of two for every measurement as compared to ideal, deterministic gate operations, but it certainly suffices as a proof of principle. An important challenge for future work is to implement the fast active switching and logic requirements for one-way quantum computation with feedforward. We have realized a universal set of quantum logic operations in the form of single-qubit rotations and non-trivial two-qubit gates. In the following sections we characterize the quality of each quantum computation by comparing the measured output state to the ideal using the state fidelity. Interesting avenues for study include full quantum gate characterization using quantum process tomography41,42 or related measures43. Single-qubit rotations We start with the one-dimensional four-qubit linear cluster state, |\u03a6lin4\u3009, which implements an arbitrary single-qubit rotation gate (Fig. 1b). In particular, we perform B1(\u03b1), B2(\u03b2) and B3(\u03b3) on the physical qubits in the linear cluster basis. The parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are sufficient to rotate the input qubit to anywhere on the Bloch sphere, or more generally to implement an arbitrary SU(2) single-qubit rotation. This computation rotates the encoded input qubit |\u03a8in\u3009 = | + \u30091E to the output state |\u03a8out\u3009 = HRz(- \u03b3)Rx(- \u03b2)Rz(- \u03b1)|\u03a8in\u3009, while the output of this computation is left in the quantum state of qubit 4. We finally characterize physical qubit 4 to verify the performance of the computation using single-qubit quantum state tomography (see Supplementary Table 1a). The three-qubit linear cluster state |\u03a6lin3\u3009 is generated from |\u03a6lin4\u3009 by disentangling physical qubit 1 from the cluster. This is achieved by measuring physical qubit 1 in the computational basis for the linear cluster, that is, { || + \u30091,| - \u30092 | } in the laboratory basis. We consider only those cases where we find the \u2018+\u2019 outcome. This resulting cluster state implements the quantum circuit in Fig. 1a, which is a simpler single-qubit rotation gate with rotations determined by the measurements B2(\u03b1) and B3(\u03b2) of the second and the third qubit. This rotates the encoded input qubit |\u03a8in\u3009 = | + \u30091E to the final state, |\u03a8out\u3009 = Rx(- \u03b2)Rz(- \u03b1)|\u03a8in\u3009, which is again left on physical qubit 4. The computation is directly implemented by performing single-particle measurements on qubits 1, 2 and 3. The single-qubit output stored on qubit 4 is completely characterized by single-qubit tomography. We compare this single output qubit with both the theoretically expected output and the predicted output from our reconstructed four-particle cluster state density matrix. Figure 3 shows the state of qubit 4 on the Bloch sphere in the laboratory basis in the ideal (left-hand side) and measured (right-hand side) case for three different measurement settings. These measurement settings were chosen to clearly show the effect of changing a single measurement basis. For the three state vectors shown as 1, 2 and 3, \u03b1 was set to \u03c0/2, \u03c0/4 and 0, respectively, while \u03b2 was fixed to -\u03c0/2. The state fidelities of these and other measurement settings compared to the ideal gate action are shown in Supplementary Table 1b. Figure 3: Output Bloch vectors from single qubit rotations using a three-qubit linear cluster |\u03a6lin3\u3009. The results of the ideal rotations (a) are compared with the results of the measured rotations (b) on the encoded input state | + \u30091E for three different choices of measurement bases B2(\u03b1). The output state is written in the laboratory basis. The measurement basis B3(\u03b2) for qubit 3 was fixed at \u03b2 = \u03c0/2. The angle \u03b1 is set to \u03c0/2, \u03c0/4 and 0 for the Bloch vectors labelled 1, 2 and 3 respectively. These different choices of \u03b1 result in different rotations about the |L\u3009 axis. The sense of the rotation is shown for decreasing \u03b1. Our final states, extracted from measured single-qubit tomography, had fidelities of (0.86 \u00b1 0.03), (0.85 \u00b1 0.04) and (0.83 \u00b1 0.03) with respect to the ideal output states. Fidelities of outputs for other choices of angles and hence other rotations are shown in Supplementary Table 1b. Full size image Two-qubit gates In order to perform universal quantum computation, non-trivial two-qubit quantum-logic gates4 are required in addition to single-qubit rotations. Well-known examples of such gates are the controlled-NOT (CNOT) or CPhase operations. The crucial trait of these gates is that they can change the entanglement between qubits. Gates of this type can be implemented with a two-dimensional cluster. In Fig. 1, we show two-dimensional cluster states\u2014the horseshoe cluster states (Fig. 1c and d) and the box cluster state (Fig. 1e)\u2014that satisfy this condition for two-qubit quantum logic. Both of their quantum circuits comprise single-qubit rotations and CPhase operations that can generate entanglement between two initially separable encoded qubits. Whether or not entanglement is generated depends on the specific circuit and the initial states. We will give a specific example of a two-qubit quantum computation that does not generate entanglement (in the box cluster) and a second computation that does generate entanglement (in the horseshoe cluster). The box cluster transforms the two-qubit encoded input state according to where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are determined by measurements B1(\u03b1) and B4(\u03b2) on qubits 1 and 4, respectively. For the isolated box (or horseshoe) cluster state, the encoded qubit input state is the product state |\u03a8in\u3009 = | + \u30091E| + \u30092E . Consider the case where photons 1 and 4 are measured to be |V\u30091 and |H\u30094 in the laboratory basis. For the box cluster, this corresponds to measuring the \u20180\u2019 outcome of B1(\u03c0) and B4(0) respectively on physical qubits 1 and 4. According to the box quantum circuit, this should perform the computation | + \u30091E| + \u30092E \u2192 | + \u30091E| - \u30092E with the resulting product state outcome left on qubits 2 and 3. The experimentally measured final state of qubits 2 and 3, in the laboratory basis, are shown as a two-qubit density matrix in Fig. 4a. The state has a single dominant diagonal element corresponding to the state |V\u30092|H\u30093 and no off-diagonal elements. Recall that the conversion from the box basis to the laboratory basis requires a swap of qubits 2 and 3 and the application of a Hadamard on each qubit. This converts | + \u30091E| - \u30092E to |V\u30091E|H\u30092E , in agreement with our measured density matrix. The fidelity of this measured density matrix of qubits 2 and 3 with the ideal output is (0.93 \u00b1 0.01). We can quantify the entanglement in the output state using the tangle44 defined as , where \u03bbi are the eigenvalues of the matrix \u03c1\u03a3\u03c1T\u03a3 and \u03a3 = \u03c3y\u2297\u03c3y , and are decreasingly ordered with \u03bb1 being the largest. The tangle can range from 0 for separable states to 1 for maximally entangled states. The tangle of our measured density matrix is (0.01 \u00b1 0.01), in agreement with the expected value of 0\u2014no entanglement has been generated in this case. The fidelities of other quantum computations in the box cluster are shown in Supplementary Table 2a, including an example where entanglement is generated. Figure 4: The output density matrices from two different two-qubit computations. Each density matrix is shown as two bar charts, with the upper bar chart depicting the real part of the matrix and the lower chart depicting the imaginary part. In case a, single-qubit measurements were made on qubits 1 and 4 in the box cluster state |\u03a6\u25a14\u3009. The measurement settings were B1(\u03c0) and B4(0), which results in the expected output state |V\u30092|H\u30093 in the laboratory basis. The measured density matrix has (0.93 \u00b1 0.01) fidelity with this state and no entanglement. In case b, single-qubit measurements in B2(0) and B3(0) were made on the horseshoe cluster state |\u03a6\u22824\u3009. In this case, the expected output density matrix (left-hand side) and the experimentally measured density matrix (right-hand side) are both shown in the laboratory basis. The measured and expected density matrices are in good agreement and this is reflected in the fidelity (0.84 \u00b1 0.03). We extracted the tangle, a measure of entanglement, from the experimentally measured density matrix as \u03c4 = (0.65 \u00b1 0.11). This conclusively demonstrates that our cluster state quantum computer can generate the quantum entanglement necessary for universal quantum computation. Full size image Encoded two-qubit operations are crucial for cluster state quantum computation as they can generate entanglement. The horseshoe cluster state of Fig. 1c performs the following quantum circuit: For our input state |\u03a8in\u3009 = | + \u30091E| + \u30092E , this circuit always generates maximal entanglement. Consider the case where photons 2 and 3 are both measured in the state | + \u3009. This measurement corresponds to the \u20180\u2019 outcome of B2(0) and B3(0) on physical qubits 2 and 3, and should perform the transformation | + \u30091E| + \u30092E \u2192 (1/\u221a2)((|0\u30091E| + \u30092E + |1\u30091E| - \u30092E ) ), where the output is maximally entangled. The experimentally measured output density matrix of photons 2 and 3 is shown in Fig. 4b (right-hand side). For comparison, the ideal output density matrix is also shown in Fig. 4b (left-hand side). The two density matrices are qualitatively very similar and, indeed, the state fidelity of our measured state with the ideal state is (0.84 \u00b1 0.03). The tangle of this output state is \u03c4 = (0.65 \u00b1 0.11), confirming the generation of entanglement between the logical qubits as a result of the quantum computation. Furthermore, this experimentally measured density matrix implies a maximum Clauser\u2013Horne\u2013Shimony\u2013Holt (CHSH) Bell parameter45 of S = (2.47 \u00b1 0.08), which is well above the S = 2 upper limit for local realistic theories. The fidelities of other quantum computations in the horseshoe cluster are shown in Supplementary Table 2b. Grover's search algorithm The excitement over quantum computation is based on just a few algorithms, the most well known being Shor's factorization algorithm3 and Grover's search algorithm6. The latter is extremely important, both from a fundamental standpoint, as it is provably more efficient than the best classical algorithm, and from a practical standpoint, because fast searching is central to solving difficult problems. Grover's algorithm has been implemented under the standard model46,47 both in NMR48,49 and in optical experiments47. Here, we demonstrate a two-qubit implementation of Grover's fast quantum search using the cluster state model. The goal of a search is to identify one out of N elements of a database. Formally, one could consider the database as a black box that labels one of N possible inputs leaving all others unchanged. The challenge, then, is to find that labelled state. The best classical strategy chooses the inputs randomly one by one and checks for the label; it takes, on average, about N/2 calculations to find the special input. Quantum parallelism in Grover's algorithm allows for all inputs to be processed simultaneously in superposition, while interference enhances the probability of finding the desired outcome in only O(\u221aN) calculations of the function. In the case of a two-bit function (N = 4), the difference is even more dramatic, as Grover's algorithm needs only one calculation of the function, whereas classically three evaluations are needed in the worst case, and 2.25 evaluations are needed on average. The quantum circuit for the two-qubit Grover algorithm is shown in Fig. 5a. Two input qubits, 1 and 2, are prepared in the state | + \u30091| + \u30092 . This is a superposition of all four computational basis states |0\u3009|0\u3009, |0\u3009|1\u3009, |1\u3009|0\u3009 and |1\u3009|1\u3009. As one of four possibilities, the black box could label the state |0\u3009|1\u3009 \u2192 - |0\u3009|1\u3009 by changing its sign and leaving all other states unchanged. Note that the change of sign is equivalent to a bit flip on an ancillary qubit. Any of the four possibilities can be set by proper choices of the rotation angles \u03b1 and \u03b2. The output from the black box is processed by an operation that inverts the amplitudes for each computational state about the mean value. This process amplifies the labelled amplitude and reduces the rest. In the two-qubit case, theory predicts that after a single application of this inversion, the computer outputs the labelled state with probability 1. Figure 5: Grover's algorithm in a cluster state quantum computer. a, The quantum circuit implementing Grover's search algorithm for two qubits. The box cluster state implements the quantum circuit shown in Fig. 1e. These two circuits perform the equivalent computation when the readout measurements on physical qubits 2 and 3 in the box cluster are carried out in the bases B2,3(\u03c0). The rotations, and hence black-box function, are fixed by the measurement settings B1(\u03b1) and B4(\u03b2) on physical qubits 1 and 4. The circuit implements one of the four black boxes in the search algorithm, and processes the output through an inversion-about-the-mean operation. The output, which is the final states of physical qubits 2 and 3, reveals which black box was applied. b, The experimentally measured outputs of this quantum computation. The data labelled \u2018no FF\u2019 show the computational outputs {s2, s3} in those cases where the measurements in the black box found the \u20180\u2019 outcome. The data labelled \u2018FF\u2019 show the outputs for all individually measured outcomes from the black box to which the feedforward relation | s2\u2295s4,s3\u2295s1 | has been applied to the output results. The probability for successful identification of the function is approximately 90% in all cases. Full size image We can compare this circuit for the two-qubit Grover algorithm to that implemented by the box cluster state in Fig. 1e. The Grover algorithm circuit contains extra fixed single-qubit operations (a \u03c3z followed by a Hadamard transformation, H) on each qubit before the readout in the computational basis. Measurement of a final physical qubit in the computational basis after a \u03c3z followed by H is equivalent to direct measurement of those qubits in the basis B(\u03c0), that is, we can absorb these additional fixed single-qubit operations into the readout stage. The quantum circuit implemented by the box cluster can be seen as precisely that one required for Grover's algorithm provided that the final readout measurements are made in B2,3(\u03c0) on physical qubits 2 and 3. The cluster state computation proceeds as follows. The encoded qubits begin in the state | + \u30091| + \u30092 . Setting the measurement angles, \u03b1\u03b2, to \u03c0\u03c0, \u03c00, 0\u03c0 and 00 determines the black-box settings 00, 01, 10 and 11, respectively. In principle, these settings remain hidden. The result of a measurement of physical qubit i is si, which is 0 (1) for a measurement of | + \u03b1\u3009 (| - \u03b1\u3009) . For the computation to proceed deterministically, the black box must provide the measurement outcomes for feedforward. The encoded qubits are transferred non-locally to the remaining physical qubits in the cluster. Remarkably, the inversion-about-the-mean process is already \u2018hard-wired\u2019 into the structure of the cluster state and is automatically implemented. The output of the computation, including feedforward (FF), are two bits { | s2\u2295s4,s3\u2295s1 | } identifying the black box. In Fig. 5b, we show the experimental outcomes of the quantum computation. As in the previous computations, measurements were made using quarter-wave plates and polarizers. The \u2018no FF\u2019 data are the computational outputs obtained when the black-box outcomes, s1 and s4, were 0, which requires no feedforward but reduces the success rate to 1/4. In addition, we have measured individually all possible correlations between the measurement results from the black box and the readout. This enables us to implement the simplest feedforward possible, where the earlier measurement determines the meaning of the final readout. Thus, when the black-box measurement outcomes are other than s1 = 0 and s4 = 0, it is necessary to reinterpret the readout via the bitwise addition shown above; the \u2018FF\u2019 row of data in Fig 5b shows the sum of the readouts interpreted in this way. In either case, the probability of the quantum computer determining the correct outcome is about 90%. These high-fidelity results (Fig. 5b) constitute, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a quantum algorithm in a cluster state quantum computer. Discussion We have generated a four-qubit cluster state, and characterized that state and its entanglement features. With that cluster, and taking advantage of a curious equivalence of a number of cluster states, we have demonstrated a universal set of single-qubit and non-trivial two-qubit quantum logic gates in a one-way quantum computer. Our final realization of the Grover algorithm strongly underlines the basic simplicity of the cluster state approach. Given the various alternatives for their creation, such as linear optics, ion traps and optical lattices, and the recent advances in the preparation of multiparticle entangled states, cluster states are promising for inclusion in future implementations of quantum computation. The most important challenges for the optical approach presented here are (1) realization of cluster states on demand, (2) generating cluster states with more qubits and (3) implementation of fast feedforward where earlier measurement outcomes actually change the setting of a future measurement in real time. Methods Experimental preparation of cluster states In our experiment, entangled photons are created by using type-II parametric down-conversion50. A frequency-doubled laser pulse at 795\u2009nm makes two passes through a \u03b2-barium borate (BBO) crystal, which emits highly entangled photons into the forward pair of modes a and b and the backward pair of modes c and d (Fig. 6). To counter the effect of birefringence in the BBO crystal, the polarization in each mode is rotated by 90\u00b0 and the photons pass through compensation crystals that erase transverse and longitudinal walk-off. Final half-wave plates (HWPs), one for each photon pair, and the tilt of the compensation crystals allow for the production of any of the four Bell states. The modes of the forward emitted pairs a and b and the modes of the backward emitted pairs c and d are coherently combined at polarizing beam-splitters (PBSs) by adjusting the position of the delay mirror for the ultraviolet pump. The preparation of the cluster state is based on the simultaneous emission of four photons. The construction of the set-up allows for four photon events to come from either two entangled pairs, one forward and one backward, or from double-pair emission into the modes a and b, and c and d26. Figure 6: The experimental set-up to produce and measure cluster states. An ultraviolet laser pulse makes two passes through a nonlinear crystal (BBO), which is aligned to produce entangled photon pairs |\u03a6-\u3009a,b in the forward direction in modes a and b, and |\u03a6+\u3009c,d in the backward direction in modes c and d. Compensators (Comp), consisting of a half-wave plate (HWP) and an extra BBO crystal, are placed in each path to counter walk-off effects. Including the possibility of double-pair emission and the action of the polarizing beam-splitters (PBSs), the four components of the cluster state can be prepared. The incorrect phase on the HHVV amplitude can easily be changed by using a HWP in mode a. The amplitudes can be equalized by adjusting the relative coupling efficiency of those photon pairs produced in the backward pass as compared to the forward pass. Polarization measurements were carried out in modes 1 to 4 using quarter-wave plates (QWPs) and linear polarizers (Pol) followed by single-mode fibre-coupled single-photon counting detectors behind 3-nm interference filters. Full size image Proposed methods for producing cluster states are based on series of two-qubit gates, such as the CPhase or CNOT. In our case, the four-photon cluster state is generated directly from parametric down-conversion. Because of its intrinsically probabilistic nature, the down-conversion process becomes exponentially inefficient for generating larger cluster states. Our way of generating the cluster states furthermore exploits the properties of PBSs and uses post-selection. A PBS is an optical device that transmits horizontally polarized light and reflects vertically polarized light. Considering the two-photon case, where after the PBS in each mode one photon has to be detected, both incoming photons must have the same polarization when they come from different input modes, or they must have orthogonal polarizations when entering along the same input mode. If the source produces simultaneously a |\u03a6-\u3009a,b state into the forward pair of modes, and backwards a |\u03a6+\u3009c,d state, only the state |H\u30091|H\u30092|H\u30093|H\u30094 - |V\u30091|V\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 results in a four-photon coincidence. However, there exists also the case where a four-photon emission into the two modes on either side results in a fourfold coincidence. The state must be in this case - |H\u30091|H\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 coming from the |\u03a6-\u3009a,b setting and + |V\u30091|V\u30092|H\u30093|H\u30094 coming from the |\u03a6+\u3009c,d setting. The final emerging state is a superposition of all four terms. In order to produce a cluster state, the phase of the - |H\u30091|H\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 term has to be shifted by \u03c0. This can be done using a HWP in one mode, where a polarization rotation of an angle \u03c6 causes the state after the PBSs to evolve to - cos(2\u03c6)|H\u30091|H\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 . Thus any HWP rotation larger than 22.5\u00b0 results in a sign flip. At the same time, the Bell state is converted to cos(\u03c6)|\u03a6-\u3009a,b + sin(\u03c6)|\u03a8+\u3009a,b , where the amount of the wanted |\u03a6-\u3009a,b state is decreased by a factor of cos(\u03c6). Owing to the properties of the PBS, only the amplitudes for the |H\u30091|H\u30092|H\u30093|H\u30094 - |V\u30091|V\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 terms are affected, while the |\u03a8+\u30091,2 Bell state does not contribute to any fourfold coincidence. Note that after each PBS a quarter-wave plate (QWP) was placed to compensate for birefringence effects. For each measurement, the phase of the back-reflected pair or four-photon was kept fixed and verified for each measurement setting. Taking into account the emission rates of the source for the entangled pairs (28,000\u2009s-1 two-photon coincidences for the forward-emitted pair, and 18,000\u2009s-1 coincidences for the backward-emitted pair), theoretical calculations show that a HWP rotation by 27.5\u00b0 results in the maximally entangled cluster state of the form |\u03a6cluster\u3009 = (1/2)((|H\u30091|H\u30092|H\u30093|H\u30094 + |H\u30091|H\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 + |V\u30091|V\u30092|H\u30093|H\u30094 - |V\u30091|V\u30092|V\u30093|V\u30094 ) ). Thus, a HWP in mode a has been rotated to prepare this state. Fine-tuning has been done by short measurements to obtain approximately equal count rates for each component.

Until then most experiments had involved a sequence of interactions between single particles (qubits) in a sequential network of quantum logic gates. Raussendorf and Briegel envisaged computing based on a particular class of entangled states, the cluster states. In this method, a quantum computer is initialized in a cluster state, then computation proceeds by single-particle measurements on individual qubits in the cluster. The measurements imprint a quantum logic circuit on the state, which destroys its entanglement and makes the process irreversible. Hence the name \u2018one-way quantum computing\u2019 for the system. Walther . now report a significant experimental advance: the first realizations of cluster states and cluster state quantum computation. The cluster is created in the polarization state of four photons and computing proceeds via a set of one- and two-qubit operations. show all Nature (Nature) ISSN 1476-4687 (online) ISSN 0028-0836 (print) About Nature Portfolio About us Press releases Press office Contact us Discover content Journals A-Z Articles by subject Protocol Exchange Nature Index Publishing policies Nature portfolio policies Open access Author & Researcher services Reprints & permissions Research data Language editing Scientific editing Nature Masterclasses Research Solutions Libraries & institutions Librarian service & tools Librarian portal Open research Recommend to library Advertising & partnerships Advertising Partnerships & Services Media kits Branded content Professional development Nature Careers Nature Conferences Regional websites Nature Africa Nature China Nature India Nature Italy Nature Japan Nature Korea Nature Middle East Privacy Policy Use of cookies Your privacy choices/Manage cookies Legal notice Accessibility statement Terms & Conditions Your US state privacy rights \u00a9 2024 Springer Nature Limited",

Comput., 26 (1997), pp. 1277--1339], [Simon, in Proc. 35th Annual IEEE Symposium Foundations Comput. Sci., 1994, pp. 116--123, SIAM J. Comput., 26 (1997), pp. 1340--1349], [Shor, in Proc. 35th Annual IEEE Symposium Foundations Comput. Sci., 1994, pp. 124--134] suggesting that quantum computers are more powerful than classical probabilistic computers. Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of \\NP can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class \\NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine (QTM) in time o ( 2 n / 2 ) .

Knill  Nature  434,  39\u201344 (2005)Cite this article 11k Accesses 782 Citations 47 Altmetric Metrics Abstract In theory, quantum computers offer a means of solving problems that would be intractable on conventional computers. Assuming that a quantum computer could be constructed, it would in practice be required to function with noisy devices called \u2018gates\u2019. These gates cause decoherence of the fragile quantum states that are central to the computer's operation. The goal of so-called \u2018fault-tolerant quantum computing\u2019 is therefore to compute accurately even when the error probability per gate (EPG) is high. Here we report a simple architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing, providing evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible for EPGs as high as three per cent. Such EPGs have been experimentally demonstrated, but to avoid excessive resource overheads required by the necessary architecture, lower EPGs are needed. Assuming the availability of quantum resources comparable to the digital resources available in today's computers, we show that non-trivial quantum computations at EPGs of as high as one per cent could be implemented.

There is a large and still-growing number of experimental efforts whose ultimate goal is to demonstrate scalable quantum computing. Scalable quantum computing requires that arbitrarily large computations can be implemented efficiently with little error in the output. Criteria that need to be satisfied by devices used for scalable quantum computing have been specified4. An important one is that the level of noise affecting the physical gates and memory is sufficiently low. The type of noise affecting a given implementation is the \u2018error model\u2019. A scheme for scalable quantum computing in the presence of noise is a \u2018fault-tolerant architecture\u2019. In view of the low-noise criterion, studies of scalable quantum computing involve constructing fault-tolerant architectures and providing answers to questions such as the following: is scalable quantum computing possible for error model \u03b5? Can fault-tolerant architecture A be used for scalable quantum computing with error model \u03b5? What resources are required to implement quantum computation C using fault-tolerant architecture A with error model \u03b5? To obtain broadly applicable results, fault-tolerant architectures are constructed for generic error models. Here, the error model is parametrized by an error probability per gate (or simply error per gate, EPG), where the errors are unbiased and independent. The fundamental theorem of scalable quantum computing is the threshold theorem and answers the first question as follows: if the EPG is smaller than a threshold, then scalable quantum computing is possible5,6,7,8. Thresholds depend on additional assumptions for the error model and device capabilities. Estimated thresholds vary from below 10-6 (refs 5\u20138) to 3 \u00d7 10-3 (ref. 9), with 10-4 (ref. 10) often quoted as the EPG to be achieved in experimental quantum computing. In the few cases where experiments with two quantum bits (qubits) have been performed, the EPGs currently achieved are much higher, 3 \u00d7 10-2 or more in ion traps11,12 and liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance13,14. For quantum computing to become practical, it is essential to reduce the large gap between the experimentally achieved EPGs and those required by theory. The first goal of our work is to provide evidence that scalable quantum computing is possible at EPGs above 3 \u00d7 10-2. This is encouraging, but the fault-tolerant architecture that achieves this is impractical because of its large resource requirements. To reduce the resource requirements, lower EPGs are required. The second goal of our work is to give a simple fault-tolerant architecture (called the \u2018C4/C6 architecture\u2019) well-suited to efficient computing with EPGs between 10-4 and 10-2. The third goal is to provide a means of estimating its resource requirements depending on computation size and EPG. Fault-tolerant architectures realize low-error qubits and gates by encoding them with error-correcting codes. A standard technique for reducing errors is concatenation. Suppose we have a scheme that, starting with qubits and gates at one EPG, produces encoded qubits and gates that have a lower EPG. If the error model for encoded gates is sufficiently well-behaved, we can apply the same scheme to the encoded qubits and gates to obtain a next level of encoded qubits and gates with much lower EPGs. This process yields a hierarchy of repeatedly encoded qubits and gates, where the physical qubits and gates are at level 0. The top level is used for quantum computing. Its qubits, gates, EPGs and so on are \u2018logical\u2019. The C4/C6 architecture differs from previous ones by combining a number of independently useful techniques. First, we use the simplest error-detecting codes, thus avoiding the complexity of even the smallest error-correcting codes. Error correction is added naturally by concatenation. Second, error correction is performed in one step and combined with logical gates by means of error-correcting teleportation. This minimizes the number of gates contributing to errors before they are corrected. Third, the architecture bootstraps key gates by state preparation and purification, thus enabling us to define it using a minimal and incomplete set of operations with only one unitary gate. Fourth, verification of the needed ancillary states (logical Bell pairs) largely avoids the traditional syndrome-based schemes. Instead, we use hierarchical teleportations and partial decoding. Finally, the highest thresholds are obtained by introducing the model of postselected computing with its own thresholds, which may be higher than those for standard quantum computing. Our fault-tolerant implementation of postselected computing has the property that it can be used to prepare states that are sufficient for standard scalable quantum computing. Error model and assumptions The unit of quantum information is the qubit, a quantum two-level system whose states are superpositions \u03b1|0\u3009 + \u03b2|1\u3009 (ref. 15). Qubits are acted on by the Pauli operators X = \u03c3x (bit flip), Z = \u03c3z (sign flip) and Y = \u03c3y = i\u03c3x\u03c3z. The identity operator is I. One-qubit gates include preparation of |0\u3009 and |+\u3009 = (|0\u3009+|1\u3009)/\u221a2, Z-measurement (distinguishing between |0\u3009 and |1\u3009), X-measurement (distinguishing between |+\u3009 and |-\u3009= (|0\u3009-|1\u3009)/\u221a2), and the Hadamard gate (HAD,\u03b1|0\u3009 + \u03b2|1\u3009\u21a6\u03b1|+\u3009+\u03b2|-\u3009). We use one unitary two-qubit gate, the controlled-NOT (CNOT), which maps |00\u3009\u21a6|00\u3009, |01\u3009\u21a6|01\u3009, |10\u3009\u21a6|11\u3009 and |11\u3009\u21a6|10\u3009. This set of gates is a subset of the so-called Clifford gates, which are insufficient for universal quantum computing10. Our minimal gate set GF min consists of |0\u3009 and |+\u3009 preparation, Z- and X-measurement and CNOT. Universality may be achieved with the addition of other one-qubit preparations or measurements, as explained below. The physical gates mentioned are treated as being implemented in one \u2018step\u2019; the actual implementations may be more complex. All error models can be described by inserting errors acting as quantum operations (not necessarily unitary) after gates or before measurements. We assume that a gate's error consists of random, independent applications of products of Pauli operators with probabilities determined by the gate. It is at present too difficult to obtain a threshold that does not depend on the details of the probability distributions, so we assume unbiased, \u2018depolarizing\u2019 errors for each gate: |0\u3009 (|+\u3009) state preparation erroneously produces |1\u3009 (|-\u3009) with probability ep. A binary (such as Z or X) measurement results in the wrong outcome with probability em. CNOT is followed by one of the 15 possible non-identity Pauli products acting on its qubits with probability ec/15 each. HAD is modified by one of the Pauli operators, each with probability eh/3. We further simplify by setting ec = \u03b3, eh = 4\u03b3/5 and em = ep = 4\u03b3/15. This choice is justified as follows: 4\u03b3/5 is the one-qubit marginal probability of error for the CNOT, which we expect to be an upper bound for all one-qubit gate errors. As for preparation errors, if they are much larger than 4\u03b3/15, then it is possible to purify prepared states using a CNOT. For example, we can prepare |0\u3009 twice, apply a CNOT from the first to the second and measure Z of the second. We then try again if the measurement outcome indicates |1\u3009, and otherwise use the first state. The probability of error is given by 4\u03b3/15 + O(\u03b32), assuming that CNOT error is as above and measurement and preparation errors are proportional to \u03b3. To improve Z measurement, we can introduce an ancilla in |0\u3009, apply a CNOT from the qubit to be measured to the ancilla, and measure both qubits. If the measurements disagree, an error is detected. If not, the conditional measurement error probability is 4\u03b3/15 + O(\u03b32). Detected errors are readily managed16. To account for \u2018memory\u2019 errors, we assume that gates other than measurements take the same amount of time. Thus, the error parameters represent the total error, including any delays for faster gates to equalize gate times. For the C4/C6 architecture, memory is required when waiting for measurement outcomes that determine whether prepared states are good, or that are needed after teleportation, particularly when implementing non-Clifford gates17,18. The simplest way to account for memory errors in these situations is to distribute it equally to the surrounding gates. The maximum error thus distributed is the memory error eB accumulated during the time required for a Bell measurement, here consisting of a CNOT followed by X and Z measurements. No gate is both preceded and followed by memory delays, so gate errors are adjusted by at most eB/2, which we assume is already taken into account in the errors given in the previous paragraph. To ensure that eB is sufficiently small requires measurements that are fast compared to memory decoherence times. Systems such as those based on ion traps can achieve this with good qubit memories12,19. Two additional assumptions are used. The first is that there is no error and no speed constraint on classical computations required to interpret measurement outcomes and control future gates. The second is that two-qubit gates can be applied to any pair of qubits without delay or additional error. This assumption is unrealistic, but the effect on the threshold is due primarily to CNOTs acting within the ancillas needed for maintaining one or two blocks encoding logical qubits. To account for this, we can use higher effective EPGs or require low-error quantum communication9,20,21. The above assumptions are standard in analyses of fault-tolerant architectures, but idealized. They are nevertheless believed to be sufficiently realistic that results based on them are meaningful in practice5,22,23,24. The quantum codes The C4/C6 architecture is based on concatenating two quantum stabilizer codes, C4 and C6. The codes are chosen to detect and correct errors with minimum effort. A stabilizer code is a common eigenspace of a set of commuting products of Pauli operators (the \u2018check operators\u2019). Such products are denoted by strings of X, Y, Z and I. For example, XIZ is a Pauli product on three qubits with X acting on the first and Z on the last. C4 has check operators XXXX and ZZZZ. It encodes a \u2018qubit pair\u2019 whose qubits may be labelled L and S, and defined by encoded operators XL = XXII, ZL = ZIZI, XS = IXIX and ZS = IIZZ. C4 is an optimal qubit-based one-error-detecting code. C6 has check operators XIIXXX, XXXIIX, ZIIZZZ and ZZZIIZ, which act on three consecutive qubit pairs. It encodes a qubit pair defined by encoded operators XL = IXXIII, ZL = IIZZIZ, XS = XIXXII, ZS = IIIZZI. C6 is an optimal qubit-pair-based one-error-detecting code. The C4/C6 architecture uses C4 to obtain level-1-encoded qubit pairs. We build subsequent levels by using three encoded qubit pairs to form a next-level C6-encoded qubit pair as shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1: Block structure of C4/C6 concatenated codes. The bottom line shows nine blocks of four physical qubits. Each block encodes a level-1 qubit pair with C4. The encoded qubit pairs are shown in the line above. Formally, each such pair is associated with two syndrome bits, shown below the encoded pair in a lighter shade, which are accessible by syndrome measurements or decoding for error detection and correction. The next level groups three level-1 qubit pairs into a block, encoding a level-2 qubit pair with C6. The pair is associated with four syndrome bits. A level-2 block consists of 12 physical qubits. Three level-2 qubit pairs are used to form a level-3 qubit pair, again with C6 and associated with four syndrome bits. The total number of physical qubits in a level-3 block is 36. In general, a level-l block has 4 \u00d7 3l-1 physical qubits. Full size image Given a joint eigenstate of the check operators, its list of eigenvalues is the \u2018syndrome\u2019. The level-l encoding has check operators that can be derived from the check and encoded operators of C4 and C6. Ideally, the state of a level-l block has syndrome 0 (all eigenvalues are +1). In the presence of errors this is rarely the case, so the encoded qubits' state is defined only with respect to a current \u2018Pauli frame\u2019 and an implicit recovery scheme. The Pauli frame is defined by a Pauli product that restores the error-free state of the block to the syndrome 0 subspace. The implicit recovery scheme determines the Pauli products needed to coherently map states with other syndromes to one with the error-free syndrome. By using the Pauli frame, we can avoid explicitly applying Pauli products for error correction and teleportation compensation9,25. Error detection and correction are based on measurements that retroactively determine the syndrome of the state (the current syndrome has already been affected by further errors). An error is detected if the syndrome is not error-free according to the Pauli frame. In \u2018postselected\u2019 quantum computing, the state is then rejected and the computation restarted. In standard quantum computing, the syndrome information is used to correct errors with a Pauli frame update. To do so, we use the fact that C4 and C6 can detect any error of one qubit and one qubit pair, respectively. If the location of the error is known, it can be corrected. This leads to the following error detection and correction (ED/EC) procedure: first we check the level-1 C4 syndromes of each block of four qubits. For each block where an error is detected, mark the encoded level-1 qubit pair as having an error. Proceed to level 2 and check the (encoded) C6 syndrome for each block of three level-1 pairs. If exactly one of the level-1 pairs has an error, use the C6 syndrome to correct it. If not, mark the encoded level-2 pair as having an error unless none of the three level-1 pairs has an error and the C6 syndrome is error-free according to the Pauli frame. Continue in this fashion through all higher levels. For optimizing state preparation, we can replace the error-correction step by error detection at the top few levels, depending on context, as explained below. Error-correcting teleportation To obtain syndrome information for a block B containing an encoded qubit pair we use error-correcting teleportation. We first prepare two blocks B1 and B2, each encoding a logical qubit pair so that the first pair is maximally entangled with the second, in the logical state (|0000\u3009 + |0101\u3009 + |1010\u3009 + |1111\u3009)/2. B1 and B2 form an \u2018encoded (or logical) Bell pair\u2019. The encoded Bell pair is prepared \u2018fault-tolerantly\u2019, so that each block's errors are essentially as though the physical qubits were subject to independent errors of order \u03b3. The next step is to apply Bell measurements (the first step of conventional quantum teleportation26) to corresponding physical qubits in B and B1. This results in the transfer of B's encoded state to B2, up to a known change in the Pauli frame. It can be shown that the Bell measurement outcomes reveal the eigenvalues of the products of corresponding check operators on B and B1, which is sufficient for inferring the needed syndrome for error detection and correction. Error detection or correction is successful if the combined errors from B and B1 are within the capabilities of the codes. See ref. 16 for further details. Encoded state preparation Fault-tolerant architectures depend on having a plentiful supply of verified, fault-tolerantly prepared encoded states. In the C4/C6 architecture, encoded Bell pairs are fundamental to preparing all other such states. An encoded Bell pair on blocks B1 and B2 is prepared at level l+1 from level-l-encoded Bell pairs in three steps. The first step is to prepare level-l+1-encoded |00\u3009 in block B1 and |++\u3009 in block B2. C4 and C6 have the property that these states are local variants of level-l \u2018cat\u2019 states (states such as (|0\u20260\u3009+|1\u20261\u3009)/\u221a2), which can be obtained and verified by linking level-l Bell pairs. The second step is a \u2018transversal\u2019 CNOT consisting of physical CNOTs applied from qubits of B1 to corresponding qubits of B2. The third step involves error-correcting teleportations of level-l sub-blocks of B1 and B2, which is required to manage errors introduced in the first two steps and limit correlations between B1 and B2. The state preparation networks are shown in Supplementary Information A. Logical Clifford gates for C4 and C6 For simplicity, we treat the qubits in a logical qubit pair identically and ignore one of them for the purpose of computation. Preparation of logical |00\u3009 and |++\u3009 is accomplished by using the first step of the logical Bell pair preparation procedure followed immediately by error-correcting teleportations of the sub-blocks. The codes C4, C6 and their concatenations have the property that logical CNOTs and measurements can be implemented transversally22. This ensures fault tolerance. The HAD gate can be implemented transversally with a permutation of the physical qubits in a block. Permutations can be implemented by relabelling without physical manipulations and are also fault-tolerant. To control error propagation, we include with each logical gate error-correcting teleportations of its blocks. Gmin thresholds For the purpose of establishing high thresholds, we first consider postselected Gmin computing. Postselected computing is a model of computing that abstracts and generalizes the key non-deterministic aspects of techniques such as purification27 and verified state preparation28. Here we use it to prepare states needed for scalable quantum computing without having to specify the state-preparation networks. Postselected computing is like standard quantum computing except that when a gate is applied, the gate may fail. If it fails, this is known. The probability of success must be non-zero. There may be gate errors conditional on success, but fault-tolerant postselected computing requires that such errors are small. We implement fault-tolerant postselected computing with the C4/C6 architecture by aborting the computation whenever an error is detected. Error-correcting teleportation is replaced by error-detecting teleportation, which uses the syndrome information only for error detection. In ref. 23 we used a computer-assisted heuristic analysis to obtain a threshold value of 3%, below which fault-tolerant postselected Gmin computing is possible. Here we use direct simulation of the error behaviour of postselected encoded CNOTs with error-detecting teleportation at up to two levels of encoding and physical EPGs of 1% \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 3.75%. The simulation method is explained in Supplementary Information B. The simulated conditional logical errors are shown in Fig. 2 and suggest a threshold of above 6% by extrapolation. Figure 2: Conditional logical errors with postselection. The plot shows logical CNOT errors conditional on not detecting errors as a function of EPG parameter \u03b3 at levels 0, 1 and 2. The logical CNOT is implemented with transversal physical CNOTs and two error-detecting teleportations, where the output state is accepted only if no errors are detected in the teleportations. The data show the incremental error attributable to the logical CNOT in the context of a longer computation (Supplementary Information B). The error bars are 68% confidence intervals. The solid lines are obtained by gradient-descent likelihood maximization. Extrapolations are shown with dashed lines and suggest that logical EPG improvements with increasing levels are possible above \u03b3 = 6%. Other operations' errors for \u03b3 = 3% and level 2 are shown in the inset table. The decoding error is the incremental error introduced by decoding a block into two physical qubits. The injection error is the error in a logical state that we prepare by decoding one block of a logical Bell pair and measuring the decoded qubits. Decoding and injection errors were found to decrease from level 1 (decoding error 4.4 \u00b1 0.40.4 \u00d7 10-2, injection error 5.5 \u00b1 0.40.5 \u00d7 10-2) to level 2. Full size image Scalable Gmin computing with the C4/C6 architecture requires lower EPGs and the use of error correction to increase the probability of success to near 1. To optimize the resource requirements needed to achieve a given logical EPG, the last level at which error correction is used in the ED/EC procedure is dl levels below the relevant top level, where dl depends on context and \u03b3. At higher levels, errors are only detected. For simplicity and to enable extrapolation by modelling, we examined a fixed strategy with dl = 1 in all state-preparation contexts and dl = 0 (maximum error correction) in the context of logical computation. The relevant top level in a state preparation context is the level of a block measurement or error-correcting teleportation of a sub-block, not the logical level of the state that is eventually prepared. Each logical gate now has a probability of detected but uncorrectable error, and a probability of logical error conditional on not having detected an error. Figure 3 shows both error probabilities up to level 4 for a logical CNOT with error-correcting teleportation and EPGs of \u03b3 \u2264 1%. The data indicate that the Gmin threshold for this architecture is above 1%. Figure 3: Conditional and detected logical errors with error correction. The plot shows incremental detected and conditional logical errors for a logical CNOT as a function of EPG parameter \u03b3 up to level 4. Error bars and lines are as described in the caption of Fig. 2. The combination of error correction and detection is as required for the error-correcting C4/C6 architecture. a, The logical CNOT's error conditional on not detecting an uncorrectable error. b, The probability of detecting an uncorrectable error. At \u03b3 = 1%, the detected errors are 2.4 \u00b1 0.00.0 \u00d7 10-2 (level 3) and 2.4 \u00b1 0.71.0 \u00d7 10-3 (level 4). The conditional errors are 6.4 \u00b1 0.60.6 \u00d7 10-4 (level 3) and 0.0 \u00b1 0.04.4 \u00d7 10-4 (level 4). For comparison, the preparation errors at levels 3 and 4, respectively were found to be 2.1 \u00b1 0.30.3 \u00d7 10-4 and 0.0 \u00b1 0.01.0 \u00d7 10-4 (detected errors) and 3.3 \u00b1 2.77.5 \u00d7 10-6 and 0.0 \u00b1 0.01.0 \u00d7 10-4 (conditional errors). The measurement errors are 4.7 \u00b1 0.40.4 \u00d7 10-4 and 5.6 \u00b1 4.612.8 \u00d7 10-5 (detected errors) and 3.3 \u00b1 2.77.4 \u00d7 10-6 and 0.0 \u00b1 0.01.0 \u00d7 10-4 (conditional errors). Finally, the HAD errors at level 3 are 1.3 \u00b1 0.00.0 \u00d7 10-2 (detected error) and 3.5 \u00b1 0.50.6 \u00d7 10-4 (conditional error). Full size image Universal computation To complete the 1Gmin gate set so that we can implement arbitrary quantum computations, it suffices to add HAD and preparation of the state |\u03c0/8\u3009 = cos(\u03c0/8)|0\u3009+ sin(\u03c0/8)|1\u300929,30 in both qubits of a logical pair. The logical errors of HAD are less than those of the logical CNOT. To prepare logical |\u03c0/8\u3009|\u03c0/8\u3009 in a qubit pair, we obtain a logical Bell pair, decode its first block into two physical qubits and make measurements to project the physical qubits' states onto |\u03c0/8\u3009 or the orthogonal state. If an orthogonal state is obtained, we adjust the Pauli frame by Y operators accordingly. Because of the entanglement between the physical qubits and the logical ones, this prepares the desired logical state, albeit with error. This procedure is \u2018state injection\u2019. To decode the first block of the Bell pair, we first decode the C4 sub-blocks and continue by decoding six-qubit sub-blocks of C6. Syndrome information is obtained in each step and can be used for error detection or correction. The error in decoding is expected to be dominated by the last decoding steps. Consequently, the error in the injected state should be bounded as the number of levels increase, which we verified by simulation. To remove errors from the injected states, logical purification can be used30,31 and is effective if the error of the injected state is less than 0.141 (ref. 31). The purification method can be implemented fault-tolerantly to ensure that the purified logical |\u03c0/8\u3009 states have errors similar to those of logical CNOTs (Supplementary Information C). Consider the threshold for fault-tolerant postselected universal quantum computing. The logical HAD and injection errors at \u03b3 = 3% and level 2 are shown in Fig. 2. The injection error is well below the maximum allowed and is not expected to increase substantially for higher levels. The injection error should scale approximately linearly with EPG, so the extrapolated threshold above 6% may apply. The injection and purification method for preparing states needed to complete the gate set works with the error-correcting C4/C6 architecture. Consider state injection at \u03b3 = 1%. The context for injection is state preparation, which determines the combination of error correction and detection as discussed above. The conditional logical error after state injection was determined to be 8.6 \u00b1 0.50.6 \u00d7 10-3 at level 3 and 1.1 \u00b1 0.10.1 \u00d7 10-2 at level 4, comparable to \u03b3 and sufficiently low for |\u03c0/8\u3009 purification. As a result, the C4/C6 architecture enables scalable quantum computing at EPGs above 1%. To obtain higher thresholds, we use fault-tolerant postselected computing to prepare states in a code that can handle higher EPGs than C4/C6 concatenated codes can. The states are chosen so that we can implement a universal set of gates by error-correcting teleportation. Suppose that arbitrarily low logical EPGs are achievable with the C4/C6 architecture for postselected computing. To compute scalably, we choose a sufficiently high level l for the C4/C6 architecture and a very good error-correcting quantum code Ce. The first step is to prepare the desired Ce-encoded states using level-l-encoded qubits, in essence concatenating Ce onto level l of the C4/C6 architecture. Suppose that the conditional error in the logical state prepared can be made arbitrarily small. The second step is to decode each block of the C4/C6 architecture to physical qubits to obtain unconcatenated Ce-logical states (partial decoding). Once these states are successfully prepared, we use them to implement each logical gate by error-correcting teleportation. Simulations show that the postselected decoding introduces an error \u2272\u03b3 for each decoded qubit (Fig. 2). There is no postselection in error-correcting teleportation with Ce, and it is sensitive to decoding error in two blocks (\u223c2\u03b3) as well as the error of the CNOT (\u223c\u03b3) and the two physical measurements (\u223c8\u03b3/15) required for the Bell measurement. Hence, the effective error per qubit that needs to be corrected is \u223c3.53\u03b3. The maximum error probability per qubit correctable by known codes Ce is \u223c0.19 (ref. 32). Thus, if \u03b3\u22725% (conservatively below 0.19/3.53) the Ce architecture can have small logical errors, say below 10-3. Scalable quantum computing is then possible by using Ce-encoded qubits as the founding qubits for the error-correcting C4/C6 architecture (for example). Because 5% is below the extrapolated threshold for the postselected C4/C6 architecture, scalable quantum computing may be possible with our architecture at EPGs as high as 5% (or at least 3% without extrapolation). Although the postselection overheads are extreme, the above architecture is theoretically efficient: the asymptotic overheads for implementing a quantum computation are polynomial in terms of the computation's size. Resources The resource requirements for the error-correcting C4/C6 architecture can be mapped out as a function of \u03b3 for different sizes of computations. We do not have analytical expressions for the resources for logical Bell pair preparation or for the logical errors as a function of \u03b3 and, with our current capabilities, we are not able to determine them in enough detail by simulation. We therefore use naive models to approximate the expressions needed. The number of physical CNOTs used in a logical Bell-pair preparation is modelled by functions of the form C/(1 - \u03b3)k , which would be correct on average if the state-preparation network had C gates of which k failed independently with probability \u03b3, and the network was repeatedly applied until none of the k gates failed. C and k depend on the level of concatenation. The logical error probabilities are modelled at level l \u2265 1 by pd(l) = d(l)\u03b3f(l+1) (detected error) and pc(l) = c(l)\u03b3f(l+2) (conditional logical error), where f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(l + 1) = f(l) + f(l - 1) is the Fibonacci sequence. These expressions are asymptotically correct as \u03b3 \u2192 0. We verified that they model the desired values well and determined the constants at low levels by simulation and at high levels by extrapolation (Supplementary Information C). Figure 4 shows the resource requirements as a function of computation size. Following the instructions in the caption, we obtain the following order-of-magnitude estimates: at an EPG of 1%, a computation with 103 or 105 gates and (say) 100 or more qubits requires 6 \u00d7 1012 or 2 \u00d7 1017 physical CNOTs, respectively. A more precise calculation shows that 1.2 \u00d7 1014 physical CNOTs are required for 1,000 logical |\u03c0/8\u3009 preparations (Supplementary Information C). Given current capabilities, the outputs of these computations are not predictable with classical algorithms. The quantum resource requirements are large and at present difficult to realize. However, comparable complexity is achieved in today's classical computers: central processing units have 108 or more transistors operating at rates of 109 steps per second33, making available up to 1017 bit operations per second. Figure 4: Estimating C4/C6 resource requirements. The figure shows the number NCNOT of physical CNOTs required per qubit and gate to implement computations of sizes G = 103, 105, \u2026, 1034 (curves with G indicated). Other resources are dominated by NCNOT. An order-of-magnitude estimate of the total number of physical CNOTs required by a computation can be made as follows: we determine the number G of gates required, including \u2018memory\u2019 gates. Using the corresponding curve in the figure, we find NCNOT at the physical EPG. We then multiply NCNOT by G and the average number of additional logical CNOTs per gate required for fault-tolerantly preparing and purifying states such as logical |\u03c0/8\u3009. A conservative estimate for the latter number is 300. With maximum parallelism, the \u2018scale-up\u2019 (number of physical qubits per logical qubit) is of the same order as NCNOT. If the memory error is not too large, this can be reduced to about 2(1 + 2(l - 1))3l-1 with moderate parallelism. The circled numbers are at the points on each curve above which the indicated level of concatenation must be used. Levels increment at each step-like feature of the curves. Full size image The resource requirements decrease rapidly with lower EPGs. At EPGs well below 10-3, an architecture based on unconcatenated block codes such as that of Steane9 is expected to be more efficient. Indeed, at an EPG of 10-4, such architectures use one to two orders of magnitude fewer resources. The C4/C6 architecture still has the advantage of simplicity, and of yielding more reliable answers conditional on having no detected errors. Discussion An important use of studies of fault-tolerant architectures is to provide guidelines for EPGs that should be achieved to meet the low-error criterion for scalability. Such guidelines depend on the details of the relevant error models and constraints on two-qubit gates. Nevertheless, the value of \u03b3 = 10-4 has often been cited as the EPG to be achieved. With architectures such as that of Steane9,34 and the one introduced here, resource requirements at \u03b3 = 10-3 are now comparable to what they were for \u03b3 = 10-4 at the time this value was starting to be cited22. Several open problems arise from the work presented here. Can the high thresholds evidenced by our simulations be mathematically proved? Are thresholds for postselected computing strictly higher than thresholds for scalable standard quantum computing? Recent work by Reichardt34 shows that Steane's architecture can be made more efficient by the judicious use of error detection, improving Steane's threshold estimates to around 10-2. How do the available fault-tolerant architectures compare for EPGs between 10-3 and 10-2? It would be helpful to improve significantly the resource requirements of fault-tolerant architectures, particularly at high EPGs. References Shor, P. W.

One problem with large-scale quantum computing is the difficulty of improving the accuracy of the quantum devices that will be needed. Encouragingly, new work suggests that existing experimental devices are, in principle, sufficiently accurate. This optimism is based on the properties of a new \u2018architecture\u2019 for the implementation of large quantum computers that can handle fault-tolerant quantum computing. There is a downside: coping with \u2018inaccurate\u2019 devices in this way requires huge resources, resulting in unfeasibly complex systems \u2014 though that might not be the end of the story if the availability of quantum resources becomes comparable to today's digital resources. show all Nature (Nature) ISSN 1476-4687 (online) ISSN 0028-0836 (print) About Nature Portfolio About us Press releases Press office Contact us Discover content Journals A-Z Articles by subject Protocol Exchange Nature Index Publishing policies Nature portfolio policies Open access Author & Researcher services Reprints & permissions Research data Language editing Scientific editing Nature Masterclasses Research Solutions Libraries & institutions Librarian service & tools Librarian portal Open research Recommend to library Advertising & partnerships Advertising Partnerships & Services Media kits Branded content Professional development Nature Careers Nature Conferences Regional websites Nature Africa Nature China Nature India Nature Italy Nature Japan Nature Korea Nature Middle East Privacy Policy Use of cookies Your privacy choices/Manage cookies Legal notice Accessibility statement Terms & Conditions Your US state privacy rights \u00a9 2024 Springer Nature Limited",

Although many approximation methods have been introduced, the complexity of quantum mechanics remains hard to appease. The advent of quantum computation brings new pathways to navigate this challenging and complex landscape. By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry, such as the electronic structure of molecules. In the past two decades, significant advances have been made in developing algorithms and physical hardware for quantum computing, heralding a revolution in simulation of quantum systems. This Review provides an overview of the algorithms and results that are relevant for quantum chemistry. The intended audience is both quantum chemists who seek to learn more about quantum computing and quantum computing researchers who would like to explore applications in quantum chemistry.

Introduction and Historical Overview ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Since the advent of electronic computers in the past century, computation has played a fundamental role in the development of chemistry. Numerical methods for computing the static and dynamic properties of chemicals have revolutionized chemistry as a discipline. With the recent emergence of quantum computing, there is potential for a similarly disruptive progress. This Review provides a comprehensive picture of the current landscape of quantum computation for chemistry to help establish a perspective for future progress. Where can quantum computers help chemistry? As our understanding of quantum computers continues to mature, so too will the development of new methods and techniques which can benefit chemistry. For now, at least, we are confident that quantum computers can aid those quantum chemistry computations that require an explicit representation of the wave function, either because of a high accuracy requirement of simulated properties or because of a high degree of entanglement in the system. In these cases, the exponential growth of the dimension of the wave function makes manipulation and storage very inefficient on a classical computer. Indeed, for even moderately large systems, it is already intractable to explicitly maintain the full wave function. As both the quantum hardware and software communities continue to make rapid progress, the immediate role of quantum computing for quantum chemistry becomes clearer. While it seems that there will be no shortage in the demand for new classical methods, the replacement of specific classical subroutines with quantum computations can improve the accuracy and tractability of chemical predictions. This also brings up a new challenge: advancing quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry requires the synergy of quantum information theory and classical quantum chemistry techniques. While these two areas are closely related, they have evolved following different disciplines\u2014the former from physics and computer science, and the latter from chemistry. In this Review, our aim is to be pedagogical to scientists from each background in order to bridge this gap and stimulate new developments. We will describe how quantum computing methods can be used to replace or augment classical quantum chemistry methods and survey an array of state-of-the-art quantum computing techniques that may, one day, become as common-place as density functional theory. Quantum computers are quantum systems which can be initialized, sufficiently controlled, and measured, in order to perform a computational task. (1) There are many candidate physical realizations of quantum computers. (2) Promising proposals include ion traps, (3\u22127) superconducting architectures, (8\u221212) quantum optics, (13\u221216) nitrogen vacancy centers, (17\u221219) nuclear magnetic resonance, (20\u221222) topological qubits, (23,24) neutral atoms (25\u221229) and quantum dots. (30\u221233) As will be done in this Review, it is convenient to abstract the description of the computation away from the particular physical implementation. However, for a concrete example in the case of ion trap quantum computing, one approach is to use trapped Ca+ ions as qubits. (34) The quantum computation consists of trapping the ions in an array, altering the valence-electron collective quantum state of the ions with a series of precise laser pulses, and measuring the occupation of two Zeeman states of the s and d orbital manifolds in each ion. Instead of referring to the energy levels of trapped ions, we refer to the parts of an abstract quantum computer, namely, interactions between two-level quantum systems called quantum bits or qubits. Instead of laser pulses, the operations on an abstract quantum computer are unitary transformations. After a sequence of unitary transformations, each qubit is measured, returning a binary outcome which is labeled \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d. A classical computation process can be broken down into elementary logical operations, such as AND, on a few bits at a time. Similarly, controlled local unitary operations, called quantum gates, can be used as elementary operations to be applied on quantum bits. The novelty of quantum computing is derived from processes which \u201centangle\u201d the qubits. Just as atomic orbitals fail to appropriately describe molecular electronic wave functions, entangled qubits cannot be independently assigned definite quantum states. In designing a sequence of quantum gates (called a quantum circuit) to output the solution to a problem, entangling quantum gates can afford shortcuts. A process for constructing a quantum circuit designed to solve a particular problem is called a quantum algorithm. Just like a classical algorithm, the performance of a quantum algorithm is characterized by the number of elementary operations and the run time as a function of the problem instance size (e.g., the number of basis set functions used in the calculation). A number of quantum algorithms have been invented which stand to outperform their classical counterparts. (35\u221239) With regard to chemistry, these include algorithms for estimating the ground-state energies of molecular Hamiltonians (40\u221242) and computing thermal rate constants. (43) Existing quantum computers have yet to solve instances of problems which are intractable for classical computers. However, the pace of progress bears promise for achieving this feat (11,13,44,45) and is certain to drive the discovery of new useful quantum algorithms. The idea of quantum computing originated in the 1980s, when Manin (46) and Feynman (47) independently described a vision for using quantum mechanical systems to perform computation. Both argued that simulating quantum mechanics on classical computers requires resources growing exponentially in the problem instance size, so that certain problems will remain out of reach, regardless of the ingenuity of the algorithm designers. It is not true that all quantum mechanical systems are difficult to simulate; some of them have easily computable exact solutions, and others have very clever computational shortcuts that lead to approximate solutions. However, simulation of a general quantum mechanical system has proven to be difficult. A quantum computer, as envisioned by Feynman and Manin, can potentially circumvent the roadblock of exponential cost by being quantum mechanical itself. During the same decade, there were also developments of abstract models of quantum mechanical computation by Benioff (48) and Deutsch, (49) raising the still-open question of \u201cwhat are the problems for which quantum computers can have a speed-up over the best-known classical algorithms?\u201d Motivated by this question, researchers in the 1990s developed several quantum algorithms of major importance. (35\u221240,50) These algorithms not only solve their respective problems with a provable speed-up over the best known classical counterparts but also provide meaningful frameworks for developing subsequent quantum algorithms. We refer the reader to the review by Childs and van Dam (51) for a comprehensive treatment of the algorithm developments prior to 2011. This Review will focus on the subset of quantum algorithms for solving problems in chemistry. In 1996, Feynman\u2019s vision was manifested in a theoretical proposal by Lloyd, (50) providing a concrete method for using quantum computers to efficiently simulate the dynamics of other quantum systems. Around the same time, Wiesner (52) and Zalka (53) also suggested using quantum computers for simulating the dynamics of many-body systems. The general set of techniques for using a quantum computer to simulate another quantum system falls under the name of Hamiltonian simulation. Broadly speaking, for a given Hamiltonian H, Hamiltonian simulation is an efficient and accurate implementation of e\u2013iHt using elementary operations that can be executed on a quantum computer. Since these early works in the 1990s, Hamiltonian simulation has grown to be an important subfield of quantum computing, offering many valuable insights toward the development of further quantum algorithms. As a prominent example, the ability to efficiently perform Hamiltonian simulation is used in conjunction with another technique known as the quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPEA) (54) for efficiently obtaining the eigenenergies and eigenstates of a quantum system. (40) The first quantum algorithms suited particularly for quantum chemistry appeared as early as the late 1990s. These include, for instance, simulating fermionic Hamiltonians (55) and the quantum algorithm for calculating thermal rate constant efficiently. (43) The opening decade of the 21st century witnessed the first quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry built on the insights of QPEA, for example, the quantum algorithms developed for computing molecular spectra with exponential speed-up over classical computers. (41,42) The basic idea of this work is to use Hamiltonian simulation techniques to efficiently simulate the dynamics of a quantum molecular Hamiltonian and apply QPEA to extract the eigenenergies. Since these initial contributions, a flurry of results have appeared in the literature which address quantum chemistry problems of various forms. The quantum computational cost of these algorithms has continued to be reduced. (56\u221259) However, practical implementation of these algorithms is widely believed to be decades away because they require scalable, error-corrected quantum computers. This perspective has driven researchers to ask, \u201cWhat are the problems we can address with near-term quantum computers of moderate size and without error correction?\u201d Such devices are increasingly referred to as noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. (60) This question has led to the new paradigm of variational quantum algorithms (described in sections 5.1 and 5.2). The approach has attracted substantial attention (61\u221269) from both the theoretical (62,63,66) and experimental communities (61,64,65,67\u221269) in quantum computing. In short, variational quantum algorithms utilize a hybrid approach involving a quantum computer and a classical computer working in tandem. Unlike the algorithms based on QPEA, which require the quantum computer to perform a long sequence of operations, in the variational quantum algorithm framework the quantum computer only needs to perform a short sequence of operations. In this way, the shortcomings of present-day hardware are partly circumvented. With variational quantum algorithms, each operation has parameters which can be set by the classical computer. Hence the quantum computer can be regarded as a machine which produces states |\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9 lying on a manifold determined by the classical parameters \u03b8\u20d7. The machine then measures these states in the computational basis. This is useful, for instance, for the estimation of the ground-state energy of some Hamiltonian H. (61) For each state, we measure the expectation \u27e8\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)|H|\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9 with respect to the Hamiltonian H. We then use the classical computer to tune \u03b8\u20d7 to minimize this energy expectation. By off-loading a portion of the computation to a classical computer, a variational quantum algorithm is a far more practical alternative to its QPEA-based counterparts. A diverse set of experimental groups worldwide have already implemented various variational quantum algorithms on their physical systems. (61,64,65,67,68,70\u221272) The quantum algorithms discussed so far fall within the standard gate model of quantum computing, meaning they can always be described by a sequence of quantum gates which manipulate the quantum state of a register of qubits. In parallel to the developments in the gate model, there are other models of quantum computation that are also relevant for chemistry applications. Two important models are adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) and the Boson sampling model. The basic principle underlying AQC is the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics. (73) Suppose we initialize a quantum system as the ground state of some Hamiltonian H0 and slowly evolve the Hamiltonian to some other Hamiltonian H1 via a linear interpolation H(s) = (1 \u2013 s)H0 + sH1, s \u2208 [0,1]. Assuming there is always a gap between the ground state of H(s) and the first excited state, the end of the adiabatic evolution of the state of the system should be close to the ground state of H1. The approach of AQC is to initialize a quantum system according to some Hamiltonian H0 whose ground state is easy to prepare and verify, and choose H1 such that preparing its ground state is equivalent to solving a hard computational problem. Extensive efforts have been made in developing AQC, and progress in the field has also been thoroughly reviewed in the literature. (74) The AQC model has been shown to be computationally equivalent to the gate model, (75) meaning that algorithms written in either model can be translated to ones in the other model without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. In contrast, the Boson sampling model of computation does not have this property. (76) However, it does give rise to a class of sampling problems (77) which are hard to solve on a classical computer. This model is discussed in more detail in section 3.3 Apart from quantum computation, another related intersection between computer science and quantum physics, which has become relevant to quantum chemistry, is quantum computational complexity theory. Well-known problems in quantum chemistry have been characterized in terms of their quantum computational complexity by taking advantage of the rigorous machinery developed in theoretical computer science for determining the worst-case hardness of a computational problem. Examples include finding the universal functional in density functional theory, (78) finding the globally optimized Hartree\u2013Fock wave function, (78) solving the N-representability problem, (79) and calculating the density of states of quantum systems. (80) These characterizations, discussed in section 3, provide further motivation for the development of quantum algorithms targeted at solving them. A comprehensive review (81) of relevant results has been presented in the literature, which can be a useful resource for interested readers. The remainder of the Review is organized as follows. We have provided a dependency graph of the sections and subsections in Figure 1. In section 2 we outline several important computational roadblocks in quantum chemistry, describe state-of-the-art classical methods which grapple with these issues, and then introduce quantum algorithms which may resolve them. In section 3 we assess the computational hardness of classical and quantum algorithms for chemistry from the perspective of computational complexity. Section 4 provides a more detailed description of the state-of-the-art quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Section 5 describes the approaches that are suitable for calculations on present-day quantum hardware. We conclude with a summary and outlook in section 6. In Appendix C, we give a hands-on demonstration of how to calculate a dissociation curve of H2 with a quantum algorithm. Due to the vast amount of notations, symbols, and nomenclatures introduced throughout this Review, we provide a glossary organized by section (including the Appendices) for terminologies used inside each respective section. Figure 1 Figure 1. Graphical illustration of the dependency between the subsections of this Review. Each dashed box corresponds to a section, and each node on the graph corresponds to a subsection. In general the materials are organized in a tree structure, with more details being covered in later sections. We broadly divide the subjects into computational complexity (section 3) and algorithmic techniques (sections 4 and 5). In particular, the sections on algorithms are further divided into methods suited for fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQC), as covered in section 4, and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, (60) covered in section 5. 2. Quantum Chemistry in the Age of Quantum Computing ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To A fundamental goal of quantum chemistry is to solve the time-independent, non-relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation for molecular systems, (1) where \u0124mol is the molecular Hamiltonian, \u03c8(r\u20d7, t) is the multi-particle wave function of the system, and E is the energy eigenvalue. In atomic units, the molecular Hamiltonian is given by (2) where R\u20d7i, Mi, and Zi indicate the spatial coordinates, masses, and charges of the nuclei in the molecule and r\u20d7i are the electronic coordinates. However, an exact solution quickly becomes intractable due to the exponential growth of the size of the wave function with the particle number. (82) This has inspired formulations of various physically motivated wave function approximations as well as quantum chemistry algorithms on classical computers. This section starts with a look at challenges as such and discusses how classical computers may fall short in addressing some of the challenges while quantum computers are able to circumvent the limitations. The dependency among the subsections is shown in Figure 1. In order to facilitate the discussion, we partition the problem space into static and dynamic problems. Static problems are associated with computing the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, most notably the ground state. 2.1. Basics and Challenges of Classical Quantum Chemistry As an approach to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is comprised of a coupled set of differential equations, the most common strategy is to introduce a complete set of independent functions, a basis set, to describe the physical wave function of the system. Although this does not resolve the exponential increase of parameters with system size, it allows the balancing of computational resources with accuracy. The full molecular Hamiltonian consists of terms associated with electrons and nuclei as well as the interactions between them. Because the mass of a nucleus is 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of an electron, a common simplifying assumption made in quantum chemistry calculations, called the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation (BOA), treats the nuclei as stationary point charges. The problem is then transformed such that it only involves electrons moving in a stationary potential due to the nuclei. The molecular Hamiltonian is split up into a nuclear part and an electronic part: (3) The wave function equally can be separated into a nuclear part and an electronic part: (4) such that for every nuclear configuration R\u20d7, a separate electronic eigenvalue problem, (5) needs to be solved. When the BOA is valid, the Hamiltonian of interest to quantum chemistry is (6) The electronic degrees of freedom influence the nuclear motion through the appearance of the energy in the nuclear eigenvalue equation: (7) where E is now the full molecular energy as in eq 1. Although in recent times there has been significant effort to treat chemistry calculations without the BOA, (83\u221286) in this Review we focus on treating quantum chemistry problems within this regime. However, we note that though most of the applications are for cases within the BOA, some of the previous formalisms have been combined with phase estimation to treat non-BOA cases. (87) Quantum simulation in first quantization can be readily applied to non-BOA instances as well. (88,89) For systems of electrons, one common methodology to avoid treating the size of the full many-electron wave function is density functional theory (DFT). (90,91) All degrees of freedom of the electronic system are integrated out, except for the density. However, the quality of DFT depends on the chosen exchange-correlation functional. There have been several efforts to improve DFT functionals systematically (e.g., GGA, meta-GGA, hybrid approaches), but there is no uniform answer on which functional to use for which chemical systems. At the same time, these more involved approaches negate some of the more attractive characteristics of regular DFT. Most functionals tend to give reasonable results around equilibrium geometries but behave unpredictably in the regime of strong correlations or in the presence of dispersive electron interactions, e.g., bond breaking or solvation chemistry. Another way to avoid an exponential parameter scaling is by reducing the electron Hamiltonian to its self-consistent field (SCF) part. This approximates the system as being comprised of electrons experiencing a mean field potential, which has to be determined self-consistently. As a first step, an initial guess is made for the single-electron orbitals, most frequently the atomic orbitals. After this, the influence of all electrons is averaged into the mean-field potential, and new orbitals are generated from it until convergence is reached. The ground-state wave function is described using a single Slater determinant or configuration. Correlation effects are thereby completely neglected, meaning computational approximations for various physical quantities are usually of low quality. Nevertheless, the SCF wave function is often used as a starting point to construct a more sophisticated wave function ansatz. The exact solution to eq 1 for an electronic system described with a fixed set of basis set functions consists of a variationally determined superposition of all determinants in the N-particle Fock space, also known as a full configuration interaction (FCI) expansion. Such a wave function cannot be efficiently manipulated and stored on a classical computer. Correspondingly, quantum chemistry methods based on a wave function approach comprise a hierarchy of models ranging from the single-determinant SCF description to FCI. Each model assumes a specific type of wave function parametrization in addition to other approximations, offering different compromises between accuracy and computational cost. Some of the most promising wave functions methods employed in quantum chemistry are described in the next section. 2.2. Classical Methods: Approximation Techniques and Their Limitations Quantum computation proposes methods which may overcome the challenges of quantum chemistry described in the previous subsection. These algorithms are reviewed in section 3.2 However, we emphasize that there are various methods and techniques in quantum chemistry applied using classical computers that address said challenges. In this section, we review some representative techniques and motivate the development of quantum algorithms. 2.2.1. Static Properties: Wave Functions and Energy Spectra Coupled Cluster Theory Coupled cluster (92) is formulated as a compact wave function parametrization in terms of an exponential functional of a cluster operator. The algorithm leverages several approximations to be tractable on a classical computer. Most codes utilize the similarity transformation formulation with the cluster operator as a pure excitation operator, taking advantage of the termination of the Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Haussdorf series. This makes the problem non-Hermitian and requires a projection onto a small subspace to solve the cluster amplitudes, introducing a further approximation. Although this formulation of coupled cluster is still exact in the limit of an N-body excitation operator, in practice, excitation operators are truncated. Such approximations are not guaranteed to behave well. The breakdown of coupled cluster with only single and double excitations for molecules in dissociation (93) is well-documented. This behavior can be generalized to any level of truncation of the excitation operator when strong correlation is exhibited by the Hamiltonian. (94) There are several approaches (95,96) that improve upon this framework by approximating higher order cluster operators or including static correlation effects, but development of a generally applicable method is still an active field of research. While coupled cluster theory is a promising method for quantum chemistry, its non-Hermitian formulation makes the obtained energy non-variational. Variationally optimized coupled cluster (97) overcomes this problem but can only be applied to small systems (98\u2212100) or models with a reduced parameter space (101) on a classical computer. The introduction of a complex conjugate excitation operator implies contractions between the operators in the bra and the ket. The transformed Hamiltonian is a full N-body operator with the number of terms scaling factorially as N!. The problem becomes more challenging when the operators in the exponential are not pure excitation operators. In this case the expectation values that need to be calculated feature contraction among the cluster operators and there are an infinite number of terms. Unitary coupled cluster (102) (in which the excitation and de-excitation operators are combined into a unitary cluster operator) and generalized coupled cluster (103) (in which the cluster operator lacks a specific substructure) fall in this category. We note that, on a quantum computer, physical operations on qubits are often realized in terms of unitary operators. If the cluster operator can be represented as a low-depth quantum circuit, it is efficient to prepare a unitary coupled cluster wave function. This method of state preparation together with a classical optimizer (see section 5.1) enables unitary coupled cluster for general Hamiltonians. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) The idea of efficiently sampling a distribution of states has a counterpart on classical computers in QMC. It has been very successful in performing large-scale calculations for extended systems in quantum chemistry. QMC relies on the stochastic estimation of the energy of a trial wave function: (8) In the real-space variational Monte Carlo formulation, the position vectors are randomly generated according to the Metropolis algorithm from the norm of the trial wave function. After sufficient convergence in the energy with respect to the number of Monte Carlo samples, the wave function parameters can be updated. This process is repeated until a desired accuracy has been met. More accurate QMC methods have been developed, in which more elaborate distributions are sampled. Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) uses a population of walkers to stochastically sample the position space. The composition of the population is algorithmically controlled from generation to generation. This process depends on the knowledge of the nodes of the exact wave function. A popular implementation of DMC fixes the nodes of the trial wave function (fixed-node DMC), which biases the population but is shown to be more robust and provides accurate results. Another possibility is to sample the manifold of electronic configurations. The auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) is performed as an imaginary-time evolution of the transformed Hamiltonian in terms of the auxiliary fields. A sign problem occurs in both DMC and AFQMC but is mitigated by defining phase constraints on the auxiliary fields from a trial wave function. There is a natural connection between the underlying principles of Monte Carlo algorithms and the representation of a state on a quantum computer. Measurement outcomes from the output of a quantum circuit are probabilistic, and several algorithms have been proposed for Monte Carlo integration on a quantum computer that outperform their classical counterparts. (104) There are certain drawbacks to the approximations in classical QMC. The most notorious one is the sign problem that plagues most fermionic implementations. The nature of fermions makes accurately estimating quantities using the wave function a difficult task. It has been shown that quantum computers avoid the dynamical sign problem, (55) providing a more effective alternative to classical methods for quantum simulation. Exact Diagonalization (ED) The ED methods (92,105,106) provide the exact answer for the wave function and energy within a certain basis set (i.e., the FCI answer). While QMC arrives at this answer through extrapolation, ED achieves it in a single calculation by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix without stochastic error bars. This comes at the cost of storing the coefficients of all (relevant) determinants, which becomes prohibitive even for medium-sized molecules. (107,108) The rapid increase in computing power and the development of libraries that take advantage of distributed computing clusters have meant a steady increase in the feasible number of determinants. (109\u2212111) Despite all these advances, FCI is still the most useful as a benchmarking method for less-costly quantum chemical methods. Exact simulation of quantum chemistry systems is widely regarded as one of the problems that would benefit enormously from quantum hardware. (47) The QPEA (40,112) is the natural translation of the FCI procedure to quantum computers. (41) Tensor Network Methods Compared to the classical methods discussed so far, entanglement-based tensor product methods, (113) which have been applied to study strongly correlated many-body physics and quantum chemistry, are closer to the formulation of gate-model quantum computation. In the case of strongly correlated (multi-reference) systems where the concept of a single dominating configuration breaks down, traditional single-reference electronic structure methods are usually not applicable. In contrast, tensor product methods (113) have proved to be efficient and accurate as multi-reference computational methods. The most commonly used entanglement-based tensor product method so far is the quantum chemistry implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. (113\u2212122) Specifically, DMRG variationally optimizes a wave function in the form of a matrix product state (MPS), (123) (9) which is a one-dimensional chain of tensors. In the quantum chemistry setting, \u03b1i represents the local Hilbert space of a single (ith) molecular orbital (MO), i.e., \u03b1i \u2208 {|0\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9, |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u2191\u27e9}. The DMRG computational complexity is governed by the size of the MPS matrices (A\u03b1i), formally characterizing the entanglement between different MOs. MPSs allow for a compact representation of one-dimensional systems and also satisfy an area law (124) in one dimension. This has led to the application of DMRG to describe ground states of one-dimensional gapped local Hamiltonians. However, the long-range Coulomb interaction in molecules causes the entanglement among the MOs to be multi-dimensional as opposed to one-dimensional. As a result, larger dimension MPS matrices (or \u201chigh bond dimension\u201d MPS) have to be employed in the case of generic (non-one-dimensional) molecules in order to properly capture correlations among MOs. These problems can be alleviated to some extent by optimizing the orbital ordering along a one-dimensional lattice (125,126) as well as by basis optimization. (127) However, these problems pose a practical limit on the applicability of tensor network states (TNSs) for quantum chemistry. DMRG applied to quantum chemistry can generally handle large active spaces (\u223c50 MOs (128)); it handles much larger active spaces than conventional active-space methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF). (129) In certain cases it can reach the exact FCI limit. (128,130) In the case of linear (or quasi-linear) molecular systems, active spaces of hundreds of MOs are reachable. (131) However, DMRG wave functions at a low bond dimension miss a sizable amount of the dynamic correlation that is important in quantum chemistry. In order to account for the missing dynamic correlation not included in the active space, several post-DMRG methods have been developed. (132\u2212140) TNSs (141) represent a generalization of MPS aimed at an improved representation of multi-dimensional entanglement. TNSs include, e.g., the projected entangled pair states, (142) tree tensor network states (TTNSs), (143\u2212147) multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz, (148) and complete-graph TNS. (149,150) A new TTNS variant was recently presented, the three-legged TTNS, which combines the tree-like network topology and branching tensors without physical indices. (147) It is especially appealing due to its low computational cost and network topology capable of taking into consideration the underlying entanglement of generic molecules more efficiently. The FCI wave function expansion coefficients can be converted into the MPS form by successive applications of the singular value decomposition. (123,151) In the case of the TTNS ansatz, which is the most general TNS without any loops, higher-order singular value decomposition is employed. Factorization of the FCI wave function into the MPS form itself does not bring any computational savings, as it results in bond dimensions of the size of the original problem. In order to achieve polynomial scaling, bounded bond dimensions have to be applied. Consequently, the entanglement between two subsystems of the bipartite splitting governs the quantum information loss (152) and accuracy of the ansatz. It must be noted that low bond dimension MPSs are not candidates for quantum speed-up, as slightly entangled quantum computations may be efficiently simulated on a classical computer using the MPS formalism. (151) 2.2.2. Dynamical Properties: Time Evolution of the Wave Function Zero-temperature ground-state quantum chemistry covers only a restricted set of the chemistry in nature. Many processes occur at finite temperature where the system is propagated in time and described by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation: (10) When the Hamiltonian is time-independent, this equation is formally solved by (11) The expansion of this equation in terms of eigenvectors \u03c8j(r\u20d7) of the time-independent Hamiltonian, (12) reveals the difficulty of the problem: exact time evolution requires knowledge of the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian and the expansion of the initial state in terms of the eigenvectors. This is only feasible for very small systems. Several levels of approximations are often applied to approach the problem. Here we review two broad categories of methods. Molecular dynamics avoids the explicit wave function propagation by treating the nuclei as classical charged particles and only solving for the electrostatic field from electron density with fixed nuclei positions. Other methods avoid maintaining the full wave function with strategies similar to those described in section 2.2.1, with an additional consideration of time dependence. Molecular Dynamics (MD) When studying the dynamics of large chemical systems (approximately hundreds of atoms), one often is interested in properties for which no quantum effects are necessary. It is sufficient to use classical MD methods which simulate the problem using an effective force field and Newtonian mechanics. (153) MD is often applied to problems such as diffusion rates, reaction rates, conformal changes, infrared spectra, and binding energies, to study processes such as protein folding, gas absorption in porous materials, stress-induced material deformation, and electrolyte solvation, among many others. Because these quantities can often be calculated to desired accuracy by treating each atom as a classical Newtonian particle, MD avoids the construction of a Hilbert space under time evolution. In order to advance one time step in a Newtonian simulation, the forces on the particles need to be approximated. This is achieved in MD by introducing a force field that acts on the atoms without explicitly considering electronic degrees of freedom. A force field comprises of a set of terms that are parametrized by electronic structure calculations or experiment. The dynamics of the system are propagated using algorithms such as Euler or Verlet integration, after which one can obtain an intuitive qualitative understanding of the dynamics of a process (e.g., protein\u2013ligand docking) or calculate quantitative results from correlation functions (such as spectra or diffusion constants). If the primary interest is in finding low-energy states (which is the case in finding the lowest-energy molecular crystal conformation or in protein\u2013ligand docking), then the dynamics are less relevant, and one of many optimization methods is used to find the ground state of the system. We note that one way to improve accuracy is to use ab initio electronic structure methods in conjunction with MD methods as a way to consider dynamics for the whole system. Such methods include Born\u2013Oppenheimer MD (154) and Carr\u2013Parinello MD. (155) There are many chemical systems for which nuclear quantum effects must be considered, even if the electronic degrees of freedom can be safely absorbed into the force field. Such effects include nuclear tunneling and zero-point vibrational energy, which are not captured by Newtonian mechanics. Nuclear quantum effects are needed for simulating condensed matter systems containing low-temperature helium and hydrogen, (156) as well as for obtaining high-accuracy simulations of hydrogen-containing room-temperature systems such as liquid water. (157) A variety of flavors of path integral methods (158) have been developed to model nuclear quantum effects, including path-integral MD, (159) centroid MD, (160) and ring-polymer MD. (161) Conceptually, these methods operate by discretizing an atom into many \u201cbeads\u201d that represent a state of the system in the path integral. While these methods include some quantum effects listed above, they avoid using a Hilbert space, which limits their computational cost to that of classical MD methods. It is important to note that, even though MD has opened a whole field of research that was previously inaccessible, the method has limitations that are hard to overcome without fundamentally altering the procedure. The most severe problem is the limited amount of time propagation that MD currently supports. Some processes in biochemistry, such as conformational transitions in hemoglobin, occur on a time scale that is many times the current limit of MD calculations. (162) Quantum Time Evolution Most of the methods in section 2.2.1 can be adapted to perform time evolution over which the quantum character is preserved at all steps. One of the strategies for time propagation is directly propagating the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, i.e., updating an explicit wave function or density matrix at each time step. This quickly becomes memory intensive and requires a method to approximate the matrix exponential of the Hamiltonian. (163) Moler and Van Loan (164) categorized the many methods for approximating the operation of a matrix exponential. The Taylor expansion, Pad\u00e9 approximant, and Chebyshev approximant are series methods based on powers of the Hamiltonian (163,164) to approximate the evolution operator. They are accurate for small matrices but prohibitively expensive for larger systems. Standard ordinary differential equation solvers such as Runge\u2013Kutta are a common workhorse for time propagation of classical equations. They can be adapted to perform quantum propagation, (163,165) although they are not the most computationally efficient choice for a given accuracy. Polynomial methods form another algorithmic category. They rely on the exact expression of high-order matrix powers as lower-order polynomials of the Hamiltonian. (166) The bottleneck for those methods is calculating the characteristic polynomial, which is expensive for large matrices. Note that in practice these methods are often combined\u2014for instance, after performing the Lanczos decomposition, one may use the Pad\u00e9 approximant on the resulting smaller approximate matrix. (167) For all of these methods, the propagation or matrix exponentiation algorithm is chosen based on desired accuracy, the size of the system, ease of implementation, and properties of the matrix such as its condition number. Matrix decomposition methods try to approximate the operator exponential of the Hamiltonian directly. The prototypical example of this is the decomposition of the exponential as eA = S eVS\u20131, where A = SVS\u20131 and V is diagonal. This approach requires far fewer matrix\u2013matrix operations than the naive implementation. Improved stability and efficiency are often observed by rewriting the exponential in terms of triangular (e.g., Schur) or block-diagonal matrix decompositions. (168) There are also splitting methods which apply an approximation that can be used if the Hamiltonian is expressible as a sum of matrices, and where each term of the sum can be simulated by a known efficient method. This is the same procedure used in the Trotter\u2013Suzuki method as well as the split-operator method for applying the kinetic and potential energy terms separately. (169) Finally, the Krylov subspace methods (e.g., the Lanczos method for Hermitian matrices) make it possible to approximate e\u2013iHv for a given vector v by solely performing matrix\u2013vector multiplications. (167,170) This is efficient for large matrices. One of the most cost-effective ways to obtain time-dependent properties without explicitly doing time propagation is the first-order perturbation approach, or linear response theory. Even though the original formulation of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) (171) does not require the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian to be small, it has mostly been applied using this assumption. (172\u2212174) In the same spirit, a linear response approximation to DMRG (175,176) and coupled cluster (177\u2212179) allows for the calculation of dynamical properties with high-level quantum chemistry methods. Linear response is the first-order expansion of a time-dependent property, and perturbation theory falls short of describing the full time dependence. Ideally we would like to be able to truly propagate quantum wave functions for an arbitrary amount of time. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) (180\u2212182) has enabled time-dependent variational Monte Carlo calculations for bosons (183) and strongly correlated fermions. (184) Although the TDVP has also found its application in DMRG, (185) the most popular algorithm for time evolution with a DMRG-style ansatz is called time-evolving block decimation. (186) This method relies on a Trotterization of the time evolution and DMRG truncation of the Hilbert space after every time step. A more thorough review of time evolution algorithms related to DMRG can be found in the report by Schollw\u00f6ck. (187) Despite these impressive efforts to formulate analogous time-dependent methods, the shortcomings of the tensor-based methods they are based on are equally present and even aggravated. After longer time evolution, errors due to the inherent approximations accumulate and lead to loss of accuracy and a rapidly growing bond dimension. Simulating dynamical behavior around conical intersections is an important topic in theoretical chemistry, relevant for studying reaction mechanisms, and in photochemistry, including photocatalysis and the interpretation of spectroscopic results. Conical intersections occur when two electronic states, e.g., the ground state and first excited state of a molecule, intersect at a point in nuclear coordinate space. Close to these points, the BOA breaks down, resulting in entanglement between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. This means that the full quantum state is no longer well-approximated with a product state, necessitating methods that allow for multi-reference character in the wave function, of which we mention three popular methods here. The multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm (188) models all relevant quantum degrees of freedom, propagating superpositions of product states. Evolution of a wave packet over longer time periods in MCTDH requires considerable computer resources, and therefore larger systems are out of the scope of current capabilities. The matching-pursuit/split-operator Fourier transform (189) and the more classical multiple spawning method (190) use careful metrics to continually update the basis set in which the system is propagated to ensure efficient simulation. Recent reviews have been published on these and other algorithms for studying non-adiabatic dynamics and conical intersections. (191,192) 2.3. Quantum Methods: Going beyond Classical Limitations Using Quantum Computers All of the classical techniques introduced in the previous section are designed to avoid two features in a computation: explicitly maintaining the full many-body wave function |\u03c8\u27e9 and propagating the wave function in time by general matrix\u2013vector multiplication e\u2013iHt|\u03c8\u27e9. However, as we will discuss in this section, quantum computers allow for efficient implementation of these two features. For the former, i.e., state representation, there are quantum states for which no known efficient classical representation exists, but that can be prepared on a quantum computer. The quantum computer thus has access to a richer state space for the ground-state search for certain systems. For the latter feature, time evolution, a long line of inquiry in quantum computing that spans more than two decades has led to a refined set of quantum algorithms for efficiently simulating time evolution under both time-independent and time-dependent Hamiltonians. These two features of a quantum computer allow for algorithm design techniques that are quite different from the classical algorithms for simulating quantum systems. Both state preparation and Hamiltonian evolution are instrumental to the techniques we review in this section. In addition to distinguishing between static and dynamic problems as in the previous section, we also make a distinction between NISQ devices and fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) devices. The first are available at present or are using technologies that will be available in the near-term, while the latter require much more research and are a much longer-term prospect. The main difference between NISQ and FTQC devices concerns decoherence due to the environmental noise and whether it sets an upper limit on the time duration of a quantum computation. In this sense, NISQ devices are sensitive to sources of noise and error (hence the term \u201cnoisy\u201d in NISQ), while FTQC devices can, in principle, carry out coherent quantum computation for an arbitrary amount of time. Many well-known quantum algorithms that have become standard examples of quantum speed-ups over classical algorithms, such as Shor\u2019s quantum factorization algorithm, (35) the quantum search algorithm by Grover, (38) and QPEA (which we review here), in fact assume the availability of FTQC devices in order to deliver the promised quantum advantage. This does not a priori exclude the possibility of quantum advantage on NISQ devices. In fact, there are promising ideas which may bring tangible results for quantum chemistry on near-term devices. Before discussing any quantum simulation algorithms, we would like to start with how wave functions of quantum systems can be represented on a quantum computer. The basic building blocks of quantum computation are controllable two-level systems called qubits. If we denote the two levels of a qubit as |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9, the wave function of an n-qubit quantum computer can be expressed as a superposition of 2ncomputational basis states: (13) For describing a computational basis state, the Kronecker product symbol \u2297 is commonly dropped for simplicity in notation. For example, we will use |110\u27e9 for representing the three-qubit state |1\u27e9\u2297|1\u27e9\u2297|0\u27e9. Early proposals (52,53) for representing wave functions of quantum systems consider a real-space representation where the spatial wave function \u03c8(x) is discretized into grid points \u2211i\u03c8i|i\u27e9, with each |i\u27e9 being a computational basis state. Similar representations have been improved in later studies applying them to simulation of quantum dynamics in real space. (88,89) An alternative representation considers the second-quantized picture where each computational basis state |i1i2...in\u27e9 corresponds to a Slater determinant in the Fock space. Each ij = 1 if the spin-orbital j is occupied and 0 otherwise. This representation underlies the majority of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry on both NISQ and FTQC devices. One of the appealing features of this approach is that it allows one to transform the molecular Hamiltonian into a standard second-quantized form, (14) where ai\u2020 and ai are raising and lowering operators acting on the ith basis function. Here the coefficients hpq and hpqrs are one-electron and two-electron integrals which can be efficiently computed classically for many choices of basis functions. The fermionic operators obey anti-commutation relations {ai, aj\u2020} = aiaj\u2020 + aj\u2020ai = \u03b4ij and {ai, aj} = {ai\u2020, aj\u2020} = 0. One can transform the Hamiltonian expressed in terms of operators into a more natural form for quantum simulation of electronic structure on a quantum computer. The basic idea is to replace each fermionic operator with a tensor product of Pauli matrices, X = , Y = , and Z = . While there are several methods for accomplishing this transform, (193,194) all result in a Hamiltonian that is a linear combination of tensor products of matrices {I, X, Y, Z}, with I = , in such a way that preserves the fermionic anti-commutation relations. In general we can write such a Hamiltonian as a k-local Hamiltonian: (15) Here \u201ck-local\u201d means that each term in the Hamiltonian acts non-trivially on at most k qubits. In eq 15, the notation \u03c3i,j means the jth operator in the ith term of the Hamiltonian. Each \u03c3i,j is a Pauli operator acting on one qubit. For a detailed illustration of mapping from a molecular Hamiltonian to a k-local Hamiltonian representation in the Fock space, the reader is encouraged to refer to Appendix C for an example using a hydrogen molecule. The organization of this section is similar to that of the previous section where the problem space is partitioned into static and dynamic problems. In addition, for each category we discuss quantum techniques devised for both NISQ and FTQC devices. The goal is to introduce some representative ideas in the space, leaving more detailed discussions to sections 4 and 5 and Appendix C. 2.3.1. Static Properties: Phase Estimation and Variational Quantum Eigensolvers The idea of quantum phase estimation (QPE) can be traced back to early works on quantum mechanics by von Neuman (195) inquiring the nature of quantum measurements. Contemporary discussions on phase estimation would commonly place its origin at the work of Kitaev et al. (54) However, textbooks (1) on quantum computing typically use another version of phase estimation which differs from Kitaev\u2019s version. The basic idea stems from the fact that, for a given unitary operator U, its eigenvalues take the form of a phase \u03bbj = ei\u03c6j. We assume that U has an efficient implementation on a quantum computer. That is, if U acts on n qubits, there is a polynomial-length sequence of elementary operations that one can perform on a quantum computer which equals or well approximates U. For an eigenstate |\u03c8j\u27e9, the phase estimation (1) algorithm transforms the state on a quantum computer into (16) where |\u03c6\u0303j\u27e9 is a state that encodes an approximation of the phase \u03c6j/2\u03c0. The approximation error comes from the attempt to capture the value of \u03c6j, which is a continuous variable, with a finite qubit register and hence a finite-dimensional quantum system. By measuring the state |\u03c6\u0303j\u27e9, one could extract the phase \u03c6i up to the precision allowed by the qubit register. Phase estimation is an algorithmic framework that encapsulates a broad set of quantum algorithms. For example, Shor\u2019s algorithm for integer factorization (35) and amplitude estimation (196) both can be cast as a form of phase estimation for specific construction of unitary operators U. Most relevant to this Review is the use of phase estimation for extracting the eigenspectrum of a Hamiltonian H. This corresponds to the special case where U = e\u2013iHt. Efficient implementation of e\u2013iHt is the subject of Hamiltonian simulation, which merits a separate discussion in section 2.3.2. It should be noted that, in the case where the objective is a specific eigenstate of the Hamiltonian such as the ground state |\u03c80\u27e9, an appropriate initial state |\u03d50\u27e9, reasonably close to |\u03c80\u27e9, is needed. To see this, consider a general state |\u03d5\u27e9 = \u2211j\u03b2j|\u03c8j\u27e9. Applying phase estimation on the initial state |\u03d5\u27e9|0\u27e9 yields \u2211j\u03b2j|\u03c8j\u27e9|\u03c6\u0303j\u27e9. Upon measurement of the second qubit register, one would like to maximize the chance of obtaining |\u03c6\u03030\u27e9, which is dictated by |\u03b20|2. In order to obtain the ground-state energy in a time duration that scales polynomially in the number of qubits n acted on by the Hamiltonian H, we require that |\u03b20|2 be at least as large as an inverse polynomial in n. Several methods of state preparation on a quantum computer have been discussed in the literature, and we review them in detail in section 4.2.1. For quantum chemistry applications, there are well-motivated methods for preparing initial wave functions based on efficiently computable ansatzes. In addition, the Hamiltonians for molecular electronic structure problems are also well studied in the context of implementing time evolution U = e\u2013iHt. Both ingredients give hope that quantum computers can take advantage of QPE to efficiently compute the spectra of quantum systems to accuracy comparable to that of FCI. However, an important technical point is that the sequences of operations (or quantum circuits, see section 4.1.3) yielded from phase estimation are often too deep to be feasible on today\u2019s NISQ devices. (60,197,198) Instead they require fault-tolerant quantum computers which can, in principle, perform quantum computation indefinitely. However, there are significant technical challenges which need to be met before fault-tolerance can be achieved. For NISQ devices, the recently proposed paradigm of the hybrid quantum\u2013classical (HQC) algorithm is a more practical framework for developing heuristics to solve the same problems of eigenstates and energy levels. A salient feature of HQC algorithms is that much of the computational burden is off-loaded to a classical computer. The quantum computer is only used for its ability to prepare entangled states that are otherwise hard to represent classically and to make measurements with respect to the states. Specifically, the setting is that the quantum computer can prepare a set of states |\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9 parametrized by classical parameters \u03b8\u20d7. One then makes measurement with respect to the state, and the classical computer updates the parameter setting to \u03b8\u20d7\u2032 and feeds it back into the state preparation on the quantum device. By iterating between classical and quantum processors, the hybrid algorithm eventually trains the quantum computer to prepare the state that is desired for the problem. An important class of HQC algorithms that are useful for solving static problems in quantum chemistry is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which will be discussed in greater detail in section 5.1 2.3.2. Dynamical Properties: Hamiltonian Simulation and Hybrid Methods Many quantum chemistry problems concern the time evolution of a quantum state under a Hamiltonian H. Propagating an initial wave function |\u03c80\u27e9 in time by calculating |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = e\u2013iHt|\u03c80\u27e9 is, in general, hard on a classical computer. As we have alluded to in section 2.2, classically tractable cases include restricted settings where 1. the system is small enough for the Hamiltonian to be treatable with explicit methods; 2. the time step t is small, for which e\u2013iHt \u2248 I \u2013 iHt\u2014this yields a linear response theory; 3. efficient approximation of the wave function is possible using, for instance, tensor networks, as in t-DMRG, or more recently neural networks; (199) 4. the dynamical sign problem can be effectively suppressed. (200) Quantum computation circumvents the main issues encountered in classical methods by maintaining a highly entangled quantum state which may not admit an efficient classical description, enabling a fundamentally different approach to realizing the unitary evolution and, in doing so, avoiding the dynamical sign problem. (55) On a (fault-tolerant) quantum computer, there are efficient methods for implementing an approximation of e\u2013iHt for arbitrary t and a broad class of Hamiltonians H. Early works on Hamiltonian simulation (41,50,201) assumed that H can be written as a sum of local terms, H = \u2211jHj, where each Hj acts on a subsystem. By application of the Trotter\u2013Suzuki formula, the problem becomes how to implement each e\u2013iHjt individually on a quantum computer. For molecular electronic structure problems the recipes for such implementations have been explicitly specified. (201) Using such recipes, implementing e\u2013iHt for an n-qubit Hamiltonian takes time polynomial in n on a quantum computer, while a classical computer takes time at least \u223c2n. In recent years there has been an extensive line of inquiry (56\u221259) in estimating and improving Hamiltonian simulation techniques in the context of phase estimation for quantum chemistry applications. An alternative setting of Hamiltonian simulation (202,203) considers an \u201coracle model\u201d where the Hamiltonian is assumed to be a sparse matrix and its elements are provided by a black-box (or oracle), such that when queried with the row number i and the index j (namely first, second, etc.) the black-box returns the jth non-zero element of the matrix. It is also assumed that one can make queries to the oracle in superposition and obtain answers in superposition. The total cost of the algorithm is then taken to be either the number of total queries or the sum of total queries and the total number of elementary operations performed on a quantum computer. Some of the recently developed paradigms for Hamiltonian simulation (202\u2212205) achieve exponential improvements in precision compared with their predecessors. (202,203) They have also been applied to quantum chemistry, (206,207) yielding a similar exponential improvement. We will expand on the details in section 4.1. Naturally, any discussion of realizing the operation e\u2013iHt is restricted to simulating time evolution of closed, time-independent systems. More generally, algorithms for simulating open quantum systems have also been explored. (208\u2212210) These algorithms focus on the Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators being sparse and given by oracles (black-boxes). For time-dependent Hamiltonians, early works (211) focus on variants of Trotter\u2013Suzuki formula, which are subsequently improved with black-box models. (203) Recently, simulation techniques in the interaction picture (212) have been proposed. A similar technique has also been applied in quantum chemistry (213) to produce the first quantum simulation algorithm of cost scaling sublinearly in the number of basis functions. In parallel with previous methods for simulating time-independent Hamiltonians (203) yielding near-optimal cost scaling, techniques for simulating time-dependent Hamiltonians using Dyson series 214 have also been recently proposed, with scaling matching the time-independent case. (203) All of the quantum algorithms mentioned in this subsection rely on the possibility of fault-tolerant quantum computers in order to outperform any of their classical counterparts. However, the prospect of physical fault-tolerant devices will most likely require decades of experimental progress. This prospect has led researchers to investigate what quantum dynamics one can simulate with the quantum devices that we have today. Indeed, there are already proposals (66) for NISQ algorithms based on variational principles. (215,216) In these methods, a quantum state |\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9 is generated by a low depth circuit with classical parameters \u03b8\u20d7. The time evolution of an initial state |\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d70)\u27e9 then translates to updating the classical parameters iteratively as the simulation progresses. More details on using variational principles for both real and imaginary time propagation will be discussed in section 5.2. 3. Computational Complexity ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To There are many examples of elusive problems in quantum physics or quantum chemistry that seem to defy efficient solutions despite decades of effort. These include the 3D Ising problem, Hubbard models, and finding the universal functional in DFT. In the face of these hard open problems, one may ask the question of why these problems remain unanswered. Is it a lack of human ingenuity and understanding, or a fundamental difficulty that is inherent to these problems? Being able to answer this question not only provides theoretical insights on the problems themselves but could also provide guidance for research efforts to choose the most fruitful direction toward a solution. To make progress, one may turn to the theory of computational complexity, which seeks to rigorously characterize the computational hardness of various problems. (81) In order to help capture the inherent hardness of solving various families of problems, the theoretical computer science community has developed the concept of complexity classes. It is important to note that the computational complexity of a given problem refers to its worst-case hardness, and does not always inform us of how difficult a problem is to solve in practice. A pertinent example is that of determining the optimal Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) approximation of a molecular eigenstate. This problem is known to have the same complexity (NP-completeness) as many infamously hard problems. Yet, there are heuristic methods which regularly solve the HF problem in practice. Complexity classes account for the worst-case instances of a problem, even if these instances may rarely occur in practice. The utility of defining complexity classes, then, is that they provide a reality check when developing new methods for solving previously classified problems. The remainder of the section is organized as follows (see also Figure 1). We start with section 3.1, where we establish the basic notions in the theory of computational complexity. Building on these definitions, sections 3.2 and 3.3 discuss results related to problems of electronic structure and molecular vibronic structure, respectively. 3.1. Complexity Classes This section intends to provide an intuitive introduction into the notion of complexity classes. Consider the example of finding the ground states of a family of Hamiltonians of various system sizes. Formally, this is an example of a problem, while finding the ground state of a particular Hamiltonian within this family is an example of a problem instance. Problems and problem instances are two important primitives in the study of computational complexity classes. From the computational viewpoint, an algorithm is efficient for a problem if for any problem instance of size n it can solve the instance in a time that is less than some polynomial function of n. Here the \u201csize\u201d is a parameter of the problem that characterizes how much information is needed to specify the problem completely (e.g., basis set size in the ground-state search of a molecular Hamiltonian, number of grid points in a real-space calculation). This allows us to rigorously characterize how hard it is to solve a computational problem. The simplest category of complexity classes involves decision problems, which are problems for which the answer is binary (\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d). If a decision problem has an efficient algorithm, then it is in complexity class P, meaning deterministic polynomial time. If a decision problem is such that, when provided a candidate solution, one can efficiently check whether the candidate is correct, then the problem is in the complexity class NP, which stands for non-deterministic polynomial time. It is unknown whether a problem being efficient to check implies that it is efficient to solve. This question is captured by the famous P vs NP conjecture (217) that is still unsolved. Another important complexity class is known as NP-hard. The qualification \u201chard\u201d is used to indicate that a problem is at least as hard as any problem in that class. Formally, a problem is said to be NP-hard if an algorithm for solving such problems can be efficiently translated into an algorithm for solving any problem in NP. If a problem is both NP-hard and in NP, it is said to be NP-complete. Roughly speaking, a problem being NP-complete is strong evidence that there does not exist a provably efficient algorithm to solve it, be it of classical or quantum nature. (218) In addition to decision problems, another important category of problem is counting problems. While a decision problem can be formulated as \u201cDoes a solution exist?\u201d, a counting problem can be formulated as \u201cHow many solutions exist?\u201d. From the class of problems in NP derives a complexity class of counting problems known as #P (\u201cSharp-P\u201d). The complexity class #P is roughly defined as the set of problems which ask to count the number of solutions to problem instances, where candidate solutions can be efficiently checked. There is a sense in which problems in #P are at least as hard as the corresponding problems in NP. If one had a way to compute the number of solutions to a problem, then one could determine whether a solution exists. The complexity classes P, NP, and #P assume that the underlying computation is classical. In other words, P is the class of problems efficiently solvable on a classical computer, NP is the class of problems whose solutions are efficiently checkable on a classical computer, and #P is the class of problems which count the number of solutions for problems whose solutions are efficiently checkable on a classical computer. The advent of quantum computing has also led to research on the quantum generalizations of these complexity classes. In particular, the complexity class BQP, short for bounded-error quantum polynomial-time, refers to the set of problems that can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer. QMA, short for quantum Merlin-Arthur, refers to the set of problems such that, when presented a candidate solution as a quantum state, one can use a quantum computer to efficiently verify the solution. Drawing a parallel from the discussion above, if a problem is QMA-complete, then it is unlikely that there is an efficient solution even on a quantum computer. While the quantum analog of #P, #BQP, has been defined and has been shown to contain important physical problems, it turns out to be of equal complexity to #P. (80) Although the exact relationships between the complexity classes remain largely open, certain containment relationships have already been proven (Figure 2). Figure 2 Figure 2. Known relationship between the complexity classes discussed in this section. Note that some classes reside entirely inside other classes, which naturally defines a difficulty hierarchy. Note that P#P and the polynomial hierarchy PH are powerful complexity classes that relate to some of the major developments in quantum complexity theory. At the intersection between theoretical computer science and condensed matter physics has emerged a research program that has recently come under the name quantum Hamiltonian complexity. (219,220) Quantum Hamiltonian complexity seeks to gain insights on some of the most challenging open problems in quantum physics and chemistry. Most notably, it has been shown that finding the ground-state energy of many simple, locally interacting systems is QMA-complete. (221,222) The three examples of open problems we mentioned in the beginning of this section all have their own computational complexity characterizations: the 3D Ising model is NP-complete, (223) finding the ground state of Bose\u2013Hubbard model is QMA-complete, (224) and finding the universal functional in DFT is also QMA-complete. (78) Finally, we note that a comprehensive list (225) of QMA-complete problems has been compiled, and the reader may use it for further exploration. 3.2. Complexity Theory of the Electronic Structure Problem The exponential complexity in handling the exact wave function is well known to be a major obstacle in solving many important problems in quantum chemistry, such as electronic structure calculations. In section 2.1 we elaborated on classical methods for circumventing the exponential complexity. Here we review rigorous results for characterizing computational hardness of various problems in electronic structure. Naturally, the QMA-completeness results for the ground state of locally interacting systems mentioned before lead to speculations about potential consequences for electronic structure. (226) Indeed, other than finding the universal functional for DFT, (78) the problem of checking whether a given set of two-electron reduced density matrices (2RDMs) is consistent with a single many-electron wave function, known as the N-representability problem, has also been proven QMA-complete. (79) Solving the HF method, which intends to find a single Slater determinant that best approximates the true wave function, has been shown to be NP-complete. (78) The NP-completeness has also been proven to persist even if one restricts to translationally invariant systems. (227) Although it is unlikely that one can find general and provably effective (quantum or classical) algorithms for QMA-complete or NP-complete problems, in practice, there are heuristic methods that have gained some empirical success. For example, in the case of HF, the SCF iteration serves as a local search algorithm which can converge to a local optimum. By chance, this can also be the global optimum, but proving that it is, or systematically finding the global minimum, is NP-complete. Although the N-representability problem is QMA-complete, heuristic methods building on constrained optimization of 2RDMs can nonetheless produce useful results in many cases. (228,229) On quantum computers, the strategies for navigating the computational hardness of finding the eigenstates and eigenenergies revolve around exploiting the ability to maintain full wave functions encoded as multi-qubit entangled states. For example, the VQE may start by preparing a physically motivated wave function ansatz that is otherwise hard to prepare classically, such as unitary coupled cluster. (63) Another cause for optimism in light of the QMA-completeness of the ground-state problem for general local Hamiltonians is that the Hamiltonians occurring in quantum chemistry problems are more restricted than the general setting considered in the computational complexity results. (81) Aside from the problems that are provably hard in the worst case, there are problems that can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer. Many such problems are related to the time evolution of a wave function under a Hamiltonian. In section 2.3.2 we mentioned some representative techniques for realizing unitary time evolution on a quantum computer. Each polynomial-time quantum algorithm is by itself a proof that the corresponding problem addressed by the algorithm is in BQP. In contrast to the QMA-completeness of evaluating the universal functional in DFT, (78) the problem of evaluating the time-dependent effective Kohn\u2013Sham potential can be efficiently addressed on a quantum computer (230) and is therefore in BQP. We categorize the problems and their respective computational complexity classes in Table 1. At first glance one might find it surprising that the commonly used HF method is solving an NP-complete problem, which is in the same complexity class as 3D Ising ground state. Other than recalling that the complexity class characterizations are for worst-case instances, we note that the effectiveness of the HF method typically relies on initial guesses that are well motivated by physical and chemical insights. A good initial guess would allow the SCF procedure to converge to a local optimum that is reasonably accurate, especially in near-equilibrium geometries. However, in geometries far from equilibrium where the many-body electronic wave function cannot be easily described by a single Slater determinant, the HF method typically struggles to find a good approximation. (92) It is our belief that these strongly correlated regimes are where the worst-case instances are more likely to arise. Table 1.

Complexity Theory in Molecular Vibronics The motivation for solving chemical problems on a quantum computer often stems from the ability of the computer to natively simulate some or all of the dynamics of the chemical system directly on a quantum device. An appealing consequence of such native simulation is that the computing device often does not need to use a great deal of resources encoding the appropriate quantum states onto the hardware, thereby reducing the resource overhead significantly. While there are as yet no quantum computer systems whose underlying physical platform is naturally fermionic, the field of linear optical quantum computing has seen substantial progress toward performing quantum information processing with photons, which are bosonic systems. Given the resource-limited nascent state of gate-model quantum computing, algorithms that look toward solving bosonic chemical problems may be particularly valuable for showing early demonstrations of post-classical computing and making an impact on chemistry in the immediate future. In particular, the optical boson sampling model is one such proposal for a near-term application. The model consists of a series of optical modes, or pathways, where light is allowed to propagate. Along these modes are passive linear optics devices, such as beam splitters and phase shifters, which allow the exchange of photons to take place between two modes. This generates so-called number-mode entanglement in a bosonic Fock space, much like the fermionic Fock space corresponding to the occupation number basis, which conserves the total number of photons (note that a major difference between bosonic and fermionic Fock spaces is the ability for bosonic modes to be occupied by any number of photons, as opposed to spin-orbitals which have at most a single fermion). It is natural, then, to consider chemical systems which are described by bosonic processes as candidates for a quantum algorithm on this platform. One particular process is molecular vibronic spectroscopy, which considers the vibrational transitions between two electronic states of a molecule. This process is fully characterized by the Franck\u2013Condon profile (FCP), (232) which describes the spectra of vibronic modes in the harmonic regime. Recall that vibrational modes can be described by excitations of phonons, which are virtual bosonic particles. There are a number of important molecular properties that depend on the vibrational modes of a molecule, particularly those related to its interaction with light. Emission, absorption, and Raman scattering all depend on the electronic states of the molecule, which in turn are influenced by the vibrational frequencies. For instance, in a spectroscopic setting, these properties could be used to extract information about unknown molecules. For molecular engineering of solar cells or photosynthetic materials, it may be necessary to have molecules meeting particular constraints on these properties. However, it may be prohibitively expensive in time or resources to experimentally test every candidate molecule; simulation of vibronic spectra then becomes a valuable tool. A quantum algorithm to solve this problem is detailed later in section 5.3.2; here, we will motivate the development of such an algorithm by discussing the complexity and theoretic limitations of solving the problem with only classical methods. To describe molecular vibronic processes, it was shown by Duschinsky (233) that a linear relationship between the initial and final normal coordinates (q\u20d7 and q\u20d7\u2032, respectively) could be given by (17) where UDus is a real-valued matrix called the Duschinsky matrix and d\u20d7 is a displacement vector. Doktorov et al. (234) showed that this corresponds to a unitary rotation \u00dbDok of the bosonic ladder operators: (18) (19) where D\u0302\u03b4 corresponds to a displacement operator dependent on d\u20d7, \u015c\u03a9\u2032 (\u015c\u03a9) a squeezing operator whose parameters depend on the harmonic angular frequencies of the transition, and R\u0302U a rotation corresponding to UDus. (235) The distribution of non-trivial transition amplitudes \u03c9 at 0 K gives rise to the FCP, (20) where |0\u27e9 is the ground state of the initial vibronic potential and |m\u27e9 is an eigenmode of the final vibronic potential of eigenenergies m = (m1, ..., mM), where M = 3N \u2013 6 is the number of degrees of freedom (vibronic modes) in an N-atom molecule. The set {mk} consists of all possible configurations of phonons leading to allowed transitions of energy \u03c9vib. The inner product \u27e8m|UDok|0\u27e9, known as the Franck\u2013Condon integral, is thus a product-sum over the all phonon configurations contributing to \u03c9. This product-sum corresponds to the computation of the hafnian of a matrix. The hafnian is operationally a function which takes as input an adjacency matrix and outputs the number of perfect matches in the graph (for matrices with real or complex valued entries, this idea can be extended by considering each edge of the graph to have weights). If a matrix is bipartite, with an equal number of vertices in each partition, the hafnian corresponds to the computation of a matrix permanent. Rather than discussing the hafnian directly, we will focus our discussion on the permanent, which is a more familiar object than the hafnian (we further note that the two are characterized by the same complexity class, so we lose little by making this reduction). The permanent of an n\u00d7n matrix M is defined by (21) which has a definition similar to the determinant of M, minus an additional product of each term with sgn(\u03c3). Colloquially, the permanent is often described as the \u201cdeterminant with all + signs\u201d. Despite the permanent\u2019s similarity to the determinant, the two functions in general exhibit dramatically different complexities. While the determinant can be efficiently computed (in O(n3) steps) by reduction to row-echelon form via elementary row operations (called Gaussian elimination), the permanent of a matrix is not invariant under row operations. Valiant (236) realized that the permanent was an archetypal problem for a complexity class of counting problems, which he coined #P. Recall that NP problems can be thought of as asking, \u201cDoes at least one satisfying assignment exist for some criteria?\u201d Problems in #P, on the other hand, are characterized by finding how many satisfying assignments exist for the same criteria, a much more difficult task. It then followed, Valiant showed, that an exact and efficient algorithm for permanent computation, even for a matrix of only binary valued entries, would imply that P = NP. The expectation is, then, that #P problems will be hard to compute. Indeed, the best-known general algorithm today for exactly solving matrix permanents is that described by Ryser, (237) requiring at least O(n2n) operations. It is important to realize that, although hafnians or matrix permanents may be hard to compute or even estimate, determining the FCP is more precisely a sampling problem. That is, although the hardness of the permanent is a necessary condition for the FCP sampling problem to be hard, it is not known to be a sufficient condition. There is, however, compelling evidence in the literature to suggest that the sampling problem as such is indeed hard as well. Particular instances of the FCP reduce to an instance of the recently developed linear optics architecture, boson sampling. (77,238\u2212243) This prompted Huh et al. (244) to devise an algorithm (developed further by Huh and Yung (245)) for sampling from the FCP using an optical quantum computer, which is summarized in section 5.3.2. It remains unclear whether the family of chemically relevant problems is generally in the set of instances for which an optical quantum computer could significantly speed up the calculation. Complexity-theoretic results hold for average-case Haar-random or Gaussian-random unitary matrices, but chemical problems do not correspond to choosing randomly from these sets. This is consistent with classical algorithmic approaches whose techniques leverage approximations that take into account the physical symmetries of the system to generate solutions. (246) However, these techniques will only give efficient and accurate solutions in some problem instances where the approximations are valid. It remains to be seen whether an efficient and fully generalizable classical approach exists. While the search for this approach continues, there is room for quantum computers to tackle the hardest of these chemical problems. 4. Quantum Simulation Algorithms for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Quantum computation was born out of the idea that a controllable quantum system could be used to simulate the dynamics of a different quantum system. As described in the previous section, it has been shown that a quantum computer consisting of quantum bits and elementary unitary operations can solve the computational problem of simulating unitary evolution for a physically realistic system efficiently (cf. Table 1). The purpose of this section is to provide a motivating narrative, guiding the reader through the significant advances in the field of quantum simulation and its applications to the electronic structure problem. These advances have carried the idea of quantum simulation from a theoretical proposal to the premier application of near-term quantum computers. In its simplest form, quantum simulation entails two steps. First, the quantum system of interest must be mapped onto the qubits of the quantum computer. Second, the unitary evolution of the simulated system must be translated into a sequence of elementary operations. The original proposals of quantum simulation in the early 1980s, by Manin (46) and Feynman, (247) were motivated by the inefficiency of simulating quantum systems using classical processors. Their revolutionary idea was that, while the scaling of the number of classical bits needed to store a wave function of N quantum systems grows as O(exp(N)), the scaling of quantum bits needed to store this wave function is O(N). [Note: Here the notation O(N) indicates an asymptotic upper bound on the scaling of the algorithm that is linear in N. A tilde on top of the bound notation, e.g., \u00d5(N), indicates suppression of poly-logarithmic factors. In contrast to formally rigorous bounds, a tilde inside of a bound, e.g., O(\u223cN), indicates the bound is obtained empirically.] The caveat is that the amplitudes of a wave function stored in quantum bits cannot be efficiently accessed. Obtaining a classical description of the quantum state would require repeated quantum simulation and tomography, which essentially eliminates all the savings. Instead, one can use quantum simulation to compute expectation values of observables, (40) sample from a given distribution, (76) or use the simulation as a subroutine in more complicated quantum algorithms. (248,249) In this setting, quantum computers can provide an exponential improvement in memory resources for quantum simulation compared to a naive approach using a wave function. Of course, there are classical methods for computing expectation values that do not require storing the wave function, but the ability to manipulate a discretization of the wave function directly opened a floodgate of new results in quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry. (50,52,53,88,250) It is important that the wave function can be efficiently evolved in time for many \u201cphysically realistic\u201d Hamiltonians. (50) That is, with respect to a desired accuracy and duration of the time evolution, the number of quantum gates (roughly, computation time) grows polynomially in system size, time, and inverse precision. In practice, we are interested not only in the scaling but also in the actual amount of resources needed to execute an algorithm. Over the years, requirements for quantum simulation of a real-world system have been steadily lowered. The state-of-the-art quantum algorithms achieve scaling roughly logarithmic in inverse precision and linear in time. We review the progress in quantum simulations in section 4.1. In quantum chemistry, it is relatively uncommon to directly simulate the dynamics of a quantum wave function. Instead, the standard task is to determine the ground-state energy of a quantum system. Solving such an eigenvalue problem exactly is a much more challenging problem than the Hamiltonian simulation. In fact, this problem is known to be QMA-complete for a general Hamiltonian, as discussed in section 3. However, there are several assumptions that make this problem easier for realistic systems, as discussed in section 3. The quantum algorithms that we discuss in this section were designed for quantum computers that function without error. In practice, quantum computers are error-prone due to both imprecision of processes and unwanted interaction with the environment. These defects limit the length of the programs that can be accurately executed. The algorithms described in this section are typically beyond this limit. Thus, only proof-of-principle demonstrations for simple problems have been executed thus far. (64,251\u2212253) Given the difficulty to engineer precise gates and stable qubits, one might be skeptical about the prospect of quantum algorithms requiring coherence. However, it is possible to correct the errors, and the system of detecting and correcting for errors is called an error-correcting code. (254) In brief, the principle behind quantum error correction is to use more physical qubits to establish a set of fewer but higher-fidelity equivalent qubits called logical qubits. (255) A rough, conservative estimate for the ratio of physical to logical qubits needed for reliable quantum computation is 10\u202f000:1, (254) but this depends on the realization of physical qubits, type of noise, and the properties of the error correcting code. Sufficient detection and recovery from errors leads to a regime known as fault-tolerance, which offers the enticing prospect of executing an arbitrarily long circuit without sacrificing accuracy. (256) The emphasis on fault-tolerance is important for this section because here we focus on quantum algorithms which assume the underlying quantum computer is fault-tolerant. In section 5 we will discuss quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry which, a priori, do not require quantum error correction because of more shallow circuits. The remainder of this section is organized as follows (see also Figure 1). In section 4.1 we discuss techniques for simulating general quantum systems on a quantum computer, which involves simulating time evolution under a given Hamiltonian (section 4.1.1) as well as other components needed for extracting the spectrum of the Hamiltonian by phase estimation (sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3). In section 4.2 we discuss applications of these techniques to quantum chemistry problems. Section 4.2 is further split into three subsections corresponding to high-level components of a quantum algorithm for quantum chemistry. In section 4.2.1 we discuss methods for preparing the initial states for an algorithm. Next, we consider simulation methods in section 4.2.2, and we conclude with methods for efficiently extracting useful information out of an algorithm in section 4.2.3. 4.1. Quantum Algorithms for Energy Estimation The observation that quantum systems appear to be difficult to simulate was one of the forces driving early quantum computing research. Together with the algorithm for factoring, (35) Hamiltonian simulation (50) was one of the landmark achievements of quantum algorithms in the 1990s. Quantum simulations are closely connected to other quantum computing schemes such as linear systems, (257) thermal state generation, (258) and quantum machine learning. (259\u2212261) In addition, Hamiltonian simulation together with phase estimation can be used for estimating eigenvalues. 4.1.1. General Hamiltonian Simulation We begin our discussion of Hamiltonian simulation by describing the breakthrough paper by Lloyd, (50) which laid the theoretical foundation for much of the later work in this field. As described above, while the works of Manin (46) and Feynman (247) proposed the idea of quantum computers for solving the memory storage issue with quantum simulation, the work of Lloyd gave a rigorous upper bound on the computational time for quantum simulation. We emphasize that Lloyd\u2019s result applies to a particular approach to quantum simulation, known as gate-based or digital quantum simulation. This approach is distinct from an analog quantum simulation, for which there have been several recent ground-breaking experiments. (25,262\u2212265) In an analog quantum simulation, the physical Hamiltonian of the controllable quantum system is engineered to correspond directly to the Hamiltonian of the system of interest. In a digital Hamiltonian simulation, the dynamics of the targeted system are approximated by a sequence of elementary quantum gates. We give a brief overview of quantum gates (see Appendix C.4) but recommend the book by Nielsen and Chuang (1) for a reader unfamiliar with this formalism. The advantage of the digital simulation approach is its aim for universality: any feasible Hamiltonian can be digitally simulated. Unless otherwise stated, by \u201cHamiltonian simulation\u201d we mean digital Hamiltonian simulation of a closed quantum system under a time-independent Hamiltonian. Informally, the task of Hamiltonian simulation is to construct a sequence of quantum gates which approximate the Hamiltonian evolution of an input state under the action of the operator e\u2013iHt. For an arbitrary Hamiltonian H, the number of elementary gates needed to construct U(t) = e\u2013iHt grows exponentially with the number of qubits. (1) Accordingly, Lloyd\u2019s result, or any other efficient Hamiltonian simulation algorithm, requires the simulated Hamiltonian to have a special structure. The structure assumed in Lloyd\u2019s analysis is that the Hamiltonian describes only local interactions. That is, the Hamiltonian of interest is mapped to an N-qubit Hamiltonian which takes the form (22) where each Hj acts on at most k qubits and each e\u2013iHj\u0394t is easy to implement for a short time segment \u0394t. The local interaction assumption leads to a quantum algorithm for approximating the time dynamics. The key insight is to use the Trotter decomposition to approximate the exact evolution as U(t) \u2248 (e\u2013iH1t/n ... e\u2013iHlt/n)n. From the local interactions assumption, each of the factors e\u2013iHjt/n is a unitary which acts on a constant number of qubits (i.e., independent of N). These local unitary transformations can, in principle, be decomposed into a number of elementary gates that is independent of N. The formal result from Lloyd\u2019s paper is that, for a Hamiltonian of terms describing k-body interactions, U(t) can be approximated within error \u03f5 by a sequence of O(\u03c42/\u03f5) elementary quantum gates, (50,266) where we define \u03c4 \u2261 ||H||t and \u03f5 \u2261 ||U(t) \u2013 \u0168(t)||\u221e, and \u0168(t) is the approximate evolution operator. Assuming that the number of terms in the Hamiltonian scales polynomially with the system size N (such as the number of particles or the number of qubits), then the scaling of the number of gates is polynomial in N, \u03c4, and 1/\u03f5. Thus, the Trotter decomposition for local-interaction Hamiltonian simulation is efficient. It is worth noting that Lloyd also gives an algorithm for simulating open-system dynamics. Following this first algorithm for digital quantum simulation, several questions drove the field of quantum simulation: Does there exist an algorithm for Hamiltonians which are not necessarily local? Is it possible to improve the scaling in terms of t, 1/\u03f5, and the norm of the Hamiltonian ||H||? Can we move beyond Hamiltonian evolution and implement evolution of open systems or evolution under a time-dependent Hamiltonian? Can we exploit structure in quantum chemistry Hamiltonians to improve algorithmic performance? This last question, in particular, has led to major advances in quantum simulation for quantum chemistry and will be the focus of section 4.2.2 But first, we will briefly review the major advances in the field of general Hamiltonian simulation. Dodd et al. (267) and Nielsen et al. (268) built on the work of Lloyd (50) and gave algorithms for simulating Hamiltonians that are a sum of tensor products of Pauli matrices. Independently, Aharonov and Ta-Shma (269) introduced the sparse Hamiltonian paradigm and thus addressed the first two questions above. This approach provides a means for efficiently simulating (i.e., with gate count poly(N, t, 1/\u03f5, d)) Hamiltonians which have fewer than d entries in each column (d-sparse) and includes local Hamiltonians as a special case. A sparse Hamiltonian is a Hamiltonian for which d \u2208 poly(n). It is natural to ask how to represent such a Hamiltonian, since storing (an exponential number of) the coefficients in memory would require an exponential overhead. Indeed, one needs to have a way of efficiently computing these coefficients in superposition. Instead of constraining ourselves to one implementation, it is customary to assume access to the Hamiltonian through oracles: (23) (24) The oracle Oloc locates the column l of the kth non-zero element in the row r. The oracle Oval then gives the (non-zero) value of the matrix element Hr, l. Both oracles are, by construction, involutory and therefore unitary. If such oracles can be constructed from a polynomial number of elementary gates, we say that the Hamiltonian is row-computable. An important subclass of d-sparse Hamiltonians are d-local Hamiltonians. A Hamiltonian is d-local if it can be written as a sum of polynomially (in the number of qubits) many terms where each term acts non-trivially on at most d qubits. Depending on the context, the qubit may or may not be spatially close. As such, many physically relevant Hamiltonians are sparse (270) or even local. (201,271) Several other oracles are used in Hamiltonian simulation literature. Childs and Wiebe (272) introduced the unitary access oracle. In this model, the Hamiltonian is represented as a linear combination of unitaries H = \u2211j=0L\u20131\u03b1jVj. For an efficient simulation, L \u2208 poly(N), and therefore the coefficients \u03b1j can be represented classically. The unitaries Vj are given through an oracle, (25) that acts directly on the data. Berry et al. (202) showed that one query to select(V) can be implemented with d2 calls to Oloc and Oval. Tensor products of Pauli matrices are a special case of the unitaries Vj. Later, Low and Chuang (204) introduced the signal oracle Usignal such that, in a subspace flagged by an ancilla in a signal state |G\u27e9, H = \u27e8G|Usignal|G\u27e9. This case arises from a linear combination of unitaries. Other Hamiltonian access models include efficiently index-computable Hamiltonians, (273) special data structures, (274) and Hamiltonians encoded into a density matrix as a quantum software state. (260,275) Since a density matrix is Hermitian, it is possible to exponentiate it and use the result for generating time evolution. While not commonly used in quantum chemistry yet, density matrix exponentiation has been used in multiple quantum machine learning algorithms. (260) We estimate the cost of the Hamiltonian simulation in terms of the number of calls or queries to these oracles as well as the number of gates. Since each query requires a construction of the Hamiltonian, query complexity often dominates the cost of an algorithm. The concept of an oracle provides a useful abstraction for designing algorithms for a wide spectrum of Hamiltonians. In practice, however, it is not always necessary to explicitly construct an oracle directly if the Hamiltonian has a structure that can be exploited directly. An example of such a structure is a sum of Pauli terms. (203,211,276) Along the line of oracular versus non-oracular approaches, we review the results in Hamiltonian simulations following two different avenues. In the first one, the Hamiltonian is first decomposed into a sum of terms H = \u2211jHj, where each eiHjt can be implemented directly, and use a Trotter decomposition to approximate the evolution under the sum of Hamiltonians. (269) These approaches are typically referred to as product formula algorithms. The original Aharonov and Ta-Shma work (269) established a query complexity of O(poly(N,d)(\u03c42/\u03f5)), which matches the gate complexity of Lloyd\u2019s algorithm but applies to a broader class of d-sparse Hamiltonians. (266) This set the stage for a wave of improvements in the query complexity. First, by more sophisticated Trotter\u2013Suzuki decompositions, (277) the approximation error can be made to depend on progressively higher orders in \u03c4. (211,276,277) Intuitively, one can achieve a more favorable error scaling by using more precise approximations for the exponential of a sum. In the simplest case, the symmetric Trotter formula e(A+B)\u0394t \u2248 eA\u0394t/2 eB\u0394t eA\u0394t/2 suppresses O(\u0394t2) errors. Second, by considering more favorable schemes for Hamiltonian decomposition, (272,273) most modern-day simulation algorithms scale in terms of \u03c4max = t||H||max instead of \u03c4, where ||H||max is the absolute value of the largest entry of H as a matrix in the computational basis. The second approach comes from the equivalence between continuous- and discrete-time quantum walks. (278) This work improved the dependence on time and sparsity but did not match the error scaling of contemporaneous algorithms. Unlike the previous results, it did not rely on Hamiltonian decomposition and it can be used for certain non-sparse Hamiltonians. Childs and Berry (278,279) showed that, given oracle access to a Hamiltonian with eigenvalues \u03bb, one can construct a unitary quantum walk operator with eigenvalues e\u00b1i arcsin \u03bb. The computationally difficult part is to uncompute the arcsin in the phase. This is done by estimating the phase arcsin \u03bb using phase estimation and coherently applying the sin function onto the phase. The use of phase estimation is responsible for a relatively poor scaling in the error \u03f5. While these algorithms reduced the asymptotic complexity of Hamiltonian simulation, this came at the cost of increased sophistication of the methods. A breakthrough in quantum simulation methods came in 2014, when Berry et al. presented an algorithm that exponentially improved the dependence on precision. (202) A series of improvements resulted in the development of a relatively straightforward technique, which considers a decomposition of the Hamiltonian into a linear combination of unitary operators (LCUs), H = \u2211j\u03b1jUj. (203) The Hamiltonian evolution is first divided into shorter segments. Then, each segment is approximated by a truncated Taylor series, (26) which itself is a LCU. A technique called oblivious amplitude amplification (202) is then used to turn black-box implementations of the individual unitaries into a desired linear combination. Oblivious amplitude amplification allowed for the implementation of algorithms based on existing probabilistic schemes (272) with near-perfect success. LCU has a query complexity of , which is optimal in inverse precision. This approach is particularly appealing for quantum chemistry application, where each Uj is a tensor product of Pauli matrices. These Hamiltonians can be implemented without the use of oracles requiring gates, where n is the number of qubits in the simulated system, L is the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, and T = \u2211j=0L\u20131\u03b1j. The major open question was whether this query complexity scaling could be reduced to being additive in its \u03c4 and \u03f5 dependence, rather than multiplicative. Such a dependence was known to be a lower bound on the asymptotic query complexity. (202) In 2016, Low and Chuang developed algorithms based on quantum signal processing (205) and qubitization (204) which achieve this provably optimal asymptotic scaling in query complexity of , achieving the sought-after \u201cadditive\u201d approximation error. Quantum signal processing refers to the ability to transform a unitary W = \u2211\u03bbei\u03b8\u03bb|u\u03bb\u27e9\u27e8u\u03bb| as (27) for any real function h. Using the phase-kickback trick, (280) one can modify the spectrum by manipulating an ancilla qubit. The transformation is then implemented through single-qubit rotations on the ancilla and repeated applications of control-W. Low et al. (281) fully characterized the transformations that can be implemented this way. In short, the transformations are first approximated by a tuple of polynomials whose degree determines the query complexity of the algorithm. If the polynomials form an achievable tuple, they can be turned into single-qubit rotations and implemented through quantum signal processing. Since the walk operator given by Childs and Kothari (273) has eigenvalues e\u00b1i arcsin \u03bb, where \u03bb is an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian, h(\u03b8) = \u2212\u03c4 sin(\u03b8) gives time evolution. The transformation is approximated by the Jacobi\u2013Anger expansion that satisfies the criteria of achievability and its quick convergence results in the optimal scaling of the algorithm. Qubitization (282) takes these ideas one step further and explains how to combine LCU with quantum signal processing. The core of this idea is to modify the signal oracle to obtain two-dimensional invariant subspaces analogous to the construction in Grover\u2019s algorithm. (38) The quantum signal processing approach was later simplified and generalized into singular value transformations by Gily\u00e9n et al. (283) and can be applied to a wide array of applications beyond quantum simulation. More recent work has focused on the possibility of improvements in the scaling with different norms of the Hamiltonian and spectral amplification. (282,284) Low and Wiebe (212) introduced Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture. A Hamiltonian with components H = A + B can be transformed into an interaction picture Hamiltonian as HI(t) = eiAtBe\u2013iAt. The time evolution in the interaction picture then corresponds to the evolution under a time-dependent Hamiltonian HI(t). The dominant scaling comes from simulating the interaction terms B while A is chosen to be a part of the Hamiltonian that is easy to simulate. If the norm of A is much larger than the norm of B, say for a diagonally dominant matrix, interaction picture simulations can lead to an exponential improvement over existing techniques. Recently, Low (282) combined multiple methods (204,205,212) to further improve scaling with respect to the norm of the Hamiltonian. This approach improves the dependence on sparsity by utilizing information about the spectral norm. Quantum simulation algorithms have been developed in other important dynamical regimes. The work of Wang and Wossnig (285) and Kimmel et al. (275) considered simulation of non-sparse Hamiltonians. Advances paralleling the time-independent results have been carried out for time-dependent Hamiltonians using Trotter\u2013Suzuki decompositions. (286,287) Very recently, a truncated Dyson series algorithm was developed (214) which achieves the logarithmic scaling in inverse precision, analogous to the truncated Taylor series method for time-independent simulation. Beyond unitary dynamics, a small line of inquiry has investigated general algorithms for open quantum dynamics, beginning with the case of local Markovian (or local Lindblad) dynamics. (288) Algorithms with improved scaling were recently developed, drawing on techniques from unitary simulation such as improved product decompositions, sparse Hamiltonian methods, and the LCU approach. (209,210) It is quite remarkable that algorithms with optimal asymptotic scaling have been discovered. In practice, however, we must consider the exact gate counts to determine which algorithm is the best in a particular instance. A recent study (289) showed that different algorithms fare better in different regimes. In particular, product-formula-based algorithms required fewer resources than quantum signal processing in a numerical simulation for systems between 10 and 100 qubits. In section 4.2, we will turn to such considerations in the context of Hamiltonian simulation for quantum chemistry. 4.1.2. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) Hamiltonian simulation is rarely used as a standalone algorithm. For the purposes of quantum chemistry, its main application is as a subroutine in the QPEA, (248,280) which is sometimes referred to as the \u201cvon Neumann trick\u201d. (290) It gives an exponential advantage to many of the algorithms reviewed in the next section. Given a unitary operator ei\u03a6 and an approximate eigenstate of that operator prepared on the quantum computer, the QPEA is used to efficiently output a binary representation of the corresponding phase \u03a6. In our case, the operator corresponds to a unitary evolution eiHt, and phase estimation is used to extract information about the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. A circuit representation of the algorithm is shown in Figure 3. The QPEA uses two separate registers of qubits. Figure 3 Figure 3. Circuit performing QPE with three ancilla qubits. First, the Hadamard gate (labeled \u201cHad\u201d) is applied on each ancilla qubit to create a uniform superposition. Next, a series of controlled operations U that corresponds to Hamiltonian evolution e\u2013iHt are applied. Finally, the inverse QFT is used, see section 4.1.3 The input is given by one register (consisting of the top three qubits in this specific diagram) initialized to zero and a second register containing the desired eigenstate of H. (The general case where the second register contains a superposition of eigenstates is discussed in the main text.) After execution, the first register stores an approximation of the eigenenergy of |\u03c8m\u27e9. Please see Appendix C.4 or ref (1) for an introduction to quantum circuits. The first register of T ancilla qubits is used to read out the binary representation of \u03bbm. For simplicity, assume that the state |\u03c8m\u27e9 in the second register is an eigenstate of the unitary U for which we want to compute the eigenenergy \u03bbm. After each ancilla qubit is initialized in the state |0\u27e9, a Hadamard gate is applied to each to prepare this register in an equal superposition of all computational basis states . In the first step of reading out \u03bbm, the phase (e\u2013i\u03bbmt)2k is imprinted on the kth ancilla qubit as (28) This is achieved via \u201cphase-kickback\u201d\u202f (37,280) by applying a controlled-U2k between this qubit and the state preparation register in |\u03c8m\u27e9. Finally, the inverse quantum Fourier transform (see section 4.1.3) is applied to the ancilla register to convert the state to a computational basis state, |x1x2...xT\u27e9, that expresses the binary representation of \u03bbmt/2\u03c0 \u2248 0: x1x2...xT. After execution of the algorithm, measurement of the first register will yield a binary approximation of the eigenenergy \u03bbm with a high probability. It can be shown that, with probability at least 1 \u2013 \u03f5, the estimation of \u03bbm is accurate to bits. (1) Roughly speaking, each ancilla adds another digit of accuracy. Let us now examine the case when the second register is not an eigenstate but rather a superposition \u2211mam|\u03c8\u27e9. One can perform the above analysis and convince oneself that phase estimation will yield \u2211mam|\u03bb\u0303mt/2\u03c0\u27e9|\u03c8m\u27e9, where \u03bb\u0303m is an approximation of the eigenenergy \u03bbm. After measurement of the first register, the second register will collapse in the corresponding eigenstate. The probability of obtaining the eigenstate \u03bbm is |am|2, i.e., the squared overlap between the eigenstate with the prepared superposition. Therefore, it is possible to obtain multiple eigenstates and eigenenergies of H by running QPEA repeatedly with an appropriately chosen initial state |\u03d5\u27e9, highlighting the importance of the state preparation step, as discussed in section 4.2.1. QPEA is closely linked to Hamiltonian simulation algorithms because of the controlled-U2k transformations. Each of these transformations can be decomposed into a sequence of gates by first decomposing U2k into a sequence of gates using Hamiltonian simulation methods from section 4.1, and then augmenting each gate into a controlled gate with a certain ancilla qubit. Accordingly, advances in quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation lead to improvements in the performance of QPEA. We note, however, that certain methods, such as quantum random access memory (quantum RAM), (291) could provide an alternative means of implementing the powers of controlled unitaries. In the standard QPEA, the precision of the estimated eigenvalue is determined by the number of ancilla qubits. As detailed by Aspuru-Guzik et al. (41) and Dob\u0161\u0131\u0301\u010dek et al., (292) the number of ancilla qubits can be greatly reduced while maintaining the same precision by using the iterative quantum phase estimation algorithm (IPEA). Feeding back on the rotation angle of the quantum gates, the phase estimation is improved in each step. Further improvements to the QPEA have been made, (293) including the introduction of Bayesian inference techniques. (294) In this way, the maximum amount of information is extracted from previous measurements in order to inform the rotation angles for the next evaluation of the algorithm. Wiebe and Granade (294) have shown that the eigenenergy and its uncertainty can thus be inferred directly rather than iteratively. This Bayesian estimation approach to QPE has recently been shown experimentally, (295) demonstrating its robustness to noise and decoherence. The use of the time evolution operator in phase estimation is not necessary for the QPEA. Recent work (296\u2212298) has investigated the use of unitaries which encode the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but are easier to implement than e\u2013iHt. As long as the alternative unitary is determined by a known invertible function f of the Hamiltonian, as e\u2013if(H)t, then the measured eigenphase of this unitary can be used to infer the corresponding eigenvalue of H. The unitary ei arccos(H/\u03bb) can be implemented using a quantum walk operator, (204) which requires fewer gates than time evolution. The cost of performing QPE depends on the cost of implementing the operation U = e\u2013if(H)t and the desired error in the estimate of the eigenvalues of H, \u03f5. U is usually implemented by repeating a circuit primitive many times in order to achieve certain accuracy, as illustrated in the previous section for the implementation of e\u2013if(H)t. Designating g(\u03f5) as the number of repetitions required for achieving error O(\u03f5) in the spectrum of H encoded through f(H), we can write the cost of phase estimation as , (298) where C is the cost of implementing a primitive of U, ||\u00b7|| denotes the spectral norm, and ||f\u2032(H)|| is the derivative of the function of the eigenvalues in the operation f(H). Therefore, the particular choice of f(H) determines the final cost of the phase estimation algorithm procedure. Babbush et al. (298) presented a comparison of the cost of implementing QPEA for different proposals of f(H). 4.1.3. Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) Many important quantum algorithms, including Shor\u2019s factoring algorithm, (35) rely on QFT (299) as a subroutine. The QFT underlies the problem of Forrelation, (300) which is said to \u201ccapture the maximal power of quantum computation\u201d. In the context of the QPEA, the QFT is the final step before measuring the ancilla qubits that carry the binary representation of the energy estimate. After the various powers of the eigenphases have been applied to the ancilla qubits (cf. Figure 3), the QFT is used to convert these powers of phases into a binary representation of the eigenenergy on these qubits. The QFT operation can be understood as a unitary change of basis from the computational basis to the Fourier basis. Mathematically, it closely resembles its classical counterpart, the discrete Fourier transform. Given an orthonormal basis |0\u27e9, |1\u27e9, ..., |N\u20131\u27e9, the action of the QFT on a basis state |j\u27e9 is given by (29) We now change to a binary representation j = j12n\u20131 + j22n\u20132 + ... + jn2\u00b0 \u2255 j1j2...jn with n bits, where N = 2n. This allows us to write the state |j\u27e9 as a multi-qubit state, |j1, j2, ..., jn\u27e9. The Fourier transform now assumes the following form: (30) Here, the terms 0.j1j2...jn denote a binary fraction. Computing the QFT requires a sequence of Hadamard gates and controlled rotations. In Figure 4, we show this circuit for four qubits. The following operations are applied to each qubit, successively from top to bottom qubit: a Hadamard gate followed by rotations Rk that are controlled by the qubits below. The rotation angle of the gate Rk is given by e2\u03c0i/2k. As indicated in the figure, the final state of the register is equal to eq 30 up to a reversal of the qubit state order. Although this circuit is complex and dense, it often serves merely as a subroutine within other algorithms. It will usually be written as \u201cQFT\u201d or \u201cFT\u201d in circuit diagrams. The inverse Fourier transform, given by the Hermitian conjugate QFT\u2020, is at least as ubiquitous. Figure 4 Figure 4. Quantum Fourier transform circuit for four qubits, reproduced from Nielsen and Chuang. (1) SWAP gates that reverse the order of the states at the end are not shown. The Hadamard gates are labeled \u201cHad\u201d, gates Rk indicate a rotation over the angle e2\u03c0i/2k, and 0.j1j2...jn denotes a binary fraction. Griffiths and Niu (301) introduced a semiclassical version of QFT that replaces two-qubit gates by adaptive measurements and single-qubit gates. The algorithm was subsequently improved and implemented by Higgins et al. (302) The QFT has also found application in simulating chemical dynamics. The quantum \u201csplit-operator\u201d method (88,290) is analogous to classical exact wave function simulation techniques such as matching pursuit/split-operator Fourier transform. (189) During simulation, the kinetic and interaction/potential energy terms can both be implemented diagonally by applying the QFT to change between the momentum and position basis. It has been shown that this technique leads to quantum speed-ups for both first- and second-quantized problem formulations. (52,88,270,303) 4.2. Determining the Ground-State Energies of Quantum Chemistry Hamiltonians Beneath the massive computational resources devoted to determining properties of molecules and materials lies the electronic structure problem. The importance of this problem derives from the fact that the quantum mechanical eigenenergies and wave functions of the electrons in a molecular system are essential for understanding and predicting industry-relevant quantities, including reaction rates, binding energies, and molecular pathways. In particular, the ground-state energy as a function of the nuclear coordinates (the ground-state energy manifold) of a molecular system is sufficient for gleaning many of these properties. In the late 1990s, quantum computing scientists began to develop approaches for estimating static properties of molecular systems using techniques for simulating time dynamics. The standard approach requires first preparing the quantum computer in the desired quantum state (e.g., an approximation of the ground state of a molecular system) and then extracting the properties of interest (e.g., the ground-state energy) using QPEA. We will review the development of necessary techniques in this section. 4.2.1. State Preparation The first step of any quantum algorithm is the preparation of an initial state. The success of an algorithm for determining ground-state energy depends on the quality of the state preparation. The ansatz for the preparation comes from a classical approximation for a ground state of a given Hamiltonian. Such a state must have two properties. First, the ansatz needs to a have a significant overlap with the ground state. Second, the state has to be efficiently preparable on a quantum computer. Examples of state preparation include the HF state, states from coupled-cluster methods, or states obtained using the method of adiabatic quantum evolution. Quantum computers are particularly useful when classical methods cannot provide answers with high accuracy, such as for strongly correlated systems. In his pioneering work, Zalka (53) considered discretizing the wave function and initializing simulation through a series of controlled rotations. Grover and Rudolph (304) gave a similar algorithm to prepare a state corresponding to an efficiently integrable probability distribution. However, this would be a costly procedure in practice. Abrams and Lloyd (40) focused on state preparation in more detail and described concrete initialization procedures. They pointed out that state preparation is conceptually easier in second quantization, where a Fock state is represented by a simple product state of qubits in {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9} states. Their algorithm begins with all qubits reset to |0...0\u27e9. Fermi statistics are automatically accounted for in the creation and annihilation operators. In first quantization, one must initialize a completely anti-symmetric-state. Anti-symmetrization can be enforced by reversing a suitable sorting algorithm and uncomputing ancillas to make the procedure reversible. (305) Recently, Berry et al. (296) improved the anti-symmetrization procedure by using a sorting network and optimizing components of the algorithm. This algorithm achieves a gate count scaling of O(\u03b7 log \u03b7 log N) and a circuit depth of O(log \u03b7 log log N), where \u03b7 stands for the number of particles and N \u2265 \u03b7 for the number of single-particle basis functions. These are, respectively, a polynomial and an exponential improvement over the previous algorithm. The choice of the initial state for ground-state energy estimation was considered by Aspuru-Guzik et al. (41) HF is the usual starting point for state preparation; however, it might not always have a sufficient overlap with the ground state. Tubman et al. (306) recently investigated the support of HF on the ground state. For small molecules, HF provides a good approximation for the ground state, for example, 0.77 for FeMoCo computed in a small active space. (306) The applicability of other methods was investigated in cases when HF fails. Wang et al. (42) investigated preparing states which are generated with the multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) approach. These states have non-zero overlap with a polynomial number of computational basis states, for which there are efficient methods of preparation. (307) In addition to having better overlap with the ground state, MCSCF states express the electron correlation needed to represent low-level excited states. Kassal et al. (88) combined state preparation with a proposal for preparing the nuclear ground-state wave function to investigate the simulation of a chemical reaction without the BOA. They conclude that simulating the complete nuclear and electronic wave function in a chemical reaction of four or more particles is more efficient than using the BOA. Recently, Tubman et al. (306,308) introduced the adaptive sampling configuration interaction (ASCI) method. ASCI allows for the generation of a small number of determinants while accounting for at least 90% of the wave function. Sugisaki et al. (250) extended the HF state preparation by proposing an algorithm for efficiently preparing an exponential number of Slater determinants. Their proposal is particularly appealing for preparing configuration state functions of open-shell molecules. Adiabatic state preparation (ASP), proposed by Aspuru-Guzik et al., (41) is a method for transforming the initially prepared HF state into an approximation of the FCI ground-state wave function. The idea draws on the method of AQC (309) (cf. section 5.3.1). ASP initializes the register in the HF state. For a second-quantized Hamiltonian, the HF state may be prepared as a product state on the qubits and is, therefore, easy to prepare. (41) The state is then evolved with respect to a circuit that approximates an adiabatic change in the Hamiltonian starting from the HF Hamiltonian and ending with the full Hamiltonian. The adiabatic evolution is then digitally simulated with either a product formula decomposition (287) or a truncated Dyson series. (212,214) If the Hamiltonian and its first derivative are upper-bounded by a constant, then a good approximation of the ground state can be reached for evolution time, , where \u03b3 is the minimum gap (except for pathological cases (310)). This is a so-called adiabatic regime, where the evolved state has support at least 1 \u2013 on the ground state. (311) A number of strategies can be used to increase the support; see Wiebe and Babcock, (312) Lidar et al., (313) and Kieferov\u00e1 and Wiebe (314) for examples. Roland and Cerf (315) proposed a method for reaching the adiabatic regime faster by modifying the speed of Hamiltonian change throughout the evolution. Note that it is not always necessary to reach the adiabatic regime to achieve a significant overlap with the ground state. Symmetries in the spectrum can be exploited even when the gap is exponentially small. (316) Crosson et al. (317) demonstrated that this effect is common even for instances that do not exhibit noticeable symmetries. Standard quantum chemistry methods can be used to lower-bound this gap (41) even though exactly computing it can be demanding. In section 5 we will discuss several other state preparation methods for second quantization which have been introduced for the purpose of the VQE algorithm, but which also apply to the QPEA. Another possibility is to initialize the registers to approximate a thermal state. (41) While creating a thermal state is a computationally difficult problem by itself, an approximation may suffice. Several quantum algorithms can be used for accomplishing this task. (258,283,318\u2212321) 4.2.2. Hamiltonian Simulation for Quantum Chemistry Independently of Lloyd\u2019s quantum simulation algorithm, (50) Zalka (290) introduced a quantum algorithm for simulation of single- and many-body quantum systems. Zalka suggested that a wave function can be discretized into an l-bit quantum register. Green\u2019s function for a quantum particle is then approximated by a product of exponentials with potential and kinetic energy in the exponents. The term corresponding to potential energy is diagonal and thus relatively straightforward to simulate. Kinetic energy terms can be diagonalized using the QFT. Zalka proposed to take similar steps for simulating many-body systems and field theories. Similar ideas also appear in the work by Wiesner. (52) At the same time, Abrams and Lloyd (112) discussed the subject of Hamiltonian simulation in first and second quantization in detail using Trotter decompositions and block diagonalization. They pointed out that the Hamiltonian can be expressed more easily in first quantization but the basis set necessary for expressing the quantum state is smaller in second quantization. Aspuru-Guzik et al. (41) first realized that quantum computers can be used for determining ground-state energies. This work lays the grounds for further research in quantum simulations for quantum chemistry, discussing choices of chemical basis, Hamiltonian mapping, simulation, and energy estimation. To map a many-body system onto a discretized Hamiltonian, one needs to make several choices. First, one must choose how to map the physical Hamiltonian onto the qubits. The upshot is that the additional structure in these Hamiltonians can be exploited to improve the performance over general algorithms. Such improvements should also take constant overheads into account, which are necessary for determining the feasibility of running a useful instance of a problem. Second, in traditional quantum chemistry, it is standard to make several simplifications to the Hamiltonian which yield a finite-dimensional operator that can be handled more easily. The BOA allows one to freeze out the slow-moving ionic degrees of freedom, leaving only the important electronic degrees of freedom. Up to a few exceptions, most quantum algorithms work with this approximation. Third, one needs to make a choice between first and the second quantization. Classical methods for simulating evolution in the first quantization are relatively rare because of the difficulty of storing the wave function. Last, one needs to find a suitable basis. The most common choice of basis for simulating molecules are the Gaussian basis sets of Pople quantum chemistry. (92,207,322) The plane wave basis was long seen as unsuitable because of the high number of orbitals required for approximating a wave function but provides a much simpler representation of the Hamiltonian. However, the recent improvement in the scaling in the number of basis terms may make it a front-runner for quantum chemistry quantum algorithms. (213,298,323,324) Babbush et al. (323) showed that the electronic structure Hamiltonian requires only O(N2) terms in a plane wave basis while O(N4) terms are necessary for Gaussians. Kivlichan et al. further refined this to show that single Trotter steps of the electronic structure Hamiltonian can be simulated in O(N) depth with only nearest-neighbor connectivity on a line. (324) White (325) proposed a so-called Gausslet set that combines Gaussian with wavelet features. The number of choices led to several avenues of research. In second quantization, Whitfield et al. (201) used the Jordan\u2013Wigner transform to create a local Hamiltonian and gave explicit formulas to compute the matrix elements. Their algorithm was then applied to H2, decomposing the operations into elementary gates and simulating their quantum algorithm. A similarly detailed study for LiH with quantum error correction was performed by Jones et al. (326) Simulations in real space have also been proposed. (88) Building on the work of Zalka (53) and Wiesner, (52) they use the QFT to simulate the kinetic term in the Hamiltonian but implement the gate sequence and give complexity estimates for their algorithm. Toloui and Love (270) chose a different approach and used sparse matrix simulation techniques to evolve a state under the configuration interaction matrix. The representation of the Hamiltonian on the basis of Slater determinants (the configuration interaction matrix) is sparse, and therefore techniques from section 4.1 can be used for simulation. This technique is also more space efficient compared to second quantized techniques using Fock states. While the above algorithms are efficient in terms of asymptotic scaling, their practicality for modest-sized quantum computers remained unclear. The advent of quantum simulators brought a number of landmark resource estimate studies. (57,197,201) Wecker et al. (56) investigated the quantum computational resources needed to simulate a molecular Hamiltonian with twice the number of orbitals that can be handled with classical methods. They paint an ambivalent picture for the future of Hamiltonian simulation in chemistry. The pessimistic conclusion was that, while the required spatial resources (i.e., the number of qubits) were just an order of magnitude more than for current devices, the required time resources demanded a quantum computer whose coherence time was many orders of magnitude beyond the capabilities of current devices. The algorithm used in their analysis was a \u201cnaive Trotter decomposition\u201d, similar to the proposal of Aspuru-Guzik et al., (41) which gives a gate count scaling of O(N11) and an empirical scaling of O(N9). The optimistic conclusion of this work, however, was that, through improving quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation, these required time resources could be drastically reduced. The following years saw a sequence of developments (57,58,327) in analyzing and improving the asymptotic scaling of resources needed for performing quantum chemical simulations on a quantum computer, in terms of the numbers of electrons and spin-orbitals. This work drastically reduced the requirements originally estimated by Wecker et al. (56) A series of papers showed how to merge sequential Jordan\u2013Wigner strings to reduce their cost from linear to constant as well how to parallelize evolution under different terms in the Hamiltonian. (57) Poulin et al. (58) empirically studied the cost of simulation for real-world molecules, finding that the cost was closer to O(\u223cN6). Later, it was also demonstrated that the Trotter errors depend on the maximum nuclear charge rather than the number of spin-orbitals. (59) Subsequently, Reiher et al. (197) carried out a detailed study of the computational cost, including the number of costly gates for quantum error correction, for FeMoCo, a model of the nitrogenase enzyme that suggests that it is indeed feasible to employ future error-corrected architectures for the simulation of realistic chemical systems of scientific and industrial interest using Trotter-based approaches. The gate counts were further lowered thanks to advancements in circuit synthesis (89,298,324,328,329) and Hamiltonian simulations. (203,204,212,283,287) Applications of LCU techniques (203) in second quantization were studied by Babbush et al. (207) and in first quantization also by Babbush et al. (206) These techniques exponentially increased the precision of the Hamiltonian simulation. In second quantization, the number of gates required is \u00d5(N5). In first quantization, it is \u00d5(\u03b72N3), where \u03b7 is the number of particles in the system. Importantly, these early LCU-based algorithms have been shown to scale better asymptotically as a function of molecule size than prior Trotter algorithms for quantum simulation. The same scaling holds for the qubitization paradigm with better constant factors. (204) Concepts such as wave function locality (327) can be introduced to further reduce the cost in terms of quantum gates for molecular simulation. The combination of these ideas with sparse algorithms and an intelligent choice of basis functions has been shown to reduce the cost of quantum simulation of chemical systems, but further improvements and generalizations may yet be possible. There are several ideas from the domain of classical molecular electronic structure that can be applied in the field of quantum simulation for further reduction of quantum computational cost. Recent work has studied the chemistry simulation problem in bases where the Coulomb operator is diagonal. (323,324) This allows a representation of the chemistry Hamiltonian with a number of terms scaling quadratically in the number of spin-orbitals, a significant reduction in the number of terms in the Hamiltonian when using MOs. This representation was first used to construct Trotter steps of the chemistry Hamiltonian requiring only a grid of qubits with nearest-neighbor connectivity. (323) Following this, it was shown that Trotter steps exactly N layers of gates deep (with N the number of spin-orbitals) could be performed even with the restriction of the qubits being on a line. (324) This has led to particularly efficient simulation algorithms. For real state simulations, Kivlichan et al. (89) simulated interacting particles and achieved super-polynomially higher accuracy than previous algorithms. Kivlichan et al. (324) gave an algorithm linear in depth and quadratic in the number of two-qubit gates in terms of spin-orbitals. Soon after, Babbush et al. (298) gave an algorithm which has been fully priced to the level of fault-tolerant gates. This algorithm uses qubitization to achieve T complexity O(N + log 1/\u03f5) for Hamiltonian simulation and O(N3/\u03b5 + N2 log 1/\u03f5) for energy estimation. The most recent series of improvements in asymptotic scaling was by Low and Wiebe (212) for second quantization and Babbush et al. (213) for first quantization. Both results use interaction picture simulations (212) and plane wave basis. Simulation in the first quantization gives time complexity \u00d5(N1/3\u03b78/3), provided the volume is proportional to \u03b7, and spatial complexity O(\u03b7 log N). Under the same assumptions, second quantization gives time complexity \u00d5(N2(N/\u03b7)2/3) and spatial complexity O(N log N). [Note: The notation \u00d5 suppresses logarithimic factors. For example, O(x log x) is in this notation represented as \u00d5(x).] Researchers have also considered extending the use of quantum algorithms in exploring nontraditional regimes in quantum chemistry such as relativistic dynamics (330,331) and quantum dynamics beyond the BOA. (88,89,332) As reliable quantum computers begin to come online, there will be a continued demand for improvement of these quantum algorithms. We give a brief overview of simulation techniques used in quantum chemistry with corresponding Hamiltonian simulation algorithms in Figure 5. A summary of query complexity and T-counts for a majority of these algorithms can be found in ref (298). Figure 5 Figure 5. Chronological overview of quantum chemistry simulation algorithms. On the left-hand side we list quantum simulation algorithm grouped by the techniques they use. The right-hand side outlines the improvement for time evolution in quantum chemistry. We indicate the underlying simulation technique with an arrow from the left column to the right. Furthermore, we color-code the Hamiltonian representation: yellow (lighter color) for first quantization and red (darker color) for second quantization. 4.2.3. Measuring Properties of Many-Body Systems The last step of quantum chemistry algorithms is extracting information about the system from the wave function. Such information includes the ground-state energy, scattering amplitudes, electronic charge density or k-particle correlations. (40) In principle, it is possible to estimate any physical quantity or observable that can be expressed through a low-depth quantum circuit and single-qubit measurements. The most sought-for information in these algorithms is the ground-state energy. Zalka (53) sketched a method for preparing a known quantum state and introduced the \u201cvon Neumann trick\u201d for extracting properties from the prepared wave function. Lidar and Wang (43) then applied these techniques to develop an algorithm for determining the thermal rate constant of a chemical reaction. Soon after, Abrams and Lloyd (40) further developed these techniques to specifically apply them toward calculating static properties of a quantum system. In 2005, Aspuru-Guzik et al. (41) adapted these techniques for the electronic structure problem. This allowed the number of qubits in the QPEA ancilla register to be reduced from 20 to 4, enabling the study of quantum algorithms for electronic structure problems on a classical computer. (41) This work shows that even with modest quantum computers of 30\u2013100 error-corrected qubits, ground-state energy calculations of H2O and LiH could be carried out to an accuracy beyond that of classical computers. The essential algorithm underlying this approach is quantum phase estimation and its modifications (see section 4.1.2). An iterative version of QPEA for ground-state estimation was recently introduced by Berry et al. (296) The authors assume that there is an upper bound on the ground-state energy, say from a classical variational method, that is guaranteed to be lower than the energy of the first excited state. Given this assumption, one can perform QPEA gradually, measuring the ancilla qubits sequentially instead of postponing the measurement to the end of the circuit. If the outcome of the QPEA is likely to be a state above this threshold, i.e., not the ground state, it is possible to abort phase estimation and restart the algorithm. QPEA can be also used for estimating the energies of excited states. In the simplest setting, one can use a state that is not an energy eigenstate to sample multiple energies from the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Santagati et al. (336) introduced a more sophisticated technique for approximating excited-state energies. A quantum algorithm for ground-state energy estimation (as discussed here) requires techniques from state preparation (section 4.2.1) and, as a subroutine, simulation (section 4.2.2). Combining the recent developments in all of these areas, Babbush et al. (298) gave detailed resource estimates, or \u201cpricing\u201d, for classically intractable ground-state energy calculations of diamond, graphite, silicon, metallic lithium, and crystalline lithium hydride. Incorporating state-of-the-art error correction methods, they showed that the estimates for the number of gates (which is dominated by the number of T-gates) required to estimate the ground-state energy of these systems is millions of times smaller than the number needed in the methods used earlier for FeMoCo. (197) Without access to fault-tolerant quantum computers, only proof-of-principle quantum chemistry calculations have been demonstrated. In particular, few-qubit simulations, often without error correction, have been carried out in most major architectures used for quantum information. In 2010, Lanyon et al. (251) demonstrated the use of the IPEA to measure the energy of molecular wave functions. In this case, the wave function of molecular hydrogen (H2) in a minimal basis set was encoded in a one-qubit state and the IPEA was realized using a two-qubit photonic chip, calculating the molecular hydrogen spectrum to 20 bits of precision. A similar procedure was applied to H2 using nuclear magnetic resonance Lanyon et al., (251) Du et al., (252) and Dolde et al. (253) and to helium hydride (HeH+) using nitrogen vacancies in diamond. (253) Although these proof-of-principle experiments are groundbreaking, it is not clear how to scale them because of their reliance on Hamiltonians simplifications and tomography. The first scalable demonstration of the IPEA (and the VQE algorithm, as discussed in section 5) employed three superconducting qubits for simulating H2 in a minimal basis and was carried out in 2016. (64) We will explain HQC algorithms better suitable for these devices in the next section. 5. Quantum Algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Despite recent improvements in the resource estimates for fully quantum chemistry algorithms such as the QPEA, the number of gates and circuit depth required for their implementation surpass the capabilities of existing and near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, these early devices, also called \u201cpre-threshold\u201d or NISQ (60) devices, cannot support quantum error correction schemes, which require additional overhead. Such limitations have motivated the development of quantum algorithms that assume the use of an imperfect, noisy quantum computer that can still outperform classical algorithms at providing approximate solutions to relevant problems. An algorithm for a NISQ device requires a low circuit depth that allows for execution within the limited coherence time of the device. Additionally, the quantity of interest should be easy to extract from direct measurements of the quantum states prepared in the device. To make NISQ algorithms as efficient as possible, one can allocate computational tasks between quantum and classical devices based on the inherent advantages of each device. These observations led to the rise of HQC algorithms, which leverage strengths of quantum and classical computation, utilizing each where appropriate. The general layout of HQC algorithms, as illustrated in Figure 6, comprises three steps. The first step is state preparation, achieved by application of a sequence of parametrized quantum gates on an initial state. The second step is measurement, in which the value of the objective function is estimated from measurements performed on the prepared quantum state. The third step involves feedback or optimization on the classical computer to determine new parameters to improve the quality of the state. Figure 6 Figure 6. Outline of the hybrid quantum\u2013classical (HQC) framework. The first part of the algorithm is performed as a quantum circuit on quantum hardware going from an input state to an output state. After measurement the data is passed on to a classical computer where the parameter optimization of the quantum circuit happens. This process allows one to take advantage of the strengths of present-day hardware and to avoid some of the weaknesses. While the algorithms developed within this framework can be implemented on fault-tolerant quantum computers, their original intent is to be implemented on NISQ devices. One particular challenge of this implementation is the presence of errors in the machine, which impacts the quality of the observables measured on the device. While some HQC algorithms have shown robustness against certain types of errors, specific techniques to mitigate noise on NISQ devices have been proposed and started to be incorporated into the implementations of HQC algorithms (337\u2212339) In this section, we will discuss some of the HQC algorithms developed for the simulation of quantum chemistry. See Figure 1 for its connection with previous sections. Specifically, section 5.1 describes the VQE approach, (61,340) the first example of an HQC algorithm to be proposed. VQE applies the time-independent variational principle to optimize the parameters of a quantum circuit implementing an ansatz on the quantum computer. This method provides approximate solutions to the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Section 4.2 describes the variational quantum simulation (VQS) algorithm, which is analogous to VQE for finding approximate solutions to the time-dynamics of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by applying one formulation of the TDVP and other variations of these algorithms for the static problem. Finally, section 5.3 covers algorithms for quantum chemistry simulation developed for non-gate-based near-term quantum devices, which includes devices for AQC and linear optics. 5.1. Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) Algorithm The VQE algorithm is an application of the time-independent variational principle, where the wave function ansatz preparation and energy estimation are both implemented on a quantum device. This paradigm allows for much flexibility in practice because the ansatz can be chosen to take into account the specifications of the quantum hardware. Furthermore, the energy estimation for VQE is performed by a technique called Hamiltonian averaging, described below, that exchanges coherence time with the ability to sample the quantum computer multiple times. These two aspects make VQE a good candidate to simulate the ground states of quantum systems using current and near-term quantum devices. The core of the algorithm can be broken down into the following steps: 1. State Preparation: A parametrized quantum state |\u03a8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9 is prepared on the quantum device. This is achieved by applying a parametrized unitary to an easy-to-prepare initial state |\u03a80\u27e9 (e.g., a computational basis state): U(\u03b8\u20d7)|\u03a80\u27e9 = |\u03a8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9. The parametrized unitary is defined by the choice of ansatz, which should correspond to a family of states that cannot be efficiently represented and manipulated on a classical computer; 2. Energy Estimation: The expectation value of the energy \u27e8H\u27e9(\u03b8\u20d7) is estimated using a Hamiltonian averaging procedure, which involves taking measurements of tensor products of Pauli terms corresponding to the qubit representation of the target Hamiltonian; (63) 3. Classical Feedback: The parameters \u03b8\u20d7 of the quantum state are updated using a classical nonlinear optimization routine; 4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence criteria (e.g., energy) are satisfied. The basic framework of VQE is modular in design such that various types of extensions and improvements are possible. In the following subsections, we describe each VQE step in greater detail, outlining improvements as well as open questions pertaining to the particular step. 5.1.1. Ansatzes for State Preparation The flexibility of the VQE algorithm arises from the ability to choose the parametrized trial state used to approximate the eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian. Consequently, the performance of the algorithm depends largely on the quality and structure of this ansatz. In general, the construction of the ansatz involves preparing an initial state and building upon it using a parametrized quantum circuit, as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7 Figure 7. Illustration of the VQE algorithm. Traditionally, the quantum computer is used to prepare a set of parametrized quantum states followed by applications of rotations Ri \u2208 {I, RX(\u2212 \u03c0/2), RY(\u03c0/2)} depending on the Pauli term of the Hamiltonian to be measured. The classical computer then takes the individual estimates of the Pauli term expectation values \u27e8Pi(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9 and averages them to compute a single value E\u0305(\u03b8\u20d7). This cost function value is fed into an optimization routine, which produces an updated set of parameters \u03b8\u20d7 as input for the quantum circuit in the next optimization loop. This procedure is repeated until the energy converges. We note that recent and future efforts are to improve each VQE component as well as replace certain \u201cclassical\u201d subroutines with quantum counterparts to further leverage the capabilities of quantum computers. Intuitively, a well-chosen ansatz can dramatically improve the capabilities of the classical optimization in the VQE algorithm. One aspect of this intuition was recently formalized by McClean et al. (341) The authors showed that, for sufficiently random circuits, the variational parameter landscape is plagued by the overabundance of \u201cbarren plateaus\u201d, large regions in which the cost function gradient is nearly zero. This implies that using an arbitrary or unstructured ansatz will lead to poor convergence of the optimization routine. This issue can be circumvented by using a physically motivated ansatz that has measurable gradients to thus better guide the optimizer. Another important quality of a circuit ansatz, particularly important for NISQ devices, is the ability to implement it with a high-fidelity, low-depth circuit. The two broad strategies in circuit ansatz design account for these considerations to different extents: 1. physically motivated ansatz (PMA), methods based on or inspired by numerical techniques that systematically approximate the exact electronic wave function; 2. hardware heuristic ansatz (HHA), methods that correspond to parametrized circuits comprising single-qubit rotations and entangling blocks generally chosen to take advantage of specific quantum hardware capabilities. The prototypical example of the PMA category is the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz, which consists of a systematic expansion that approximates the exact many-electron wave function as the excitation rank of the operators in the cluster operator increases. While the UCC ansatz is intractable to express with a classical computer, (342\u2212344) a Trotter\u2013Suzuki decomposition approximation (cf. section 2.3) of this transformation can be implemented efficiently on a quantum computer. (61,340) The relatively large number of parameters and long circuit depth required to implement UCC motivated the development of alternative approaches. In particular, Wecker et al. proposed a Hamiltonian variational ansatz approach, (62) which consists of a parametrized version of the circuit implementing Hamiltonian simulation for the target Hamiltonian. This approach allows for a reduction in the number of variational parameters, however, the depth of the circuit depends on the complexity of the target Hamiltonian. When combined with the simplified representations of the Hamiltonian described in the previous section, (323) the Hamiltonian variational method can be used to construct variational circuits with depth equal to the number of spin-orbitals for a linear qubit architecture, using the fermionic swap network. (324) Independently, Dallaire-Demers et al. (345) proposed a related PMA ansatz with the same scaling in depth based on a circuit employed to prepare fermionic Gaussian states (FGSs) on a quantum register, called the low-depth circuit ansatz (LDCA). The LDCA ansatz comprises parallel layers of nearest-neighbor matchgates augmented by ZZ interactions. On the other hand, HHA approaches have been mainly motivated by limitations of existing quantum hardware. The general structure of the quantum circuits employed as HHA comprises two interleaved blocks: the first one comprising single-qubit rotations and the second one composed of fixed entangling operations that can be easily executed when taking into account particular constraints of the quantum hardware employed. (67) This concept was applied in the experimental demonstration of the VQE protocol for small molecules, (67) and it has been recently refined using sets of gates that conserve particle number. (346) Although these approaches can be implemented more easily than existing PMA on NISQ devices, to date, there lacks theoretical evidence one way or the other regarding their ability to efficiently approximate many-electron wave functions. Evidently, significant progress has been made in the development and design of ansatzes. However, the existence of a general formulation to construct meaningful ansatzes for particular target Hamiltonians remains an open question. In what follows we describe in more detail some of the ansatzes outlined above. Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) Traditional coupled-cluster (CC) methods have long been considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d of quantum chemistry because they offer chemically accurate results for a variety of systems, including molecules near equilibrium, and because they are tractable on classical computers. Recall that the ansatz for the traditional coupled-cluster method can be written as (31) where |\u03a60\u27e9 is a reference state, usually the solution to the HF equations, and T corresponds to excitation operators of different excitation rank defined in terms of fermionic annihilation and creation operators as (32) (33) (34) where the occ and virt spaces are defined as the occupied and unoccupied sites in the reference state and \u03b7 is the number of electrons in the system. For practical implementations on classical computers, T is usually truncated to lower excitation ranks, e.g., single (T1) and double (T2) excitations. This allows one to find optimal CC amplitudes by projecting the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the form (35) against a set of configurations {\u27e8\u03bc|}. This set spans the space of all the states that can be reached by applying the truncated cluster operator T linearly to the reference state. The similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, e\u2013TH eT, can be expanded using the Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff (BCH) formula. The expansion applied to eq 35 has a finite truncation leading to a finite set of nonlinear equations for the CC energy and amplitudes. These equations are then solved using standard numerical methods such as Newton\u2019s approach. (92) A method such as CCSD(T) (where the effect of triple excitations is included using perturbation theory) suffices to achieve chemical accuracy for energies of molecules near equilibrium. Unfortunately the scaling of this approach, O(N7), limits its applicability to small molecules. Unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) is an alternative CC formulation, constructed as (36) where the T operator is replaced by the anti-Hermitian operator T \u2013 T\u2020. Consequently, the corresponding CC operator is unitary and the formulation is variational, which offers an advantage compared to standard CC. However, UCC is not a practical ansatz in classical quantum chemistry because the BCH expansion of the similarity transformed Hamiltonian, e\u2013(T\u2013T\u2020)H eT\u2013T\u2020, does not terminate. (344) Fortunately, unitary operations such as eT\u2013T\u2020 are natural operations on quantum computers. They can be readily implemented by mapping fermionic excitation operators to qubit operators and applying the Trotter\u2013Suzuki decomposition to the cluster operator. The different Trotter approximations to the UCC operator constitute a family of CC-inspired ansatz that can be implemented on a quantum computer using standard circuit compilation techniques for exponentiating Pauli matrices. (1) Given the inherent advantage in implementing the ansatz as well as the high accuracies of CC methods, the application of the UCC ansatz truncated up to single and double excitations (UCCSD) has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. (61,62,69,70,72,345\u2212348) In the case of a Trotterized implementation of UCCSD, the ansatz parameters correspond to the cluster amplitudes, whose number scales as O(N2\u03b72) < O(N4). Correspondingly, a serial implementation of these terms would result in a scaling of the number of gates of O(fN4), where f indicates the number of gates required for implementing each term. The scaling of f with N depends on the fermion-to-qubit mapping employed: in the case of the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev transformation f \u2208 O(log(N)), while in the case of Jordan\u2013Wigner f \u2208 O(N) (see Appendix B). Similarly, the circuit depth can be upper-bounded to O(fN4), which corresponds to a serial execution; however, this can be improved depending on the connectivity constraints of the hardware and the ability to parallelize operations in the quantum registers. For architectures with arbitrary connectivity that allow parallelization, some strategies developed for Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution (58) could save up to a linear factor in depth using a constant number of ancilla qubits when a Jordan\u2013Wigner mapping is used. The scaling in the number of parameters of the UCCSD ansatz poses a challenge for typical optimization strategies, as the number of amplitudes can easily increase to the order of thousands for systems with tens of spin-orbitals and half-filling. To reduce this cost, practical applications of UCCSD must consider typical strategies employed in classical quantum chemistry to prioritize those excitation operators that are more relevant for achieving accuracy. Some of these strategies include limiting the calculation to active spaces, freezing core orbitals, applying spin-symmetry constraints, and discarding operators with low amplitudes based on classical efficient approximations, e.g., M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory. (63,346,348) The last strategy also has the potential to significantly reduce the number of gates required and provides approximate amplitudes for initializing the optimization, which has been pointed out as critical for improving convergence. (348) Most numerical demonstrations of UCCSD applied to VQE have explored the impact of different optimization approaches, including both gradient-free and gradient-based methods, as described in more detail in section 5.1.3. In practice, gradient-based methods can be implemented using either numerical or analytical gradients. It has been pointed out that analytical gradients require orders-of-magnitude fewer measurements than numerical gradients. (348) The effect of the number of Trotter steps has been also investigated, indicating that the accuracy of the exact implementation of the UCCSD exponential operator is virtually the same as that obtained with Trotterized UCCSD for different Trotter numbers. This can be understood considering that different Trotterized versions of UCCSD correspond to different ansatzes and the variational optimization tends to compensate the differences between the non-Trotterized and the Trotterized version, which would have different optimal amplitudes. UCCSD has been implemented in combination with different basis set representations of the chemistry Hamiltonian, including the particle/hole basis (346) and the Bogoliubov basis. (345) The latter allows for the application of UCC to Hamiltonians with pairing fields, extending the range of applicability of VQE to problems in condensed matter and nuclear physics. Finally, UCCSD has been demonstrated experimentally for HeH+ using a single trapped ion, (70) for H2 on a superconducting quantum computer, (64) for H2 and LiH on an ion-trapped quantum computer (72) and for the wave function of a deuterium nucleus using cloud quantum computing. (69) Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz The Hamiltonian variational approach, proposed by Wecker et al., (56) defines a strategy for building variational ansatzes for arbitrary Hamiltonians. The general idea is described as follows: consider a target Hamiltonian that can be written as a sum of local terms, H = \u2211ihiOi, where hi is a scalar and Oi is a local operator. Furthermore, the terms in this Hamiltonian can be grouped into arbitrary subsets, H = \u2211jHj. The criteria for grouping can differ depending on the target Hamiltonian, as shown below. The variational ansatz is defined as (37) where |\u03a80\u27e9 can be chosen to match the desired symmetry properties of the target ground state, UHk(\u03b8kb) = exp(\u03b8kbHj), \u03b8 is a vector grouping the scalar variational parameters to be minimized [\u03b811, ..., \u03b8kb, ..., \u03b8jS], and S is the number of repetitions of the circuit block and can be varied to control the approximation accuracy. Notice that in the implementation, each term UHk(\u03b8kb) has to be further broken down into a product of exponentials of individuals terms since Hj may be a sum of terms. If all the terms within a subset were to commute, this could be implemented exactly. The definition of the circuit in the product of eq 37 resembles a first-order Trotterized evolution under the Hamiltonian, where now the terms have been multiplied by arbitrary parameters. Other versions of eq 37 can be obtained by mimicking higher-order Trotter\u2013Suzuki formulas. The Hamiltonian variational approach is inspired by both ASP and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). (349,350) In ASP, the ground state of a target Hamiltonian, H1, is obtained by adiabatically evolving the ground state of a Hamiltonian H0, |\u03a80\u27e9, that is easy to prepare. This process assumes that the transition between H0 and H1 is continuous and that the ground-state energy of \u03bbH0 + (1 \u2013 \u03bb)H1 remains sufficiently separated from the first-excited-state energy during the preparation (see section 5.3.1 for discussion of the importance of the \u201cenergy gap\u201d remaining large). In practice, ASP is implemented by rotating the initial state by a time-dependent Hamiltonian of the form H(t) = A(t)H0 + B(t)H1, where A(t) and B(t) are continuous functions defining the relative weights between the initial Hamiltonian and the target one, which constitutes the annealing schedule. This evolution is performed during some annealing time t and is discretized into S steps of size , such that the annealing becomes a sequence of S unitary rotations by Hamiltonians interpolating between H0 and H1. If the initial and target Hamiltonian are both expressed as a sum over the same Hamiltonian terms, Hi = \u2211jhjiOj, then the evolution in eq 37 can be seen as analogous to a discretized ASP, where the angles of the rotations are obtained by a variational optimization instead of being fixed by a predefined annealing schedule. A related idea is the concept of adiabatically parametrized states, introduced by McClean et al., (63) where the functions defining the annealing schedule are parametrized and subsequently optimized using variational minimization. Wecker et al. (62) also proposed two different optimization strategies for minimizing the energy of the ansatz defined in eq 37. The first approach, described as global variational, corresponds to the simultaneous optimization of all the parameters in the ansatz, given a fixed value of S. The second approach, called annealed variational, is also inspired by discretized ASP. It consists of performing a block-by-block optimization that starts by optimizing the ansatz with S = 1. The state resulting from this optimization, |\u03a8(1)\u27e9, is used as the initial state for an optimization with another variational circuit with S = 1, obtaining a new state, |\u03a8(2)\u27e9. This process is repeated until S steps have been completed. The final parameters could be further refined by a global optimization, or at each step k in the sequential optimization a global optimization could be applied. The block-by-block optimization procedure improves convergence and is analogous to the segment-by-segment pre-training strategy employed in machine learning to avoid barren plateaus in the optimization of neural networks. (351,352) The performance of the Hamiltonian variational approach applied to the Fermi\u2013Hubbard model in a 2D lattice and the electronic structure Hamiltonian is analyzed in ref (62). In the first case, the target Hamiltonian has the form (38) where ai,\u03c3\u2020 and ai,\u03c3 respectively create and annihilate an electron at site i with spin \u03c3 \u2208 {\u2191,\u2193}. The summation in the first term runs over nearest neighbors, denoted as \u27e8i,j\u27e9. In this case, the Hubbard Hamiltonian is divided as H = hh + hv + hU, where hh and hv are the sums of hopping terms in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, and hU is the repulsion term. The authors use a second-order Trotter formula for the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, (39) where UX(\u03b8X) denotes a Trotter approximation to exp(i\u03b8XhX) where X \u2208 {U, h, v}. The initial state |\u03a80\u27e9 is chosen to be in the correct spin sector, e.g., a computational state with equal number of spin-up and spin-down qubits for singlet ground states. For the application to the electronic structure Hamiltonian, the terms are separated into three groups corresponding to diagonal terms, hopping terms, and exchange terms as follows: (40) (41) (42) where the sums are taken with p, q, r, s all distinct from one another. In this case the ansatz is built as (43) where UX(\u03b8X) denotes a Trotter approximation to exp(i\u03b8XhX), where X \u2208 {ex, hop, diag }. The initial state is chosen to be the ground state of Hdiag, and the basis is a HF basis such that Hhop|\u03a80\u27e9 = 0. Both eqs 39 and 40 were numerically tested on lattices of size 2\u00d7N, with N = 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12, and for small molecules such as HeH+, H2O, BeH2, and hydrogen chains (Hx with x \u2208 {6, 8, 10}). The results show that this strategy can achieve good overlaps with the ground state for values of S varying between 3 and 20 (see Wecker et al. (62)). However, it remains to be investigated how S would scale with the size of the system and the accuracy required for generic Hamiltonians. The Hamiltonian variational approach greatly reduces the number of variational parameters, which eases the optimization. In the case of the Hubbard model, it also provides an ansatz that scales only linearly with the size of the system and therefore is a good candidate for experimental demonstration in near-term devices. However, in the case of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians, the depth of the corresponding ansatz is directly related to the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, which scales formally as O(N4). This scaling might vary depending on the analytical properties of the basis sets employed to represent the Hamiltonian. In the case of Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs), which are the most popular basis sets in quantum chemistry, the number of non-negligible terms scales nearly quadratically for systems of sufficient size, as explained in more detail in section 5.1.2. The sizes at which this scaling is observed, however, depends on the nature of the system and the basis set and might correspond to tens to hundreds of angstroms. (92,327) This fact has motivated the exploration of alternative basis sets that can show more favorable scalings and therefore facilitate the computation. In particular, Babbush et al. have proposed to use a dual form of the plane wave basis (323) which diagonalizes the potential operator, leading to the following representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian that has only O(N2) terms: (44) where np is the number operator, \u03b6j are nuclei charges, and k\u03bd is a vector of the plane wave frequencies at the harmonics of the computational cell in three dimensions, with volume \u03a9. Here, \u03c3 is the spin degree of freedom and \u03bd is a three-dimensional vector of integers with elements in [\u2212N1/3, N1/3]. Letter indices with a prime symbol denote orbitals, while regular letters indicate spin-orbitals. The plane wave dual basis set can be viewed as a discrete variable representation and is particularly suited for periodic systems. When mapped to qubit operators, the Hamiltonian in eq 44 is equivalent to the following local Hamiltonian in the Jordan\u2013Wigner representation: (45) Notice that this Hamiltonian also encompasses the Fermi\u2013Hubbard Hamiltonian and can be readily combined with the Hamiltonian variational strategy to produce a variational ansatz. In Babbush et al., (323) this idea is developed to propose a VQE simulation for Jellium, that requires depth O(NS) and optimizes only over O(N) parameters by exploiting the translational invariance of this system. Finally, Kivlichan et al. (324) demonstrated that a single Trotter step of the Hamiltonian in eq 44 can be implemented with a circuit of depth N using a fermionic swap network, which has a constant improvement with respect to the proposal in Babbush et al. (323) and is conjectured to be optimal. In the particular case of the Fermi\u2013Hubbard Hamiltonian, the scaling is further reduced to . The main insight of this proposal is that when the Jordan\u2013Wigner transformation acts on the terms (ap\u2020aq + aq\u2020ap), it produces terms of locality |p \u2013 q| + 1, which has significant overhead when mapped to a circuit. To get rid of this problem, the authors propose to execute the Trotter step by executing operations only on nearest neighbor qubits, and then swapping the spin-orbital indexes, until all the N(N \u2013 1)/2 interactions between spin-orbitals are implemented. The swapping is performed using the fermionic-SWAP (f-SWAP) gate, defined as (46) Furthermore, rotations by the interaction and repulsion terms between orbitals with indexes p and q could be implemented together with the f-SWAP gates, forming the so-called fermionic simulation gate, (47) (48) The fermionic swap network circuit could be readily employed in combination with the Hamiltonian variational strategy to create a variational ansatz for preparing ground states of the Hamiltonian of eq 44 using VQE. For example, one could adopt a parametrization with distinct variables for the interaction and the hopping terms, in analogy with eq 39 Alternatively, one could free the T and V terms as variational parameters, which scales as O(N2) compared to O(N4) of the UCCSD ansatz. Low Depth Circuit Ansatz (LDCA) Another ansatz for state preparation in VQE is the so-called LDCA proposed by Dallaire-Demers et al. (345) This ansatz is inspired by a circuit for preparing fermionic Gaussian states (FGSs) on quantum computers. In what follows, we briefly describe FGSs and some of the techniques for preparing these states in quantum registers before describing the LDCA. FGSs are states of which the density operators can be expressed as an exponential of a quadratic function of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. Typical single determinant ansatzes, such as the Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) and the Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schreiffer (BCS) states for superconductivity, are FGSs. The advantage of simulating this family of states is that they are completely characterized by a quadratic number of parameters and therefore, can be manipulated efficiently on a classical computer. A particularly convenient representation of an FGS is via its covariance matrix (\u0393), which corresponds to a 2N\u00d72N matrix: (49) where \u03b3j = aj\u2020 + aj and \u03b3j\u2020 = \u2212i(aj\u2020 \u2013 aj) correspond to Majorana operators and \u03c1 is the corresponding FGSs. For pure states, i\u0393 \u2013 1 \u2264 0 and \u03932 = \u22121. Importantly, any expectation value of an operator can be computed from the covariance matrix as (50) where 1 \u2264 j1 < ... < j2p \u2264 2N, \u0393|j1...j2p is the corresponding submatrix of \u0393, and (51) is the Pfaffian of a 2N\u00d72N matrix defined from the symmetric group S2N and sgn(s) is the signature of the permutation s. Similarly, the time evolution of a state can also be described via the covariance matrix. FGSs have special properties, including being ground states of quadratic Hamiltonians of the form H = \u2211pqhpq\u03b3p\u03b3q. In addition, pure FGSs can be brought into the form |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u220fk=12N(uk + vkak\u2020ak\u2020)|0\u27e9, where |vk|2 + |uk|2 = 1, using an appropriate basis set transformation. Finally, we point out that FGSs also include thermal states of quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians, and in the case where the number of particles is well-defined, FGSs correspond to Slater determinants. Preparing FGSs on a quantum computer is often the first step in the quantum simulation of fermionic Hamiltonians, whether QPE or variational schemes such as VQE are employed. Methods for preparing Slater determinants and general FGSs employ a quadratic number of gates. (324,345,353,354) In the case of Slater determinants, the preparation is often described in terms of a rotation applied to a single determinant, (52) where ck\u2020 and ck represent fermionic operators in an easy-to-prepare basis (e.g., the computational basis). The transformation is a 2N\u00d72N matrix; however, it is equivalent to rotating the basis, (53) where \u03d5p, ap\u2020, and ap are spin-orbitals and fermionic operators in the rotated basis and u is an N\u00d7N unitary matrix. The operator is related to u via (54) can be decomposed into a sequence of Givens rotations by applying a QR decomposition scheme to u, generating a circuit composed of two-qubit gates corresponding to these Givens rotations applied on neighboring qubits. (324,353) In the case of FGSs, there exist two related schemes. Jiang et al. (353) proposed a method that specifies the FGSs as the corresponding quadratic fermionic Hamiltonian for which the target FGSs are ground states. The Hamiltonian is (55) where \u03a3 = \u03a3\u2020 and \u0394 = \u2212\u0394\u2020 are complex matrices. This Hamiltonian is brought into its diagonal form using standard methods, yielding (56) where C is a constant and bj and bj\u2020 are new fermionic operators. The transformation that maps the original fermionic operators to the new ones is described by the 2N\u00d72N matrix W, defined by (57) Using matrix manipulation on W, the corresponding circuit implementing this transformation, , can be decomposed into a sequence of (N \u2013 1)N/2 Givens rotations applied on neighboring qubits and N particle\u2013hole transformations implemented as single-qubit rotations. This circuit can be parallelized in depth O(N). (353) Independently, Dallaire-Demers et al. (345) proposed a method that prepares FGSs specified by their corresponding covariance matrix. The prepared state has the form (58) where |vac\u27e9 is the Fock vacuum, the operators bk and their Hermitian conjugates, bk\u2020, correspond to Bogoliubov operators which are defined as in eq 57, and ck\u2020 and ck are the original fermionic operators with respect to the Fock vacuum. From the covariance matrix it is possible to obtain the corresponding W matrix, which is later decomposed into 2N(N \u2013 1) matchgates acting on neighboring qubits and N local rotations, using the Hoffmann algorithm. (355) The final circuit can be parallelized such that its depth scales only as O(N). Notice that both methods (345,353) achieve the same scaling but differ in the types of gates and the numerical methods employed to compute the angles of the preparation circuits. While the other linear-depth methods have better constant factors, their circuits are less general. (324,345,353) The circuit requires a single layer of single-qubit rotations followed by blocks of neighboring matchgates, Gij(k), acting on qubits i and j. The matchgates can be decomposed into a product of two-qubit evolutions under XX, XY, YX, and YY, with the evolution times obtainable from the covariance matrix. Each parallel cycle of the LDCA circuit interleaves gates between even and odd neighboring qubits: (59) There are cycles in total, i.e., (60) such that the transformation W can be composed as (61) Dallaire-Demers et al. (345) suggested that a similar circuit template could be used to create a variational ansatz by complementing the list of matchgates with neighboring ZZ interactions, allowing for the preparation of non-Gaussian fermionic states. A similar idea has been used to design ansatzes for preparing non-Gaussian states efficiently on classical computers, with high success. (356) The so-called low depth circuit ansatz (LDCA), acts on the quasiparticle vacuum state for the Bogoliubov picture, such that the initial states correspond to the generalized HF optimal state for the VQE target Hamiltonian. The circuit comprises L cycles of variational blocks composed of the simulation gates Kij, where each Kij is a product of evolutions under YX, XY, ZZ, YY, and XX with the evolution times again given by the covariance matrix. Each layer k applies variational rotations in parallel, first on the even pairs and then on the odd pairs, such that (62) A cycle l is composed of layers, in analogy with the FGSs preparation: (63) Finally, the L cycles are assembled sequentially to form the complete variational ansatz, (64) with only one round of variational phase rotations, (65) The variational state therefore has the form (66) where UBog is the transformation corresponding to the optimal Bogoliubov transformation for the VQE target Hamiltonian, which can be included if measuring the Hamiltonian is more efficient in the original basis. There are five variational angles per Kij(k, l) and N \u2013 1 of those terms per layer. Since each cycle has layers, an L-cycle circuit has + N variational angles, the extra term arising from the round of Z rotations. Considering parallelization, the final circuit depth is + 4 when we account for UBog\u2020 and the initial round of single-qubit X gates. The linear scaling of the depth of LDCA makes it a viable option for implementation on near-term NISQ devices. The same global variational and annealed variational optimization approaches employed in the optimization of Hamiltonian variational approaches can be applied in this case. The LDCA also has the advantage of being able to treat systems where the number of particles is not conserved, such as superconductors, and therefore expands the range of applications of VQE to problems in condensed matter physics. For the same reason, the optimization of the energy must be performed by constraining the number of particles in those cases where the number of particles is conserved, e.g., in molecular systems. Numerical studies of LDCA have shown great promise. In the original paper, (345) the authors applied LDCA to a system with eight qubits, corresponding to a 2\u00d72 Fermi\u2013Hubbard lattice and an extended Fermi\u2013Hubbard model describing the isomerization of cyclobutadiene. The results demonstrated the ability of LDCA to describe the ground states of these systems in both weakly correlated and strongly correlated regimes. More recently, the LDCA has been applied to lithium hydride, (357) showing superior accuracy compared to hardware efficient ansatz. Still, further numerical benchmarks and theoretical analysis are required to better understand the scaling of the number of layers with the accuracy of the ansatz. Finally, we point out that approaches analogous to LDCA could be developed by interleaving the blocks of Givens rotations obtained in the procedure proposed by Jiang et al., (353) with ZZ interactions and optimizing the parameters in the Givens rotations variationally. In the same vein we note some similarities between the LDCA circuit and the fermionic swap network circuit proposed in the context of Hamiltonian evolution for eq 44. The circuits for the fermionic swap network comprise fermionic swap gates applied on neighboring qubits that implement evolution under ZZ, Z, XX and YY. This is very similar to the construction of the LDCA circuit with the difference that LDCA also implements XY and YX interactions, which do not conserve the number of particles. This suggests that the fermionic swap network circuit could be employed as a template for variational ansatz with potentially similar results as those observed for LDCA. Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA) This is a specific instance of the HHA class mentioned previously. These ansatzes comprise a series of parametrized quantum circuits originally motivated by the limitations of existing NISQ hardware. (67) The general construction of these circuits comprises L entangling blocks, each block containing parametrized gates chosen to facilitate implementation according to the limitations in fidelity and connectivity of the hardware employed for the simulation. In general, these circuits can be expressed as (67) where the variational parameters correspond to \u03b8 = [\u03b80, ..., \u03b8L\u20131, \u03b8L], U(k) denotes the kth entangling block, and |\u03a80\u27e9 is a suitable initial state. In the first example of this ansatz, (67) each entangling block comprised a single layer of parametrized single-qubit rotations followed by a fixed set of entangling two-qubit gates, specially chosen for a six-qubit quantum processor employed in the experiment. The circuit has the following form: (68) where Eent denotes a fixed set of two-qubit gates. In this case, the total number of parameters scales as 3N(L+2). For the experiment, the qubit register was initialized with the |0\u27e9\u2297N state. More recently, Barkoutsos et al. (346) proposed a new set of entangling blocks. Two of these new blocks are designed to implement number-conserving operators, more suitable for simulations of molecular systems, and can be implemented natively on superconducting processor with transmon qubits. (358\u2212360) The third type of entangling block introduced by Barkoutsos et al. (346) is similar to the original proposal (eq 68), with Eent being a circuit with all-to-all CNOT gates and with single-qubit rotations corresponding to Rz. For these new ansatzes, the HF state was employed as initial state in the VQE calculation. A different approach that stays close to the hardware was proposed by Ryabinkin et al. (361) The qubit coupled-cluster method (QCC) implements a coupled-cluster ansatz in the qubit space without reference to fermionic wave functions. This allows for a very cost-effective implementation that results in accurate energies after variational optimization. The method was later augmented (362) with Lagrangian multipliers and postprocessing procedures to account for the lack of correct symmetries in the wave functions. The accuracy of HEA have been tested both experimentally (67,362) and numerically (346,361) for small molecular systems including H2, LiH, BeH2 and H2O. These implementations have incorporated the use of active spaces and methodologies for reducing the number of qubits in the Hamiltonian. (363) Since not all the HEA ansatzes conserve the number of particles, a constrained minimization method must be employed in cases where the number of particles is conserved, using the number of particles as a constraint. In general, in order to approach the accuracy of methods like UCCSD, the number of layers has to grow rapidly, even to an extent that the number of parameters approaches or surpasses the size of the Hilbert space. (346) As in the case of other variational algorithms, a better understanding of the scaling of accuracy with the number of layers for different versions of this family of ansatzes is required. Alternative Approaches to State Preparation In gate-model quantum computers, it is important to first initialize the computer into a known state, and to do so with high accuracy. Typically, the form of the initial state is a product state such as |0...0\u27e9, which is simple to prepare because each qubit can be addressed individually. Once an initial state is prepared, the evolution of the quantum state through the computer is determined by the sequence of gates that the algorithm calls for. While improving circuit ansatzes help reduce the overhead in the depth of a quantum circuit after the quantum computer has been initialized, there can be an advantage in preparing more complicated initial states that are closer to the final state. For example, VQE relies on ultimately preparing (and then measuring) an entangled state of many qubits. Thus, an initial state that is already highly entangled could be advantageous to preparing a desired ground state. Despite rapid advances in both theory and experiment for quantum computing, significant efforts must be dedicated toward maximizing the use of NISQ devices while accounting for their limitations. As we have reviewed earlier in this section, the choice/design of the ansatz is a crucial component for algorithmic performance. One particular strategy for lowering the resource requirements for expressing quantum data (of quantum states) is through the use of the quantum autoencoder (QAE) that combines ideas from both quantum simulation and quantum machine learning. Specifically, the QAE (364) is an HQC algorithm that encodes a set of quantum states using a fewer number of quantum bits, as shown in Figure 8. For instance, the wave function of molecular hydrogen (in the minimal basis) at a particular bond length requires four qubits to represent the occupancy of the ground state. However, the set of these ground states lives on only a one-dimensional manifold in the four-qubit space. This means that the quantum information corresponding to this four-qubit state can be represented by a single qubit. The task of a QAE is to find a unitary mapping that coherently maps this four-qubit state to a single qubit. The payoff for finding such a unitary mapping is that it enables a type of generative modeling approach called Compressed Unsupervised State Preparation (CUSP) that explores the latent space to find a shorter pathway to a desired ground state. (365) CUSP uses an existing VQE circuit ansatz, together with a QAE, to generate a new ansatz that is shorter in gate depth and hence less vulnerable to noise on a NISQ computer, resulting in more accurate VQE energies. Figure 8 Figure 8. (a) Illustration of the quantum autoencoder (QAE) algorithm. After the training set of quantum states is prepared, a variational circuit comprised of encoding and decoding components is trained using measurements from either the trash state or the final decoded state. Once successfully trained, the encoding circuit of the overall QAE circuit can compress a set of n-qubit states to m-qubit states, where m \u2264 n. (b) A classical 4-2-4 autoencoder. 5.1.2. Energy Estimation in VQE After preparing the parametrized trial state |\u03a8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9, the next stage for the VQE algorithm is to estimate the expectation value of the target Hamiltonian, E(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u27e8\u03a8(\u03b8\u20d7)|H|\u03a8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9. In practice, this implies estimating the value of E(\u03b8\u20d7) up to a given precision, \u03f5. Arguably, the most common application of ab initio quantum chemistry is the calculation of thermochemical properties, such as reaction rates and binding energies. Reaction rates, for example, are exponentially sensitive to changes in energy: a change of only 1.4 kcal/mol in the free energy (which is proportional to the energy) generates a change of 1 order of magnitude in the estimate of a reaction rate. This sensitivity motivates the concept of chemical accuracy, which is a standard for the desired energy accuracy of 1 kcal/mol (1.59 \u00d7 10\u20133 hartree, 43.3 meV) or less. (92) This requirement sets an upper bound to the precision, \u03f5, for energy estimation in VQE and in general to any quantum simulation algorithm for chemistry. One possible approach to estimating the energy is the PEA approach, which provides an estimate of the energy in a single state preparation with cost for error tolerance \u03f5. Unfortunately, to guarantee the success of PEA estimation, all the operations must be executed fully coherently on the quantum computer, which is only possible using quantum error correction. This requirement is unattainable on NISQ devices because the operations available on these devices are too error-prone to achieve useful quantum error correction. To avoid the overhead of PEA, Peruzzo et al. (61) suggested an alternative scheme called Hamiltonian averaging for computing the expectation value of local Hamiltonians. Hamiltonian Averaging The basic idea behind this approach is that any Hermitian operator, such as the electronic structure Hamiltonian, can be decomposed on the basis of Pauli operators. Therefore, any Hermitian operator can be written as (69) and by linearity the expectation value can be expressed as (70) where \u03c3\u03b11\u03b12...i1i2... represent a product of Pauli matrices, where ij indicates the type of Pauli matrix and \u03b1j qubit indices. In the case of approximation based on second quantized approaches, the Hamiltonian is directly obtained as a sum of Pauli operators after a mapping from fermions to qubits is applied (see Appendix B). Unlike the PEA approach, where each k-local Pauli operator requires O(k) circuit depth for the implementation, Hamiltonian averaging only adds a constant factor to the state preparation procedure, assuming parallel rotation and orbital readout is available. However, not all the Hamiltonian terms can be measured simultaneously, which increases the number of measurements needed to achieve a given accuracy. In general, the number of state preparations and measurement cycles required to converge the energy to a precision \u03f5 will scale roughly as M2/\u03f52, where M is the number of terms in the Pauli decomposition of the Hamiltonian. A more detailed analysis of the number of measurements takes into consideration the structure of the Hamiltonian terms. In general, any Hamiltonian for simulation can be written as H = \u2211iMhiOi, where {hi} represents the set of Hamiltonian coefficients and {Oi} corresponds to a set of Pauli operators. Assuming that all the terms are measured independently, i.e., Cov(\u27e8Oi\u27e9, \u27e8Oj\u27e9) = 0 \u2200 i \u2260 j), the total variance of the estimator of \u27e8H\u27e9 will be given by the sum of the variances of the individual Hamiltonian terms: (71) where Var(\u27e8Oi\u27e9) denotes the variance of the estimator of \u27e8Oi\u27e9. In practice, we need to define the precision at which each term is going to be measured. A simple approach would be to measure all the terms to the same accuracy, i.e., taking \u03f5i2 = . Considering that Var(Oi) = 1 \u2013 \u27e8Oi\u27e92 = \u03c3i2, where \u03c3i is the precision of \u27e8Oi\u27e9, we can estimate the required number of measurements, m, as (72) A more practical approach is to choose \u03f5i2 to be proportional to |hi|. This reduces the estimate in the number of measurements to (73) which can be proved to be optimal by application of the Lagrange conditions. (366) Therefore, the effective number of measurements will be dependent on the magnitude of the Hamiltonian coefficients, which is the case of electronic structure correspond to linear combinations of one-electron and two-electron integrals, which in turn depend on the choice of basis set for the calculation (see Appendix A for an introduction to basis sets). As noted before, the electronic structure Hamiltonians by definition have O(N4) terms; however, on a local basis the number of non-negligible terms scales as O(N2), and advanced techniques can evaluate these contributions in O(N) time. This is the basis of linear scaling methods employed in quantum chemistry. (92,367) In the particular case of Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs), this scaling can be verified by considering the cutoffs due to exponentially vanishing overlaps between GTOs and bounds on the largest integral to estimate the number of non-vanishing terms in the Hamiltonian. (92,327) Although this scaling is guaranteed asymptotically, in practice, the molecular size at which this scaling is observed depends on the type of atoms in the system and the family of basis set used. (327) This analysis applied to Hamiltonian averaging showed that the number of measurements required for achieving precision \u03f5 in the energy is expected to scale as O(N6/\u03f52) for molecules of sufficient size, compared to the formal O(N8/\u03f52) estimated based on the number of terms in the Hamiltonian. (327) Moreover, this analysis justifies the intuitive strategy of neglecting Hamiltonian terms that are under a certain threshold \u03b4, such as the maximum \u03b4 \u2264 , with Nr being the number of removed terms. In practice, it has been observed that \u03b4 = 10\u201310 is more than sufficient to retain quantitatively accurate results in molecular calculation with GTOs. (92,327,367) Alternatively, for Hamiltonians in the plane wave dual basis (eq 44), the number of measurements required to estimate the expectation values can be bounded as (323) (74) This bound is based on upper bounds to the norm of the plane wave dual basis Hamiltonian applied to eq 73. In this case, it is possible to obtain further savings in the number of measurements by exploiting the fact that the interaction (V) and potential terms (U) of the Hamiltonian are diagonal and commute with each other. Therefore, they allow the use of a separate, unbiased estimation for the mean of the sum of these terms. (336) The kinetic operator is not diagonal in the plane wave dual basis, but it can be made diagonal by the application of a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT). This trick can be used to measure the kinetic operator. Correspondingly, the number of measurements can be bounded as (323) (75) where \u03b7 is the number of electrons in the system, and T represents the kinetic energy terms of the Hamiltonian in eq 44. This bound is obtained by bounding the norms of the different terms in the Hamiltonian assuming a neutral system and a fixed density. Since in finite molecules and bulk materials, \u03b7 \u2208 O(N), this shows that the number of measurements does not scale worse than O(N4/\u03f52) for this representation of the Hamiltonian. To avoid the extra cost of implementing the FFFT, one could also measure U + V at once and measure T by typical Hamiltonian averaging, which would scale as O(N4/\u03f52). (323) Strategies for Reducing the Number of Measurements in Hamiltonian Averaging The computational cost of operator averaging is one of the factors contributing to the overall cost of VQE prediction, the others being the depth of the circuit for state preparation and the number of function calls required by the optimization routine. Different strategies have been proposed to reduce the cost of operator averaging. The first of these approaches is term truncation, briefly described in the previous section. Implementation of this approach (63,327) requires ordering the Hamiltonian terms according to the norm of their coefficients, which correspond to the maximum expected contribution to the total expectation value. After this, we can select sequences of particular sums \u03b4k = \u2211i=1k|hi| that correspond to the maximal bias introduced by neglecting the k smallest terms. Subsequently, one could choose a constant C \u2208 [0,1) and remove the k* lowest terms such that \u03b4k* < C\u03f52, where \u03f5 is the intended accuracy. Correspondingly, the remaining terms must be computed to accuracy (1 \u2013 C)2\u03f52, and the number of measurements required would be , where the constant C can be adjusted according to the problem instance and implementation constraints to minimize the number of measurements. A second strategy is to group commuting terms in the Hamiltonian to reduce the number of state preparations required for a single estimate of the energy, which was first described in McClean et al. (63) Commuting terms can be measured in sequence without biasing the final expectation. This can be achieved, for example, by using ancilla qubits to measure the Pauli operators, which only adds a small overhead in gate depth. When using this technique, terms within the same measurement group will be correlated, and therefore the covariance between their expectation values will be different from zero. This could increase or decrease the number of measurements required for the set of terms depending on whether the covariances are positive or negative, an effect similar to the one observed in correlated sampling in classical Monte Carlo simulations. (368) In practice, implementing this approach requires classical preprocessing to group the terms into commuting groups using sorting algorithms, (333) with a classical computational cost of O(M2) as a result of checking commutativity between pairs of terms. Furthermore, one must check whether a specific grouping lowers the number of measurements, which requires access to efficient approximations of the state of interest, since covariances are state dependent. Therefore, efficient classical algorithms for grouping Hamiltonian terms could benefit from efficient classical approximation to the electronic structure problem. (63) A stronger condition that can be imposed on groups of commuting terms is to have all the terms being diagonal in the same tensor product basis, as proposed in Kandala et al. (67) (for example, the set of terms {ZIXZ, ZIXI, ZZXZ, ZZXI}). This guarantees that all the expectation values within the set can be obtained from a single state preparation followed by a specific set of single-qubit rotations to measure in the appropriate tensor product basis. More recently, Rubin et al. (366) pointed out that N-representability conditions on the fermionic reduced density matrices can be exploited to reduce the number of measurements in VQE calculations. N-representability conditions define a set of mathematical constraints which must be satisfied by the reduced density matrices (RDM). The p-electron RDMs (p-RDMs) are defined as the set of expectation values \u27e8ai1\u2020aj1...aip\u2020ajp\u27e9, for fermionic or bosonic systems. In the specific case of fermionic RDMs, the main constraints are the following: (369) 1. RDMs are Hermitian; 2. the 2-RDM is antisymmetric; 3. the (p \u2013 1)-RDM can be obtained by contracting the p-RDM; 4. the trace of each RDM is fixed by the number of particles in the system, e.g., the trace of the 1-RDM is equivalent to the number of particles; 5. RDMs correspond to positive semi-definite density operators. In addition, constraints related to the total spin and spin quantum numbers (S2 and Sz) can be formulated for each marginal. (370) The equality N-representability conditions can be expressed in a qubit basis by mapping the RDM elements using a standard transformation such as Jordan\u2013Wigner or Bravyi\u2013Kitaev. The kth condition can be written as Ck = \u2211iMck, i\u27e8Oi\u27e9 = 0, with Oi being the same terms appearing in the target Hamiltonian for VQE. These constraints provide extra information about the relations between expectation values that can be exploited to reduce the number of measurements. The basic idea of the procedure proposed in Rubin et al. (366) is to add the constraints to the original Hamiltonian to reduce the sum in eq 73. Specifically, this is equivalent to running VQE for an alternative Hamiltonian of the form (76) where \u03b2 is a set of real parameters. Notice that \u27e8H\u27e9 = \u27e8\u0124\u27e9 due to the definition of the N-representability conditions. Correspondingly, based on eq 73, the number of measurements can be minimized by performing the following optimization: (77) with the second optimization depending on the availability of a meaningful prior on the expectation values of the Hamiltonian terms. This optimization problem can be recast as a convex L1 minimization method by writing the constraints and the original Hamiltonian as a vector, where each position of the vector represents a fermionic term. (366) The optimal \u03b2 can be found by applying standard optimization methods. The application of this strategy to, for example, molecular Hamiltonians showed reductions of around 1 order of magnitude in the number of measurements required. (366) Finally, another direction that deserves more exploration is the use of Bayesian inference to estimate the expectation values of Hamiltonian terms, described in McClean et al. (63) The use of sensible choices of classical approximations could provide priors for Bayesian estimation potentially leading to reductions in the number of measurements. 5.1.3. Optimization Methods Several numerical studies comparing the efficacy of different optimization methods have been published since VQE was first introduced; the original paper (61) used Nelder\u2013Mead, a simple derivative-free optimization algorithm. McClean et al. (63) studied VQE for optimizing H2 using the software package TOMLAB (371) to compare four algorithms: Nelder\u2013Mead, MULTMIN, GLCCLUSTER, and LGO, finding that LGO was usually superior. Romero et al. (348) simulated VQE for H4 (a system of four hydrogen atoms), using both gradient and derivative-free methods for the classical optimization step. They used algorithms known as L-BFGS-B, COBYLA, Powell, and Nelder\u2013Mead, observing that the derivative-free methods Powell and Nelder\u2013Mead often had difficulties converging to the correct answer in the large parameter space required by VQE, with COBYLA and L-BFGS-B showing a better performance. Romero et al. (348) and Guerreschi and Smelyanskiy (372) proposed quantum circuits to compute analytical gradients for HQC algorithms, the former in the context of VQE and the latter in the context of the QAOA. Both studies compared the cost of numerical gradients relative to analytical ones, which depends on the cost function employed. In the case of QAOA applied to the Max-Cut problem (372) the authors found that for quasi-Newton methods, numerical gradients required fewer overall function calls than analytical gradients, and both out-performed Nelder\u2013Mead. This is in sharp contrast with VQE applied to electronic structure Hamiltonians, (348) where the conclusion is that analytical gradients offer a practical advantage over numerical gradients. The numerical gradients require a few orders of magnitude more measurements to achieve the same accuracy. Both these studies also point out the dependence of the achieved accuracy and convergence times on the hyper-parameters chosen for the classical optimizer. (348,372) In experimental implementations of VQE on NISQ devices, the accuracy of the optimization can be significantly lowered by the fluctuations on the measured properties caused by noise and finite measurement statistics. This is a major hurdle to the implementation of VQE for larger systems, where the number of parameters can be significant even for linear scaling ansatzes. Correspondingly, most of the experimental implementations so far have employed methods that better tolerate these fluctuations, such as Nelder\u2013Mead and particle-swarm optimization (PSO), (373) which are gradient free. More recently the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) has been applied. (374,375) This method relies on numerical gradients computed in random directions. References to these experiments are provided in Table 2. Table 2.

For small instances such as H2 in a minimal basis set that require a single variational parameter, it is possible to sample the energy landscape. In this case, the expectation values of the Hamiltonian terms are computed within a certain range of the variational parameters and subsequently fitted using methods such as trigonometric interpolations or Gaussian process regression. (64,72) This procedure provides classical functions (which model the values of the expectation values of the Hamiltonian terms) as a function of the variational parameters: \u27e8Oi(\u03b8)\u27e9 \u2248 fi(\u03b8). Subsequently, the optimization can be performed on the fitted models to simplify classical postprocessing. These functions are convenient when applying VQE to a family of Hamiltonians (e.g., ground-state calculations along a path in the potential energy surface), since the same expectation values are used to compute all the ground states, saving measurements. Methods such as Nelder\u2013Mead are limited to problems with few parameters, (376) and more likely their application is not scalable to large molecules. In contrast, SPSA is better for treating more parameters and is also expected to be robust to statistical fluctuations. (375) However, being a method based on numerical gradients, the accuracy and precision of SPSA are also limited by the step size chosen for the gradient discretization. Choosing a smaller step size implies lower energy differences and therefore more precision required for the energy estimation. In fact, the number of measurements required for the estimation of the gradient at a fixed precision increases quadratically with the inverse of the step size, as shown by Romero et al. (348) Consequently, methods employing numerical gradients require careful tuning of the hyper-parameters throughout the optimization to minimize the number of measurements employed. Some heuristic have been proposed for dynamically updating the hyperparameters of SPSA in VQE calculations (see appendix of ref (67)). Nonetheless, more efforts are needed to design efficient strategies to estimate energies and gradients to sufficient precision in VQE. A different and complementary strategy to improve optimization, and the quality of VQE results in general, is error mitigation. This term groups a series of recent proposals for improving the quality of the expectation values of observables measured on NISQ devices. Since estimation of expectation values is at the heart of the VQE protocol, these approaches have a direct benefit in the accuracy of the energies and gradients measured in VQE, which in turn could improve the overall performance of the optimization. Some of the proposals for error mitigation assume that the first-order contributions of the noise to the expectation values can be removed by introducing a controllable source of noise in the circuit of interest. (337,338,377,378) Expectation values are estimated at different error levels and an extrapolation to zero noise is performed using different mathematical techniques. Some of these methods have been successfully applied in experimental demonstrations of VQE for small molecules. (339) However, it has been pointed out that the successful application of some of these approaches to bigger systems might require lower error rates than those existing today. (378) Other proposals for mitigating errors are the VQE subspace expansion (68,340) and updating expectation values using marginal constraints. (366) In the former case, described in more detail in section 5.1.5, the target Hamiltonian is expanded in a basis built from the ground state obtained from a regular VQE procedure at the cost of an additional number of measurements. This new expansion allows for the calculation of excited-state energies and a refined ground-state energy which is found to be closer to the exact result. The second approach exploits the physical constraints of fermionic reduced density matrices, described in section 5.1.2, to update the reduced density matrices measured experimentally. Although the enforcement of these conditions can increase the energy, the procedure can improve the overall shape of the predicted potential energy surfaces and derived properties such as forces. Finally, McArdle et al. (378) have also proposed the use of easy-to-implement stabilizer checks for molecular properties (e.g., electron number parity) to detect errors and discard faulty state preparations, which improves the overall VQE performance. The so-called stabilizer-VQE can be implemented in combination with other error mitigation strategies. For a more detailed description of error mitigation techniques we refer the reader to ref (379). The recent observation (341) that the variational parameter landscape is often plagued by the overabundance of \u201cbarren plateaus\u201d implies that care must be taken when designing a circuit ansatz for the VQE algorithm. By Levy\u2019s lemma, one can prove that expectation values only substantially deviate from their mean over an exponentially small fraction of the Hilbert space. This implies that the use of an arbitrary or unstructured ansatz may be uninformative and expensive, as the optimization algorithm would have to search through most of the space before measuring a non-zero gradient. However, this issue can be circumvented by using PMA that have measurable gradients and thus could better guide the optimizer. This is the case of UCC, where classical quantum chemistry methods such as M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset second order perturbation theory and traditional CC or CI can provide approximate amplitudes to initialize the optimization. As described in section 5.1.1, the barren plateau phenomenon presents a challenge to unstructured energy minimization in VQE. Besides selecting a well-motivated circuit ansatz, several other strategies may be taken to address this issue. One of these strategies is the \u201cannealed variational\u201d optimization (56) described above. This method can be naturally applied to Hamiltonian variational ansatz, HEA and LDCA, where the structure of the variational ansatz is naturally divided into layers or circuit blocks that can be optimized following a block-by-block fashion. We could also adapt this method to ansatzes such as UCC by separating the excitation operators into subsets that are implemented and optimized sequentially. Finally, an alternative strategy to break the optimization into easier, smaller parts is the adiabatically assisted variational quantum eigensolver (AAVQE) method. (380) This method is inspired by the adiabatic evolution of a ground state in quantum annealing. As in AQC, the method employs a parametrized Hamiltonian of the form (78) where H0 is the initial Hamiltonian, for which the ground-state preparation is easily implemented (e.g., a local Hamiltonian may be used), HP is the problem Hamiltonian, and s interpolates between the two Hamiltonians as it is incremented from 0 to 1. However, rather than dynamically tuning the interpolation parameter (see Adiabatic Quantum Computing in section 5.3.1), the interpolation parameter is used to adjust the Hamiltonian from one VQE run to the next. The state preparation parameters at each step are initialized by the optimized parameters of the previous step. As long as the gap of H(s) does not become too small (see section 5.3.1), the ground state of H(s) will lie close to the ground state of the Hamiltonian H(s + \u0394s) in the subsequent step. Thus, AAVQE, which runs VQE while incrementally adjusting the optimization landscape, appears to be another promising approach for circumventing the barren plateau issue. Notice that this method is not equivalent to implementing a Hamiltonian variational approach, since it is the Hamiltonian and not the variational ansatz that has an adiabatic parametrization. Consequently, AAVQE could be combined with any choice of variational ansatz for its execution. 5.1.4. Physical Realizations of VQE To demonstrate the capabilities of existing quantum devices, few-qubit simulations, often without error correction, have been carried out in most major architectures used for quantum information, as shown in Table 2. The first experimental demonstration of VQE was performed in 2014. (61) This experiment employed a two-qubit photonic chip to variationally minimize the energy of HeH+. A VQE experiment of the same molecule was achieved using a system comprising a single trapped ion. (70) These experiments served as proofs-of-principle for the VQE approaches applied to chemistry but involved non-scalable simplifications of the Hamiltonians or non-scalable experimental procedures such as full tomography. A scalable demonstration of both the IPEA and VQE algorithms was carried out in 2016, employing three superconducting qubits for simulating H2 in a minimal basis. (64) These demonstrations were followed by the demonstration of VQE with a hardware-based ansatz for H2, lithium hydride (LiH) and beryllium hydride (BeH2) in a system with six qubits (67) by the IBM quantum computing team. Similarly, the first scalable simulation of VQE in ion trap quantum computers was demonstrated for H2 and LiH using an approximate implementation of the UCC ansatz with Molmer\u2013Sorensen gates. In this demonstration, LiH was simulated using an active space approach that exploited the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev mapping to generate an effective Hamiltonian for this molecule in three qubits. (72) In recent years, various full-stack platforms have been introduced by IBM, Rigetti Computing, and Microsoft, supporting quantum computations via cloud computing. One recent study that leverages this availability of quantum hardware computed the deuteron binding energy using the VQE framework. (69) 5.1.5. VQE for Excited States Since the development of the VQE algorithm by Peruzzo et al., (61) numerous studies and demonstrations of VQE focused on approximating ground states of physical systems. In principle, the VQE algorithm was designed as a modular framework, treating each component (i.e., state preparation, energy estimation, classical optimization) as a black-box that could be easily improved and/or extended. Recent studies have leveraged this flexibility, specifically applying different formulations of objective functions to compute excited states, which are fundamental to understanding photochemical properties and reactivities of molecules. In the following subsections, we highlight several methods extending the original VQE algorithm for approximating excited states for molecular systems. Folded Spectrum and Lagrangian-Based Approaches The first and perhaps the simplest extension consists of the application of the folded spectrum method, which utilizes a variational method to converge to the eigenvector closest to a shift parameter \u03bb. This is achieved by variationally minimizing the operator H\u03bb = (H \u2013 \u03bbI)2 as described by Peruzzo et al. (61) This methodology, though relatively straightforward to implement, requires a quadratic increase in the number of terms of the effective Hamiltonian. This translates to a significant increase in the number of measurements needed, especially in the case of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. (336) A related approach consists of adding a set of constraints to the original Hamiltonian in the VQE calculation to construct the Lagrangian, (63) (79) where \u03bbi are energy multipliers, Si are sets of operators associated with the desired symmetries, and si are the desired expectation values for these sets of operators. The set of operators Si, e.g., spin numbers, accounts for symmetries whereby the energies are minimized by the appropriate excited states (with respect to the original Hamiltonian). We note that Si2 and Si must be efficiently measurable on the quantum computer to ensure the efficiency of the method. By solving VQE for the Lagrangian instead of the original Hamiltonian, it is possible to converge to an approximation of the excited state. More recently, two new Lagrangian-based approaches were introduced for calculating excited-state energies without the measurement overhead. (381) The first doubles the circuit depth to measure overlaps between the ground state and the prepared state to put a penalty on the overlap with the ground state. Choosing this penalty to be large enough ensures that the first excited state becomes the minimizer of the new cost function. The second method works by a similar principle, except the size of the quantum register is doubled instead of the circuit depth. A SWAP test\u2014a circuit construction to compare two quantum states (or quantum registers) by computing the overlap\u2014is then applied to incorporate a penalty for the prepared state having overlap with the ground state. Linear Response: Quantum Subspace Expansion (QSE) More recently, a methodology based on linear response has been developed (340) and demonstrated on existing hardware. (68) In summary, this framework, called the quantum subspace expansion (QSE), extends the VQE algorithm and requires additional measurements to estimate the excited-state energies. That is, after obtaining the ground state |\u03c8\u27e9 of a molecule using VQE, an approximate subspace of low-energy excited states is found by taking the linear combinations of states of the form |Oi\u03c8\u27e9, where the Oi are physically motivated quantum operators. For example, in fermionic systems, these operators could correspond to fermionic excitation operators. In the algorithm, the matrix elements |\u03c8OiHOj\u03c8\u27e9 are computed on the quantum device. The classical computation then diagonalizes the matrix to find the excited-state energies. While the QSE method benefits from the low coherence time requirements of VQE, the quality of the excited states obtained is subject not only to the quality of the ansatz employed in VQE but also to the errors induced by the linear-response expansion. Witness-Assisted Variational Eigenspectra Solver (WAVES) An alternative protocol that also utilizes VQE as a subroutine to compute the ground state is WAVES. (336) The objective function in WAVES is augmented to include the energy (E) as well as an approximation for the entropy (a purity term Tr[\u03c1C2]): (80) In this setup, a control ancilla qubit is considered along with the trial state. Here, the control qubit behaves as an \u201ceigenstate witness\u201d, where its entropy measurement nears zero if the optimized trial state is arbitrarily close to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. A tunable parameter T (that can be pre-optimized) is used to bias toward excited states. In the first iteration of WAVES, T is set to 0 (i.e., implementing regular VQE) to compute the ground state. Then, T is tuned such that when the objective function is optimized, the resulting trial states correspond to approximate excited states. These states are fed into the iterative phase estimation algorithm (IPEA) to extract the corresponding excited-state energies. For near-term devices, the IPEA procedure could be replaced by a Hamiltonian averaging approach. (340) 5.1.6. Calculation of Molecular Properties with VQE Obtaining the ground state for a molecular system is usually just the first step in a quantum chemistry study. In most cases, chemists are interested in a variety of molecular properties that provide insights into the chemistry of the target system. Some of these properties, such as the dipole moment and the charge density, can be computed by measuring the corresponding operators represented in the basis set employed for the VQE. For example, the expectation values of one-electron (E1) and two-electron (E2) operators can be calculated using the same 1-RDM and 2-RDM measured for the optimal state obtained from VQE: (81) (82) where the coefficients o represent expansion coefficients. Other properties might require the estimation of k-RDMs, with k > 2, which requires a larger number of measurements. The information on the RDMs measured in the VQE procedure can be used to connect the VQE algorithm with complementary classical algorithms for the calculation of other properties or energy refinement. One possibility is to combine VQE calculations on active spaces with multi-reference perturbation theory techniques implemented on a classical computer to add dynamical correlation to the calculations, as suggested in. (366) For example, n-valence electron perturbation theory (382) requires measurement of the 3-RDM and 4-RDM in order to compute the corresponding energy correction. To avoid the measurement cost of estimating these RDMs, a cumulant approach that approximates this correction using only the 1-RDM and 2-RDM could be employed. (383) Other techniques that could be implemented using this strategy are canonical transformation theory (132) and perturbative explicit correlated corrections. (384,385) Similarly, the VQE algorithm can be used as a subroutine for energy calculation and interfaced with classical routines for geometry optimization and calculation of thermodynamic properties. In all these calculations, an important factor to consider is the impact of measurement noise, especially when iterative procedures are involved. Investigating the extension of VQE to the calculation of molecular properties common in classical quantum chemistry is an important direction of research for HQC techniques. 5.2. Other Hybrid Quantum\u2013Classical Algorithms for Chemistry In this section, we highlight several other HQC algorithms that may be useful in the context of quantum chemistry. These recent algorithms highlight the opportunity for continued innovation in the development of HQC algorithms. 5.2.1. Variational Quantum Simulator A common explanation for the efficiency of Hamiltonian simulation is the following: as a controllable quantum system, the quantum computer can be made to evolve in a way which mimics the to-be-simulated quantum system. Surprisingly, this canonical approach to quantum simulation, that was detailed in section 4, is not the only method for accomplishing this task. Motivated by the hopeful prospects of near-term quantum algorithms, such as VQE, Li and Benjamin (66) introduced a variational quantum algorithm which implements Hamiltonian simulation, known as the variational quantum simulator algorithm. Instead of applying quantum gates which simulate Hamiltonian dynamics, the variational quantum simulator algorithm applies a series of tunable gates to prepare a tunable output state. The evolution is discretized (t1, t2, ...), such that the task of the algorithm is to determine a series of circuit parameter settings (\u03b8\u20d71, \u03b8\u20d72, ...) for which the subsequent output states (U(\u03b8\u20d71)|\u03c80\u27e9, U(\u03b8\u20d72)|\u03c80\u27e9, ...) approximate the time-evolved states (|\u03c8(t1)\u27e9, |\u03c8(t2)\u27e9, ...) according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The algorithm achieves this by invoking the variational principle: the optimal \u201cpath\u201d in parameter space for expressing the dynamics is the one which is stationary with respect to variation of the action, . The Euler\u2013Lagrange equation derived from this variation\u2013minimization problem determines a differential equation for the evolution of the parameters = V\u20d7. The crux of the algorithm is that the entries of the matrix M and vector V\u20d7 can be estimated from measurements made on the quantum computer. It is important to note that these measurements are facilitated by using an ancilla qubit which is coupled to the system register through controlled-unitary gates. For details of the measurement scheme used to determine M and V\u20d7, refer to ref (66). Each subsequent setting for the parameters is then determined by the update rule: (83) This matrix inversion and multiplication is carried out by a classical processor. The role of the quantum computer is to explore families of output states, U(\u03b8\u20d7)|\u03c80\u27e9, which are unlikely to be representable on a classical computer, and to use these states to efficiently estimate the entries of M and V\u20d7. 5.2.2. Imaginary-Time Variational Quantum Simulator The variational quantum simulator technique has been developed further for problems beyond quantum simulation. In the work by McArdle et al., (386) a variant of the variational quantum simulator is used for preparing certain useful quantum states. The key insight of that paper is that the time evolution in the variational quantum simulator algorithm can be replaced by imaginary-time evolution, e\u2013i(\u2212i\u03c4)H = e\u2013\u03c4H. The functioning of the algorithm is similar to the variational quantum simulator algorithm, apart from replacing t with \u2212i\u03c4. Imaginary-time evolution is useful for preparing a thermal state at temperature T with respect to the Hamiltonian: \u03c1(T) = e\u2013H/T/tr(e\u2013H/T). If the system is initialized in the completely mixed state I/d, then the imaginary-time evolution of \u03c4 = 1/2T will yield a thermal state, \u221d e\u2013H/T. A thermal state can be used for preparing approximations to the ground state of the Hamiltonian by taking the limit T\u21920, since, for a non-degenerate Hamiltonian |\u03c8gs\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8gs| = limT\u21920 e\u2013H/T/tr(e\u2013H/T). With approximate preparation of a Hamiltonian\u2019s ground state, this algorithm can be used as an alternative to the VQE algorithm. Initial simulations show that this method is competitive with the traditional gradient descent approach of the VQE. Hardware implementations which directly compare the two methods are still needed. 5.2.3. Imaginary-Time Variational Quantum Simulator for Excited States The imaginary-time variational quantum simulator can be used as a substitute for VQE. Just as variants of VQE have been developed for determining excited-state energies of Hamiltonians, (340,381) a variant of the imaginary-time variational simulator has been proposed to do the same. (357) Similar to the excited-state energy methods described in section 5.1.5, the VQS version of determining excited-state energies iteratively builds up the spectrum starting with the ground-state energy. Furthermore, in both approaches, each step introduces a penalty term to the Hamiltonian that is proportional to the projector onto the previously found eigenstate. As proposed before, (381) a short-depth swap test circuit is added (357) to measure the contributions to the Hamiltonian from the additional projectors. The difference in the VQS version for determining excited states is that these penalty terms added to the Hamiltonian alter the imaginary-time dynamics, rather than the cost function that is optimized. The value of these algorithms is that they provide alternative approaches to several established quantum algorithms. An important caveat regarding these alternative algorithms is that, as with VQE, they are heuristic. There are no guarantees on their performance, and their proper functioning can only be established on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, the true test of such heuristic algorithms will be when they are implemented on hardware. So, while these algorithms, along with VQE, are promising candidates for making use of near-term quantum devices, more substantial experimental testing is needed to determine their potential for scalability. 5.3. Non-Gate-Based Methods for Quantum Chemistry 5.3.1. Adiabatic The results discussed so far are based on gate model quantum computers, which can be broadly categorized as the \u201cdigital\u201d approach to quantum simulation. The overall unitary quantum evolution being simulated is eventually decomposed into a sequence of elementary operations called quantum gates in a way similar to how logic gates underlie classical computers. However, there is an alternative \u201canalog\u201d approach to quantum computing based on adiabatic quantum evolution (73) that has also gained much attention in the quantum information community. Rapid experimental progress has been underway to scale-up devices for realizing AQC architectures (D-Wave Systems Inc., 2018). In the context of quantum chemistry, research has focused on the analog simulation of molecules by mapping the electronic structure problem to a Hamiltonian of spins with additional coupling terms, (387) although proposals exist for simulating chemical reactions (388\u2212390) and protein folding simulations. (391,392) We will illustrate the analog simulation of electronic structure in the case of hydrogen in a minimal basis set, as shown in ref (387). The Hamiltonian of molecular hydrogen in the minimal basis mapped to a four-qubit system, using the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev transformation, takes the following form: (194,387) (84) (85) (86) (87) We refer to Appendix C.3 for a derivation and description of this formula. A suitable adiabatic quantum computer would be able to effectively encode such a spin Hamiltonian. It would then evolve the system from an \u201ceasy\u201d Hamiltonian (such as the transverse field H0 = \u2211iXi) with known ground state to the spin Hamiltonian of interest, therefore encoding the ground state of the molecule in its final state. Two major challenges in successfully implementing this adiabatic evolution are keeping the energy scales well below the size of energy gaps in the Hamiltonian throughout the evolution and realizing the many-body interactions. For the first issue, the energy scales that must be considered are temperature and speed with which the Hamiltonian is changed. Thermal fluctuations which drive the system out of the ground state can be mitigated by keeping the system at extremely low temperatures. Additionally, the Hamiltonian must be changed slowly enough relative to the transition energy of the first excited state (the energy gap) so that non-adiabatic transitions do not drive population out of the ground state. For the second issue, certain many-body terms in the Hamiltonian, such as three- and four-body terms X1Z2X3 and Y1Z2Y3Z4, are difficult to implement experimentally. Techniques exist to reduce them to two-body terms by adding ancilla qubits and encoding the correct couplings in the lowest eigenstate of a different Hamiltonian, which is commonly called gadgetization. (54,222,393\u2212395) Although gadgetization schemes have greatly improved over the past decade, they provide limited tunability over the couplings that are required to construct the problem Hamiltonian. This poses a challenge as molecular Hamiltonians and the adiabatic evolution require the spread of coupling term strengths over multiple orders of magnitude. Therefore, experimental progress in the field of AQC for chemistry applications hinges on the development of non-gadgetized, highly tunable multi-spin couplers that either directly encode the problem Hamiltonian or reduce the mapping overhead of gadgetization. 5.3.2. Linear Optics As we have seen earlier, much of the work in quantum simulation is related to the structure of atoms and molecules, such as electronic structure, which are typically fermionic in nature. However, bosonic dynamics govern many other aspects of chemical systems; for instance, the vibrational modes of molecules can be described by phonon transitions, which obey bosonic statistics. While one could imagine devising a gate-model quantum algorithm to simulate this system, optical quantum systems are native to bosonic statistics and represent a platform for carrying out this simulation more efficiently than encoding the problem into a qubit formalism. The first realization of this protocol was introduced by Huh and Yung (245) and targeted the simulation of the FCP. This work and its successors (369,397) are the only examples of native simulation of bosonic chemical systems on a quantum device to date. In section 3, we discussed some of the complexity issues related to computing distributions whose probability amplitudes are derived from hafnians and matrix permanents. Here we give a description of how the algorithm works. The goal is to compute the FCP by sampling from the output distribution of a modified boson sampling device, as shown in Figure 9. Figure 9 Figure 9. Left: Sketch of the photoelectric spectrum of the ionization of a molecule. The energy level diagram shows the electronic ground and excited state of the molecule, with its corresponding vibrational energy levels. Vibronic transitions are allowed between the two distinct electronic states, with the intensity of the peaks given by the wave function overlap integral \u27e8vk\u2032m|v0\u27e9. According to the Franck\u2013Condon principle, due to the slower motion of nuclei the most intense peak in the vibronic spectrum corresponds to the vertical transition in the energy level diagram (blue arrow). The whole spectrum is known as the Franck\u2013Condon profile (FCP). Right: Modified boson sampling device to simulate the FCP. An initially prepared squeezed-coherent state of light (dashed blob represents the resulting photonic entangled state) is sent through a photonic circuit, where judiciously chosen beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Doktorov rotation U. Sampling from the output distribution of this apparatus yields the FCP, up to a certain error \u03f5, given by the number of measurements. This modification of the optical apparatus stems from the unitary transformation (eq 19) that encodes the molecular problem. (234) On top of the M-dimensional rotation of the bosonic modes given by the Duschinsky rotation R\u0302U, one has to include the displacement D\u0302\u03b4 caused by the different minima of the nuclei in the electronic ground and excited states, together with the squeezing \u015c\u03a9\u2032\u2020 that photons undergo for transitioning to different frequency states (\u03a9\u2032\u2192\u03a9). These effects are encoded in the initial state preparation, which can be written as a squeezed coherent state |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u015c\u03a9D\u0302\u03b4|vac\u27e9. The unitary rotation R\u0302U is implemented in a linear optics setup and precedes the last squeezing operation \u015c\u03a9\u2032\u2020. The second squeezing operation might be challenging to implement in optical setups, for which Huh et al. proposed a more efficient setup, compressing the two squeezing operations into the initial state, so that the FCP simulation is isomorphic to a Gaussian boson sampling problem. (243) Given this setup, the following hybrid classical\u2013quantum sampling algorithm can efficiently generate the FCP profile at T = 0 K: 1. With the information on the potential energy surfaces obtained from electronic structure calculations, calculate the parameters that define the Doktorov transformation. The electronic structure method could be a classical approach such as TD-DFT but eventually also a quantum computation. 2. Build a Gaussian boson sampler as described above that implements this Doktorov transformation and samples on the phonon number basis, and collect the photon numbers {mk} in each mode. 3. For every detection event estimate the corresponding associated energy E = \u210f\u03c9kmk where mk is the number of detected photons and increment its corresponding bin by one unit. 4. Repeat the sampling Nsamp times until the estimated statistical error is below a given threshold \u03f5FCP. 5. Output the normalized profile of the counting statistics. This result has recently motivated proof-of-principle experimental quantum simulations of molecular spectroscopic systems with linear optics. (396) The paper by Clements et al. (396) is the first instance of an experimental FCP of a small molecule, tropolone. The improved algorithm accounts for the unavoidable effects of experimental imperfections. As such it is an excellent example of a scalable simulation in the absence of error-correcting techniques. Sparrow et al. (397) simulated the vibrational quantum dynamics of a variety of molecules (H2CS, SO3, HNCO, HFHF, N4, and P4), in both the harmonic and anharmonic regimes, using a re-programmable photonic chip. Linear optics is a natural platform for the simulation of vibrational quantum dynamics, as photons have the same boson statistics as the vibrational excitations (phonons). Nevertheless, other physical platforms such as trapped ions or superconducting circuits have also proven useful in simulating vibrational degrees of freedom. In particular, Shen et al. (398) reproduced the molecular vibronic signal of SO2 using solely the vibrational excitations in a trapped ion device. Superconducting circuits have no experimental realizations as of yet ,but promising architectures have been theoretically proposed. For instance, the proposal by Olivares et al. (399) involves of superconducting resonators interacting through tunable couplers. In their approach the authors performed a quantum quench in the superconducting simulator, initially prepared in the molecular ground state. The abrupt change takes the system out of equilibrium, in a way that the system relaxes to the ground state populating the resonators with a distribution that resembles that of the FCP. Additionally, a polynomially scaling algorithm for efficiently calculating the full FCP was introduced for the gate model by Sawaya and Huh, (400) based on QPE. This algorithm can efficiently include often-essential anharmonic vibrational effects, a primary advantage over the boson sampling approach, which deals only with harmonic vibrations. A related work provides an overview of many vibrational processes ripe for simulating on the gate model, including calculating individual Franck\u2013Condon factors, described by McArdle et al. (401) Other studies include a hardware implementation for calculating a one-dimensional method (Joshi et al. (402)) and an annealing algorithm for calculating low-lying vibrational states (Teplukhin et al. (403)). 6. Summary and Outlook ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Quantum chemists have come to embrace a set of computational tools which have driven much innovation in chemistry over the past half century. As quantum computers become available, many of these computational tools will be supplemented with, or even replaced by, quantum computations. Furthermore, quantum computation will likely inspire new theoretical approaches and computational methods for solving problems in chemistry. As a precedent, consider the way that early computational tools gave rise to the invention of Monte Carlo methods. (404) Today\u2019s quantum chemists face an impending disruption of their field. As with the previous computational revolution in quantum chemistry, the practitioners and early adopters will drive much of the innovation. This Review has aimed to provide the perspective and basic tools helpful in beginning the practice of using quantum computation for chemistry. In the near term, quantum computation will likely first be used for ab initio electronic structure calculations in quantum chemistry. Quantum algorithms for chemistry, then, should be viewed as alternatives to the state-of-the-art post-Hartree\u2013Fock methods such as coupled-cluster, M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory, and density-matrix renormalization group techniques. Such calculations often suffer from inaccuracies due to approximations of the quantum electronic wave function (cf. section 2.2). Quantum computers provide a solution to this problem by naturally handling wave functions that span the full Hilbert space to estimate energies, electric polarization, magnetic dipoles, reduced density matrices, etc. The canonical problem that is expected to be solved is the computation of ground- and excited-state energies of small molecules. Such calculations serve as the starting point for computing many useful quantities, such as reaction pathways, binding energies, and rates of chemical reactions. There are two distinct approaches to estimating the electronic ground-state energies. The first method, proposed by Aspuru-Guzik et al., (41) uses the quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPEA) to make quantum measurements of the energy of a trial wave function, as described in section 4.1.2. Although promising, this method requires the use of quantum error correction to properly function, and it is therefore not feasible using near-term quantum devices. In contrast, the second method for estimating ground-state energies was specifically developed to be deployable on currently available quantum hardware, without a dependence on quantum error correction for proper functioning. This algorithm, known as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), as described in section 5.1, has become the focus of the state-of-the-art quantum experiments. (64,67) It is possible that the first commercial use of quantum computers will involve applying the VQE algorithm to predict the electronic structure properties of small molecules. In the few years since its invention, there has been significant algorithmic development surrounding the VQE algorithm. (340,345,346,381) Yet, there remains room for innovation surrounding this and other variational quantum algorithms. It is possible that these innovations, coupled with advances in hardware, will enable commercial utility of quantum devices far sooner than anticipated. This crossover point will likely be arrived at through the synergistic collaboration between quantum chemists, quantum information scientists, and quantum device engineers. Already, insights from quantum chemistry have led to substantial improvements in quantum algorithms. Variational ansatzes borrowed from classical quantum chemistry such as the unitary coupled cluster have informed state preparation techniques (348) in several quantum algorithms. The quantum subspace expansion technique, developed by McClean et al., (340) was motivated by the concept of linear response of the ground state. Finally, the N-representability problems and the 2-RDM constraints inspired the methods described by Rubin et al. (366) for improving expectation value estimates in VQE. Yet, many avenues remain to be explored. For example, a recent paper (405) initiated the use of low-rank tensor decompositions for improving the performance of certain quantum algorithms for chemistry simulation. Such techniques should find a broader range of applicability in quantum algorithms. Furthermore, as techniques in quantum algorithms mature, it is likely that methods from perturbation theory will be useful in pushing the capabilities of quantum computers, especially in regard to active-space methods. It is difficult to predict the course of quantum computing in the long term. In particular, it is difficult to predict when or if algorithms on near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices will outperform classical computers for useful tasks. But it is likely that, at some point, the achievement of large-scale quantum error correction will enable the deployment of a host of so-called error-corrected quantum algorithms, which in many cases have theoretical guarantees on their performance. These error-corrected algorithms include the celebrated Grover search algorithm, (38) Shor\u2019s factoring algorithm, (35) and the Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd\u2019s linear system of equations algorithm. (257) Regarding quantum chemistry, quantum error correction would enable the use of the various Hamiltonian simulation algorithms, as described in section 4.1. These Hamiltonian simulation algorithms can be used to simulate the dynamics of quantum systems. But, more importantly, Hamiltonian simulation serves as a subroutine for other algorithms, such as the QPEA. Thus, with quantum error correction, the QPEA could become a viable alternative option to the VQE for ground-state energy estimation. That said, many of the techniques that have and will be developed for the VQE will likely be employed for preparing the initial state in the phase estimation algorithm. The use of quantum error correction also stands to improve the performance of variational quantum algorithms such as VQE. For instance, error correction could lead to an improvement in the preparation of good ansatz states for the VQE, as described in section 5.1.1. However, a possible future scenario is that, by the time useful, large-scale quantum error correction is achieved, the dichotomy between error-corrected algorithms and non-error-corrected algorithms will have become blurred. Already, several methods have been introduced which aim to bridge the gap between these two classes of quantum algorithms. (274,406,407) The landscape of quantum algorithm development has recently been changing quite dramatically. With the arrival of usable quantum devices, (408,409) we have now entered a prototype era in the field of quantum algorithms. Use of these devices has and will continue to spur the development of many new quantum algorithms at a substantially increased rate. In particular, the ability to test performance on real quantum devices facilitates the development of heuristic quantum algorithms. (61,66,340,345,349,364,406) In the past few years, several papers have proposed new quantum algorithms along with experimental demonstrations on quantum devices. (410,411) This points to the increasing value in having quantum algorithm developers working closely with quantum machines. Fortunately, this synergy has been amplified by the development of software platforms such as Rigetti\u2019s pyQuil, (412) IBM\u2019s QISKit, (413) ETH Z\u00fcrich\u2019s ProjectQ, (414) Intel\u2019s qHipster, (415) Google\u2019s Cirq, (416) and Xanadu\u2019s Strawberry Fields. (417) Any reasonable forecast on the timing of the quantum utility crossover point is given with a wide margin of error. The more conservative estimates predict that this crossover will occur in 15\u201320 years. (418) However, the most optimistic estimates predict that quantum computers will solve useful problems in 2\u20135 years. (419) The estimated dates for reaching this horizon are strongly determined by progress in hardware development and are extrapolated based on recent advances in quantum device technology. (67,408,420,421) However, quantum algorithm development also serves to influence these estimates. Quantum simulation for quantum chemistry provides a rather striking example. Over the past 5 years, as outlined in section 4.2.2, the asymptotic scaling of quantum simulation algorithms for quantum chemistry has been dramatically improved from a high-degree polynomial to sublinear in the number of orbitals. Furthermore, continued development in quantum error correction (254,422) and error-mitigation techniques (66,337) will also improve prospects. So, while progress in quantum hardware development carries us toward the utility horizon, progress in quantum algorithm development moves this landmark itself closer into our reach. With this perspective, then, there is ample opportunity for quantum chemists and quantum theorists to make valuable algorithmic contributions toward the quest for useful quantum computation. So far, many of the quantum approaches take inspiration from the standard classical techniques. For example, the VQE algorithm can be viewed as a quantum version of Ritz\u2019s variational method. With novel computational means, there is an opportunity for developing more quantum chemistry methods which truly have no classical analogs. Quantum computing for quantum chemistry is likely to develop into a rich subfield of quantum chemistry. Now is an opportune time to enter into this emerging research field. Through cross-disciplinary engagements, early practitioners of these novel computational tools will usher in a renaissance for computational methods in chemistry.

Appendices ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To A. Quantum Chemistry Basis Sets Wave function ansatzes for the electronic structure problem, where the total wave function is approximated as a product of one-electron functions, or methods based in second quantization techniques, where the system is represented in the Fock basis, require the introduction of a set of system-dependent, one-particle functions \u03d5(xi), where xi represents the spatial and spin coordinates of a single electron. In practice, the set of one-particle functions is finite, introducing an approximation error associated with a truncated representation of the Hilbert space, or basis-set incompleteness. Furthermore, these one-electron functions, also called spin-orbitals, are usually expanded as linear combinations of a set of standard system-independent functions, which are called the basis set functions. Choosing basis set functions with the right mathematical properties can significantly facilitate the evaluation of the Hamiltonian elements and expectation values. Ideally, basis set functions should be designed to capture the physics of the problem, such that a good representation can be achieved using as few functions as possible. Correspondingly, the performance of the basis set is usually measured as the difference with the undiscretized problem, which would correspond with a hypothetical infinite basis set. A good basis set should allow for a systematic and quickly converging extrapolation to this basis set limit. Furthermore, basis sets should have a mathematical form that facilitates the evaluation of molecular integrals and should be able to accurately describe not only total energies but also other properties. The existing basis sets in computational chemistry offer different levels of compromise among these desired qualities. The first and most important aspect to consider in the choice or design of a basis set is the nature of the problem. Molecular systems can be roughly categorized into two types: periodic systems and isolated molecules. The first case describes extended systems modeled as unit cells with periodic boundary conditions, such as crystals. In periodic systems, the periodic density does not vanish exponentially far away from the nuclei, unlike the case of isolated molecules. Molecular crystals and large biomolecules can be considered intermediate cases between these two extremes. Traditionally, periodic systems have been described using plane-wave basis sets whereas the basis sets for isolated molecules have been dominated by basis sets with atom-centered functions. In isolated molecules, the electronic density is highly peaked around the nuclei and vanishes exponentially away from them, which justifies the chemical view of molecules as atoms interacting mostly through their outermost regions. This intuition applied to basis sets inspired the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method, which conceives molecular spin-orbitals as linear combinations of a fixed set of atomic basis set functions, also called atomic orbitals (AOs). This framework has the advantage of providing a systematic way of constructing basis sets for molecules by keeping a dataset of AOs for most elements in the periodic table. The functional form of atomic basis sets is inspired by the solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for hydrogen-like atoms (one electron and one nucleus), which have the following general form: (88) where n is the natural quantum number, l and m are the angular momentum and magnetic quantum numbers, Ylm(\u03b8, \u03d5) is a spherical harmonic function, Rnl(r) is a product of Laguerre polynomials and a term decaying exponentially with r, and (r, \u03b8, \u03d5) are spherical coordinates. Slater-type orbitals (STOs) have the same structure as the orbitals of hydrogenic atoms, with the radial function taking the form (89) where N is a normalization constant and \u03b6 is called the orbital exponent. The exponent controls the degree of \u201cdiffuseness\u201d of the orbital, meaning how fast the density vanishes as a function of the nuclear distance. Consequently, within a basis set comprised of several STOs, the minimum and maximum orbital exponents determine how far and how close the resulting wave function can be represented. AO basis sets are then constructed by choosing a particular combination of individual basis set functions for each of the orbitals in a given atom. For example, one could construct a basis set for any element in the second period of the periodic table by using five STOs with different exponents and appropriate spherical harmonics to represent the 1s, 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz orbitals of the electronic configuration of these elements. One could further improve the flexibility of the basis set by expressing each orbital as a linear combination of n STOs with different exponents, instead of using a single one. This strategy is known as the n-zeta representation. The main advantage of STOs is that they capture the appropriate behavior of electron density near and far from the nuclei, with appropriate cusps for s orbitals at the nuclei and exponential decaying tails. Unfortunately, the calculation of the molecular integrals using STOs has to be carried out numerically because of the lack of analytical solutions, restricting the use of STOs to small molecules. This difficulty motivated the adoption of Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) as basis sets. Spherical GTOs have the same angular form as STOs but differ in the form of the radial function, which adopts a Gaussian form instead of the original exponential: (90) Furthermore, GTOs can be also Cartesian, where the spherical harmonic factor is replaced by a Cartesian product of the form xiyjzk, where x, y, and z are the components of the radial distance between the electron and the center of the gaussian and the sum i + j + k determines the angular momentum. GTOs have convenient analytical properties that allow for efficient schemes for the computational evaluation of molecular integrals. However, unlike STOs, they do not describe the cusp and exponential tails of the electronic density correctly. A middle ground between accuracy in the representation and computational ease is the contracted GTOs scheme, where a linear combination of GTOs, also referred to as primitives, is used to emulate a single STO. The set of primitive STOs is called a contraction. Contracted GTOs have been adopted as the main basis set functions for electronic structure calculations in isolated molecules, (423) with different families of basis sets created to fit different purposes. Although different families of Gaussian basis sets differ in the specific parameters and optimization strategy employed, they share similar structures and nomenclatures. Most families are created by augmenting the number of basis sets using the n-zeta strategy. A minimal basis set corresponds to a 1-zeta, denoted as SZ (single zeta), comprising a number of orbitals corresponding to the orbitals in the electronic configuration of the period of the corresponding element. For example, elements in the second row of the periodic table would have five orbitals corresponding to 1s, 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz for an SZ basis set. The flexibility of the basis set can be increased by multiplying the number of contractions employed to represent valence orbitals, which play a more prominent role in the molecule energetics. For example, a double-zeta (DZ) basis set would have twice the number of valence orbitals of a SZ basis set : 1s, 2s, 2s\u2032, 2px, 2px\u2032, 2py, 2py\u2032, 2pz, and 2pz\u2032. The number of orbitals can be also augmented by adding polarization functions. Correspondingly, DZP (double-zeta plus polarization) would include orbitals of angular momenta 2 for elements in the second row of the periodic table. In addition to polarization functions, diffuse functions (GTOs with small exponents) can be included to improve the description of tails of the density, especially in system such as anions. Similarly, tight functions (GTOs with large orbitals exponents) can be included when the description of core electrons plays an important role in the accuracy. Apart from the strategies for augmentation of the basis set size, there are two different contraction schemes: segmented and general contracted basis sets. In segmented contractions, different sets of primitive GTOs are used to represent different orbitals. An example of segmented contracted basis is the 3-21G basis that belongs to the split-valence family (also called the Pople family). (322) In a 3-21G basis, core electrons are described with a single contraction of 3 GTOs, while valence electrons are made of contractions of 2 and 1 GTOs. In contrast, the general contractions approach employs the same set of primitive GTOs to expand all the orbitals, with only the combination coefficients differing between different orbitals. An example of general contracted basis sets is the Dunning family (cc-pVXZ), which aims at calculating electron correlation by wave function methods. (424) Modern basis sets share elements of both segmented and general contraction types. Examples of other commonly used families of atomic basis sets include the Karlsruhe family, (425) the XZP family, (426) the Sapporo family, (427) the ANO family, (428) the nZaP family, (429) and the pc-n family. (430) Some Gaussian basis sets have been developed to improve the calculation of magnetic and electronic properties and to include relativistic effects. For a more detailed description of atomic orbital basis sets, we refer the reader to refs (431and432). Atomic basis sets are well suited to describe electron densities in isolated molecules, where the densities resemble those of individual atoms. However, energy bands in periodic systems are different from atomic orbitals. For example, in metals, valence electrons have a behavior more similar to free electrons. Correspondingly, solutions to the particle-in-a-box problem can offer a better description of periodic systems, giving rise to plane-waves (PW) basis sets, which have a complex exponential form. In a three-dimension cell, a PW can be expressed as (91) for a wave with wavevector corresponding to the \u03bdth harmonic of a box with length L and volume V. The size of the PW basis set is determined by the chosen value of the maximum energy and the volume V of the unit cell, and in contrast with atomic basis sets, does not depend on the number of atoms within the cell. Correspondingly, the description of core electrons might require a large number of PW basis sets due the large energies, and thus, PW are usually employed in combination with pseudopotentials to describe core electrons. Compared to GTOs, PW basis sets generally require an order of magnitude more functions to achieve a similar accuracy. Recently, the dual plane-wave basis set (dual PW), corresponding to the Fourier transform of PW, has been proposed as an alternative for electronic structure calculations on quantum computers. (323) PWs and their dual diagonalize the kinetic and potential operators, respectively. The dual PW basis set has the advantage of providing a more compact representation of the molecular Hamiltonian in second quantization. These functions have a form that resembles the Sinc function, which is expressed as (92) The Sinc function is oscillatory in nature just like a plane wave, but its amplitude decays to zero away from the expansion point x. The dual PW and Sinc functions can be used as basis sets by placing functions at a number of real-space grid points. The quality of the basis set can be improved by decreasing the separation in the grid. B. Mappings to Qubits In this section we introduce the two main approaches to mapping second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians to qubit Hamiltonians. We define the mappings and discuss their benefits, drawbacks, and variants. For a more-detailed introduction to these various mappings, refer to McArdle et al. (379) B.1. Jordan\u2013Wigner Mapping In the Jordan\u2013Wigner mapping, each electronic orbital, described by creation operator aj\u2020 is associated with a qubit j via (93) where \u03c3z = and \u03c3+ = . This induces a correspondence between each second-quantized basis state (aK\u2020)iN ... (a1\u2020)i1 |vac\u27e9 and a corresponding computational basis state |i1\u27e9\u2297|i2\u27e9\u2297...\u2297|iN\u27e9, where each i1, ..., iN is 0 or 1. Notice that the creation operators ai\u2020 act non-trivially on i qubits. This is a consequence of the creation operator carrying out two actions: the action of changing the occupation is carried out locally by \u03c3i+, while the action of applying a phase according to the parity (even or odd) of the occupations for orbital labels less than i is achieved by a string of \u03c3z (see eq 93). The high weight of the parity-counting phase can be costly for certain quantum simulation algorithms. So, while each spin-orbital occupation operator ai\u2020ai is local, acting only on the ith qubit, other one-body operators ai\u2020aj can be very nonlocal due to the high weight of the parity. A dual version of the Jordan\u2013Wigner mapping is the so-called parity mapping. (194) Here, the parity operators are low-weight, while the occupation operators become high-weight. In the parity mapping, the creation and annihilation operators are (94) This definition induces a transformation from Jordan\u2013Wigner product states to parity product states, (95) where \u2295 indicates addition modulo-two. While the Jordan\u2013Wigner mapping stores the occupation of each spin-orbital in each qubit, the parity mapping stores the parity in each qubit. While the parity mapping is a valid transformation from fermionic operators to qubits, so far, it has not been considered as a useful contender for use in quantum simulation. Rather, it serves as a useful pedagogical tool for motivating the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev transformation introduced in the following subsection. B.2. Bravyi\u2013Kitaev Mapping The Bravyi\u2013Kitaev mapping (193) combines the advantages from the Jordan\u2013Wigner and parity mappings to yield creation and annihilation operators which act non-trivially on O(log N) qubits (i.e., have weight O(log N)). This is important for quantum simulation, as larger-weight terms in the Hamiltonian require longer circuits for their simulation. The original Bravyi\u2013Kitaev encoding is defined for the case that N = 2n. In this case the maximum weight of any encoded aj\u2020 is exactly log2 N according to Havl\u00ed\u010dek et al. (433) The creation and annihilation operators in the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev mapping have a more involved description than in the Jordan\u2013Wigner or parity mapping. For a full description of these operators, see Seeley et al. (194) We limit ourselves to presenting the transformation from Jordan\u2013Wigner product states to Bravyi\u2013Kitaev product states: (96) where bk = \u2211l=1k[\u03b2r]klil mod 2 and the matrix \u03b2r is defined recursively as (97) (98) As an example, in the case of N = 23, the matrix defining the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev transformation is (99) The Bravyi\u2013Kitaev transformation, as presented here, applies only for systems with a spin-orbital number equal to a power of two. A closely related variant of the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev transformation, known as the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev tree method, also achieves a mapping with O(log N)-weight creation and annihilation operators. (433) The algorithm for generating this mapping uses the data structure known as Fenwick trees, which were originally used for arithmetic coding compression algorithms. (434) Although the scaling of operator weight is the same as that of the standard Bravyi\u2013Kitaev mapping, in practice the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev tree method produces higher-weight creation and annihilation operators. (379) However, it has been noted (379) that, in contrast to the standard Bravyi\u2013Kitaev mapping, the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev tree method enables the use of qubit-reduction techniques when the spin-orbital number is not a power of 2. Bravyi\u2013Kitaev mapping allows for superfast simulation of interacting fermion systems on a graph (193) where each node corresponds to a local fermionic mode and each edge represents a pairwise interaction. Unlike Jordan\u2013Wigner or Fenwick tree-based methods which map m fermionic modes (or nodes of the graph) to m qubits, the superfast simulation schemes (193,435) map each edge of the graph to a qubit, yielding O(md) qubits for a graph of degree d; i.e., each node on the graph is connected to at most d other nodes. In the original proposal by Kitaev, (193) one-body and two-body fermionic interactions can be mapped to operators that act on at most O(d) qubits. Recently this has been improved to O(log d) by Setia et al. (435) in connection with quantum error correction. The authors also show that their encoding scheme is robust against single-qubit errors. C. From Quantum Chemistry to Quantum Computation: Example of Molecular Hydrogen C.1. Introduction The purpose of this Appendix is to present a detailed description of the workflow underlying a simple quantum computation (VQE calculation) of a quantum chemistry problem by working out the example of molecular hydrogen. Examples and resources for other small molecules are available elsewhere. (67,436) We will focus on a concrete problem and progress step-by-step through the various assumptions, simplifications, and calculations taken to convert the chemistry problem into results on a quantum computer. This section is intended to speak to both quantum chemists and quantum information scientists and is structured as follows: (a) define the chemistry problem, (b) map the problem onto the quantum computer, (c) provide a brief introduction to (circuit-model) quantum computation, (d) apply the VQE algorithm to treat the problem. C.2. Defining the Chemistry Problem We address the problem of determining the electronic ground-state energy of molecular hydrogen as a function of the distance between the nuclei. This relationship is otherwise known as the ground-state energy dissociation curve (Figure 10). An accurate description of this energy surface is a key challenge in quantum chemistry that can provide insight on a range of chemical phenomena, e.g., bond breaking and reaction dynamics. To simplify the problem, we apply the BOA, in which we treat the nuclei as stationary classical particles. This is justified as the ratio of electronic to nuclear mass is roughly 1:1000, leading to a separation in the time scale of their dynamics. The resulting quantum Hamiltonian describing the electronic system, in atomic units, can be written as (100) where ri are the position coordinates of the electrons, which parametrically depend on the fixed position coordinates of the nuclei Ri, and Zi and Mi denoting the nuclear charges and masses, respectively. The electronic system, as written in the first-quantized picture in eq 100, assumes an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. When applying quantum computation for chemistry, the Hamiltonian is instead often considered in the second-quantized formulation, in which the system can be described approximately using a finite basis. For our example of molecular hydrogen, we consider the minimal basis (STO-6G). For a deeper review of basis sets, the reader should refer to Appendix A. Within this framework, states are labeled by the occupation of the orbitals, and the exchange symmetry of the particles is naturally considered through the use of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The electronic Hamiltonian can then be expressed in terms of these second-quantized operators as (101) where ap is an electron annihilation operator that removes an electron from an orbital with label p. The weights of the operators are given by the molecular integrals (102) and (103) where we use xi to denote the spatial and spin coordinates, i.e., xi = (ri, \u03c3i). In practice, several electronic structure packages and codes have been developed and optimized for computing these integrals. To prepare our quantum computation for molecular hydrogen, we use such classically pre-computed integrals to prepare the second-quantized Hamiltonian. Figure 10 Figure 10. Dissociation profile of molecular hydrogen in the minimal basis (STO-6G). The ground-state energies computed using the full configuration interaction (FCI) method are shown. The ideal goal in applying the VQE algorithm for chemistry is to compute energies that approximately reproduce the FCI results. C.3. Mapping the Problem In classical computation, the chemistry problem is treated by solving the necessary equations using a method that implements some level of approximations. In quantum computation, an extra \u201ctranslation\u201d step is necessary to encode the second-quantized Hamiltonian in a system of quantum bits, or qubits, prior to treating the problem. This is achieved by applying a mapping from the set of creation and annihilation operators in the Hamiltonian to the set of operators on qubits, in which the mapping preserves the algebraic relationships, i.e., the fermionic canonical commutation relations. We note that this step is a general prerequisite for implementing Hamiltonian simulations, the QPEA, or the VQE. In Appendix B, we review the two most well-known mappings, the Jordan Wigner and the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev transformations. For our molecular hydrogen example, we employ the Bravyi\u2013Kitaev transformation, mapping the minimal-basis second-quantized Hamiltonian shown in eq 101 to a four-qubit Hamiltonian: (104) (105) (106) (107) Here, Xj, Yj, and Zj are Pauli operators acting on the jth qubit, such as X1 = \u03c3x \u2297 I \u2297 I \u2297 I, and the \u03bck are determined by the integrals from eqs 102 and 103. As described in O\u2019Malley et al., (64) symmetries in this Hamiltonian can be exploited to construct a two-qubit Hamiltonian representing the symmetry sector of the original Hamiltonian that contains the ground state. The resulting two-qubit Hamiltonian is (108) where the \u03bdj are linear combinations of the \u03bck. This is the final form of the Hamiltonian we will use in our quantum computation to determine the ground-state energy as a function of interatomic spacing. C.4. A Brief Introduction to Quantum Computation After encoding the computational problem or task onto the quantum computer, we can approach the said task (or parts of the overall task) on the quantum computer by manipulating its qubits with relevant quantum operations. Before we describe the application of the VQE, an algorithm that involves both classical and quantum computations, we briefly introduce the workings of a quantum computation. The following paragraphs describe the widely used \u201ccircuit-model\u201d of quantum computation. However, as described in the main text, other models such as adiabatic quantum computation exist. Just as bits are the elementary units of a (classical) computation, quantum bits\u2014or qubits\u2014are the elementary units of a quantum computation. Qubits are controllable, two-level quantum systems. Analogous to logic gates, which comprise, en masse, a computation, quantum gates are simple actions or operations performed on qubits which, in sequence, comprise a quantum computation. Specifically, a quantum gate is a unitary transformation which typically manipulates just a few qubits at a time. As an example, a common single-qubit gate is a \u201cZ-gate\u201d, or \u201cphase-gate\u201d, which maps the quantum state |0\u27e9 to itself and the state |1\u27e9 to |\u22121\u27e9. While this phase-gate only changes the (unobservable) phase of these two states, it affects a non-trivial action on superpositions of these states. For example, the quantum state |+\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9)/ is transformed to the orthogonal state vector Z(|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9)/ = (|0\u27e9 \u2013 |1\u27e9)/ = |\u2212\u27e9. This transformation may be physically realized by subjecting the two level system to a driving term that is diagonal in the qubit basis, i.e., proportional to \u03c3z. A qubit flip between the 0 and 1 states, in turn, may be realized by a drive along \u03c3x. Similarly, a two-qubit gate may be implemented by inducing a direct or indirect coupling between two qubits. A two-qubit gate is fully characterized by how it transforms the four two-qubit basis states |00\u27e9, |01\u27e9, |10\u27e9, and |11\u27e9. In its simplest form, a quantum computation implements the following three steps, as illustrated using a circuit diagram in Figure 11: 1. initialize the qubits in the state |0\u27e9 \u2297 ... \u2297 |0\u27e9, 2. apply a sequence of quantum gates U|0...0\u27e9, and 3. measure to obtain either 0 or 1 for each qubit. Figure 11 Figure 11. Illustration of a quantum computation using the circuit model. Various quantum and/or quantum\u2013classical algorithms leverage the capabilities of quantum circuits to achieve computational tasks or subtasks. These steps can be combined and manipulated at a higher level to achieve more sophisticated tasks. Namely, the VQE algorithm complements \u201cquantum\u201d routines comprising executions of quantum circuits with classical routines to estimate the ground-state energy of molecular systems. In the following subsection, we will describe the VQE algorithm in the context of finding the ground-state energy of molecular hydrogen. C.5. Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Quantum Chemistry As detailed in section 5.1, the VQE is a hybrid quantum\u2013classical algorithm that estimates molecular properties, often the ground-state energies, of quantum systems using the variational principle. Consequently, a promising application of VQE is quantum chemistry. At a high level, VQE allocates subtasks between quantum and classical resources based on the inherent strengths and capabilities of each device. In this framework, the role of the quantum computer is to prepare the parametrized trial quantum state |\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9 (also known as the ansatz) and estimate the energy with respect to the Hamiltonian. The ansatz is constructed by applying a variational circuit\u2014that is, a parametrized quantum circuit U(\u03b8\u20d7) with classical parameters \u03b8\u20d7\u2014to an initial or reference state |\u03d50\u27e9. The role of the classical processor is then to orchestrate the minimization of the energy expectation through feedback to the parameters \u03b8\u20d7. Procedurally, the VQE algorithm can be summarized in the following steps: 1. prepare the parametrized trial quantum state |\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9 = U(\u03b8\u20d7)|\u03d50\u27e9 on the quantum computer [note: normalization is assumed], 2. estimate the expectation value of energy \u27e8\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)|H|\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)\u27e9 using measurements of terms in the Hamiltonian, 3. update the parameter(s) \u03b8\u20d7 of the quantum state using a classical optimization routine, and 4. repeat the previous steps until convergence criteria (e.g., in energy and/or iteration number) are satisfied. Often the challenge in VQE is the choice and/or design of the ansatz, which largely influences the performance of the algorithm. (341) This has motivated numerous studies and designs of ansatzes, several of which are reviewed in section 5.1.1. For our case of simulating molecular hydrogen, we selected an ansatz based on the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) method, as shown in Figure 12. To construct the ansatz, the HF reference state (i.e., |01\u27e9) is first prepared, followed by quantum operations corresponding to the application of the UCC operators. For more details on the UCC method, the reader should refer to section 5.1.1. We note that, for the H2 example, this level of theory is equivalent with the exact solution. Figure 12 Figure 12. Quantum circuit used in VQE to estimate the ground-state energy for molecular hydrogen in the minimal basis. After preparing the parametrized quantum state, using the HF reference state followed by the application of the unitary coupled cluster-inspired variational circuit. To estimate the energy expectation, necessary post-rotations (Rt \u2208 {RX(\u2212\u03c0/2), RY(\u03c0/2), I}) are applied before measuring the qubits in the Z basis. Once the ansatz is selected, its variational circuit implementation is executed on the quantum computer to compute the objective function value, which, in the case of VQE, is the energy expectation. We note that initialization of the variational circuit parameters should ideally be informative. For instance, in the case of UCC ansatz, the classically computed MP2 amplitudes can be used to initialize the VQE parameters (i.e., UCC amplitudes). The energy expectation can then be estimated using the Hamiltonian averaging procedure. Given that the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of Pauli terms acting on subsets of qubits, we can compute the energy expectation by averaging over the expectation values of the individual Pauli terms, as shown below: (109) where Oi is a Pauli term, a tensor product of Pauli operators (i.e., X, Y, Z, or I) acting on some subset of qubits, and hi is the corresponding weight. In the case of molecular hydrogen, the energy expectation expression becomes (110) We note that when measuring each Pauli expectation, post-rotations may need to be applied to make measurements in the Z basis. These measurements are then collected and processed to approximate the total energy. In practice, we can only obtain a finite number of measurements, leading to errors in the energy estimation. For a deeper analysis of the sampling error, the reader should refer to section 5.1.2 or ref (63). While VQE is a near-term alternative to the QPEA due to its low coherence time requirements, the trade-off or cost of the algorithm is the large number of measurements needed to approximate the ground-state energy with high precision. After computing the energy expectation with respect to some values assigned to the parameters, VQE employs a classical optimization routine to update the parameters to ideally reach a quantum state that better approximates the ground state. Section 5.1.3 reviews a number of optimization routines used and benchmarked for VQE in previous studies. Provided that the ansatz can well describe the ground state and the classical optimizer is robust against noise in the cost function landscape, VQE can provide a high-quality estimation for the ground-state energy. This is observed for our small example of molecular hydrogen, shown in Figure 13a, in which a simulation of the VQE algorithm was able to compute ground-state energies along the energy surface that were numerically equal to the corresponding FCI energy values. Note that we also show the sampling error at a particular geometry in Figure 13b. Figure 13 Figure 13. VQE simulation results for molecular hydrogen in the minimal basis (STO-6G). (a) Dissociation profile computed using the VQE algorithm. At each bond length, the energy computed using VQE is numerically equal to that of the FCI method. The L-BFGS-B method was used for parameter optimization. (b) Energy expectation plotted over a range of parameter values for bond length of 1.2 \u00c5. A parameter scan using a finite number of samples is overlaid with that generated using the wave function simulator. These simulations were implemented using OpenFermion (436) and Forest. (412) Since it was first presented in 2014, VQE has been widely studied and improved from both theoretical and experimental standpoints. In particular, VQE was experimentally implemented for molecular systems beyond hydrogen, as highlighted in section 5.1, demonstrating the utility and potential of the algorithm for applications in quantum chemistry even on early quantum computers.

Introduction The aim of this article is to review the recent development of ion trap quantum computing. This field has evolved rapidly in the recent decade. Thus the many facets of experimental ion trap quantum computing and its techniques cannot all be covered. Instead, we want to present here a coherent picture of the most important experimental issues and refer the reader to the original publications for the details. We also describe some of the milestones achieved so far in ion trap quantum computing, such as the teleportation of quantum states and quantum error correction. Still, much of the work especially towards shuttling ions with segmented traps is only touched upon. A quantum computer uses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve certain mathematical problems faster than normal computers. Such a quantum computer processes quantum information whose most basic unit is called a quantum bit (qubit). Already a small quantum computer, consisting of forty qubits,1 could solve quantum mechanical problems that are intractable with current computers. In particular, the study of quantum mechanical many-body systems would benefit considerably from such a device (Feynman, 1982, Lloyd, 1996). In 1989, David Deutsch discovered a mathematical problem which can be solved faster with quantum mechanical means than with classical ones (Deutsch, 1989). But it was a few years later when the rapid development of quantum computation set in, marked by Peter Shor\u2019s discovery of a quantum algorithm with which large numbers can be factored much faster than with today\u2019s classical algorithms (Shor, 1994). Shortly afterwards, Ignacio Cirac and Peter Zoller found a physical system on which such quantum algorithms could be implemented (Cirac and Zoller, 1995): single trapped ions were supposed to carry the quantum information, which is manipulated and read out with focused laser beams. Already within a year\u2019s time, David Wineland\u2019s group at National Institute of Standards and Technology demonstrated the heart of such an ion-trap quantum computer (Monroe et al., 1995a), a controlled bit flip on a single ion. Without exaggeration, one can say that those two publications mark the birth of experimental quantum computation. Rapidly, other implementations were also considered. In particular, liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance was used to demonstrate a quantum algorithm (Gershenfeld and Chuang, 1997, Chuang et al., 1998b, Jones and Mosca, 1998) and later even Shor\u2019s algorithm was implemented on a seven qubit register (Vandersypen et al., 2001). On the theoretical side, many new interesting implications were found. For quantum computation, the most relevant implication was the discovery of quantum error correction protocols by Shor (1995) and Steane (1996). These protocols allow for the implementation of arbitrary long quantum algorithms without perfect control. The basic unit of quantum information (a qubit) can be implemented with a two-level system such as the electron\u2019s spin in a magnetic field or using two levels of an atom. A simple quantum computation initializes the qubits, manipulates them and finally reads out the final states. Any physical implementation of quantum computation must be able to perform these tasks. Thus the physical system must satisfy the requirements laid out in Section 2.1 to qualify as a universal quantum computer (DiVincenzo, 2001). (1) It must be a scalable physical system with well characterized qubits. (2) It must be possible to initialize the qubits. (3) The qubits must have a coherence time much longer than the operation time. (4) There has to be a universal set of quantum gates. In the most simple case one considers single-qubit and entangling two-qubit gates. (5) A qubit-specific measurement must be attainable. Furthermore, to build up a quantum network, one requires: (6) The ability to interconvert stationary and flying qubits. (7) The ability to faithfully transmit flying qubits between specified locations. In principle, these requirements can be fulfilled with a number of physical approaches, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (Gershenfeld and Chuang, 1997), cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) (Raimond et al., 2001), Josephson junctions (Makhlin et al., 2001), a combination of circuit-QED and Josephson junctions (Wallraff et al., 2004, Majer et al., 2007) and quantum dots (Loss and DiVincenzo, 1998, Petta et al., 2005). Methods using linear optics have also been proposed (Knill et al., 2001b) and actually were used for quantum information processing (Walther et al., 2005, Lanyon et al., 2008), however, here the emphasis is naturally more on the transmission of quantum information rather than processing it. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, quite a number of impressive demonstration experiments have been performed. Unfortunately, the state of the quantum register (molecules) can only be poorly initialized (except in special cases (Jones, 2000)), making the scaling properties of NMR quantum computation not very promising (Warren, 1997, Jones, 2000, Linden and Popescu, 2001). At the moment Josephson junctions seem to be very appealing, especially when combined with superconducting strip line cavities (Wallraff et al., 2004, Majer et al., 2007). Recently, Steffen et al. (2006) and Plantenberg et al. (2007) demonstrated Bell-states and a controlled-NOT, respectively, with pairs of Josephson junction qubits. 2. Ion trap quantum computers Of the many approaches that have been proposed for constructing a quantum computer, trapped ions are currently one of the most advanced (Army Research Office, USA, 2005). This is also reflected in the fact that around the year 2000 only half a dozen groups pursued experimental ion-trap quantum computing while in 2008 there are more than 25 groups working in the field. Already, long before the idea of quantum computation was picked up by experimentalists, four out of the five core criteria required by DiVincenzo for a quantum computer were demonstrated with trapped ions in the laboratory: initialization (Wineland et al., 1980) and read-out of the internal electronic states of trapped ions (Nagourney et al., 1986, Sauter et al., 1986, Bergquist et al., 1986), extremely long coherence times (Bollinger et al., 1991) and laser cooled ion crystals with many ions (Diedrich et al., 1987, Wineland et al., 1987, Raizen et al., 1992a, Raizen et al., 1992b) serving as a qubit register. Then Cirac and Zoller (1995) realized that quantum computation can be carried out by coupling the ions via a collective motional degree of freedom. Thus, a route to implement the missing conditional evolution of physically separated qubits (a two-qubit interaction) was introduced. In addition, they proved that the size of the resources necessary to control trapped ions does not increase exponentially with the number of qubits (Cirac and Zoller, 1995). Soon after the proposal by Cirac and Zoller in 1995, the NIST ion storage group around David Wineland implemented the key idea of the proposal\u2013a conditioned phase shift\u2013with a single Be+-ion (Monroe et al., 1995a). Furthermore they demonstrated a few other two-qubit gate candidates (Sackett et al., 2000, DeMarco et al., 2002, Leibfried et al., 2003b), entangled up to four ions (Sackett et al., 2000), demonstrated a so-called decoherence free subspace (Kielpinski et al., 2001) and simulated a nonlinear beam-splitter (Leibfried et al., 2002). In our group in Innsbruck, the Deutsch\u2013Josza algorithm was demonstrated with a single Ca+-ion (Gulde et al., 2003), followed by the first implementation of a set of universal gates on a two-ion string (Schmidt-Kaler et al., 2003c). In addition, the creation of various entangled states and the partial read-out of an entangled quantum register was demonstrated (Roos et al., 2004b). Further milestones in ion-trap quantum computing were experiments on quantum teleportation by both groups (Barrett et al., 2004, Riebe et al., 2004), an error correction protocol by the NIST-group (Chiaverini et al., 2004), entanglement of six and eight particles (Leibfried et al., 2005, H\u00e4ffner et al., 2005a) by both groups, respectively and entanglement purification (Reichle et al., 2006b). Recently, ions in separate traps have been also entangled using ion\u2013photon entanglement by the Ann\u2013Arbor group (Blinov et al., 2004, Maunz et al., 2007, Moehring et al., 2007, Matsukevich et al., 2008). Currently, miniaturization and integration of segmented ion traps is rapidly progressing. Already for some time, the NIST group has been successfully using microfabricated segmented traps to relieve the difficulties of single ion addressing. Inspired by this success, in the meantime virtually all ion trap groups started to develop segmented trap technologies. Furthermore, US funding bodies initiated contacts between the various groups to further ion trap related technologies and established contacts to microfabrication laboratories, such as Lucent Technologies and Sandia National Laboratories. In Europe the \u2018Specific Targeted Research Project\u2019 MICROTRAPS with six participating groups has been formed to further microfabricated ion trap technologies. 2.1. Principles of ion-trap quantum computers A excellent overview and detailed account of the fundamental issues of ion trap quantum computing is given by Wineland et al. (1998) and by \u0160a\u0161ura and Bu\u017eek (2002). Furthermore, Leibfried et al. (2003a) review the progress towards the manipulation and control of single ions. Very recently, the generation and applications of entangled ions were reviewed by Blatt and Wineland (2008). We start here by summarizing how ion-trap quantum computers fulfill the DiVincenzo criteria mentioned above (DiVincenzo, 2001): (1) A scalable physical system with well characterized qubits: long-lived internal levels of the ions serve as the qubits (see Section 2.3). The qubit register is formed by strings of ions in a (linear) trap. While this approach is in principle scalable, it is desirable to distribute the ions among multiple traps (Wineland et al., 1998, Kielpinski et al., 2002). Thus complications, due to the increased mass and more the complicated mode structure of large ion strings can be circumvented. First steps in this direction will be briefly discussed in Section 8. (2) The ability to initialize the state of the qubits: this is most easily achieved by optical pumping to a well-defined electronic state. Fidelities of 0.99 are typical, in Section 2.4 also methods to achieve much higher fidelities will be discussed. (3) A coherence time much longer than the operational time: in current quantum computing experiments, typically coherence times of a few milliseconds are achieved, which are about one to two orders of magnitude longer than the time scale for quantum operations (see Section 3 for details). The coherence time is often limited by magnetic field fluctuations. on the other hand, coherence times of more than 10 s have been demonstrated with Raman-transitions between magnetic-field insensitive transitions (Langer et al., 2005). Similar observations were made in 43Ca+ by the Oxford and Innsbruck groups (Lucas et al., 2007, Benhelm et al., 2008a). Furthermore, Bollinger et al. (1991) demonstrated a coherence time of more than 10 min using a microwave drive instead of a Raman-laser setup. However, so far only one experiment demonstrated the combination of high-fidelity quantum gates and magnetic field insensitive transitions (Haljan et al., 2005b). (4) A universal set of quantum gates: (a) Single qubit gates are implemented by driving Rabi oscillations between the two qubit levels with resonant laser pulses (see Section 2.5). The gates can be represented as rotations of the Bloch sphere where the axis of rotation can be selected by changing the phase of the exciting laser field (single photon transition) or the phase difference of the two Raman beams (see Section 2.5). A single-qubit phase-gate can be produced directly by an off-resonant laser via an AC-Stark shift (see Section 2.5). (b) For two-qubit gates usually the long range interaction due to the Coulomb force is employed. In the original proposal by Cirac and Zoller, the quantum information of one ion is swapped to the common motional degree of freedom of the ion string (Cirac and Zoller, 1995). Then an operation conditioned on the motional state can be carried out on a second ion before the quantum information is swapped back from the motion to the first ion. Section 2.6 details this idea as well as other methods to implement multi-qubit gates. Implementations of some of the two-qubit gate recipes will be discussed in Sections 4.1 Cirac\u2013Zoller-type gates, 4.2 Entangled states with trapped ions. (5) A qubit-specific measurement: one of the qubit levels is excited on a strong transition to a higher lying auxiliary short-lived level while the other qubit level remains untouched. Thus, fluorescence from the decay is detected only if the qubit is projected to the qubit level which is coupled to the auxiliary transition (see Section 2.4). Additionally DiVincenzo requires: (6) The ability to interconvert stationary and flying qubits: ions can be stored in a high-finesse cavity. Thus, the ions\u2019 internal state can be mapped onto a photonic state (Cirac et al., 1997). (7) The ability to faithfully transmit flying qubits between specified locations: a photon can be transmitted through a fiber and at the target location coupled via another high-finesse cavity to the target ion. There exist further possibilities to connect two distant ion trap quantum computers. One of them will be briefly discussed in Section 5.5. For practical applications, the DiVincenzo criteria have not only to be fulfilled, but also the fidelity and speed of the implementations have to be considered (see Section 8). Furthermore, it is highly desirable to implement all operations as parallel as possible. 2.2. The basic Hamiltonian We will now briefly discuss the Hamiltonian of two-level systems interacting with a quantized harmonic oscillator via laser light. For more detailed discussions, we refer to Refs. Wineland et al. (1998) and Leibfried et al. (2003a). The basic level scheme of such a system is displayed in Fig. 1. We start out by writing the Hamiltonian for a trapped single ion interacting with near resonant laser light, taking into account only two levels of the ion and one vibrational mode (taken to be oriented along the z direction): (1) H = \u0127 \u03a9 \u03c3 + e \u2212 i ( \u0394 t \u2212 \u03c6 ) exp ( i \u03b7 [ a e \u2212 i \u03c9 t t + a \u2020 e i \u03c9 t t ] ) + h.c. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Energy level scheme of a single trapped ion with a ground ( | g \u3009 ) and an excited ( | e \u3009 ) level in a harmonic trap (oscillator states are labeled | 0 \u3009 , | 1 \u3009 , | 2 \u3009 , \u2026 ). \u03a9 denotes the carrier Rabi frequency. The Rabi frequency on the blue sideband transition | 0 , e \u3009 \u2194 | 1 , g \u3009 transition is reduced by the Lamb-Dicke factor \u03b7 as compared to the carrier transition (see Eq. (5)). The symbols \u03c9 qubit and \u03c9 t denote the qubit and the trap frequency, respectively. Here, \u03c3 \u00b1 is either the atomic raising or the atomic lowering operator, while a \u2020 and a denote the creation and annihilation operator for a motional quantum, respectively. \u03a9 characterizes the strength of the laser field in terms of the so-called Rabi frequency, \u03c6 denotes the phase of the field with respect to the atomic polarization and \u0394 is the laser-atom detuning. \u03c9 t denotes the trap frequency, \u03b7 = k z z 0 is the Lamb-Dicke parameter with k z being the projection of the laser field\u2019s wavevector along the z direction and z 0 = \u0127 / ( 2 m \u03c9 t ) is the spatial extension of the ion\u2019s ground state wave function in the harmonic oscillator ( m is here the ion\u2019s mass). We mention also that the rotating wave approximation has been applied which assumes that both the laser detuning and Rabi frequency are much smaller than optical frequencies. A similar treatment can be carried out for qubits based on Raman-transitions by eliminating the virtual level through which the two qubits are coupled. Please note that in our definition the Rabi frequency measures the frequency with which the population is exchanged in contrast to the definition used by Wineland et al. (1998) and Leibfried et al. (2003a). Using the Lamb\u2013Dicke approximation ( \u03b7 \u3008 ( a + a \u2020 ) 2 \u3009 \u226a 1 ) which is almost always valid for cold tightly bound ion strings, we can rewrite Eq. (2) (Leibfried et al., 2003a, Jonathan et al., 2000): (2) H = \u0127 \u03a9 { \u03c3 + e \u2212 i ( \u0394 t \u2212 \u03c6 ) + \u03c3 \u2212 e i ( \u0394 t \u2212 \u03c6 ) + i \u03b7 ( \u03c3 + e \u2212 i ( \u0394 t \u2212 \u03c6 ) \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 e i ( \u0394 t \u2212 \u03c6 ) ) ( a e \u2212 i \u03c9 t t + a \u2020 e i \u03c9 t t ) } . Three cases of laser detuning \u0394 are of particular interest (see Fig. 1): \u0394 = 0 and \u0394 = \u00b1 \u03c9 t . This becomes apparent if a second rotating wave approximation is carried out where it is assumed that only one transition is relevant at a time. Discarding time dependent terms, we thus arrive at (1) the Hamiltonian describing the carrier transition ( \u0394 = 0 ) (3) H car = \u0127 \u03a9 ( \u03c3 + e i \u03c6 + \u03c3 \u2212 e \u2212 i \u03c6 ) . Here only the electronic states | g \u3009 and | e \u3009 of the ion are changed. (2) the Hamiltonian describing the blue sideband transition ( \u0394 = \u03c9 t ) (4) H + = i \u0127 \u03a9 \u03b7 ( \u03c3 + a \u2020 e i \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 a e \u2212 i \u03c6 ) . Simultaneously to exciting the electronic state of the ion, in this case, a motional quantum (a phonon) is created. Within this two-level system, Rabi flopping with the Rabi frequency (5) \u03a9 n , n + 1 = n + 1 \u03b7 \u03a9 occurs, where n describes the number of motional quanta (phonons). For convenience, we define the blue sideband Rabi frequency \u03a9 + = \u03a9 0 , 1 which describes the flopping frequency between the | g , 0 \u3009 and the | e , 1 \u3009 state. (3) the Hamiltonian describing the red sideband transition ( \u0394 = \u2212 \u03c9 t ) (6) H \u2212 = i \u0127 \u03a9 \u03b7 ( \u03c3 \u2212 a \u2020 e \u2212 i \u03c6 + \u03c3 + a e i \u03c6 ) . Simultaneously to exciting the electronic state, here a phonon is destroyed and Rabi flopping with the Rabi frequency (7) \u03a9 n , n \u2212 1 = n \u03b7 \u03a9 takes place. Naturally, one is interested in driving the sideband transitions as fast as possible to speed up the quantum operations based on the sideband transitions. However, especially for small Lamb\u2013Dicke factors, the second rotating wave approximation performed to obtain Eqs. (3), (4), (5), (6) is then not satisfied for Rabi frequencies \u03a9 comparable with the trap frequency \u03c9 t : as can be seen from Eq. (5) for ions in the motional ground state, the carrier transition is stronger by a factor of 1 / \u03b7 as compared with the sideband transitions. Therefore, driving the weak sideband transitions with strong laser fields, Stark shifts and off-resonant excitations arise (Steane et al., 2000). For example, to achieve a side-band Rabi frequency \u03a9 + of a fraction f of the trap frequency \u03c9 t , we need a laser field of strength \u03a9 = \u03a9 + / \u03b7 = f \u03c9 t / \u03b7 . The Stark shift \u0394 E of the qubit transition due to the presence of the carrier transition is given by (8) \u0394 E \u0127 = \u03a9 2 2 \u0394 = 1 2 \u03c9 t f \u03c9 t \u03a9 + \u03b7 2 = f 2 \u03b7 2 \u03a9 + . The phase evolution \u0394 E t / \u0127 due to the AC-Stark shift becomes comparable with the desired Rabi flopping with frequency \u03a9 + already for f \u223c \u03b7 2 and thus typically for f \u223c 0.01 ( \u03b7 \u223c 0.1 ) . Similarly, off-resonant excitations on the carrier transition might spoil the fidelity in this regime. In particular, Rabi oscillations on the carrier transition occur with amplitude A  (Steane et al., 2000) (9) A = \u03a9 2 \u03a9 2 + \u03c9 t 2 \u2248 \u03a9 2 \u03c9 t 2 = f 2 \u03b7 2 , where we assumed \u03a9 \u226a \u03c9 t , which is justified by the conclusions from Eq. (8). Both the AC-Stark shift and the off-resonant excitations, can be at least partially canceled with methods described in Section 3.1.3. However, it still remains very difficult to drive Rabi flops on sidebands much faster than \u03b7 \u03c9 t . Thus, it is hard to implement a two-qubit gate based on sideband transitions within one trap period. 2.3. Choice of qubit ions A good qubit candidate must meet certain criteria. In the case of trapped ions it is usually sufficient to concentrate on long coherence times on the qubit transition compared with the manipulation times and on the technical feasibility of the required lasers. The scale to which the coherence time has to be compared with is given by the gate operation times of typically 0.1\u2013500 \u03bcs (c.f. Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Currently achieved time scales in ion trap quantum computing. All operations can be implemented faster than the relevant decoherence mechanisms. Currently, two different schemes are used to store quantum information in trapped ions: In the first scheme, superpositions between the electronic ground state and an excited metastable electronic state provide the two-level system (optical qubit) (see Fig. 3a and 4). The excited D5/2-level in Ca+\u2013similarly to Sr+ and Ba+\u2013has a life time of more than one second (Barton et al., 2000, Kreuter et al., 2004, Kreuter et al., 2005). In a second scheme, even larger coherence times can be achieved with superpositions encoded in the electronic ground-state of the ions (radio-frequency qubits) (see Fig. 3). Here, either the Zeeman or the hyperfine structure can be used. The lifetimes of these states are estimated to be much larger than any currently experimentally relevant timescales. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Generic level schemes of atoms for optical qubits (left) and radio-frequency qubits (right). In addition to the two qubit levels { | 0 \u3009 , | 1 \u3009 } usually a third rapidly decaying level is used for laser cooling and state read-out. While the optical qubit is typically manipulated on a quadrupole transition, radio-frequency qubit levels are connected with Raman-transitions. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Level scheme of 40Ca+, with Zeeman substructure and required laser wavelengths for manipulation of the calcium ions. There are different aspects to be considered for optical and and radio-frequency qubits: to fully exploit the potential of the optical qubit provided by the S1/2 and D5/2-level in Ca+, a laser line width of less than 200 mHz is required. This fractional stability of about 1 0 \u2212 15 is technically quite demanding, however, it has already been implemented for metrology purposes (Young et al., 1999a, Young et al., 1999b, Hall et al., 2006). The transition frequencies for radio-frequency qubits are usually below 10 GHz. Thus, it is much easier to get the required stable phase reference. Radio-frequency qubits can be manipulated either directly by microwaves (Mintert and Wunderlich, 2001) or\u2013as it is usually the case\u2013by a Raman-process (Monroe et al., 1995a). Here, a single atom absorbs a photon from one laser field and emits a second one into a second laser field. The frequency difference of the two laser fields provides the necessary energy for the population transfer and thus only this frequency difference is important. The two laser fields are either derived from the same laser or a phase locking between two lasers can be implemented without resorting to optical frequency standards. Using optical fields instead of microwaves has the advantage that a much better spatial concentration of the power can be achieved and much higher Rabi-frequencies can be attained as with microwaves. Furthermore, by driving radio-frequency qubits optically with two anti-parallel beams, two photons can transfer their recoil onto the atom. Thus, the coupling to the ion motion is increased as compared with single photon transitions (larger Lamb\u2013Dicke factors \u03b7 ) and as a consequence the speed of two-qubit gates can be higher. Choosing co-propagating beams, the coupling to the motion can be inhibited efficiently which has the benefit of suppressing the sensitivity to the ion motion. For optical as well as for rf-qubits, coherence times are often limited by fluctuations of the magnetic fields. The reason is that usually the qubit basis states employed have different magnetic moments such that they experience an additional phase evolution due to the (fluctuating) magnetic field. Strategies to avoid these decoherence sources will be discussed in Section 3.1.2. We note here that a good qubit must not necessarily combine a large coherence time to manipulation time ratio with high fidelity initialization and read-out capabilities: initialization and read-out can be implemented with an additional auxiliary ion of a different ion species. This idea has already been demonstrated by the NIST group (Schmidt et al., 2005): in this experiment aimed at implementing a frequency standard, the state of an individual Al+ ion was detected via a Be+ ion. However, for practical purposes it is desirable to initialize and read out the qubit ion directly. Finally, a good qubit candidate must have all the relevant transitions in an accessible frequency regime. Generally, laser sources, fibers and detectors for short wavelengths are more expensive, less efficient and often more fault-prone than for longer wavelengths. However, ions tend to have short wavelength transitions. Thus, there are only a very limited number of ions which have strong transitions in the visible frequency range. In the quantum computing context, calcium, strontium and ytterbium ions appear to be attractive due to their relative large wavelength transitions. However, beryllium and magnesium have a relatively small atomic mass which leads to large Lamb\u2013Dicke factors ( \u03b7 \u2248 0.3 in some of the NIST experiments) and eases coupling of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom and thus makes them attractive in spite of difficulties with laser radiation generation, manipulation and fiber optics. 2.4. Initialization and read-out Prior to the implementation of a quantum algorithm, the qubits must be initialized in a well-defined state. For atoms, in general, this can be most conveniently achieved by optical pumping. This idea was introduced by Kastler (1950) and first implemented by Brossel et al. (1952) and by Hawkins and Dicke (1953). For reviews on optical pumping see Refs. Happer (1972), Weber (1977) and Wineland et al. (1980). The general idea of optical pumping is that an atom is driven until it decays into a state where the drive does not act any longer. Usually, circularly polarized light is used to pump the atom into one of the extreme Zeeman-levels. Typically, the target state is occupied in less than 1 \u03bcs with a probability larger than 0.99. The initialization fidelity is usually limited by the quality of the polarization of the driving laser along the preferred axis of the qubit. In most cases, this axis is given by the direction of the magnetic field. For fault-tolerant quantum computing, however, it appears that initialization fidelities exceeding 0.9999 are desirable. It is not clear whether such high preparation fidelities can be achieved with the methods described above. Furthermore, there exist situations where it is not possible to achieve a pure circular polarization along the quantization axis. The latter might happen for instance, because there is no optical access along the direction of the magnetic field to send a laser in. In these cases, a frequency rather than a polarization selection can be used for optical pumping if the ions offer a spectrally narrow transition (Roos et al., 2006). We illustrate this procedure here for the 40Ca+-ion: with a narrow band laser the ion is excited on the S 1 / 2 ( m j = + 1 / 2 ) \u27f7 D 5 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 3 / 2 ) transition (see Fig. 4) and simultaneously the D level is coupled to the P 3 / 2 level with a broad band laser at 854 nm. In this way the population of the S 1 / 2 ( m j = + 1 / 2 ) state is effectively coupled to the rapidly decaying P 3 / 2 ( m j = { \u2212 3 / 2 , \u2212 1 / 2 } ) levels while the S 1 / 2 ( m j = + 1 / 2 ) level is not touched. Fig. 5 shows the depletion of the initially fully populated S 1 / 2 ( m j = + 1 / 2 ) level with time. Pumping time constants of about 10 \u03bcs have been demonstrated in Innsbruck. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Optical pumping of the 40Ca+ S 1 / 2 ( m j = + 1 / 2 ) level using frequency selection rather than polarization selection. In principle, the attainable pumping efficiency is only limited by the strongest Rabi frequency and pumping time. Assuming a typical transition splitting of the various Zeeman transitions of a few MHz, Rabi frequencies \u03a9 Rabi lower than 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 10 kHz are required to keep the off-resonant excitations P off \u2248 \u03a9 2 / \u0394 2 (see Eq. (9)) of the unwanted transitions below 1 0 \u2212 4 . From that, we estimate that within 1 ms an initialization fidelity of 0.9999 can be reached. In experiments in Innsbruck, preparation fidelities exceeding 0.999 have already been observed (Roos et al., 2006). At the end of a quantum algorithm the quantum register needs to measured. Radiation coupling to only one of the qubit levels can be used here. This idea was introduced by Dehmelt (1975) and is often termed electron shelving. Experimentally it was first implemented by Nagourney et al. (1986), Sauter et al. (1986), and by Bergquist et al. (1986). Referring to the level scheme of 40Ca+ in Fig. 4, the ion does not fluoresce under irradiation of light on the S 1 / 2 \u2192 P 1 / 2 and D 3 / 2 \u2192 P 1 / 2 transitions if its valence electron is in the D5/2-state. If the electron, however, is in either the S1/2-,P1/2- or D3/2-state, the ion will scatter approximately 10 7 \u2013 10 8 photons/s. A lens system collects typically 1 0 \u2212 3 \u2013 1 0 \u2212 2 of this fluorescence light such that with a photomultiplier tube (quantum efficiency \u223c30%) about 30 photons/ms can be detected. As typical background count rates of photomultiplier tubes are usually well below 1 count/ms, one expects exceedingly high state detection fidelities when collecting fluorescence for detection times of more than one millisecond. However, this reasoning holds only if the ion has a negligible probability to decay either from the P 1 / 2 to the D5/2 or from the D5/2 to the S1/2 or the D 3 / 2 level during the detection time. In practice, these two constraints lead to an optimal detection time where the error due to the Poissonian spread of the number of scattered photons is balanced with the relaxation time scales (Roos, 2000, Acton et al., 2006, Myerson et al., 2008). Typical detection times are about one millisecond with detection fidelities exceeding 0.99. The fidelity can be further increased by analyzing the arrival times of the photons with a maximum likelihood method and thus identifying some events when the D5/2 level decayed during the detection (Myerson et al., 2008). Other qubits can be detected very similarly. If the energy separation of the two qubits, however, is not large enough to allow for selection via the laser frequency, polarization of the laser field can be used. For instance for 9Be+, circular polarization ensures that predominantly only one of the two qubit states scatters photons (Sackett et al., 2000, Langer, 2006). The detection efficiency can be further increased when the quantum state is mapped onto auxiliary qubits prior to its measurement: for this, one prepares first an additional qubit (the ancilla qubit) in state | 0 \u3009 . A controlled-NOT operation maps then the qubit \u03b1 | 0 \u3009 + \u03b2 | 1 \u3009 onto the combined state \u03b1 | 00 \u3009 + \u03b2 | 11 \u3009 of the two qubits. Measuring both qubits yields an improved fidelity as compared with measuring a single qubit if the fidelity of the ancilla qubit state preparation and the controlled-NOT operation are high enough. Schaetz et al. (2005) demonstrated this procedure, albeit preparing the ancilla ion in ( | 0 \u3009 + | 1 \u3009 ) / 2 and replacing the controlled-NOT with a controlled phase gate (see Section 2.6.4) followed by a single-qubit rotation on the ancilla. Hume et al. (2007) present another variant to improve the state detection fidelity by measuring the qubit repeatedly. In this experiment, the qubit is encoded in superpositions of the ground state and the excited qubit level of 27Al+. This qubit state is first transferred to a 9Be+ ion by a series of laser pulses (Schmidt et al., 2005): a first pulse on the red sideband on an auxiliary transition of the Al+ ion inserts one motional quantum only if the Al+ ion is in the ground state. This motional excitation is transferred to the 9Be+ ion with a red sideband pulse on the 9Be+ ion which is then detected via the usual state dependent fluorescence method. Most importantly, the electronic auxiliary state of the Al+ ion decays back to the ground state on a timescale of about 300 \u03bcs and not to the excited qubit state. Thus the information in which state the qubit is projected is still available in the Al+ ion and this procedure can be repeated. Based on the photon counts from the 9Be+ ion and previous detection results, another detection step is carried out. Repeating this procedure on average 6.5 times, Hume et al. (2007) achieve a detection efficiency of 0.9994. The accuracy of this method is only limited by processes which couple the excited qubit state of the Al+ ion (\u223c21 s) to one of the electronic levels which does not decay to the ground state. Very recently, Myerson et al. (2008) took advantage of the arrival times of the photons and combined it with the adaptive scheme just discussed. Thus they reached within an average detection time of 145 \u03bcs efficiencies of about 0.9999 of a qubit encoded in the S\u2013D manifold of a single 40Ca+. 2.5. Single-qubit gates It can be shown that all quantum algorithms can be broken down into a sequence of single-qubit operations plus a specific two-qubit operation, e.g. a conditional phase gate, a controlled-NOT gate or a SWAP gate (Deutsch, 1989, Nielsen and Chuang, 2000). In ion traps, single-qubit operations are usually easy to implement and thus it is reasonable to use this approach to attain universal quantum computing. Rabi oscillations between the two qubit levels (see Fig. 6) implement such single-qubit operations. Mathematically, we can describe the effect of resonant radiation inducing such a coupling by a rotation R C ( \u03b8 , \u03c6 ) acting on the state vector \u03b1 | 0 \u3009 + \u03b2 | 1 \u3009 (c.f. Nielsen and Chuang (2000)): (10) R C ( \u03b8 , \u03d5 ) = exp ( i \u03b8 / 2 ( e i \u03c6 \u03c3 + + e \u2212 i \u03c6 \u03c3 \u2212 ) ) = I cos \u03b8 / 2 + i ( \u03c3 x cos \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c3 y sin \u03c6 ) sin \u03b8 / 2 = ( cos \u03b8 / 2 i e i \u03c6 sin \u03b8 / 2 i e \u2212 i \u03c6 sin \u03b8 / 2 cos \u03b8 / 2 ) , where \u03c3 + = ( 0 1 0 0 ) and \u03c3 \u2212 = ( 0 0 1 0 )  are the respective atomic raising and lowering operators. \u03c3 x = ( 0 1 1 0 )  and \u03c3 y = ( 0 \u2212 i i 0 )  are the Pauli-spin matrices. The angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 specify the rotation. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Rabi oscillations of a single Ca+ ion. Each dot represents 1000 experiments, each consisting of initialization, application of laser light on the qubit transition and state detection. Often single-qubit operations are visualized by use of the so-called Bloch sphere. We identify the north pole of the Bloch sphere with logical | 0 \u3009 (the energetically higher state) and the south pole with | 1 \u3009 (see Fig. 7). In the Bloch picture, the angle \u03c6 specifies the axis of rotation in the equatorial plane and \u03b8 the rotation angle (pulse area), and thus any linear combination of \u03c3 x and \u03c3 y operations can be implemented with laser pulses. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Rotation around the y axis visualized on the Bloch-sphere. Rotations around the z axis can be decomposed into rotations around the x and the y axis. Alternatively, all following rotations on that qubit can be shifted by \u2212 \u0394 \u03c6 to achieve effectively a rotation about the z axis by \u0394 \u03c6 . Finally, a far detuned laser beam can shift the relative energy \u0394 E of the eigenstates due to an AC-Stark effect by \u0394 E = \u03a9 2 / 2 \u0394 (c.f. Eq. (8)). Thus, after a time t = \u0127 \u0394 \u03c6 / \u0394 E the desired phase shift is acquired. The relevant control parameters in the ion trap experiments are the pulse area \u03b8 = \u03a9 \u03c4 (Rabi frequency \u03a9 , pulse length \u03c4 ) and the phase of the laser field \u03c6 . These control parameters can be conveniently controlled with an acousto-optical modulator in double-pass configuration (c.f. Donley et al. (2005)) by changing the amplitude and phase of the RF field driving the acousto-optical modulator. We will give here a quick interpretation of the phase \u03c6 : After optical pumping the experiments start with the ion qubits in an energy eigenstate. Thus the electric field of the resonant excitation laser builds up a dipole (or quadrupole) moment oscillating in phase with the field at the laser frequency. In this way, the first laser pulse (whose length is not a multiple of  \u03c0 ) sets the phase reference for all subsequent operations on that ion. Thus, it becomes very intuitive to see e.g. that shifting the phase of a second excitation field by \u03c0 inverses the evolution. In ion traps, single-qubit manipulations are routinely carried out with fidelities exceeding 0.99 (Knill et al., 2008). Single-qubit-gate fidelities are usually limited by laser intensity fluctuations and in the case of single photon transitions by the finite temperature of the ion crystal and in the case of Raman transitions also by spontaneous emission from the intermediate level. In the Lamb\u2013Dicke limit (i.e. the extension of the ground-state wave function is much smaller than the projection of wavelength of the light onto the motion), the effective Rabi frequency \u03a9 eff of the transition is given by (Wineland et al., 1998) (11) \u03a9 eff \u2248 \u03a9 \u220f i ( 1 \u2212 n i \u03b7 i 2 ) , where i labels all motional modes, n i is their vibrational quantum number and \u03b7 i denotes the corresponding Lamb\u2013Dicke factor. Here, in contrast to Eq. (2), the second order in \u03b7 was taken into account. \u03a9 is the Rabi frequency for an ion (string) completely cooled to the ground state of the trap. For Raman transitions, \u03b7 i can be made quite small ( \u223c 1 0 \u2212 7 ) by using co-propagating beams such that the Rabi frequency is given just by \u03a9 (the same reasoning holds for microwaves). Thus, in practice, only single-qubit operations on optical qubits suffer from finite temperature effects. The speed of single-qubit rotations is often limited by the acousto-optical modulator used to control the light field: during switching the light field, phase and amplitude chirps appear which can spoil gate fidelities considerably. Further speed limitations are set by the amount of available laser power and more fundamentally by transitions close by, e.g. due to other Zeeman levels. Excitations on unwanted transitions due to strong laser fields transfer the population out of the computational subspace and thus spoil the fidelity. 2.5.1. Individual addressing of ion qubits Individual addressing of qubits is particularly difficult if multi and single-qubit gates have to be carried out in the same trap: reasonable gate times are only possible for high trap frequencies resulting in small ion\u2013ion spacings, which, in turn, require very well-shaped laser beams to address the ions. The most straightforward way to achieve single ion addressing is to focus the qubit manipulation laser strongly. In the Innsbruck experiments a waist of 2 \u03bcm FWHM reliably distinguishes between ions spaced by 5 \u03bcm. Including deviations from a Gaussian beam shape, a 1000-fold reduction of the light intensity at the position of the adjacent ions as compared with the addressed ion can be achieved. This corresponds to an unwanted Rabi frequency of 0.03 on the adjacent ions with respect to the addressed ion (addressing error \u03f5 = \u03a9 neighboring \u03a9 addressed = 0.03 ). A complication arises from the fact that one would like to irradiate the ion string with the laser beam perpendicular to the trap axis to resolve the ion positions. This, in turn, leads to a strongly reduced coupling of the laser field to the ion motion along the axial direction. In Innsbruck, an angle of about 68 \u2218 between the laser beam and the trap symmetry axis was chosen as a compromise between the two diametral requirements. To fulfill the stringent requirements for quantum computation, one could use only every second ion thus increasing the qubit\u2013qubit distance. However, with an increasing number of ions, the Lamb\u2013Dicke factor tends to become smaller which in turn results in slower two-qubit operations. Furthermore, the more complicated normal mode spectrum might reduce the obtainable fidelity. A more favorable method to reduce the effect of addressing imperfections is to use composite pulses also discussed in Section 2.7.3: here a single pulse is split into several smaller pulses. As an example, we consider here the realization of an R C ( \u03c0 , 0 ) operation with the pulse sequence R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 ) R z ( \u03c0 ) R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) (see Fig. 8). The first pulse ( R ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) ) moves the Bloch vector of the addressed qubit into the equatorial plane, while the Bloch vectors of the unaddressed qubit i is rotated by the addressing error angle \u03f5 i \u03c0 / 2 . The AC-Stark pulse R z ( \u03c0 ) (e.g. implemented with the laser tuned off resonance) rotates the phase of the addressed qubit by \u03c0 , while the phases of all other qubits are rotated only by \u03f5 i 2 \u03c0 . The last R ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 ) pulse finalizes then the rotation on the addressed qubit, while on the other qubits the effect of the first pulse is undone to a large extent for sufficiently small \u03f5 i 2 . Fig. 8b illustrates this behavior on the Bloch sphere for a rather large addressing error of 0.3. We note that if the addressing imperfection of the operations is well-known, much better results can be achieved. For instance Haljan et al. (2005b) choose the length of a spatially inhomogeneous R z pulse such that two qubits acquire a phase difference of \u03c0  (Lee, 2006). In this way, one can afford addressing errors \u03f5 close to unity. Similar techniques were also used by Kielpinski et al. (2001). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Evolution of the Bloch vector on the Bloch sphere for a bit flip with the pulse sequence R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 ) R z ( \u03c0 ) R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) (left-hand side, see text for an explanation). The right-hand side displays the state evolution for a Rabi frequency corresponding to 0.3 of the one on the left-hand side (pulse sequence R C ( 0.3 \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 ) R z ( 0 . 3 2 \u03c0 ) R C ( 0.3 \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) ). This composite pulse technique uses the fact that single-qubit operations commute on different ions. This is not the case for sideband transitions as multiple ions interact simultaneously with the a vibrational mode. However, it can be shown that by splitting sideband pulses into a sufficiently large number of pulses (\u223c5) errors in the population of the vibrational mode are undone before they get large (H\u00e4nsel, 2003). Thus, addressing errors can also be suppressed in this case with composite pulses. A related technique is addressing in frequency space (Staanum and Drewsen, 2002, Schrader et al., 2004, Haljan et al., 2005b): here an inhomogeneous laser or a magnetic field gradient induces different transition frequencies for each qubit. Thus the laser predominantly interacts with the qubit whose transition frequency matches the laser frequency. The disadvantage, however, is that in this case one must keep track of the phases of all qubits individually. In addition, it is necessary to control the strength of the gradient field sufficiently well to avoid dephasing of the qubits. This can be a serious problem when the qubit register is large and some of the qubits experience a very fast phase evolution due to the gradient field. There are various other possibilities to achieve effective addressing (see e.g. Wineland et al. (1998)): One particularly useful trick consists in changing the distance of the ions between the quantum operations by altering the trap stiffness (see e.g. Refs. Rowe et al. (2001) and Reichle et al. (2006b)). In this way the relative phase of the operations on the individual ions can be changed allowing one to address even individual groups of ions for non-local operations. In addition, it was demonstrated that a two-ion string can be placed in such a way in the trap that the ions have a different micromotion amplitudes. This in turn leads to different transition strengths and thus to single particle addressing capabilities (Monroe et al., 1999, King, 1999). 2.6. Two-qubit gates One route to achieve a universal set of gates (Deutsch, 1989), is to complement single-qubit operations with two-qubit gate operations. These operations are one of the most important ingredients of a quantum computer as they provide the possibility to entangle two qubits. In combination with single-qubit operations they allow for implementation of any unitary operation (Barenco et al., 1995). In many implementations of quantum algorithms with trapped ions, the fidelity of the whole algorithm was limited by the fidelity with which the two-qubit operations were implemented. Thus, currently the implementation of high-fidelity entangling gates is of crucial importance. In the following, we will discuss the Cirac\u2013Zoller gate (Section 2.6.2), the M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate (Section 2.6.3) and the so-called geometric phase gate (Section 2.6.4), before we briefly summarize various additional proposals for two-qubit gates (Section 2.6.5). 2.6.1. Motion of ion strings The interaction between the ionic qubits can be mediated by motional degrees of freedom that serve as a quantum bus for distributing quantum information between the ions. Therefore, we will discuss first the manipulation of the motion of single ions and ion strings (see also Ref. Leibfried et al. (2003a)). The basic level scheme representing a single ion coupled to a single motional mode is depicted in Fig. 1. A laser field resonant with the carrier transition of frequency \u03c9 qubit drives transitions with Rabi frequency \u03a9 eff where the motional state is not changed (see Eq. (11)). If the laser field, however, is detuned by the trap frequency towards higher energies, the so-called blue sideband is excited (see Eq. (5)) and the operation (12) R + ( \u03b8 , \u03c6 ) = exp [ i \u03b8 2 ( e i \u03c6 \u03c3 + a \u2020 + e \u2212 i \u03c6 \u03c3 \u2212 a ) ] is carried out. Here \u03c3 \u00b1 are the atomic flip operators which act on the electronic quantum state of an ion by inducing transitions from the | g \u3009 to | e \u3009 state and vice versa (notation: \u03c3 + = | e \u3009 \u3008 g | ). The operators a and a \u2020 denote the annihilation and creation of a phonon at the trap frequency \u03c9 , i.e. they act on the motional quantum state. As in Eq. (10), the parameter \u03b8 depends on the strength and the duration of the applied pulse, and \u03c6 denotes the relative phase between the optical field and the atomic polarization. Importantly, the electronic and motional degree of freedom change simultaneously. Similarly for the opposite detuning the red sideband can be excited. Fig. 9 shows a spectrum of a single trapped 40Ca+ ion near the qubit transition. At a detuning of \u00b11 MHz, the red and the blue axial sidebands appear, respectively. In addition, radial sidebands (detuning \u223c\u00b15 MHz) and higher order sidebands are visible. For the applied laser power and excitation time, the carrier transition is strongly saturated while the sidebands are only weakly saturated. This indicates that the sideband transitions are weaker than the carrier transition as is expected from Eqs. (5), (7). For the experiment shown in Fig. 9, the single 40Ca+-ion was cooled to a temperature of ( n \u0304 x , n \u0304 y , n \u0304 z ) \u2248 ( 3 , 3 , 16 ) via Doppler cooling, while the Lamb\u2013Dicke factors were ( \u03b7 x , \u03b7 y , \u03b7 z ) \u2248 ( 0.01 , 0.01 , 0.08 ) (in this particular experiment the angle of the laser beam was given by ( 49.2 , 49.2 , 22.5 ) ). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Spectrum of a single trapped 40Ca+ ion cooled close to the Doppler limit (see text). On resonance ( \u0394 = 0 ) the strong carrier transition appears as well as for positive (negative) detunings \u0394 blue (red) sidebands are visible. The motional frequencies of the single ion can be deduced from the spectrum to amount to \u03c9 z \u2248 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 1  MHz (axial frequency) and \u03c9 r x , y \u2248 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 5  MHz (radial frequencies). In addition, higher order modes are visible at \u0394 = m \u03c9 z \u00b1 m \u03c9 r . For quantum logic experiments, however, the case of multiple ions is more interesting. Since the Coulomb interaction couples the ions strongly together, it is useful to find the normal modes of the ion string (Steane, 1997, James, 1998, \u0160a\u0161ura and Bu\u017eek, 2002). Taking a three ion string as an example and concentrating on the axial direction, we find three normal modes: center-of-mass, breathing (or stretch) and an additional axial mode. Fig. 10 illustrates the motion of each ion associated with each mode. Denoting the center-of-mass modes frequency \u03c9 1 , the breathing mode has a frequency of \u03c9 2 = 3 \u03c9 1 and the third axial mode has a frequency of \u03c9 3 = 29 / 5 \u03c9 1 . Fig. 10 indicates the relative motions of the ions. The strength with which each mode couples to the motion is characterized by the eigenvectors ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) / 3 for the center-of-mass, ( 1 , 0 , \u2212 1 ) / 2 for the breathing and ( 1 , \u2212 2 , 1 ) / 6 for the third axial mode (James, 1998). This means that the center ion does not couple to the breathing mode and that the left and right ions couple with opposite phase factors to it. Fig. 11 illustrates that the breathing mode cannot be efficiently excited when the center ion is addressed (see Section 2.5.1 for addressing of individual ions). For further details of the normal modes of ion strings (including larger ion strings), we refer to James (1998). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Normal modes of a three-ion crystal along the axial direction with motional frequencies \u03c9 i . Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Excitation spectra of a three-ion string. In Fig. 11(a), the exciting laser is addressed to the center ion, while in Fig. 11(b) the laser is addressed to the left ion. Visible are excitations of the motional modes as well as of the carrier transition. If the center ion is addressed Fig. 11(a), the breathing mode cannot be excited efficiently. The residual excitation of the breathing mode is most likely due to laser light interacting with the outer ions (see Section 2.5.1 on imperfect addressing). While measuring the spectra of ion strings needs only reasonably cold temperatures (e.g. ions cooled to the Lamb\u2013Dicke limit), coherent operations on the sideband need usually ground state cooling of this particular mode. The reason can be seen already in Eq. (5) which predicts that the sideband Rabi frequency strongly depends on the vibrational quantum number of the corresponding motional mode and thus excitation on the sideband is incoherent for a finite temperature of this motional mode. On the other hand, this strong sensitivity of the sideband excitations to the motion will be the key to couple ion qubits. To allow for coherent sideband operations, the motion of the mode in question is cooled to the ground state, although one could also imagine using any well-defined motional quantum number. Finally, we extend Eq. (5) to take all motional modes into account (c.f. Eq. (11) and Wineland et al. (1998)): (13) \u03a9 eff + = \u03a9 ( n bus \u03b7 bus ) \u220f m ( 1 \u2212 n m \u03b7 m 2 ) . Here \u03a9 eff + is the effective Rabi frequency on the blue sideband, \u03a9 the ideal carrier Rabi frequency and n bus denotes the quantum number of the bus mode (i.e. the mode which will be used to couple the qubits), while \u03b7 bus labels its corresponding Lamb\u2013Dicke factor. The index m runs here over all modes except the bus mode. Since the influence of these modes on the sideband Rabi frequency \u03a9 eff + is strongly reduced, they are often termed spectator modes. As discussed in Refs. Neuhauser et al. (1978), Wineland and Itano (1979) and Marzoli et al. (1994), ground state cooling in ion traps can be achieved by driving the red sideband (c.f. Fig. 1). Each absorption of a photon on the red sideband followed by a spontaneous emission on the carrier transition takes out one motional quantum of energy (Stenholm, 1986, Eschner et al., 2003). It usually takes too long to wait for spontaneous decay of the upper level. Therefore, in most experiments, the lifetime of the upper state is shortened by quenching the state with a laser connecting it to a fast decaying state. Experimentally, sideband cooling to the motional ground state was demonstrated first by the NIST-group with a single mercury ion (Diedrich et al., 1989) and then later with various other ion species ((Monroe et al., 1995b, Roos et al., 1999, Peik et al., 1999); for a review see Leibfried et al. (2003a)). For ion strings sideband cooling works similarly as for single ions. The multiple normal modes can be cooled sequentially (Monroe et al., 1995b, Roos et al., 1999). However, for ion crystals, the Lamb\u2013Dicke factors \u03b7 i tend to be smaller due to the increased mass as compared with single ions (for a definition of \u03b7 see Section 2.2) and thus the cooling process is slowed down. Once the motion of a particular mode of the ion string is cooled to the ground state, irradiation on the respective blue sideband leads to Rabi oscillations (assuming the electronic degree of freedom of the ion is also in the ground state). Fig. 12 shows such a Rabi oscillation on the blue sideband of the center-of-mass mode of a string of two 40Ca+ ions. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Rabi oscillation on the blue sideband of the center-of-mass mode. The data were taken on a string of two 40Ca+ ions whose center-of-mass mode was cooled to the ground state. Only one of the ions was addressed. The population oscillates between the | S , 0 \u3009 and the | D , 1 \u3009 state of the addressed ion. Another promising route to cool ions below the Doppler limit is based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) (Roos et al., 2000, Morigi et al., 2000). Here, two interfering laser fields are used to shape the atomic absorption spectrum in such a way that sharp features appear in it which can be used to suppress heating effects on the carrier and blue sideband transitions while still maintaining absorption on the red sideband transitions. In general, EIT is a very versatile tool as the free parameters of the two laser intensities and detunings from the atomic resonance allow one to adjust the atomic absorption spectrum to the actual needs (equilibrium temperature and cooling speed). Furthermore, Roos et al. (2000) achieved simultaneous cooling of up to three modes close to the ground state with a single setting. 2.6.2. Cirac\u2013Zoller gate Conceptually, the Cirac\u2013Zoller phase gate is the simplest of the two-qubit gates presented here and is therefore discussed first (Cirac and Zoller, 1995). It requires single ion addressing and ground-state cooling of the bus mode. On the other hand, for the M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen type gates (S\u00f8rensen and M\u00f8lmer, 1999, Milburn et al., 2000, Leibfried et al., 2003b) both ions are illuminated simultaneously and the ion string have to be cooled only into the Lamb\u2013Dicke limit. The geometric phase gate (Leibfried et al., 2003b) is closely related to the M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate. However, it will be presented separately as its implementation looks different. Cirac and Zoller proposed the following procedure to perform a two-qubit gate between two ions in an ion string (Cirac and Zoller, 1995): First, the quantum information of the first qubit is transferred to the motional degree of freedom of a mode (the bus mode) of the ion crystal. Importantly, the resulting motional state affects not only the addressed ion itself but the ion string as a whole. Therefore, on a second ion, operations conditioned on the motional state of the ion string can be carried out. Finally, the quantum information of the motion is mapped back onto the first ion of the string. The individual steps of the Cirac\u2013Zoller phase gate are as follows: a laser pulse directed to the first ion with length \u03b8 = \u03c0 and frequency \u03c9 qubit \u2212 \u03c9 trap (red sideband) moves all population present in the | 0 , e \u3009 -state to | 1 , g \u3009 -state (see left panel in Fig. 13). However, if the first ion is in the | 0 , g \u3009 -state, no state transfer happens. Thus, we have effectively mapped the quantum information from the electronic degree of freedom to the motion. Note that the coupling strength on the sideband depends strongly on the vibrational excitation. Therefore, this procedure works only if one knows the vibrational state such that one can properly adjust the laser intensity to achieve a \u03c0 pulse. With the quantum information of the first ion in the motion, we can exploit the common motion of the two ions and perform a conditional operation on a the second ion. We follow here the original proposal (Cirac and Zoller, 1995) and use a 2 \u03c0 rotation between | 1 , g \u3009 and a third auxiliary state | 0 , a \u3009 on the red sideband (see center panel in Fig. 13). Importantly, only the | 1 , g \u3009 state is coupled to another level; for the states | 0 , e \u3009 , | 1 , e \u3009 and | 0 , g \u3009 , however, the coupling vanishes as there are no levels present with the appropriate energy. Effectively, we have therefore performed the following operation: (14) 2 \u03c0 | 0 , e \u3009 \u27f6 | 0 , e \u3009 | 1 , e \u3009 \u27f6 | 1 , e \u3009 | 0 , g \u3009 \u27f6 | 0 , g \u3009 | 1 , g \u3009 \u27f6 \u2212 | 1 , g \u3009 . Download : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Graphical representation of the three steps to perform a phase gate between two ions with an electronic ground state | g \u3009 , an excited state | e \u3009 and an auxiliary state | a \u3009 . This implements a phase shift of the second ion conditioned on the motional state. Finally, another \u03c0 pulse on the red sideband addressed to the first ion maps the quantum information present in the motion back onto the first ion and in total a phase gate between the two ions is performed. To turn this phase gate into a controlled-NOT operation, one can apply an R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c6 i ) pulse ( i = 1 , 2 ) to the target ion on the carrier transition (see Eq. (10)) before and after the phase gate. Choosing a particular phase relation \u03c6 2 \u2013 \u03c6 1 either an ordinary controlled-NOT gate or a zero controlled-NOT operation is obtained. The heart of this procedure, i.e. the dynamics presented in Eq. (14), was demonstrated by the NIST group with a single beryllium ion (Monroe et al., 1995a). The Innsbruck group implemented the complete protocol with individual addressing of two calcium ions (Schmidt-Kaler et al., 2003c, Schmidt-Kaler et al., 2003b). Section 4.1 describes both experiments. Jonathan et al. (2000) present a generalization of this gate where they propose to drive the system so strongly that due to AC-Stark shifts the eigenstates of different vibrational quantum numbers (the dressed states) get the same energy. Thus a motional dynamics can be achieved just with carrier pulses of appropriate phase. Essentially, this proposal trades faster gate speeds against more sensitivity to laser intensity noise as the energy of the dressed states depends strongly on the laser power. 2.6.3. M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate Another possibility to implement a two-qubit gate is to use laser radiation tuned close to the motional sidebands (S\u00f8rensen and M\u00f8lmer, 1999, M\u00f8lmer and S\u00f8rensen, 1999, S\u00f8rensen and M\u00f8lmer, 2000, Solano et al., 1999). The basic principle is as follows: both ions are irradiated with a bichromatic laser field with frequencies \u03c9 0 \u00b1 ( \u03c9 qubit + \u03b4 ) , tuned close to the red and the blue sideband of a collective mode, respectively (see Fig. 14). The two frequencies sum up to twice the qubit frequency \u03c9 qubit , each laser field itself, however, is not resonant to any level. Thus both ions can change their state only collectively and choosing an interaction time appropriately, the dynamics (15) | e e \u3009 \u2192 ( | e e \u3009 + i | g g \u3009 ) / 2 | e g \u3009 \u2192 ( | e g \u3009 + i | g e \u3009 ) / 2 | g e \u3009 \u2192 ( | g e \u3009 + i | e g \u3009 ) / 2 | g g \u3009 \u2192 ( | g g \u3009 + i | e e \u3009 ) / 2 is achieved. To see that this gate leads to a universal set of gates, we introduce the new basis | \u00b1 \u3009 i = ( | e \u3009 i \u00b1 | g \u3009 i ) / 2 . | \u00b1 \u3009 | \u00b1 \u3009 are eigenstates of the unitary operation described by Eq. (15) and transform as | + + \u3009 \u2192 | + + \u3009 , | + \u2212 \u3009 \u2192 i | + \u2212 \u3009 , | \u2212 + \u3009 \u2192 i | \u2212 + \u3009 , | \u2212 \u2212 \u3009 \u2192 | \u2212 \u2212 \u3009 by the action of the gate, where we omitted a global phase factor of e \u2212 i \u03c0 / 4 on the right hand sides. This transformation is a conditional phase gate up to single-qubit phase-shifts and is known to be universal together with single-qubit operations. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Energy-level diagram of two trapped ions illustrating the principle of the S\u00f8rensen and M\u00f8lmer gate. The bus mode is populated with n phonons. Two laser beams tuned close to the blue and red sideband, respectively, drive the system via the dashed virtual levels between the | n , g g \u3009 and | n , e e \u3009 state. A similar process takes place if the ion string is either in the | n , e g \u3009 or in the | n , g e \u3009 state. The M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate has the particular feature that it does not require individual addressing of the ions and that it does not fail completely if the ion string were not cooled to the ground state. As will be described in Section 4.2, the NIST group entangled up to four 9Be+ ions with this gate type (Sackett et al., 2000). Furthermore, Haljan et al. (2005b) created all four Bell states and implemented Grover\u2019s seach algorithm with 111Cd+ ions using this gate operation (see also Refs. Lee et al. (2005), Brickman et al. (2005) and Brickman (2007)). Very recently, the application of a M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate to optical qubits excited on dipole-forbidden transitions has been analyzed (Roos, 2008). It was shown that fast, high-fidelity gate operations are achievable by smoothly switching on and off the bichromatic laser fields inducing the gate action. The experimental implementation of this technique has resulted in the creation of Bell states with a fidelity of 99.3(1)% (Benhelm et al., 2008b). 2.6.4. Geometric phase gate The so-called geometric phase gate uses also two laser fields irradiating multiple ions at the same time. An interesting feature of this gate is that ideally during the gate operation the electronic state of the ions is not touched. Only a force dependent on the electronic states is applied such that for the various electronic states different phases are acquired (Milburn et al., 2000). In the scheme implemented by the NIST group (Leibfried et al., 2003b) two non-co-propagating laser fields create a standing wave (see Fig. 15). The difference of the two laser frequencies is tuned closely to one of the axial frequencies which leads to a walking wave. Thus, each ion experiences a periodic AC-Stark shift and a force depending on the slope of the spatial variation of the AC-Stark shift. Most importantly, the size and even the direction of the force can depend on the electronic state of the ion. Choosing the distance between the ions such that each ion experiences the same phase of the walking wave for a given time (see Fig. 15), ions are pushed in the same direction if they have the same electronic state. In this way, the breathing mode cannot be excited. However, if the ions are in different electronic states the forces on the ions are not the same and the breathing mode can be excited. Detuning of the drive from the motional mode is chosen such that the phase between the motion and the drive changes its sign after half the gate time. In this way, the ion string is driven back to the original motional state after the full gate time. This ensures that the motion is disentangled from the electronic state after the gate operation. The intermediate energy increase as compared to situations where the motion is not excited leads to the desired phase factor and the ions have picked up a phase factor that depends non-linearly on the internal states of both ions.

Both ions experience the same force (b) one ion spin down, the other spin up. Both ions experience opposing forces. Tuning the frequency difference of the two laser fields close to the breathing mode frequency, in (a) the motion of the ion string cannot be excited efficiently, while in (b) the breathing mode is excited. Leibfried et al. (2003b) implemented this gate with a fidelity of 0.97, limited mainly by the spontaneous decay from the P manifold of the Be+ ions during the gate operation. This exceptional fidelity was reached because the gate avoids a number of imperfections in the first place. We mention here the absence of off-resonant excitations on the carrier transition. Furthermore, the gate execution time of about 10 \u03bcs is two to three orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding coherence time of the qubits and thus decoherence effects are small. To obtain a differential force on the ions, the NIST group used two laser beams detuned blue from the S 1 / 2 \u2192 P 1 / 2  transition by 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 82  GHz (fine structure splitting of the P state is 200 GHz). For the ratio of the forces on the | \u2193 \u3009 = | F = 2 , m f = \u2212 2 \u3009 and the | \u2191 \u3009 = | F = 1 , m f = \u2212 1 \u3009 state this yields: F \u2193 = \u2212 2 F \u2191 . Additional Stark shifts can be efficiently suppressed by choosing almost perpendicular and linear polarizations for the laser beams (Wineland et al., 2003). Finally, Leibfried et al. (2007) discuss a version of this gate where the laser intensities impinging on the ions are controlled by transporting the ion crystal through the laser fields. Controlling the interaction of the ions by transport also offers the possibility of using spatially modulated magnetic fields to create the state dependent oscillating force (Leibfried et al., 2007). These three gate types have different strengths and weaknesses. Both, the geometric phase gate and the M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate do not need single ion addressing. While this is often advantageous, it has the inconvenience that it is not straightforward to carry out these gates between specific ions in a string. Using segmented traps for moving and splitting ion strings (see Section 6) resolves this issue. Another route to introduce ion specific gates is to hide certain ions with single ion operations (see Section 4.5) such that these ions are not affected by the multi-qubit gate operation. The Cirac\u2013Zoller gate on the other hand demands single ion addressing but allows for a straightforward implementation of quantum algorithms. Another aspect is speed. The geometric phase gate can be executed quite fast as the laser can be tuned such that off-resonant transitions are quite unlikely. The Cirac\u2013Zoller and M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gates on the other hand require a laser tuned to or tuned close to a sideband transition. This automatically implies that the laser is detuned only by (approximately) the trap frequency from the strong carrier transition. Thus, it seems that the gate speed has to be much slower than a trap frequency (see Section 2.2). However, for special temporal and spectral arrangements of the laser field, it is possible to suppress the spectral contribution on the carrier transition so that gate times close to the trap period seem feasible. Finally, it is important whether the gate works efficiently with magnetic field insensitive transitions. Qubits encoded in superpositions of levels connected via a magnetic field insensitive transition provide very long coherence times of many seconds (Section 3.1.2). In its originally proposed form, the geometric phase gate is very inefficient on magnetic field insensitive transitions because hyperfine states with a similar magnetic moment appear to experience similar AC-shifts (Langer, 2006). However, this could be circumvented by using a pair of laser beams tuned close (as compared to the qubit difference frequency) to a spectrally narrow transition to induce the state-dependent force (Aolita et al., 2007). In this way, one induces a spectral rather then a polarization dependent force. Another option is to recode the qubits for the conditional phase gate from a magnetic insensitive coding to a different coding (Langer, 2006). The M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate, on the other hand, has been already applied on magnetic field insensitive transitions (Haljan et al., 2005b). The Cirac\u2013Zoller gate (either with composite pulses described in Section 2.7.3 or a third magnetic field insensitive transition as available for instance with the D manifold in 43Ca+) can be also directly applied in these situations. 2.6.5. Other gate types Another possibility to employ AC-Stark shifts for a two-qubit gate was demonstrated by Brune et al. (1994) with Rydberg atoms passing through a microwave cavity. We summarize here, the ion trap version implemented by Schmidt-Kaler et al. (2004). In these experiments, a laser was tuned close to the axial motional sideband of a single ion. The Rabi frequency of the blue motional sideband \u03a9 + depends on the phonon occupation number n z such that the resulting AC-Stark shift of the electronic levels due to the sideband resonance depends on the motional state: (16) \u0394 E = \u0127 \u03a9 + 2 2 \u0394 = \u0127 \u03b7 i 2 \u03a9 2 2 \u0394 ( n z + 1 ) , where we used Eq. (5). Rotating the frame by exp ( \u03b7 i 2 \u03a9 2 2 \u0394 t ) removes the phase evolution of the two electronic levels in motional ground state n z = 0 . The relative phase of the two electronic states in the first excited state n z = 1 , however, evolves as \u03c6 = \u03b7 i 2 \u03a9 2 2 \u0394 t . Thus, choosing the interaction time t = 2 \u03c0 \u0394 \u03b7 i 2 \u03a9 2 , the phase gate operation diag ( 1 , 1 , \u2212 i , i ) is implemented, where we used the basis { | e , 0 \u3009 , | g , 0 \u3009 , | e , 1 \u3009 , | g , 1 \u3009 } . This gate can also be generalized to multiple ions (Schmidt-Kaler et al., 2004). Here, all ions simultaneously interact with the laser beam. The situation is very reminiscent of the M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate: taking as an example a two-ion crystal, only transitions between the eigenstates with the same number of excited ions can be induced, e.g. between the | g e \u3009 and the | e g \u3009 (see Fig. 16). All other basis states acquire only a phase factor which can be corrected for with single-qubit operations. Using this method, starting from the | e g \u3009 state, the Bell state ( | g e \u3009 + | e g \u3009 ) / 2 was generated with a fidelity close to 0.9 by applying a pulse corresponding to a \u03c0 / 2 dynamics with trapped 40Ca+ ions (H. H\u00e4ffner et al., Innsbruck, unpublished). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Simplified level scheme of two trapped 40Ca+ ions including the motional state of the bus mode (from Schmidt-Kaler et al. (2004)). The virtual levels are represented by dashed lines. A monochromatic laser beam can only induce transitions between the | g e \u3009 and the | e g \u3009 state (solid arrows). In addition, the | g g \u3009 state acquires an additional phase factor due to an AC Stark effect (dashed arrows). Another gate type uses the dependence of the carrier Rabi frequency from the motional state (see Eq. (11)). Proposed by Monroe et al. (1997), it was implemented later by the same group on a single 9Be+ ion (DeMarco et al., 2002). Essentially, a laser pulse on the carrier transition is applied, with the Lamb\u2013Dicke parameter chosen such that for one motional state an even number of Rabi oscillations occurs, while for the other motional state an odd number of Rabi cycles occurs. This way, the phase of an electronic state is only flipped in the latter case, while it remains unaffected in the former case. This implementation of a controlled-NOT operation requires, however, a reasonably large and tunable Lamb\u2013Dicke factor of the bus mode \u03b7 b (the gate time is quadratic in 1 / \u03b7 b ), while either all other motional modes are cooled to the ground state or their Lamb\u2013Dicke factors are much smaller than \u03b7 b . Finally, there have been quite a number of other promising gate proposals which are not implemented as of yet. Some of them rely\u2013as some of the already presented gates\u2013on state dependent AC-Stark shifts, albeit in the static regime (Cirac and Zoller, 2000, Steane, 2004, Staanum et al., 2004). The general idea here, is that an inhomogeneous laser beam changes the distance between the ions depending on their electronic state. Simulations show that the fidelities can be quite high and that the experimental requirements are not very demanding. For instance, only moderately low temperatures are required. Alternatively, the state dependent potential can be created with strong magnetic field gradients (Mintert and Wunderlich, 2001). Creation of sufficiently strong field gradients might be eased by implementing these gates in microfabricated ion traps where smaller ion-surface distances and microstructured current carriers would facilitate the generation of the required static or dynamic field gradients (Leibfried et al., 2007, Chiaverini and Lybarger, 2008, Ospelkaus et al., 2008). Another gate class, which recently received much attention, uses short but strong laser pulses to strongly kick the ion string (Garc\u00eda-Ripoll et al., 2003). Most interestingly, the corresponding gate operation times can be shorter than even one trap period. Choosing proper phases and amplitudes of the pulses, the ions are kicked in such a way that they acquire a state dependent phase due to their motion. Another gate variant uses a continuous irradiation with fast phase modulations (Garc\u00eda-Ripoll et al., 2005). Based on these ideas, Duan and Kimble (2004) propose quantum computation in an array of trapped ions where the fast gates are used to induce a next neighbor interaction. 2.7. Apparative requirements Experimental quantum computation requires exceedingly long coherence times as well as an exquisite control over the qubits. The former is achieved by decoupling the qubits from the environment, while the latter requires a well-defined and switchable interaction with the environment. In ion trap quantum computing, the qubits are held in free space with electromagnetic forces which hardly couple to the ion\u2019s internal degree of freedom. The control is achieved with strong laser fields such that during their interaction they still can be treated classically and entanglement between the laser field and ions is negligible. Thus the seemingly contradictory requirements\u2013decoupling from the environment and controlled interactions\u2013can be fulfilled. For ion-trap quantum computing usually so-called linear Paul traps are used where the ions can form a linear ion chain (Raizen et al., 1992b, Drees and Paul, 1964). In these devices, a radio-frequency potential is applied to two electrodes which are parallel with the axis of the trap (see Fig. 17). These electrodes create an oscillating two-dimensional quadrupole potential that is translation invariant along the trap axis. If the frequency of the RF field is sufficiently large, the ions experience an effective restoring force to the center axis. Additionally, static electric fields confine the ions along the trap axis. The trap resides in an ultra-high vacuum vessel to reduce collisions with residual molecules and atoms as much as possible. For typical experiments, it is sufficient to describe the time dependent confining forces of the ion trap as if they resulted from a static three-dimensional harmonic potential. If the confinement perpendicular to the trap axis (radial direction) is much larger than the confinement along the trap axis, cold ions form a linear chain. Typical trap frequencies for the radial frequencies are between 4 and 10 MHz, while axial frequencies range mostly between 0.5 and 5 MHz. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 17. Front (left) and side (right) view of the Innsbruck trap (from Schmidt-Kaler et al. (2003b)). It consists of four blades (light gray) and two end caps (dark gray). A radio-frequency drive is applied to two opposing blades while the other blades are held at ground. This provides confinement perpendicular to the trap axis. The two end caps held at a positive DC-potential U end prevent the ions to escape along the axis. For the control of electronic and motional states of the ions, lasers with high frequency and intensity stability are used. Acousto-optical modulators allow one to control both the frequency and the intensity. Typically, the lasers are either referenced to an ultra-stable cavity or to a molecular transition. Ions tend to have higher energy splittings as compared with atoms. Therefore, lasers emitting in the ultraviolet are often required. In the next paragraphs, we briefly describe the experimental setups used in the NIST and the Innsbruck experiments. 2.7.1. The NIST setup Details of the NIST setup can be found in the Ph.D. thesis of Langer (2006), Kielpinski (2001) and King (1999). The NIST group uses 9Be+ ions whose level scheme is depicted in Fig. 18. Qubits are encoded in the hyperfine manifold of the S 1 / 2 electronic ground state split by 1.25 GHz. For most of the experiments discussed here, the qubit was encoded in the | F = 2 , m F = \u2212 2 \u3009 \u27f7 | F = 1 , m F = \u2212 1 \u3009 -transition as the levels are easily prepared and distinguished from each other. Doppler cooling at 313 nm (laser power \u223c \u03bcW at a waist of \u223c25 \u03bcm) and optical pumping with \u03c3 \u2212 polarized light on the | S 1 / 2 , F = 2 , m F = \u2212 2 \u3009 \u27f7 | P 3 / 2 , F = 3 , m F = \u2212 3 \u3009 transition along the quantization axis given by a weak magnetic field (typically B\u223c1 m T) initializes the ions in the | F = 2 , m F = \u2212 2 \u3009 state. Finally, pulsed resolved sideband cooling on the | F = 2 , m F = \u2212 2 \u3009 \u27f7 | F = 2 , m F = \u2212 1 \u3009 transition is used to prepare the ions\u2019 motion with a probability of about 0.99 in the ground state (Wineland et al., 1998), before the quantum information is manipulated. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 18. Energy level scheme of a 9Be+ ion (nuclear spin: 3/2). The hyperfine splitting of the P 3 / 2 state is smaller than 1 MHz and not shown. The qubit states are coupled with a Raman transition via the P manifold. The NIST group generates the necessary Raman beams from the same laser source such that the relative phase of the beams is well-defined. Therefore the dominant decoherence source is dephasing due to magnetic field fluctuations (e.g. due to the mains supply at 60 Hz) causing a qubit lifetime on the order of a few milliseconds. However, recently the NIST group used a magnetic field insensitive transition and measured coherence times on the order of a few seconds (see Section 3.1.2). Read-out is performed again on the cycling transition | S 1 / 2 , F = 2 , m F = \u2212 2 \u3009 \u27f7 | P 3 / 2 , F = 3 , m F = \u2212 3 \u3009 with \u03c3 \u2212 polarized light. This light does not couple efficiently to the | S 1 / 2 , F = 1 , m F = \u2212 1 \u3009 state as it is detuned from any possible transition by a little bit more than 1 GHz. In order to avoid pumping into the bright state by the still present off-resonant excitations, the | S 1 / 2 , F = 1 , m F = \u2212 1 \u3009 population is transferred with two \u03c0 pulses to the | S 1 / 2 , F = 1 , m F = + 1 \u3009 level. In this state, absorption of a single off-resonant photon cannot lead to a population of the | S 1 / 2 , F = 2 , m F = \u2212 2 \u3009 . Thus the ion remains dark. The theoretical analysis by Langer (2006) shows that with this method, detection errors can be kept smaller than 1 0 \u2212 4 . At the moment, due to stray light background and imperfections in the \u03c0 transfer pulses, typically detection efficiencies of about 99% are attained in the NIST setups (Langer, 2006). The small atomic mass of beryllium allows for high trap frequencies and comparatively large Lamb\u2013Dicke factors. Both factors alleviate a strong coupling to the motional degree of freedom and thus facilitate fast multi-qubit operations. In order to initialize, manipulate and detect the quantum states, light sources in the ultraviolet at 313 nm are required. The NIST group uses various microstructured traps. Many of these traps have multiple trapping zones, which ease the scaling of ion trap quantum computers to larger ion numbers (Kielpinski et al., 2002). In addition, segmented traps allow for single-qubit addressing without tightly focused laser beams (see Section 5.2) and a separate loading zone avoiding patch effects (see Section 3.2). 2.7.2. The Innsbruck setup The experimental setup used by Innsbruck group is described in Refs. Schmidt-Kaler et al. (2003b) and Gulde (2003). As qubits, superpositions of the S 1 / 2 ground state and the metastable D5/2 state of 40Ca+ are used (see Fig. 4). The D5/2 state has a lifetime \u03c4 \u2243 1.16 s . A magnetic field of 300 \u03bcT lifts the degeneracies of the Zeeman manifolds. For the experiments, the entire quantum register is prepared by Doppler cooling, followed by sideband cooling to the motional ground state. Normally, only the center-of-mass mode ( \u03c9 CM \u2248 1.2 MHz ) is cooled to the ground state. The ions\u2019 electronic qubit states are initialized in the S 1 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 1 / 2 ) state by optical pumping with \u03c3 \u2212 light. Then each ion-qubit is individually manipulated by a series of laser pulses on the S \u2261 S 1 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 1 / 2 ) to D \u2261 D 5 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 1 / 2 ) quadrupole transition near 729 nm. In order to guarantee phase coherent manipulation, the laser frequency is stabilized to about 50 Hz on a time scale of 1 min by locking it to an ultra-stable reference cavity with a similar design as presented by Notcutt et al. (2005). This time scale corresponds to the typical duration of a full set of quantum computing experiments. On time scales of a few seconds even a 3 Hz linewidth has been observed. The slow drift of the reference cavity\u2013typically about 1 Hz/s\u2013is monitored every few minutes by interrogating the qubit transition and compensated with a feedback loop. Thus many thousands of experiments under comparable conditions are feasible. Spectroscopy on a transition more sensitive to magnetic field fluctuations ( S 1 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 1 / 2 ) \u2192 D 5 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 5 / 2 ) ) is used to monitor slow magnetic field drifts continuously. In addition, a passive magnetic shield reduces the magnetic field fluctuations on timescales longer than 1 s by about a factor of 30 and by more than 2 orders of magnitude for frequencies higher than 10 Hz. The total field amplitude noise is on the order of a few nT. Thus, typically coherence times of about 5 ms on the S 1 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 1 / 2 ) \u2192 D 5 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 5 / 2 ) transition and 15 ms on the S 1 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 1 / 2 ) \u2192 D 5 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 1 / 2 ) transition are achieved. The laser driving these transition is tightly focused onto individual ions in the string with a waist size of 2 \u03bcm (inter-ion distance \u223c5 \u03bcm). While the NIST group uses predominantly global addressing and state read-out, the Innsbruck-group uses tightly focused laser beams to address individual ions (see Section 2.5.1). Thus, in principle, any quantum algorithm can be implemented straightforwardly, only limited by the decoherence time. The trade-off of this method, however, is that the axial trap frequency cannot be increased too much, since then the ions move closer to each other, thwarting single ion addressing. A consequence of a lowered trap frequency is a reduced speed of the entangling operations on the sidebands. 2.7.3. Composite pulses and optimal control Quantum algorithms are usually implemented by a sequence of a few fundamental gates. Many of those gates can be carried out with single laser pulses. However, using a set of pulses sometimes offers an advantage over using single pulses (as demonstrated already in Section 2.5.1). In NMR, the composite pulse technique is well known and allows for the compensation of many systematic effects like intensity mismatch and detuning errors (Freeman, 1997, Levitt and Freeman, 1979, Levitt, 1986). The spin echo sequence discovered by Hahn (1950) is such a sequence with which a constant detuning between the excitation and the transition can be removed to a large extent. In addition to the many sequences discovered and used in NMR, there are a few sequences which are important in the context of ion traps. We present here two of those which were used in the implementation of the Deutsch\u2013Josza algorithm (Gulde et al., 2003) (see Section 5.1) and were described first by Childs and Chuang (2000). The first sequence uses four sideband pulses (Childs and Chuang, 2000, Gulde et al., 2003, Schmidt-Kaler et al., 2003b) to implement a phase gate in the computational subspace { | D , 0 \u3009 , | S , 0 \u3009 , | D , 1 \u3009 , | S , 1 \u3009 } . The advantage over the method laid out in Section 2.6.2 is that no third level is required to implement the gate. To achieve the desired gate with just two levels, cleverly chosen pulse lengths and phases avoid leakage into higher phonon number states. Using the definitions from Eq. (12), the pulse sequence (to be read from right to left) is: R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 / 2 ) R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 / 2 ) R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) . Having Fig. 1 in mind, we analyze the effect of this pulse sequence on the four physical eigenstates { | D , 0 \u3009 , | S , 0 \u3009 , | D , 1 \u3009 , | S , 1 \u3009 } . The | D , 0 \u3009 state is not affected at all and therefore | D , 0 \u3009 \u2192 | D , 0 \u3009 . Fig. 19 illustrates the evolution of the respective Bloch vector in the | S , 0 \u3009 \u2194 | D , 1 \u3009 and | S , 1 \u3009 \u2194 | D , 2 \u3009 manifold, respectively. Because the couplings and thus the effective pulse lengths differ by a factor of 2 between the two manifolds, the Bloch vector follows different paths. Still, it reaches always its original position when the pulse sequence is finished. Using Eqs. (12), (12), one can show that for the three remaining cases, each time a phase factor of \u22121 is picked up and thus the diagonal matrix diag ( 1 , \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 , \u2212 1 ) is implemented. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 19. Evolution of the Bloch vector during the composite phase gate in the | S , 0 \u3009 \u2194 | D , 1 \u3009 (left) and | S , 1 \u3009 \u2194 | D , 2 \u3009 manifold (right) (from Schmidt-Kaler et al. (2003b)). Similarly, three blue sideband pulses can be employed to implement a SWAP operation between an electronic and a motional degree of freedom of trapped ions (Gulde et al., 2003): R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) R + ( 2 \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c6 swap ) R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) , where \u03c6 swap = arccos ( cot 2 ( \u03c0 / 2 ) ) . This pulse sequence was used by Gulde et al. (2003) to implement the Deutsch\u2013Josza algorithm (Deutsch, 1989). Already, these two pulse sequence examples demonstrate that composite pulses are a quite versatile tool. Especially, gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) developed in the context of NMR carries the idea of composite pulses to its extreme (Khaneja et al., 2005). Here, a pulse sequence thought to implement a particular unitary operation is split into many pulses. Then, a special algorithm is used to vary amplitudes and phases of the pulses to perfect the desired unitary that is optimal with respect to certain quality criteria (e.g. execution time) with a special algorithm (Khaneja et al., 2005). In addition, various boundary conditions (e.g. experimental constraints such as finite pulse rise times) can be included in form of cost functions. Thus, significant performance improvements in terms of speed and reduced susceptibility to experimental imperfections can be achieved. Most interestingly, the sensitivity to control parameters can be minimized with GRAPE, too. However, note that in spite of the fact that the execution time can be reduced considerably, composite pulses lead usually to a larger total pulse area. Thus decoherence effects which scale with the pulse area might become relevant. One such source of decoherence is spontaneous emission during Raman transitions (see Section 3.1.3). The first steps in applying such optimal control techniques to trapped ions have already been taken. Timoney et al. (2008) deviced pulse sequences to robustly perform \u03c0 / 2 and \u03c0 rotations between two hyperfine qubits of a single 171Y b+. Creating the states | 0 \u3009 + e i \u03c6 | 1 \u3009 and | 1 \u3009 from | 0 \u3009 , this work also experimentally demonstrates the robustness of these pulse sequences as compared with simple \u03c0 / 2 or \u03c0 pulses, respectivvely, with respect to intensity and detuning errors. Furthermore, Nebendahl et al. (2008) modify a GRAPE algorithm to construct a controlled-NOT operation from a global M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen interaction and single qubit operations. The algorithm allows for the optimization of whole algorithms. Taking as an example a quantum error correction scheme for bit flips based three qubits and two ancilla qubits, the original length of more than 100 pulses was reduced to 34 pulses. 3. Decoherence in ion trap quantum computers This section describes the most relevant decoherence mechanisms for ion trap quantum computers. For further discussions, we refer to Ref. Wineland et al. (1998). 3.1. Sources of imperfections in ion trap quantum computers 3.1.1. Bit-flip errors Bit-flip errors occur when a process transfers populations between the physical eigenstates of the qubit. Usually, the physical eigenstates are the energy eigenstates of the system and bit-flips are connected to radiation or absorption of photons. Thus, bit-flip errors are usually caused by spontaneous emission. The frequency differences of hyperfine and Zeeman qubits are quite small and therefore the time constants for spontaneous emission are usually longer than a year and thus are of no relevance if the ions are not irradiated with electromagnetic radiation. For optical qubits, usually superpositions of the ground state and the metastable state D -level in earth-alkali elements are used. Typical life times of the D -levels are about 1 s (Barton et al., 2000, Kreuter et al., 2005, Letchumanan et al., 2005), which is long as compared with the gate time of less than 1 ms. Therefore, most current experiments are not yet limited by bit-flip errors during their free evolution. Bit-flip errors on the motional degree of freedom are discussed in Section 3.2. 3.1.2. Dephasing The phase evolution of a superposition often depends on a classically well-defined parameter such as the magnetic field. Ignoring the time evolution of the classical parameter leads to dephasing of the superposition. For instance, a superposition consisting of two levels with differing magnetic moments experiences energy shifts due to a (fluctuating) magnetic field. Thus, the phase of the superposition depends on the particular magnetic field history and dephasing occurs. Similarly, dephasing also takes place for the ion motion if the trap frequency is not constant, e.g. due to voltage fluctuations on the trap electrodes (see Section 3.2). A typical experimental sequence to test the phase coherence consists of two \u03c0 / 2 pulses separated by a waiting time T (a Ramsey experiment). During the waiting time, any difference between the atomic transition frequency and the laser frequency will lead to an evolution of their relative phase. The second \u03c0 / 2 pulse will then rotate the atomic state according to the phase difference either towards the excited or the ground state. This effect can be seen in Fig. 20 when the population of the ion oscillates with the detuning of the laser frequency from the atomic transition (Ramsey fringes). The contrast ( max \u2212 min max + min ) in the center of this curve is in the following termed Ramsey contrast. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 20. Ramsey fringes with a free precession time of T=100 \u03bcs (Chwalla et al., Innsbruck, unpublished). The data points indicate the excitation probability to the metastable D level in a single 40Ca+ ion. Experimentally, fluctuations of the atomic resonance frequency, e.g. typically due to fluctuations of the magnetic field and of the laser frequency, lead to dephasing. Sometimes it is useful to distinguish between fast fluctuations (the relative frequency changes during the waiting time), slow fluctuations (the relative frequency is constant in each experiment, but not the same in the next experiment(s)) and an intermediate regime. It can be shown that with an increasing waiting time, fast fluctuations lead to an exponential decay of the Ramsey contrast, while slow fluctuations lead to a Gaussian decay of the Ramsey contrast (Sengstock et al., 1994). Furthermore, slow fluctuations can be compensated for by spin-echo techniques (Hahn, 1950). Currently, the coherence time of most qubits is limited by magnetic field fluctuations to a few milliseconds. Usually Fourier components at multiples of the mains frequency contribute most to the magnetic field changes. Synchronizing the experiment with the phase of the mains supply effectively counters time variations of the magnetic field. A more generic way to reduce magnetic field fluctuations is shielding of ambient magnetic fields with \u03bc -metal and/or active cancelation with a feedback loop. Currently, the Innsbruck group uses an aluminum/ \u03bc metal shield which suppresses the magnetic field fluctuations by more than two orders of magnitude. However, in most cases a finite magnetic field is needed to lift the degeneracy of the electronic levels. Therefore, a very stable magnetic field has to be created inside the magnetically shielded region without saturating the \u03bc -metal. The standard procedure is to use a pair of Helmholtz coils through which a current is passed. As it is very difficult to stabilize currents to better than 1 0 \u2212 6 , in the future it might be worth while going through the trouble to use superconducting solenoids. Here magnetic field stabilities of better than 1 0 \u2212 11 at 6 T have been attained. These experiments were made possible by choosing a particular geometry of the superconducting coils to shield the external magnetic fields (Dyck et al., 1999), especially of high importance for small fields. It remains to be seen to what extent these exceptional field stabilities can be obtained at the relatively small fields of 1 m T as required for quantum computation. A more elegant solution to reduce dephasing due to magnetic field fluctuations is to use qubit levels having the same magnetic moment. For this, especially, ions with a hyperfine structure have interesting levels. Obvious choices for the qubit transitions are of the form m F = 0 \u2192 m F = 0 , which experience only a quadratic Zeeman-effect at small magnetic fields. However, at the magnetic fields required to lift the Zeeman degeneracies, a considerable linear Zeeman-effect is present. Therefore, it seems advantageous to work with stronger magnetic fields where transitions with a purely quadratic Zeeman-effect can be found. While magnetic field insensitive transitions were extensively explored in microwave precision experiments (Bollinger et al., 1991, Thompson, 1990), in the context of quantum computing it has been implemented only very recently by the NIST group on 9Be+ (Langer et al., 2005), by the Oxford (Lucas et al., 2007) and the Innsbruck groups on 43Ca+ (Benhelm et al., 2007, Benhelm et al., 2008a) and by the Ann\u2013Arbor group on 111Cd+ (Haljan et al., 2005b). To achieve a reasonable spatial selectivity, the qubits are manipulated with an optical Raman drive (c.f. Section 2.3). However, care has to be taken to maintain the phase coherence between both laser fields on time scales of several seconds. Using co-propagating laser beams simplifies this obstacle considerably as both beams propagate along the same path such that effects of mirror vibrations as well as of air currents cancel. However, a co-propagating geometry does not allow for easy coupling to the motional degree of freedom. On the other hand, if only phase gates are used as two-qubit gates, the phase stability only has to be maintained during each phase gate operation. Langer et al. (2005) demonstrated coherence times \u03c4 > 10 s using a magnetic-field-independent hyperfine transition in 9Be+ at a magnetic field of B 0 \u2243 0.01194 T . In these experiments, Ramsey spectroscopy was carried out on the | F = 2 , m F = 0 \u3009 \u27f7 | F = 1 , m F = \u2212 1 \u3009 qubit transition to measure the phase coherence. The optimal magnetic field was determined by measuring this transition frequency (\u223c1 GHz) as a function of the magnetic field. The minimum of the resulting parabola (second order derivative B 2 \u2243 0.305 Hz / \u03bc T 2 , B 0 \u2243 0.01194 T ) corresponds to the desired magnetic field with the least magnetic field dependency. The coherence time of this qubit is limited by slow drifts of the ambient magnetic field within the typical measurement times of a few hours especially for scans with long Ramsey waiting times. These experiments demonstrate a qubit memory error rate on the order of t 0 / \u03c4 \u2248 1 0 \u2212 5 where the time scale t 0 is set by the detection time of t 0 = 200 \u03bc s , which is the longest operational time of the NIST ion-trap quantum computer. The Oxford group carried out coherence measurements on 43Ca+ with a microwave drive (Lucas et al., 2007). They used the | F = 3 , m F = 0 \u3009 \u2194 | F = 4 , m F = 0 \u3009 transition in the hyperfine ground state manifold of 43 Ca+ at small magnetic fields ( B \u2248 0.178 mT ) and observed a dephasing time of 1.2 (2) s. Additionally, they investigated the coherence properties in a spin echo configuration and could not detect any decay of the Ramsey contrast on time scales of up to 1 s. From this, they deduce a spin-echo dephasing time of larger than 45 s. Similar results were obtained by the Innsbruck group in microwave-induced Ramsey experiments on the | F = 3 , m F = 0 \u3009 \u2194 | F = 4 , m F = 0 \u3009 clock transition of 43Ca+. For Ramsey interrogation periods \u03c4 = 1 s , the Ramsey contrast was still 88% while for \u03c4 = 50 \u03bc s , a contrast of 97% was found. The experiment was carried out at a field of 0.05 mT (Benhelm et al., 2008a, Benhelm, 2008). 3.1.3. Imperfect control Other serious sources of decoherence are imperfect realizations of the intended gate operations, usually caused by fluctuating or insufficiently calibrated control parameters. Typical candidates for these parameters are intensity and frequency fluctuations of the laser and beam pointing instabilities. In addition, pulses on a particular ion can have unwanted side effects on the ion itself (AC-Stark shifts, off-resonant excitations) or on neighboring ions (addressing errors). Many of these errors can be greatly reduced with composite pulse and optimal control techniques (c.f. Section 2.7.3). We list here some of these imperfections: \u2022 Pulse length errors arise from intensity fluctuations of the laser beam, beam pointing instabilities or just miscalibration. All of these reasons are almost equally relevant in current experiments. Common to all of them is also that the fluctuations take place at frequencies below a kHz, such that they can be considered constant during the execution of a pulse sequence. Relative amplitude fluctuations of 1 0 \u2212 2 are typical. Insufficient cooling can also lead to effective intensity fluctuations. During each run, the phonon numbers n m have different values (which corresponds to a finite temperature of the ion crystal) and thus for a non-vanishing Lamb\u2013Dicke factor the Rabi frequencies are different (see Eqs. (11), (13)). Interestingly, for an increasing number of ions the Innsbruck group observes that this effect is reduced. In fact, in their current experiments it is only relevant for single ions. As detailed by Wineland et al. (1998), there are two reasons for this: (1) With an increasing ion number the Lamb\u2013Dicke factor for each mode tends to get smaller. (2) The contributions of the increasing number of modes averages, such that the variance of the effective Rabi frequency narrows. \u2022 Detuning errors take place when the qubit transition frequency is miscalibrated or the drive frequency fluctuates slowly as compared to the duration of the coherent manipulation. Furthermore, magnetic field fluctuations have the same effect and usually are also slow as compared with the coherent manipulation time. The effect of a detuning error is a constant phase evolution during the experiment. A simple and effective method to remove such a constant phase evolution is the so-called spin-echo method (Hahn, 1950). The idea is that after half the evolution time the roles of the upper and the lower qubit level are exchanged. Thus the phase rewinds during the second half and\u2013if the detuning is constant\u2013arrives at zero after the complete evolution time. Often, this method can be implemented quite straightforwardly. An example in the ion trap context can be found in Leibfried et al. (2003b). However, usually during algorithms the qubits state is changed. In this case either more spin-echo sequences might have to be used (e.g. for each free evolution one as in Barrett et al. (2004)) or an effective spin echo sequence can be found. For instance, Riebe et al. (2004) optimized the time position of the population inverting pulses both in simulations and in the actual experiment. \u2022 Addressing error While addressing a single ion with a focussed laser beam, residual light might affect other ions in the trap and thus perform an undesired unitary evolution. See Section 2.5.1 for more details. \u2022 Off-resonant excitations also limit the obtainable fidelity. Off-resonant excitation is usually a problem if one drives a weak transition in the presence of a nearby strong transition (c.f. Eq. (9)). Exactly this situation occurs in ion traps, when driving the sideband transition (Steane et al., 2000). The transition matrix element of the sideband transition is weaker by a factor \u03b7 than the one of the carrier transition as can be inferred from Eqs. (13), (11). Thus, strong laser fields are required to obtain a reasonable gate speed which can then yield high gate fidelities in the presence of dephasing mechanisms. However, the strong laser field, characterized by the Rabi frequency \u03a9 , leads to off-resonant excitations on the carrier transition (see Eq. (9)). The Innsbruck experiments suffered particularly from this effect (Schmidt-Kaler et al., 2003c). Quantum mechanically, the off-resonant excitation can be understood as Rabi oscillations induced by a non-adiabatic switching of the energy eigenbasis while the laser power is changed. Thus, a system initially being in an energy eigenstate finds itself no longer in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian and consequently oscillations between the newly populated energy eigenstates occur. Off-resonant excitations can be greatly reduced with pulse shapes which have no spectral Fourier components at the carrier-transition. In the simplest case, the laser pulse powers are switched smoothly such that during the smooth turn on and off the system follows adiabatically. \u2022 Unwanted AC-Stark shifts have a similar origin as off-resonant excitations (see Eq. (8)), however, affect the phase of the qubit rather than the population. Here the carrier transition nearby leads to an AC-Stark shift of the qubit levels and thus the qubit phase evolves (H\u00e4ffner et al., 2003b). In principle, this phase evolution can be measured and then taken into account in the algorithm to be implemented. In the Innsbruck setup, the problem, however, with this approach is that the acquired phase shift during a controlled-NOT operation is typically on the order of 20 \u03c0 . In order to obtain a reasonable phase stability of 0.1 \u03c0 , one needs an intensity reproducibility of better than 0.005. To achieve this intensity stability of a particular polarization at the ion position with a narrow beam waist is quite demanding. To relieve this stringent condition, a second light field can be used which induces an AC-Stark shift of the same magnitude but of opposite sign (H\u00e4ffner et al., 2003b, Kaplan et al., 2002). This field can be most conveniently derived by driving the acousto-optical modulator (AOM) used to control the qubit-control field with a second RF signal. Thus the two laser fields, for qubit manipulation and for AC-Stark shift compensation, are generated simultaneously by the same AOM. Both light fields pass then along the same path to the ions such that they pick up virtually the same intensity, polarization and beam pointing fluctuations, removing the AC-Stark shifts to a large extent. In the Innsbruck experiments, a considerable AC-Stark shift also appears due to dipole-allowed transitions (H\u00e4ffner et al., 2003b). For the blue sideband, the presence of the dipole-allowed transitions partially cancels the shift induced by the presence of the carrier transitions, whereas for the red sideband they add. Thus, in the Innsbruck experiments for coupling the ions to the motion, the blue sideband is preferred over the red one. Another possibility to reduce AC-Stark shifts is to use the polarization degree of freedom. The NIST group tunes the polarization of the Raman-laser beam pair to minimize the shift (Wineland et al., 2003). \u2022 For Raman-driven qubits, spontaneous decay from the levels used to couple the two qubit levels has to be considered. Ozeri et al. (2005) show that using very large detunings this decoherence effect can be reduced sufficiently, however, at the expense of requiring large laser powers. For a detailed discussion of these issues, we refer here to Ozeri et al. (2007). Most of these decoherence sources can be minimized by changing external parameters. For example, the laser intensity can be reduced such that AC-Stark shifts become negligible at the expense of slow gates. Slow gates in turn increase the susceptibility to dephasing due to fluctuating magnetic fields and laser frequencies. Similarly high trap frequencies allow for faster gates (Steane et al., 2000), but make good addressing of the individual qubits more difficult. In the experiments therefore a compromise has often to be made to keep all decoherence mechanisms reasonably small. The previous paragraphs listed the most common important imperfections. However this list is of course incomplete: for instance, a finite residual temperature of the ion string leads to single and two-qubit gate errors. Especially, the Cirac\u2013Zoller gate is very susceptible to imperfect cooling. This error source is very special, since the combined fidelity of two concatenated gates is not the product of the individual gate fidelities as discussed in Section 4.7. Therefore, a full simulation of the whole algorithm is required to make reliable predictions on its performance. 3.2. Motional coherence In the Cirac\u2013Zoller proposal, quantum information is temporarily stored in the motional degree of freedom. Some other gate types, such as the M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate require the ion string to be only well within the Lamb\u2013Dicke regime (Section 2.6.3). Both gate types are affected by population changes (motional heating) and dephasing (e.g. trap frequency fluctuations) during the gate operation. Dephasing is often caused by slow drifts of the trap voltage on the order of a few Hertz, whereas motional heating can be caused by electromagnetic background radiation at the trap frequencies. This background stems predominantly from voltage fluctuations in material close to the trap. The most fundamental source of these voltage fluctuations should be the thermal motion of the electrons inside the conductors. This mechanism has been thoroughly investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, by Wineland and Dehmelt (1975) with electrons in Penning traps. The Johnson noise heating power P is given by: (17) P noise = k T \u0394 \u03bd , where k T is the thermal energy and \u0394 \u03bd is the frequency bandwidth in which the ion accepts the power. The time \u03c4 in which one motional quantum of energy E q = h \u03bd is generated is given by (18) \u03c4 \u2212 1 = P noise E q = k T \u0394 \u03bd h \u03bd = k T h Q , where we introduced the quality factor Q of the ion motion. This quality factor can be derived from the dissipated power P dis = I 2 Re Z of the current induced by a single ion with an energy E ion at the real part of the impedance Re Z . For this, we assume a lumped circuit model (see Fig. 21) where the ion induces a current I = q x \u0307 / D with q being the charge and x \u0307 the velocity of the ion (Shockley, 1938). The characteristic dimension D is on the order of the ion-electrode distance. Using this, we obtain for the quality factor: (19) Q = E ion P dis / \u03bd = m x \u0307 2 \u03bd I 2 Re Z = m \u03bd D 2 q 2 Re Z . Inserting Eq. (19) into Eq. (18), we arrive for the time in which one motional quantum is acquired at (20) \u03c4 \u2212 1 = k T h \u03bd q 2 Re Z m D 2 . Download : Download full-size image Fig. 21. Lumped circuit model of a single ion at velocity x \u0307 interacting with the trap electrodes. The connection between the trap electrodes is mainly characterized by the resistivity R and capacitance C between the electrodes. For typical values of D=100 \u03bcm, Re Z = 1 \u03a9 at room temperature, the expected heating time from Johnson noise is \u03c4 \u223c 200 s/quantum and thus very small. In order to measure a heating rate, one can cool the ion (string) to the ground state, wait for some time to allow for some heating and then probe the strength of the motional sideband. Assuming thermal distribution, the mean phonon number is deduced by employing Eq. (13). Depending on the thermal excitation, the Rabi oscillations on the blue sideband speed up and eventually degrade (c.f. Section 2.6.1). Repeating this procedure for various waiting times yields the heating rate. Seidelin et al. (2006), Epstein et al. (2007) and Wesenberg et al. (2007) developed and applied another method which is based on the strength of the ion fluorescence. The basic idea is that the ion motion leads to Doppler broadening of the absorption spectrum. The change in fluorescence is recorded as a function of a waiting time when cooling is switched off. The latter method is less sensitive than the first one, however, it does not require manipulation of the sidebands. The NIST group observed heating rates of a few phonons per ms (Leibfried et al., 2003a, Turchette et al., 2000) in various traps. This is orders of magnitude more than what is expected from fundamental electrical noise in the trap electrodes (Eq. (20)). Patch charges on the trap electrodes have been suspected to cause these excessive heating rates (Wineland et al., 1998, Turchette et al., 2000). The former publication also discusses various other sources of heating in detail. Patch charges can be generated when an electron beam is used to ionize the atoms during trap loading. Indeed, many experiments suggest that using photo ionization techniques to produce the ions (Kj\u00e6rgaard et al., 2000) can help to reduce the heating rate. A reason for the seemingly reduced heating rate could be the reduced vapor pressure of the atoms during photo ionization as compared with the less efficient electron beam ionization. Thus a much reduced atom flux can be used which reduces deposition of atoms on the trap electrodes. Furthermore, ionization with a laser produces only a minimum of charged particles whereas the electron beam can charge any insulating layer on the trap electrodes. While photoionization seems to lead to reduced heating rates, no experiment with laser cooled ions was reported as of yet where the fundamental thermal noise given in Eq. (20) dominated the heating rate. Only in some Penning trap experiments using a resonance circuit to enhance the real part of the resistivity in Eq. (20), thermal noise plays the dominant role (Wineland and Dehmelt, 1975, H\u00e4ffner et al., 2003a). The Ann\u2013Arbor group observed much reduced heating rates by cooling the trap electrodes (see Ref. Deslauriers et al. (2006) and Fig. 22). In the course of cooling the trap electrodes from 300 K to 150 K, the heating rate dropped by more than one order of magnitude. This strong dependence on the temperature hints at a thermally activated process causing the unexplained heating in ion traps. In addition, the authors measured heating rates as a function of the trap size d . From Eq. (20), a 1 / d 2 scaling is expected while one expects a 1 / d 4 dependence in the case of heating due to moving patch charges (Turchette et al., 2000, Epstein et al., 2007). The Ann\u2013Arbor group extracted from the data in Fig. 22 an exponent of 3.5 (Deslauriers et al., 2006) only slightly different from the postulated exponent of 4 (Turchette et al., 2000). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 22. Single ion heating rate as function of ion-electrode distance (a measure of the trap size) (from Deslauriers et al. (2006)). The trap consists of two needles to which the radio frequency is applied to. Furthermore, two heating rates from planar surface traps are added: the cross shows the heating rate of a 25Mg+ ion in a room temperature trap (electrode material: gold) (Epstein et al., 2007), while the triangle shows the heating rate of a single Sr+ ion where the silver trap electrodes were held at 6 K (Labaziewicz et al., 2008a). The MIT-group has investigated various planar traps made of silver electrodes on a quartz substrate close to 4 K as well as one trap at room temperature (Labaziewicz et al., 2008a). They measured a heating rate as low as 2 quanta/s for trap sizes on the order of 100 \u03bcm while a similar trap at room temperature had a devastating heating rate seven orders of magnitude larger. Even the extremely small heating rates for the 4 K experiments cannot be explained by Johnson noise, only. They also measured heating rates for three different trap sizes and found them to be consistent both with a 1 / d 2 and a 1 / d 4 scaling. In addition, a strong dependence of the heating rate on the annealing temperature used in the fabrication process was found. Furthermore, the MIT group investigate the heating rate of the ions as a function of the electrode temperature T  (Labaziewicz et al., 2008b). Above T = 40 K , they found that the heating rate is proportional T \u03b2 with 2 < \u03b2 < 4 depending on the trap. Overall, these findings suggest that with improved fabrication methods, smaller heating rates can be achieved. Furthermore, the NIST group observed heating rates of 300 quanta/s for a 25Mg+ ion 40 \u03bcm above the gold surface of a planar trap (Epstein et al., 2007). This heating rate is significantly smaller than what one would expect from the MIT measurements and supports the conclusion that choice of materials and fabrication methods are very important to achieve small heating rates. To speed up quantum gates and to ease cooling, there is a strong tendency towards constructing small ion traps. On one hand, small traps with characteristic dimensions of a few tens of microns allow for large trap frequencies on the order of 10 MHz, on the other hand they seem to lead to unacceptable heating rates. Therefore, heating in ion traps is not only an interesting topic on its own but needs a lot of attention from a technological point of view. Cooling the traps to 4 K seems to offer a solution to the heating problem. Many two-qubit gate implementations, however, store quantum information in the motional degree of freedom. Therefore, dephasing of the motional states must be also taken into account. To measure the motional coherence, a superposition of two motional states can be created whose phase coherence is tested after some waiting time. In the Innsbruck experiments, the pulse sequence (read from right to left) R + ( \u03c0 , 0 ) R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) creates the state ( | D , 0 \u3009 + | D , 1 \u3009 ) / 2 . The inverse pulse sequence R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c6 ) R + ( \u03c0 , 0 ) closes the interferometric procedure after some waiting time T . From the contrast of the interference fringes obtained by varying \u03c6 with waiting time T , the coherence time can be directly deduced. One might be tempted to use just a pair of two R + ( \u03c0 / 2 ) pulses to implement the Ramsey experiment. In this case, however, motional as well as electronic dephasing mechanisms lead to decoherence of the intermediate state ( | S , 0 \u3009 + | D , 1 \u3009 ) / 2 . The former pulse sequence, however, is insensitive to phase decoherence of the electronic qubit, and waiting times T of many tens of milliseconds are possible. Thus, with the former pulse sequence, the trap frequency can be easily determined with an accuracy of a few Hertz. Using this method, the Innsbruck group observed a motional coherence time on the order of 100 ms (Schmidt-Kaler et al., 2003a) on the center-mass-mode, being consistent with expected voltage fluctuations on the order of 1 0 \u2212 5 . Furthermore, the Oxford group observed on a single 40Ca+ion a motional coherence time of 182 (36) ms, limited most likely by motional heating of about 3 quanta/s (Lucas et al., 2007). However, the Innsbruck group found that for the axial breathing mode (and other higher axial modes) coherence times of about 5 ms are more typical (Roos, 2008). Thus, it must be concluded, that on the breathing mode, a dephasing mechanism is present which can be neglected for the center-of-mass mode. Roos (2008) show, both theoretically and experimentally, that for a two-ion crystal the breathing mode frequency depends on the motional state of some of the radial modes. The basic mechanism responsible is that an anti-correlated motion (the rocking mode) along a radial direction changes the mean distance between the ions (see Fig. 23). Thus, the repelling force between the ions is reduced leading to a reduction of the axial breathing mode frequency with increasing excitation of the rocking mode. Therefore, if the rocking modes are not in a well-defined state, the breathing mode frequency is different for each experimental realization which in turn is interpreted as dephasing of the breathing mode.

Modeling ion trap quantum computers The influence of each imperfection on the performance of the quantum computer can be reliably estimated with numerical simulations. In this way the necessary steps to improve the performance can be analyzed and planned in detail. For ion trap quantum computers this procedure is relatively straightforward as the Hamiltonians are well-known (see Eq. (2)) (Wineland et al., 1998, Leibfried et al., 2003b, Jonathan et al., 2000). Here we describe the simulations as appropriate for the Innsbruck set-up. With small modifications, these simulations should also be applicable to other ion trap set-ups. Eq. (2) is a good starting point to model ion trap quantum computers. The Hamiltonian is first generalized to multiple ions: (21) H = \u0127 \u2211 n , m \u03a9 n { \u03c3 + ( n ) e \u2212 i \u0394 t + \u03c3 \u2212 ( n ) e i \u0394 t + i \u03b7 n m ( \u03c3 + ( n ) e \u2212 i \u0394 t \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 ( n ) e i \u0394 t ) ( a m e \u2212 i \u03c9 t + a m \u2020 e i \u03c9 t ) } . Here, the indices n and m denote the various ions and motional modes taken into account, respectively, and \u03b7 n m accounts for the different coupling strengths of the ions to the motional modes (James, 1998). For the simulations, the initial state vector is first transformed into the rotating frame of the laser field such that Eq. (21) becomes time independent and the Hamiltonian can be directly integrated. A quantum algorithm usually consists of laser pulses with different frequencies. Therefore, this procedure has to be carried out for each pulse, separately. For the bi-chromatic laser fields employed for the AC-Stark shift compensation (c.f. Section 3.1.3) and M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen-gates (Section 2.6) this method fails. In these cases the differential equation can be numerically integrated. In the following we describe how almost all experimental imperfections were incorporated into the simulations: AC-Stark effects due to the carrier transition are described by Eq. (21) and appear with increasing \u03a9 n (see Section 2.2). Therefore, these shifts are automatically included in the simulation. AC-Stark shifts due to other (dipole) transitions are not taken into account by Eq. (21). However, in the experiments a second light field is used anyways to minimize the total effect of all AC-Stark shifts. Therefore the light shifts must be artificially removed from the Hamiltonian to match the experiments. Off-resonant excitations (c.f. Eq. (9)) are described by Eq. (21) and are therefore automatically included. Laser frequency noise and magnetic field noise are divided into fluctuations slower and faster as compared with typical coherent manipulation times (on the order of 1 ms in current experiments). In the experiments slow fluctuations usually dominate and the laser detuning remains to a large extent constant during coherent state manipulation. The observed increase in the coherence time\u2013when spin echo sequences are used\u2013supports this conjecture. These slow fluctuations can be modeled by running the simulations for several detunings from the qubit transition and by averaging the measured populations. On the other hand, fast fluctuations can be taken into account by transforming Eq. (21) into a master equation. In this case, the dimension of the state space describing the system is squared as compared to the Schr\u00f6dinger approach and thus this method already starts to get tedious for simulations of a five-ion algorithm. In fact, even today\u2019s supercomputers cannot hold the complete density matrix of an arbitrary twenty qubit system in their memory. Laser intensity fluctuations are assumed to be constant during the coherent state manipulation and therefore can be modeled by simulating the algorithms a few times for various laser intensities. Addressing errors are described by setting the Rabi frequencies \u03a9 n in Eq. (21) to the corresponding values. However, it should be noted that there is an additional degree of freedom connected with addressing errors: the phase of the laser at an ion position when directed on this particular ion and when mainly directed on another ion is in general not the same. This is due to the different paths the light field takes in these two cases. Usually, in the simulations all phases are taken to be the same as they seem to give an upper bound for most algorithms. Imperfect ground state cooling can be taken into account by running the simulation with the different initial states and averaging the results appropriately. These simulations allow one to reduce the sensitivity of quantum algorithms to the respective imperfections. In the Innsbruck experiments, especially the influence of laser freqency and addressing errors issues was reduced considerably by optimizing the implementations taking the simulations as a guide. Finally, we document some of the imperfections not taken into account in the simulations for the Innsbruck experiments. In Eq. (21) each ion was approximated as a two level system. For 40Ca+ the S1/2-ground state is split into two Zeeman levels and the upper qubit level D5/2 into six levels. The level separation is about 5 MHz and therefore not much larger than the involved trap frequencies. Therefore, off-resonant excitations of the additional transitions are possible. Furthermore, AC-Stark effects arise due to the presence of the other Zeeman levels as well as due to dipole transitions (H\u00e4ffner et al., 2003b). Finally, the AC-Stark effect was canceled with a second off-resonant laser field. Treating this second light field leads to a time dependent Hamiltonian and was therefore usually not taken into account in the simulations. 4. Key experiments 4.1. Cirac\u2013Zoller-type gates The NIST group demonstrated the central part of the Cirac\u2013Zoller gate on a single 9Be+ ion by implementing the operations displayed in Eq. (14) (Monroe et al., 1995a). The phase gate was turned into a controlled-NOT operation by inserting two Ramsey \u03c0 / 2 pulses, one before and one after the phase gate, to verify the quantum nature of the phase gate. The first two motional excitations n = { 0 , 1 } (see Fig. 1, \u03c9 trap = 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 11 MHz ) served as the control bit, while the target bit was represented by superpositions of the | F = 2 , m f = \u2212 2 \u3009 and | F = 1 , m f = \u2212 1 \u3009 states. For the auxiliary state, the | F = 2 , m f = 0 \u3009 state was used. The complete Cirac\u2013Zoller gate was finally implemented by Schmidt-Kaler et al. (2003c): two 40Ca+ ions were addressed individually using a laser beam with a waist of about 2 \u03bcm. First, the quantum state of ion #1 was mapped onto the breathing mode with a blue sideband pulse R + ( \u03c0 ) . Then, a controlled-NOT gate with the motion as the control bit and the electronic state of ion #2 as the target bit was carried out, before the motional state was mapped back onto ion #1. However, to implement the conditional phase shift, the Innsbruck group did not use an auxiliary level but the composite pulse sequence R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 / 2 ) R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 / 2 ) R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 ) discussed in Section 2.7.3. In the first experiments (Schmidt-Kaler et al., 2003c), the controlled-NOT mapped the four logical eigenstates and one superposition state to their desired respective output states with an average fidelity of 0.73(2) (coherence time \u03c4 \u223c 800 \u03bc s , addressing error \u03f5 \u223c 0.05 ). After several improvements of the experimental set-up ( \u03c4 \u223c 2 ms , \u03f5 \u223c 0.03 , more flexible computer control, etc.), fidelities as large as 0.91.0(6) were observed (Riebe et al., 2006) where, here, the fidelity is defined as an average of the overlap of the produced output states with the ideal output. Additionally, this work implemented the conditional phase shift with the pulse sequence R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) R + ( 2 \u03c0 , \u03c0 / 2 ) R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 ) yielding a fidelity of up to 0.926(6). 4.2. Entangled states with trapped ions One important application of quantum computers in basic research is the generation of interesting quantum states as for instance the first deterministic generation of entangled particles with 9Be+ ions (Turchette et al., 1998). In addition, new applications of entangled states especially for metrology appear constantly (Blatt and Wineland, 2008). Entangled states play an important role in discussions on the foundations of quantum mechanics. Especially since Bell formulated inequalities which could distinguish between so-called local realistic theories and quantum theories (Bell, 1965, Bell, 1971, Clauser et al., 1969), physicists were keen to produce these states and to check the predictions of quantum mechanics. Since then, there have been numerous experiments demonstrating a violation of a Bell inequality. Almost all of these experiments were carried out with photons (for a summary see e.g. Clauser and Shimony (1978), Weihs et al. (1998) and Tittel et al. (1998)). Photons naturally explore the non-locality of entanglement and thus violations over distances of many kilometers were established. However, current detection efficiencies of photons are not high enough to close the so-called \u2018detection loophole\u2019, i.e. one must assume that the detected particles represent a fair sample of all particles emitted by the source (Clauser et al., 1969). Therefore, there is a large interest in testing Bell-inequalities with trapped ions where the detection fidelities approach unity. Such an experiment was conducted with 9Be+ ions by Rowe et al. (2001) and closed the detection loophole. However, the ions were not detected outside their respective light cone, i.e. the detection time was longer than the time it takes light to travel between the ions. Thus there could still exist a combined detection-locality loophole. This loophole could be excluded for instance by creating entanglement between ions or atoms separated by several kilometers. Another interesting aspect of the ion trap experiments is that the entangled states are produced deterministically. That means that in contrast to the photon experiments, the entangled states are created on demand. More importantly, the entangled states are not destroyed during their creation such that they can be used for further experiments. Current research is directed towards entangled states with more than two particles. Already for three qubits, two classes of entanglement appear: GHZ states (Greenberger et al., 1989) and W states (D\u00fcr et al., 2000, Zeilinger et al., 1992). These two classes of entanglement cannot be transformed into each other by local operations and classical communication, i.e. with single-qubit operations and measurements of the individual qubits (D\u00fcr et al., 2000). Both classes are not only maximally entangled but also violate Bell-type inequalities. GHZ states are states of the form (22) | GHZ \u3009 N = ( | 00 \u22ef 0 \u3009 + | 11 \u22ef 1 \u3009 ) / 2 . GHZ states with many qubits can be interpreted as Schr\u00f6dinger-cat states. For this, e.g. the first qubit is treated as a separate degree freedom and all other qubits as a single quantum system, i.e. the cat system. Then the state of the first qubit indicates the state of the second \u201cmacroscopic\u201d system. Another use of GHZ states is by encoding quantum information in a superposition of the form \u03b1 | 000 \u3009 + \u03b2 | 111 \u3009 . If a single qubit flips, the original state can still be recovered with so-called quantum error correction protocols (Shor, 1995, Steane, 1996). W states are states of the form (23) | W \u3009 N = ( | 0 \u22ef 001 \u3009 + | 0 \u22ef 010 \u3009 + | 0 \u22ef 0100 \u3009 + \u22ef + | 10 \u22ef 0 \u3009 ) / N . They are remarkably stable against various decoherence sources: they are intrinsically stable against collective dephasing mechanisms (Roos et al., 2004b) and even loss of qubits does not completely destroy the entanglement present in them. A four ion GHZ state was first produced by Sackett et al. (2000) using a M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen type gate (see Section 2.6.3). The produced GHZ-state was analyzed by applying R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c6 ) -pulses to all ions simultaneously and measuring the number of fluorescing ions with a photo multiplier. Here, we will illustrate this procedure used by Sackett et al. (2000) for the two particle Bell state ( | 00 \u3009 + | 11 \u3009 ) / 2 : (24) | 00 \u3009 + | 11 \u3009 \u27f6 R 2 C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c6 ) , R 1 C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c6 ) ( | 0 \u3009 + i e i \u03c6 | 1 \u3009 ) ( | 0 \u3009 + i e i \u03c6 | 1 \u3009 ) + ( | 1 \u3009 + i e \u2212 i \u03c6 | 0 \u3009 ) ( | 1 \u3009 + i e \u2212 i \u03c6 | 0 \u3009 ) = ( 1 \u2212 e \u2212 2 i \u03c6 ) | 00 \u3009 + i e i \u03c6 ( 1 + e \u2212 2 i \u03c6 ) | 01 \u3009 + i e i \u03c6 ( 1 + e \u2212 2 i \u03c6 ) | 10 \u3009 + ( 1 \u2212 e \u2212 2 i \u03c6 ) | 11 \u3009 , where we used Eq. (10) in the first step and omitted the normalization factors. To find an estimate for the fidelity of the original Bell state, it is useful to introduce the parity operator P which is defined as P = P 00 \u2212 P 01 \u2212 P 10 + P 11 . Here P x y are the probabilities to find the ions in state | x y \u3009 . Plotting the expectation value of the parity, we see that it oscillates twice as fast as the phase \u03c6 of the analyzing pulses. This behavior can also be interpreted as a consequence of the doubled energy difference between the | 00 \u3009 and the | 11 \u3009 state as compared with the single ion case. To find the fidelity of the Bell state, two sets of experiments can be carried out: first a Bell state is created and the populations P 00 and P 11 are recorded. In a second set of experiments, the maximum ( max P ) and minimum ( min P ) of parity oscillations as described in Eq. (24) are determined. The overlap F of the experimentally produced state with a state of the form ( | 00 \u3009 + e i \u03d5 | 11 \u3009 ) / 2 is given then by F = ( P 00 + P 11 ) / 2 + ( max P \u2212 min P ) / 4  (Sackett et al., 2000). No individual addressing of the ions is required in the analysis procedure. In addition, the parity can be inferred from the global fluorescence of the ion string. Thus, this analysis method is relatively simple and efficient. Furthermore, it can be generalized to GHZ states with an arbitrary number of ions and is thus very useful to gain information on the generated GHZ states, without individual qubit addressing and read-out. This analysis technique was also used to verify the creation of a three particle GHZ-states with fidelities of up to 0.89 (Leibfried et al., 2004). The quality of the GHZ state was high enough, that from the resulting generalized Ramsey fringes (c.f. Eq. (24)) the phase could be estimated 1.45 times more accurately than using three uncorrelated particles. Estimating the phase of superpositions is quite important in frequency measurements. The high fidelity of the GHZ states was made possible by using the geometric phase gate (Section 2.6.4). Encouraged by this, the NIST group applied this gate also to create four-, five- and six-particle entangled GHZ-states, with lower bounds for the fidelities of 0.76 (1), 0.60 (2) and 0.509 (4), respectively (Leibfried et al., 2005). As for GHZ states, a fidelity above 0.5 implies automatically the presence of genuine N -partite entanglement, the latter experiments demonstrated up to six partite GHZ-like entanglement. While the NIST group uses predominantly global addressing and state read-out, the Innsbruck group entangled ions mainly with laser pulses addressed to individual ions. For instance, a Bell can be created in the following way (please note that the right-most ion is the first one) (Roos et al., 2004a): (25) | S S , 0 \u3009 \u27f6 R 1 + ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c6 + \u03c0 / 2 ) ( | S S , 0 \u3009 + e i \u03c6 | S D , 1 \u3009 ) / 2 \u27f6 R 2 C ( \u03c0 , 0 ) ( | D S , 0 \u3009 + e i \u03c6 | D D , 1 \u3009 ) / 2 \u27f6 R 2 + ( \u03c0 , 0 ) ( | D S , 0 \u3009 + e i \u03c6 | S D , 0 \u3009 ) / 2 . The success of the Bell-state generation is usually verified using a procedure called state tomography (see Section 4.4). The laser phase offset \u03c6 of the first pulse determines phase of the Bell state. In addition, an additional R 2 C ( \u03c0 , 0 ) -pulse on the second ion transfers the ( | D S , 0 \u3009 + e i \u03c6 | S D , 0 \u3009 ) / 2 state to ( | S S , 0 \u3009 + e i \u03c6 | D D , 0 \u3009 ) / 2 . Thus, using this toolbox all four Bell-states can be created in the same set-up. Furthermore, the Innsbruck group used the flexibility of the entangling method to create three particle GHZ and W states (Roos et al., 2004b). The idea to create a GHZ state (Cirac and Zoller, 1995), is to apply a controlled-NOT gate while the motional degree is still in a superposition of | 0 \u3009 and | 1 \u3009 (see Eq. (25)). For this CNOT-operation, the motion is the control bit and the new ion is the target bit (the second line in Fig. 24) (Rauschenbeutel et al., 2000, Raimond et al., 2001). Inserting more and more CNOT\u2019s, this GHZ-state generation method is straightforwardly generalized to more particles. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 24. Pulse sequence to generate a GHZ state. The controlled-NOT operation is implemented with a composite phase gate \u03a6 ( \u03c0 ) (see Section 2.7.3) sandwiched in between two R C -pulses on the center ion. Hatched areas indicate sideband pulses. In order to create a three-ion W state | W 3 \u3009 = ( | D D S + | D S D \u3009 + | S D D \u3009 \u3009 ) / 3 , Eq. (25) can be generalized differently: the length of the first blue sideband pulse is adjusted such that the state ( | S S S , 0 \u3009 + 2 | S S D , 1 \u3009 ) / 3 is created and ions #2 and #3 are flipped to obtain ( | D D S , 0 \u3009 + 2 | D D D , 1 \u3009 ) / 3 . Then the phonon is shared between the remaining ions #2 and #3 to create ( | D D S , 0 \u3009 + | D S D , 0 \u3009 + | S D D , 0 \u3009 ) / 3 . Fig. 25 shows the corresponding pulse sequence (See also Fig. 26.). It can also be directly generalized to N ions by adjusting the pulse area of the first beam splitter to arccos ( 1 / N ) and then sharing the phonon excitation among the other ions equally (H\u00e4ffner et al., 2005a). Interestingly, the required blue sideband pulse area grows only logarithmically with the ion number and thus the generation time grows sublinear with the number of ions. Therefore, this scheme opens the possibility to generate large entangled states (Fig. 27). In experiments, W states ranging from four up to eight ions have been created (H\u00e4ffner et al., 2005a). Using a technique called state tomography (see Section 4.4), the experimentally obtained states have been fully characterized (Fig. 27). Analyzing the measured density matrix showed that the generated states indeed carried genuine N -particle entanglement. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 25.

Absolute values of the density matrix of an eight-ion W state (from H\u00e4ffner et al. (2005a)). In addition, in the upper right corner the CCD-image of an eight-ion string is displayed. For the state tomography, the experiment was repeated 100 times for each of the 6561 measurement settings. The total measurement time amounted to more than 10 h. The fidelity of the W state was determined to 0.722(1). We add that an even faster scheme to produce W states was proposed which does not require individual addressing in the entangling procedure (Retzker et al., 2007, Solano, 2005). The idea here is that first a | D D \u22ef D , 1 \u3009 state is created. Then a R + ( \u03c0 , 0 ) pulse addressed to all ions is supposed to generate the desired W state by mapping the phonon to the electronic state of one of the ions, i.e. creating a symmetric superposition with exactly one electronic state flipped. Retzker et al. (2007) further generalized this procedure to W states with more than one excitation (Dicke states). Entangled states have also been produced with trapped 111Cd+ and 40Ca+ ions by the Ann\u2013Arbor (Haljan et al., 2005b) and the Oxford groups (Home et al., 2006), respectively. For the two qubit levels, the Ann\u2013Arbor group used the | F = 0 , m F = 0 \u3009 and | F = 1 , m F = 0 \u3009 state of the ground state of 111Cd+, taking advantage of its insensitivity to the Zeeman effect in first order. The geometric phase gate (Section 2.6.4) does not work efficiently on magnetic field insensitive transitions (Langer, 2006). Instead, the Ann\u2013Arbor group used a M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate (Section 2.6.3) to entangle the two ions (Haljan et al., 2005a, Haljan et al., 2005b). Furthermore, a tomographic state characterization was applied to evaluate the produced states and the degree of entanglement thoroughly (see Section 4.4). To achieve the required individual addressing capability, a combination of ion selective AC-Stark shifts and microwave fields was used (c.f. Section 2.5.1). The Oxford group created Bell states with two trapped 40Ca+ ions (Home et al., 2006). They encoded the quantum information in the Zeeman manifold of the S1/2-ground state, thus effectively using the direction of the valence electron\u2019s spin. Adopting the geometric phase gate (Section 2.6.4) for 40Ca+, they created the Bell state ( | \u2191 \u2191 \u3009 \u2212 | \u2193 \u2193 \u3009 ) / 2 . In Innsbruck, a M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate was used to prepare a pair of 40Ca+ ions in the entangled state \u03c8 = ( | S S \u3009 + i | D D \u3009 ) / 2 , where | S \u3009 \u2261 | S 1 / 2 , m = 1 / 2 \u3009 and | D \u3009 \u2261 | D 5 / 2 , m = 3 / 2 \u3009 . Using a gate time \u03c4 = 50 \u03bc s with the laser light being smoothly switched on and off within 2.5 \u03bcs, a Bell state fidelity of 0.993(1) was achieved (Benhelm et al., 2008b) when the ions were cooled to the ground state of the motional mode mediating the coupling. Moreover, uneven multiples k = 1 , 3 , 5 , \u2026 , 21 of the gate were used to create entangled states. For k = 21 , the state fidelity was still 0.8. Finally, the gate yielded Bell states with a fidelity of 0.96 even with the ion string cooled only to the Doppler limit ( \u3008 n bus \u3009 = 17 ) . 4.3. Decoherence free subspaces Laser frequency and magnetic field fluctuations are usually the dominant decoherence mechanisms in ion traps. Both mechanisms lead to fluctuations of the phase between the laser and the atomic polarization and thus to dephasing of each qubit, however, to a good approximation by the same amount for all qubits. If one encodes a single qubit in two ions in such a way that the two phase evolutions cancel each other, the original qubit is protected from this global dephasing and the quantum information is encoded into a decoherence free subspace (DFS). In particular, superpositions of the form \u03b1 | 01 \u3009 + \u03b2 | 10 \u3009 are transformed by the global single-qubit phase-change | 1 \u3009 \u2192 e i \u03d5 | 1 \u3009 in the following way: (26) \u03b1 | 01 \u3009 + \u03b2 | 10 \u3009 \u2192 \u03b1 e i \u03d5 | 01 \u3009 + \u03b2 e i \u03d5 | 10 \u3009 . The global phase factor e i \u03d5 cannot be observed, such that the state remains immune against collective dephasing. This property was demonstrated by Kielpinski et al. (2001) using an engineered dephasing mechanism. The qubits were encoded in the hyperfine-states of 9Be+. As a controlled dephasing mechanism, Kielpinski et al. (2001) chose an unfocused off-resonant laser beam with \u201crandom\u201d intensity. The laser beam leads for each experimental realization to a different AC-Stark effect, however, common to both ions. In an environment with natural dephasing, Roos et al. (2004a) observed also much increased lifetimes of qubits encoded in a DFS as compared with single ion qubits. In these experiments, the coherence of a state formed by two 40Ca+ ions | \u03a8 qubit \u3009 = ( | D S \u3009 + e i \u03c6 | S D \u3009 ) / 2 was retained for 1 s, the dominant decoherence mechanism being spontaneous decay of the D5/2 level. For comparison, laser frequency noise and magnetic field fluctuations led to a single ion coherence time of 1 ms. Furthermore, both the Innsbruck (H\u00e4ffner et al., 2005b) and the NIST (Langer et al., 2005) groups encoded quantum information in the ground states of two-ion strings with 40Ca+ and 9 Be+, respectively. Coherence times of 34 s and 7 s, respectively, were measured. In both cases, fluctuations of the magnetic field gradient were believed to be the reason for the decoherence in the DFS. For these experiments, extreme care must be taken to switch off the laser light properly. Not only residual light scattering rates on the order of 0.1 photon/s destroy the coherence, but also fluctuating differential AC-Stark shifts on the order of 1 Hz destroy the phase coherence of the entangled states. Finally, we note that these experiments also demonstrated extremely long lived entanglement of up to 20 s between two parties separated by 5 \u03bcm. Apart from robustly encoding quantum information, decoherence-free subspaces have also found an application in quantum metrology. In Roos et al. (2006), a Bell state was encoded in a combination of Zeeman sublevels of the D5/2 level of two 40Ca+ ions. The state was decoherence-free with respect to fluctuations of the magnetic field but sensitive to energy level shifts caused by static electric field gradients. In this way, the quadrupole moment of the metastable state could be determined with high precision by monitoring the Bell state\u2019s phase evolution over a duration orders of magnitude longer than the single-qubit coherence time. 4.4. State tomography Quantum state tomography (Paris and Rehacek, 2004) is a measurement technique that provides access to all the information stored in density matrices describing pure and mixed quantum states. It requires the quantum state of interest to be available in many copies. While the basic measurement principle dates back fifty years (Fano, 1957), experimental implementations of quantum state tomography started only in the 1990\u2019s (Smithey et al., 1993, Dunn et al., 1995, Leibfried et al., 1996). Tomographic measurements of systems composed of qubits have been implemented in experiments with nuclear magnetic resonance, photons, trapped ions and superconductors (Chuang et al., 1998a, White et al., 1999, Roos et al., 2004a, Steffen et al., 2006). Noting that the density matrix of a single qubit can be represented by (27) \u03c1 = 1 2 ( I + \u2211 \u03b1 \u3008 \u03c3 \u03b1 \u3009 \u03c3 \u03b1 ) , we see that the density matrix of a single qubit can be inferred by measuring the expectation values \u3008 \u03c3 \u03b1 \u3009 , ( \u03b1 = x , y , z ), of the Pauli spin matrices. The measurement of \u03c3 z is accomplished by projecting the qubit onto its energy eigenstate basis. For the measurement of \u03c3 x , y , an additional \u03c0 / 2 -pulse of suitable phase precedes the projective measurement. The tomographic procedure can be easily extended to systems of several qubits by measuring the joint spin expectation values \u03c3 \u03b1 1 ( n 1 ) \u2297 \u03c3 \u03b1 2 ( n 2 ) \u2297 \u22ef \u03c3 \u03b1 k ( n k ) where \u03c3 \u03b1 j denotes a spin component of qubit n j ( \u03c3 \u03b1 j \u2208 { I , \u03c3 x , \u03c3 y , \u03c3 z } ) . This way, the determination of the density matrix of an N-qubit system requires the measurement of 4 N expectation values. As some of the operators commute, a total of 3 N measurement bases is necessary. While in principle the number of measurements could be reduced by projecting onto mutually unbiased bases (Wootters and Fields, 1989), this procedure is of no practical importance in current ion trap experiments as it would demand high-fidelity entangling gate operations for mapping the required bases to product state bases. A slight complication arises, since in every experimental implementation of quantum state tomography, expectation values are never exactly determined but only estimated based on a finite number of measurements. The na\u00efve replacement of the expectation values \u3008 \u03c3 \u03b1 \u3009 in Eq. (27) can give rise to unphysical density matrices with negative eigenvalues. This problem is avoided by employing a maximum likelihood estimation of the density matrix (Hradil, 1997, James et al., 2001) that makes use of the estimated expectation values for searching in the set of meaningful density matrices the \u2018most likely one\u2019. The maximum likelihood algorithm identifies the sought-for density matrix with the one that maximizes the probability of observing the experimentally recorded set of measurement results. Even though maximum likelihood estimation has been criticized (Blume-Kohout, 2006) for being less accurate than Bayesian estimation techniques (Paris and Rehacek, 2004), it has the practical merit of being easily implemented in experiments. Starting with Roos et al. (2004a), almost all Innsbruck experiments made heavy use of quantum state tomography. Even an eight particle W state has been fully characterized (H\u00e4ffner et al., 2005a). Fig. 27 shows the experimentally obtained density matrix of an eight-ion W state. A particular merit of quantum state tomography is that all physically available information on the quantum register is extracted. Thus, all aspects of the generated states can be thoroughly analyzed without taking new data. An alternative to the above described method, was demonstrated by the Oxford group (Home et al., 2006). They used a refined, albeit partial tomographic procedure: instead of choosing three measurement settings for each qubit (either one of the pulses R C ( 0 , 0 ) , R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) , or R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u03c0 / 2 ) preceding the qubit detection), they choose to apply before the detection the pulses R C ( \u03b8 i , \u03c6 ) with \u03b8 i either 0, 0.66 \u03c0 , or 0.54 \u03c0 and evenly distributed phases \u03c6 \u2208 [ 0 , 2 \u03c0 [ . In this way, the reconstruction is less biased and thus more robust against systematic errors or equivalently against decoherence. 4.5. Selective read-out of a quantum register For some quantum algorithms like teleportation and most error-correction protocols a part of the quantum register has to be read out while leaving the rest of the register intact. Both the Innsbruck and the NIST group succeeded in this task. Barrett et al. (2004) employed segmented traps to separate the ions to be read out from the ions which should remain coherent. Now, one set of ions can be illuminated safely with detection light while the other ions are left dark. The Innsbruck group chose a different route to selectively read out the quantum register (Roos et al., 2004b, Riebe et al., 2004). Qubits were protected from being measured by transferring their quantum information to superpositions of levels which are not affected by the detection, that is, a light scattering process on the S 1 / 2 \u2192 P 1 / 2 -transition in Ca+. In the experiments, a \u03c0 pulse on the S 1 / 2 \u2192 D 5 / 2 ( m J = \u2212 5 / 2 ) -transition transfers the quantum information into the { D \u2032 \u2261 D 5 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 5 / 2 ) , D \u2261 D 5 / 2 ( m j = \u2212 1 / 2 ) } manifold. Fig. 28 shows two ions which are protected from the detection light at 397 nm and the third ion with the original encoding which is measured. After the selective readout, a second set of \u03c0 -pulses on the D\u2032 to S transition transfers the quantum information back to the original computational subspace {D, S}. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 28. Partial level scheme of the three Ca-ions (from Roos et al. (2004b)). Only ion #3 is read out. Ion #1 and #2\u2019s quantum information is protected in the Zeeman manifold of the D5/2-level, namely the m J = \u2212 1 / 2 and m J = \u2212 5 / 2 levels. It is interesting to apply the selective read-out to an entangled qubit register and to demonstrate the collapse and even partial collapse of a wave function. For this Roos et al. (2004b) first prepared a three-ion GHZ- and a W-state and then detected one of the ions while the quantum information of the other ions was still protected in the D-level. Fig. 29 shows the results of these measurements. The quantum nature of the GHZ-state was completely destroyed by measuring a single constituent, i.e. it was projected into a mixture of | S S S \u3009 and | D D D \u3009 (Fig. 29a and c). By contrast, for the W-state, the quantum register remained partially entangled as coherences between ion #1 and #2 persisted after measuring ion #3 (Fig. 29b and d).

Conditional single-qubit operations One can take the partial read-out of a quantum register one step further and perform operations conditioned on the read-out result. As will be discussed in Section 5.2, both the NIST and the Innsbruck group demonstrated this procedure within their respective teleportation experiments (Barrett et al., 2004, Riebe et al., 2004). Furthermore, the Innsbruck group employed conditional operations to deterministically transfer a three-particle GHZ-state with local operations into a two-particle Bell state (Roos et al., 2004b). This procedure can also be regarded as an implementation of a three-spin quantum eraser as proposed by Garisto and Hardy (1999). In the experiment by Roos et al. (2004b), first the GHZ-state ( | D S D \u3009 + | S D S \u3009 ) / 2 was created. Application of R 3 ( \u03c0 / 2 , 3 \u03c0 / 2 ) yielded the GHZ state | D \u3009 ( | S D \u3009 \u2212 | D S \u3009 ) + | S \u3009 ( | S D \u3009 + | D S \u3009 ) / 2 . Measuring ion #3, projected ions #1 and #2 either onto ( | S D \u3009 \u2212 | D S \u3009 ) / 2 or onto ( | S D \u3009 + | D S \u3009 ) / 2 with ion #3 indicating in which of the two states the first two ions were (see Fig. 30a). This mixture of the two Bell states can then be transferred to a pure Bell state by inducing a phase shift of \u03c0 on ion #2 (pulse sequence R 2 C ( \u03c0 , \u03c0 / 2 ) R 2 C ( \u03c0 , 0 ) ) if, and only if, ion #3 was measured to be in the D -state. In addition, the state of ion #3 was reset to | S \u3009 . Fig. 30 shows the intermediate result before applying the conditional rotation as well as the resulting Bell state. The bipartite entangled state | S \u3009 ( | S D \u3009 + | D S \u3009 ) / 2 was produced with fidelity of 0.75. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 30.

Note the different vertical scaling of (a) and (b). 4.7. Process tomography Process tomography is a method to characterize a quantum mechanical evolution (Chuang and Nielsen, 1997, Poyatos et al., 1997). Measurements are made to determine how an arbitrary input state, characterized by the density matrix \u03c1 in , is transformed by the quantum process. The output density matrix \u03c1 out of the process can be expressed as (28) \u03c1 out = \u2211 i , j = 0 2 N \u2212 1 \u03c7 i j A \u02c6 i \u03c1 in A \u02c6 j . Here \u03c7 i j is the so-called process matrix, N is the number of qubits and the operators A \u02c6 i form a basis of the space of the 2 N \u00d7 2 N matrices. All relevant information on the quantum process is contained in the process matrix \u03c7 i j . In the standard procedure, the 4 N separable states\u2013 { | 0 \u3009 i , | 1 \u3009 i , ( | 0 \u3009 i + | 1 \u3009 i ) / 2 , ( | 0 \u3009 i + i | 1 \u3009 i ) / 2 } for a single qubit\u2013are prepared and then the output of the process is characterized each time with a full state tomography ( 3 N measurement settings). Inverting Eq. (28) yields the process matrix \u03c7 i j . Such a process tomography has been carried out for characterizing quantum gates in NMR (Childs et al., 2001) and in linear-optics quantum computing (O\u2019Brien et al., 2004, Kiesel et al., 2005). For ion traps, a one-qubit process (the teleportation of a qubit (Riebe et al., 2007)) and two-qubit processes (a CNOT and its square (Riebe et al., 2006)) have been characterized. Knowing the process matrix \u03c7 i j for all basic operations of a quantum computer is a very good basis for estimating the computer\u2019s performance. However, there are a few caveats: the number of necessary measurements to determine the process matrix \u03c7 i j scales quite dramatically and thus it becomes quickly impractical to characterize processes with numerous qubits. Already for a four-qubit process, 20 736 measuring settings would be required summing up to about 24 h measurement time with the current parameters of the Innsbruck experiment (100 experiments/setting, 25 repetitions/s). In addition, it is not clear that the subsequent application of two processes corresponds to the product of the process matrices. This assumption usually holds only if the relevant environment is time invariant, i.e. the process interacts only with a bath without memory. For example, for the Cirac\u2013Zoller gate, the phonon mode might keep the memory about the failure of an earlier gate operation and thus induce a failure of the next gate. Furthermore, the realization of the process can depend on whether it is executed at the beginning or the end of an algorithm. In particular, experiments are often triggered to the phase of the power line to reduce dephasing due to magnetic field fluctuations caused by 50 Hz or 60 Hz noise and their multiples. Executing a certain gate operation a few milliseconds earlier or later within the experimental sequence leads easily to a change of the qubit resonance frequency of 100 Hz and the realization of the process becomes time dependent. Process tomography, as presented above, requires at least 4 N 3 N measurement settings and is thus quite costly. Above, we have restricted ourselves to the separable operators A \u02c6 j . Using entangled auxiliary qubits and/or measuring in non-separable bases, the number of settings could be reduced, however, scales still exponentially in the qubit number N  (Mohseni and Lidar, 2006). Furthermore, most likely the total number of measurement runs has to be on the same order of magnitude as in the standard method to obtain a similar accuracy. Therefore, we conclude that a full quantum process tomography of a large quantum systems will be not practical. Finally, we note that there exist other approaches to estimate the fidelity of quantum processes. For instance, Knill et al. (2008) employ long sequences of randomly chosen gates. The main idea is that while the result of each gate sequence is known in an ideal implementation, noise leads to deviations from the expected results. Measuring the deviations, the average fidelity of the gate operations can be inferred. Choosing random sequences guarantees that the gate operation is investigated with various input states and in various combinations. 5. Algorithms with trapped ions 5.1. Deutsch\u2013Josza algorithm The Deutsch\u2013Josza (DJ) algorithm detects the parity of an unknown function (Deutsch, 1989, Nielsen and Chuang, 2000). Concentrating on a single bit, there exist four different functions which map one (qu)bit with value a = { 0 , 1 } onto another one. These functions can be divided into constant (even) ( f 1 ( a ) = 0 and f 2 ( a ) = 1 ) and balanced (odd) functions ( f 3 ( a ) = a and f 4 ( a ) = NOT a ). With a classical machine, it is necessary to call f n at least twice to decide whether f n is odd or even, i.e. one needs to calculate f n ( 0 ) and f n ( 1 ) . However, formulating the procedure quantum mechanically, the question whether f n is constant or balanced can be decided by calling it only once. In order to formulate the problem quantum mechanically, the functions f n have to be generalized to take qubits as inputs. Within the framework of quantum mechanics all operations are unitary and therefore another qubit (the work or auxiliary qubit) is added to allow for non-invertible functions f 1 and f 2 . Rephrasing the task, qubit | a \u3009 holds the input variable x while qubit | w \u3009 (the work qubit) will receive the result of the evaluation f n ( a ) plus the initial value w of qubit | w \u3009 to guarantee invertibility (see Fig. 31). Thus, we define the unitary U f n representing the implementation of the function acting on | w \u3009 | a \u3009 with values w and a , respectively: (29) U f n | w \u3009 | a \u3009 = | f n ( a ) \u2295 w \u3009 | a \u3009 . Here, \u2295 denotes an addition modulo 2. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 31. General scheme of the Deutsch\u2013Josza algorithm (from Gulde et al. (2003)). The upper line represents the qubit holding the input variable a which\u2013if prepared in a logical eigenstate\u2013does not change its value when U f n is called. The lower line holds the work qubit w . To this number, the value of the function f n is added modulo 2. The Hadamard rotations R y w (and R y \u0304 w ) transfer the quantum bits into superpositions so that the inherent parallelism of quantum mechanics can be used. The DJ-algorithm consists of the following steps (c.f. Fig. 31): (1) Initialize the system in the state | 0 a \u3009 | 1 w \u3009 . (2) Transfer the input qubit | a \u3009 into ( | 0 \u3009 + | 1 \u3009 ) / 2 and the work-qubit | w \u3009 into ( | 0 \u3009 \u2212 | 1 \u3009 ) / 2 with Hadamard operations R y . (3) Call the (unknown) function with these superimposed values by implementing U f n . (4) Close the interferometer by applying an inverse Hadamard operation ( R y \u0304 ) on | a \u3009 . (5) Read out the result in | a \u3009 . The ion trap experiment used only a single 40Ca+-ion (Gulde et al., 2003). The internal state acted as the qubit | a \u3009 to hold the input variable for the function with the logical assignment | 0 \u3009 \u2261 | S \u3009 , while the axial vibrational degree of freedom was used as the work qubit | w \u3009 (logical assignment | 0 \u3009 \u2261 | 1 \u3009 ax and | 1 \u3009 \u2261 | 0 \u3009 ax ). Thus, ground state cooling to | S , 0 \u3009 initialized the system in | 0 a \u3009 | 1 w \u3009 , as required. A peculiarity of encoding a qubit within the ion\u2019s motional state is that one has to take care that the system does not leave the computational subspace { | S , 0 \u3009 , | D , 0 \u3009 , | S , 1 \u3009 , | D , 1 \u3009 } . In the experiment, this was achieved with the composite pulse techniques described in Section 2.7.3 (Childs and Chuang, 2000). Furthermore, single-qubit operations on the motional degree of freedom had to be carried out. For this, the quantum information in the motional degree of freedom was swapped to the electronic degree of freedom such that ordinary carrier pulses could be used. Finally, the quantum information was swapped back to the motional degree of freedom. The Hadamard rotations R y w and R y \u0304 w were absorbed into the definitions of the functions such that only for f 2 this swapping of the quantum information had to be employed. To decide on the class of the implemented function, only qubit | a \u3009 had to be measured. Finding | a \u3009 in | 0 \u3009 indicated that the function was even, finding | 1 \u3009 showed that the function was odd (see points at the end of the traces in Fig. 32). For the functions f 1 , f 3 and f 4 the fidelity to identify the functions class with a single measurement exceeded 0.97, for f 2 it was still above 0.9. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 32.

Repeating this sequence for various times, it is possible to follow the algorithm through its evolution. This procedure helps to debug algorithms and makes sure that the desired algorithm is implemented. 5.2. Teleportation In quantum teleportation, the state of a qubit is transferred from one physical system to another one. This can be achieved with the following protocol (Bennett et al., 1993): first two parties share an entangled qubit pair. The quantum information contained in an additional qubit (the source qubit) can be transferred from one party to the other party by performing a Bell-state measurement on the source qubit and one of the entangled qubits. To conclude the transfer, the result of this Bell-state measurement is communicated via a classical channel to the receiver party and the receiver performs one of four rotations depending one the result of the Bell-state measurement. Thus, it is possible to transfer the information content of a qubit by communicating two classical bits (the result of the Bell measurement) and using entanglement. Therefore, teleportation demonstrates a way to break down quantum information into a purely classical part and a quantum part. Another feature of teleportation is that it is not merely a simple transmission of a quantum state: it does not need a quantum channel to be open at the time the transfer is carried out. Instead, it uses the non-local properties of quantum mechanics, established by a quantum channel prior to the generation of the state to be teleported. Once that link has been established, an unknown state can be transferred deterministically at any later time using classical communication only. Especially this feature was highlighted by the two ion trap teleportation experiments (Barrett et al., 2004, Riebe et al., 2004) by entangling the auxiliary and the target qubits before writing the quantum information into the source qubit. Thus these experiments demonstrate that unknown quantum information can be transferred on demand without using an active quantum channel. The teleportation circuit displayed in Fig. 33 is formally equivalent to the one proposed by Bennett et al. (1993), but adapted to the Innsbruck ion-trap quantum processor. The Innsbruck group reached fidelities of about 0.75 (Riebe et al., 2004) and 0.83 (Riebe et al., 2007), while the NIST group measured a fidelity of 0.78 (Barrett et al., 2004). Teleportation based on a completely classical resource instead of a quantum entangled resource yields a maximal possible fidelity of 0.667 (Massar and Popescu, 1995). We note that to rule out out hidden variable theories, a fidelity in excess of 0.87 is required (Gisin, 1996). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 33. The teleportation algorithm\u2019s quantum circuit as implemented in the Innsbruck experiment (from Riebe et al. (2004)). Double lines represent flow of classical information, whereas single lines represent flow of quantum information. The gray lines indicate when a qubit is protected from detection light via so-called hiding-pulses. First, ions #2 and #3 are entangled, creating the quantum link between the source region (ions #1 and #2) and the target ion (ion #3). Then, after some waiting time, the state to be teleported (on ion #1) is prepared via the unitary operation U \u03c7 . A controlled phase gate together with detection via a photomultiplier tube (PMT) implements the Bell state measurement. To emphasize the role of the shared entangled pair as a resource, in the Innsbruck experiments, a delay between the creation of the Bell state and the state preparation of the input qubit was introduced. For waiting times of up to 20 ms (exceeding the time required for the teleportation by more than a factor of 10) no significant decrease in the fidelity was observed. For longer waiting times, the measured heating of the ion crystal of less than 1 phonon/100 ms is expected to reduce the fidelity significantly, because the Cirac\u2013Zoller gate requires the center-of-mass mode of the ion string to be in the ground state. The implementation of the NIST group (Barrett et al., 2004) demonstrates how segmented traps facilitate ion trap quantum computation. The authors use a segmented linear trap (Rowe et al., 2002), where the two DC-electrodes rails are each split into eight segments. Fig. 34 shows the ion positions in each step during the teleportation procedure. By changing the potentials on the electrodes (top), the ion strings can be moved, split and merged. The teleportation algorithm was implemented in the following way (see Fig. 34): first the leftmost and rightmost ions (auxiliary and target, respectively) were prepared in the Bell state | \u2193 \u2193 \u3009 13 \u2212 i | \u2191 \u2191 \u3009 13 using the geometric phase gate discussed in Section 2.6.4 (Leibfried et al., 2003b). As the bus mode, the stretch mode was used. The center ion does not couple to the stretch mode and thus an effective two-qubit gate between the outer ions is implemented. For the experiments, it proved useful to transfer this Bell state into a singlet state ( | \u03a8 \u3009 = | \u2191 \u2193 \u3009 13 \u2212 | \u2193 \u2191 \u3009 ) 13 as the singlet state remains invariant under global rotations allowing for an effective single-qubit addressing of the source ion #2. This was achieved by changing the relative position of the ions by varying the trap strength such that the subsequent laser pulses had the desired phases at the new ion positions (Rowe et al., 2001). To implement the teleportation, the Bell state measurement has to be carried out on the source ion #1 and the auxiliary ion #2. For this, the target ion #3 was first separated from the string in trap #6 and ions #1 and #2 were transferred back into trap #5. Most importantly, the stretch mode of the two ions was still close to the ground state and the required rotation into the Bell basis could be directly implemented with the geometric phase gate (Section 2.6.4) without the need of a sympathetic cooling step (c.f. Section 6). Then, ion #1 and #2 were measured by transporting first the auxiliary ion into trap #5, measuring there its fluorescence (see Section 2.4) and pumping it into state | \u2193 \u3009 . Next, ion #2 was also transported to trap #5 and the total fluorescence was detected, revealing the state of the source ion. In a last step, ion #3 was transferred into trap #5 and conditioned on the result of the Bell measurement, the corresponding single-qubit operation was applied.

Quantum error correction Classical computers use error correction schemes intensively. It is to be expected that quantum computers will employ error correction schemes as well. However, due to the continuous nature of quantum information, it might seem difficult to apply the ideas of classical error correction to quantum computers. However, Shor (1995) and Steane (1996) both found algorithms which correct errors by moving the errors from the quantum register to ancilla systems. In these procedures, a logical qubit is encoded in a number of qubits such that the two-dimensional Hilbert space of a single qubit is embedded in a higher-dimensional space. Errors will then rotate the state vector out of the allowed subspace. Generalized measurements can project the system back to the allowed subspace and in case of small errors the original state is recovered. Quantum error codes were implemented in NMR for the first time (Cory et al., 1998, Knill et al., 2001a). Using trapped ions, Chiaverini et al. (2004) implemented a rudimentary quantum error correction protocol. In these experiments, the authors encoded the (arbitrary) state of a source qubit in a superposition of two distinct three-qubit states (the primary qubit + two ancilla qubits), introduced controlled errors (spin flips only) on all three of them, before they decoded the state with the inverse operation used to encode the primary qubit. Small errors occurring on the encoded state rotated the state such that after decoding, the error could be corrected for. Read-out of the ancilla qubits provided the error syndrome, based on which the primary ion was returned in its original state. Using the language of quantum error correction, the stabilizer code { Z Z X , Z X Z } (for an introduction to stabilizer codes see for instance Refs. Gottesman (1997) and Nielsen and Chuang (2000)) was employed in these experiments. This encoding procedure was conveniently implemented by an entangling operation similarly to the ones discussed in Section 2.6.4 and used in Section 4.2. However, in this particular instance, the three ions were placed in the standing wave such that they experienced the phases { \u03c6 , \u03c6 + 2 / 3 \u03c0 , \u03c6 + 4 / 3 \u03c0 } in the lattice. In this symmetric configuration, the ions felt no force if they were all in the same state. In all other logical basis states the total averaged force had the same absolute value and thus the same phase was acquired. Most notably, the heart of the algorithm (encoding and decoding) was executed only with global qubit operations, i.e. without individual addressing. Only for the preparation of the primary qubit, was individual addressing necessary and for detecting the error syndrome, selective state read-out was used. The NIST-group studied the performance of the error correction for the three different input states { | \u2193 \u3009 , 0.10 | \u2191 \u3009 \u2212 i 0.90 | \u2193 \u3009 , 0.22 | \u2191 \u3009 \u2212 i 0.78 | \u2193 \u3009 } for artificial error angles \u03b8 e applied to all qubits simultaneously while the qubit was protected by the encoding. Technical imperfections led to a fidelity of about 0.8 even if no error was applied. Therefore the NIST group compared results where the error syndrome was used to results where the correction pulses were not used to correct the primary qubit. For the measurement eigenstate | \u2193 \u3009 and error angles \u03b8 e < \u03c0 / 2 , the fidelity stayed close to 0.8, whereas in the uncorrected case, the fidelity dropped to 0.5. For the two other superposition states, a clear improvement over the uncorrected implementation was also found. One of the biggest challenges in quantum information processing will be to improve the fidelity of an error correction algorithm such that it is below a fault-tolerant threshold. Furthermore, the qubit should never be left unprotected. This implies that the error correction has to be applied directly on the encoded qubit. Finally, it will be necessary to apply the error correction repeatedly and to extend the algorithm to correct for spin flips as well as for phase flips. 5.4. Semiclassical quantum Fourier-transform The quantum Fourier transform is the final step in Shor\u2019s algorithm to factor large integers. It is designed to find the periodicity of a quantum state (Shor, 1994, Coppersmith, 1994, Ekert and Jozsa, 1996, Nielsen and Chuang, 2000). Nielsen and Chuang (2000) show that the quantum Fourier transformation transforms an N -qubit register in binary notation according to ( k i \u2208 { 0 , 1 } ) (30) | k N k N \u2212 1 \u22ef k 2 k 1 \u3009 \u27f6 [ ( | 0 \u3009 + e 2 \u03c0 i [ 0 . k 1 ] | 1 \u3009 ) \u2297 ( | 0 \u3009 + e 2 \u03c0 i [ 0 . k 2 k 1 ] | 1 \u3009 ) \u2297 \u22ef \u2297 ( | 0 \u3009 + e 2 \u03c0 i [ 0 . k N \u2212 1 \u22ef k 2 k 1 ] | 1 \u3009 ) \u2297 ( | 0 \u3009 + e 2 \u03c0 i [ 0 . k N k N \u2212 1 \u22ef k 2 k 1 ] | 1 \u3009 ) ] / 2 N . Here [ 0 . k N k N \u2212 1 \u22ef k 2 k 1 ] stands for k N / 2 + k N \u2212 1 / 4 + \u22ef + k 2 / 2 N \u2212 1 + k 1 / 2 N . Each qubit is rotated by R C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u2212 \u03c0 / 2 ) and has acquired a phase shift conditional on other qubits. If the quantum Fourier-transform is the last step in a quantum algorithm, one can take advantage of this structure and perform the semiclassical quantum Fourier-transform (Griffiths and Niu, 1996). Starting with the first qubit k i = 1 , first an R i C ( \u03c0 / 2 , \u2212 \u03c0 / 2 ) pulse is applied to qubit k i . Then qubit k i is measured and conditioned on the result exp ( i \u03c0 \u03c3 z / 2 ( j \u2212 i + 1 ) ) rotations are carried out on qubits k j for all j > i . Note that a z  rotation directly preceding a measurement does not change the measurement result, such that the last z  rotation before a measurement can be omitted. This procedure is then repeated for the next qubit i with i increased by one. Chiaverini et al. (2005b) implemented this procedure and tested it on a variety of separable and entangled three-qubit states. The implementation used a segmented trap, such that the state of one ion could be measured without destroying the quantum state of the others. In this way, one after the other ion was measured and appropriate single-qubit operations were carried out conditioned on the measurement result. Four states ( | 001 \u3009 + | 010 \u3009 + \u22ef + | 111 \u3009 , | 001 \u3009 + | 011 \u3009 + | 101 \u3009 + | 111 \u3009 , | 011 \u3009 + | 111 \u3009 , | 111 \u3009 ) representing all the possible periods one, two, four and eight, respectively, of three bits were successfully tested. In addition, the entangled state a 001 | 001 \u3009 + a 011 | 011 \u3009 + a 100 | 100 \u3009 + a 110 | 110 \u3009 ( | a i | = | a j | ) with approximate period three was investigated. This state has the particular property that the result depends on the relative phases of the coefficients a i which was confirmed in the experiments, too. 5.5. Entanglement purification High fidelity entanglement can be obtained from multiple entangled states of lower fidelity by a procedure called entanglement purification. In the context of fault-tolerant quantum computing, entanglement purification can alleviate thus the stringent requirements for quantum communication (Bennett et al., 1996, Gottesman and Chuang, 1999): first many entangled states of a relatively moderate fidelity are created and shared between the two communicating parties. Next, each party carries out local high fidelity quantum operations and measurements before it communicates the measurement results to the other party (see Fig. 35). Based on this, the parties can decide when the entanglement purification was successful and which states to keep for further use. This shared entanglement can be employed to perform a high fidelity state transfer between the two nodes via quantum teleportation (see Section 5.2). In this way, two quantum nodes can be linked with high fidelity even if the direct transfer of quantum information between them limits the fidelity of Bell pairs to just above 0.5. Together with quantum teleportation, this Bell state can be used for a high fidelity state transfer (see Section 5.2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 35. Schematics of a high-fidelity transfer of quantum information over a noisy quantum channel. First, a number of entangled states of moderate fidelity (>0.5) is shared by both parties (quantum nodes). Next, local operations and measurements are used to create a single Bell state with high fidelity. Finally, this qubit pair is used to teleport quantum information from one node to the other. Reichle et al. (2006b) demonstrated the entanglement purification procedure by purifying a two-atom Bell state out of two pairs of Bell states. First, the NIST-group used the geometric phase gate (see Section 2.6.4) to entangle four ions pairwise in a single step. To achieve this, the ions were placed such that ions #1 and #2 as well as ions #3 and #4 were spaced each by multiples of the standing wave ( \u0394 x = n \u03bb ), while between ions #2 and #3 was a distance of ( n \u00b1 1 / 4 ) \u03bb (see Fig. 36). In this way, the interaction between the two pairs vanished while within each pair the ions were entangled (ion #1 and #2 on one side and #3 and #4 on the other side). To implement the purifying procedure, a controlled-NOT operation has to be implemented on each quantum node, ion #1 and #3 on one side and ion #2 and #4 on the other side. For this, the axial confinement was changed such that there was a distance of n \u03bb between ions #1 and #3 as well as between ions #2 and #4, while the distance was ( n \u00b1 1 / 4 ) \u03bb between ions belonging to different nodes. Thus another geometric phase gate executed two (local) phase-gate operations simultaneously. Measuring ion #1 and #2 (originally entangled with each other) in opposite states signaled success of the purification and the entanglement of the other entangled pair increased, while measuring them in the same state signaled failure of the protocol. In order to verify the entanglement between ions #3 and #4, the NIST group split these ions off from the other two ions prior to the measurement, such that the measurement did not destroy their coherence. In this way, a Bell state with a fidelity of 0.629 \u00b1 0.0015 was obtained starting from two states of the form \u03b1 | \u2191 \u2191 \u3009 + \u03b2 | \u2193 \u2193 \u3009 with a Bell-state fidelity of 0.614 \u00b1 0.0015 .

Panel (a) shows the situation for entangling ion #1 and #2 on one side and for entangling ion #3 and #4 on the other side. The situation to carry out the two phase gates between ion #1 and #3 and between ion #2 and #4 is illustrated in panel (b). 5.6. Quantum simulations Quantum simulations appear to be very appealing and especially feasible applications of quantum computers. The idea was first put forward by Feynman (1982) and can be actually thought of as the birth of the field of quantum information processing. Later Lloyd verified this suggestion (Lloyd, 1996) and together with Braunstein showed how a quantum system with continuous variables can be simulated efficiently (Lloyd and Braunstein, 1999). Quantum simulations appear so attractive because they require only the interactions which are present in the system to be simulated. In addition, often only moderate manipulation fidelities are necessary to obtain meaningful results. Leibfried et al. (2002) show that the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle in an arbitrary potential can be efficiently simulated with a single trapped ion. In the same publication, the NIST-group simulates the action of an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and thus a first quantum simulation with a single ion. In this work, a beam splitter is implemented in the following way: the electronic state of the ion represents the number of photons in one of the incoming modes,2 while the motional state of the ion describes the state of one of the output modes. An R + ( \u03c0 / 2 , 0 ) pulse on the blue sideband can transfer photons from one mode to the other and thus implements the beam splitter. Thus, a sequence of two R + ( \u03c0 / 2 ) -pulses on the blue sideband, resembles the action of two beam splitters of a Mach-Zender interferometer. Furthermore, using second and third order sideband pulses (detuning \u0394 = n \u03c9 t , n = { 2 , 3 } ) a non-linear interferometer can be implemented where one photon in one mode can generate two and more photons in the other mode. This process is equivalent to parametric down conversion \u2014 a quite important process in quantum information science with photons (Tittel and Weihs, 2001). In the experiments, first a single 9Be+-ion was cooled to the motional ground state. Next, a \u03c0 / 2 -sideband pulse of order n = 1 , 2 , 3 was applied on the axial motional sideband to create the state ( | \u2193 , 0 \u3009 + | \u2191 , n + 1 \u3009 ) / 2 . Then a change in trap frequency induced a phase shift between the two eigenstates. Finally, the phase shift was analyzed with another \u03c0 / 2 -sideband pulse of order n . The phase shift acquired between the two \u03c0 / 2 pulses is proportional to the energy separation. Thus, the fringes are more sensitive to the trap frequency change for larger n . This demonstrates the enhanced sensitivity of a non-linear interferometer as compared with a linear one. Quantum simulations with trapped ions have also been investigated in the context of quantum phase transitions. Porras and Cirac (2004) propose that each ion in the crystal represents a spin. Irradiating the string, for example, with off-resonant laser radiation produces in each ion a differential level shift which can be interpreted as a magnetic field acting on the spins. Interaction between the spins, i.e. an effective spin\u2013spin interaction, can be simulated by coupling the ions to a collective vibrational mode. Thus, a wide class of Hamiltonians can be investigated efficiently. In particular, it should be possible to observe quantum phase transitions in ion traps. A first step in this direction has already been taken by the Max Planck group in Garching by simulating the phase transition of a tiny quantum magnet consisting of two 25 Mg + ions from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic order (Schaetz et al., 2004, Friedenauer et al., 2008). The spin\u2013spin interaction was realized by the same laser-ion coupling used in geometric phase gates (see Section 2.6.4) while the action of a magnetic field in the x direction was simulated by driving local spin-flips between the hyperfine states of the ions with an RF field of frequency \u03c9 qubit . The ground state of an ion with a magnetic field in x direction is given by | \u2192 \u3009 = ( | \u2191 \u3009 + e i \u03c9 qubit t | \u2193 \u3009 ) / 2 . Tuning the ratio of the two simultaneously applied Hamiltonians adiabatically, the ground state | \u2192 \u2192 \u3009 of the parametric phase was transferred to the ground state | ( \u2191 \u2191 + \u2193 \u2193 ) / 2 \u3009 of the ferromagnetic phase with a fidelity of 0.88. 6. Shuttling and sympathetic cooling of ions Shuttling ions between various traps might relieve the requirements for scalable ion trap quantum computing considerably (Wineland et al., 1998, Kielpinski et al., 2002). In accelerator experiments, shuttling of ions between different traps and re-cooling has been long established to slow down fast ions efficiently (Herfurth et al., 2001). Also single ions have been transported reliably between Penning traps (H\u00e4ffner et al., 2000). However, for ion trap quantum computing, the requirements are more stringent: in particular, ion strings have to be separated, moved through junctions, recombined and the quantum information must be preserved during all these operations. In this context, Rowe et al. (2002) demonstrated the reliable transport of single 9Be+-ions over 1.2 mm within tens of microseconds in a segmented ion trap. Moreover, they showed that the coherence of the hyperfine qubit was not affected by the transport. For this they first transfer the ion in a superposition with a \u03c0 / 2 -pulse, transported the ion and tested for the coherence. A contrast of 95.8 % \u00b1 0.8 % limited by magnetic field fluctuations was measured. In a second set of experiments, the NIST-group used a spin echo sequence to reduce the influence of magnetic field fluctuations. Here, the ion (put again in a superposition of physical eigenstates with \u03c0 / 2 pulses) was transported back and forth. A spin-echo \u03c0 pulse was applied in the remote trap. The contrast of this measurement, as well as of a control experiment without transport was almost 97%, limited by imperfections of the Raman pulses and off-resonant scattering from the P-level. These results demonstrated that the transport did not affect the coherence of the quantum state. Furthermore, Rowe et al. (2002) investigated motional heating for various transport speeds. For this, the voltages on the trap electrodes were changed such that the trap minimum moved with time along a sin 2 function. This ensures that not only the velocity but also the acceleration varies smoothly with time. They found that the ions can be transported between the two traps within 54 \u03bcs with hardly any observable motional heating (axial trap frequency 2.9 MHz, heating \u2272 0.01 quanta/transport). Only for shorter transporting times heating of the ion motion was observed in agreement with a classical simulation. In addition, Rowe et al. (2002) demonstrate splitting of ion strings. However, their electrode structure was not optimized for this task as the size of the separation electrodes was too large. Therefore, only success rates of 95% were achieved as well as relatively long separation times of about 10 ms were required. Furthermore, the ions heated excessively by 140 \u00b1 70  quanta due to the fact that during the separation the ion oscillation frequency was quite small. Later the NIST group demonstrated that these problems can be overcome (Barrett et al., 2004) (c.f. Section 5.2). Separation times of a few 100 \u03bcs as well as small motional heating have been achieved in these experiments. In particular, after splitting one ion from a three ion crystal, the stretch mode of the remaining two-ion crystal was still in the ground state, while the center-of-mass mode had acquired one motional quantum. A theoretical study of the splitting process and the required electrode structures can be found in Ref. Home and Steane (2006). Another requirement for the proposal by Kielpinski et al. (2002) is the transport through junctions. First experiments were carried out by Pearson et al. (2006) and Hensinger et al. (2006). In the former experiment, charged nano-particles were transported through a four-way crossing of a planar segmented trap. In the latter, Cd+ ions were moved through a T-junction. Recently, the linear transport of ions was studied within the framework of quantum mechanics (Reichle et al., 2006a), while the non-adiabatic transport was investigated theoretically by Schulz et al. (2006) and experimentally by Huber et al. (2008). Finally, Hucul et al. (2008) analyzed the transport through various junction geometries (including T junctions) quantum mechanically. After transport, the ion strings might have to be re-cooled such that the subsequent operations can be carried out with high fidelity. In order to achieve this while maintaining coherence, a viable way seems to use the strong Coulomb coupling and to cool only a part of or even only one ion of an ion string. Such sympathetic cooling was demonstrated in various experiments (Drullinger et al., 1980, Larson et al., 1986, Rohde et al., 2001, Hornekaer et al., 2001). Furthermore, it has been established in various contexts ranging from precision measurements (Roth et al., 2005) to electron cooling in accelerators (Meshkov, 1997). Within the context of quantum information, Rohde et al. (2001) cooled a two ion string to the motional ground state as required for many two-qubit proposals. However, in these experiments two ions of the same species were used. As, typically, one of the qubit levels takes part in the cooling process, it is important to shield other nearby ions from the radiation to maintain the coherence of the qubits during the cooling process. This is very difficult if only one ion species is employed. Blinov et al. (2002) cool a 112Cd+ ion via Doppler cooling of 114Cd+. Isotope shift would help to preserve the coherence, however, it might be better to use a completely different ion species as done in the early experiments by the NIST group. Barrett et al. (2003) cooled Be+ with Mg+ to the motional ground state (vice versa only to the Doppler limit) and in separate measurements showed that even on time scales of 30 ms a qubit encoded in the hyperfine manifold of 9Be+ is not affected by the strong cooling light for Mg+. Finally, Schmidt et al. (2005) took the idea one step further and cooled and detected the internal state of Al+ via Be+. While all prerequisites for quantum computing by shuttling ion strings have now been demonstrated in separate experiments, a combination of shuttling ions, splitting and re-cooling the ion strings in the same experiment and at the same time preserving the quantum information has yet to be accomplished. 7. New trap developments Parallel with the efforts to shuttle and split ion strings, in particular the NIST group has put quite some effort into developing new traps manufactured by microfabrication techniques to build a medium sized quantum computer. Microfabrication techniques allow for complicated and precise electrode structures. Trap sizes (measured as the distance between two RF electrodes) range from about 200 \u03bcm down to a few tens of \u03bcm. While in the beginning mainly three-dimensional designs were built using two substrates, recently a new, planar trap design was invented by Chiaverini et al. (2005a). In such traps, the electrodes are arranged all in a plane such that a single substrate suffices to mount the electrodes. Typically there are five (four) electrode groups in such a linear surface trap (see Fig. 37): on the center electrode, ground or a small DC potential is applied. The two neighboring electrodes receive an RF potential which provides the radial confinement. The outer electrodes are often structured and various DC potentials provide the axial confinement. The ions are trapped in the center of the field lines in Fig. 37b where the RF field vanishes. The asymmetry of the RF electrodes tilts the principle axes of the quadrupole field such that a laser beam traveling parallel with the trap surface has a projection along both radial motional degrees of freedom and all modes can be cooled satisfactory. Two trap designs were successfully used by the NIST group, one based on gold on a quartz substrate (Seidelin et al., 2006) and the other one based solely on silicon (Britton et al., 2006). Ions have been trapped as close as 40 \u03bcm to the surface with still reasonable heating rates of a few phonons/ms (Seidelin et al., 2006, Epstein et al., 2007). The MIT group developed a trap based on printed circuit board fabrication techniques (Pearson et al., 2006). They also built traps using silver on a quartz substrate (Labaziewicz et al., 2008a). For trap sizes between 75 \u03bcm and 150 \u03bcm(ion-substrate distance), heating rates between 2 and 20 phonons/s were measured at 4 K (see Section 3.2).

Future challenges and prospects for ion trap quantum computing In order to achieve universal quantum computing, the algorithms have to be implemented in a fault-tolerant way. It is commonly accepted that this requires quantum error correction. Therefore, currently one of the most important goals is to implement quantum error correction repeatedly with high fidelity to prolong coherence times and to correct for errors induced by the gate operations. The largest obstacle to perform a successful quantum error correction protocol seems to be the limited fidelity of the operations. The current state of the art for the control in ion trap quantum computing can be summarized as follows: \u2022 The qubit coherence times are one or two orders of magnitude longer than the basic (gate) operations. In specific cases, coherence times longer by more than five orders of magnitude the gate time are available (see Section 3.1.2). In most current experiments, motional decoherence is not a problem. In addition, it can be further suppressed with cooling of the trap electrodes (see Section 3.2). \u2022 Initialization accuracies are on the order of 0.999 as discussed in Section 2.4. Most likely, they can be improved further if necessary. \u2022 Single qubit operation can be carried out with fidelities exceeding 0.995 (Knill et al., 2008). If required, further improvements are possible with more stable laser fields at the ion positions. \u2022 Implementations of two-qubit gate operations achieve fidelities of about 0.9\u20130.99. Depending on the gate type, various sources limit the fidelity. Errors are caused by off-resonant scattering, imperfect addressing of individual qubits, insufficient cooling, laser frequency and intensity noise. \u2022 The read-out of a single qubit can be performed with a fidelity of 0.999. Further improvements seem possible (see Section 2.4). \u2022 Ion strings can be shuttled, split and merged (see Section 6) with high fidelity and small decoherence. Currently, two-qubit gate operations seem to be the main limiting factor and receive therefore most attention both from experimenters and theoreticians. Fig. 38 shows the progress of the fidelity achieved in the last decade. Most notably Benhelm et al. (2008b) demonstrate two-qubit gate fidelities high enough to allow in principle fault tolerant quantum computation according to the scheme proposed by Knill (2005). In addition, one must always keep in mind that all these requirements have to be met at the same time. Furthermore, some emphasis should be given to parallel processing quantum information (Steane, 2004). However, initialization of the necessary ancillas, read-out, coherence times and the particular layout and the attainable degree of parallelization are important. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 38. Progress in reducing the error rate of two-qubit gates (taken from Ref. Benhelm (2008)) and in increasing the number of entangled ions. Open circles represent experiments using two-qubit gate operations with global addressing while diamonds show results based on individual addressing. The performance is measured in terms of the infidelity of produced Bell states. Stars mark the largest number of entangled ions obtained at that time. Numbers below the reference indicate the number of trap cycles required for the operation. Dashed and dotted lines indicate the trends. Both analytical and numerical results indicate that operational fidelities on the order of 0.9999/operation seem to be sufficient to achieve fault tolerance (the so-called fault-tolerant threshold), provided certain other criteria can be met, too (Steane, 2004): specific errors, error propagation, the allowed overhead, specific requirements, the amount of possible parallelization, amongst others have to be considered to get a full grasp on the situation at hand. Thus the concept of thresholds is oversimplifying the situation. For instance, Knill (2005) published numerical results which indicate that even error rates on the order of 1 0 \u2212 2 are permitted, however with a huge overhead of 106 physical qubits for one logical qubit. It seems reasonable that every operation in a quantum computer should be treated with the same meticulous attention and be implemented as perfect as possible to achieve fault tolerance while keeping the overhead as small as possible. Interestingly, state transfer between interconnected ion trap quantum computers at the fault-tolerant level is not necessary as discussed in Section 5.5 (Gottesman and Chuang, 1999, Reichle et al., 2006b): quantum information can be teleported deterministically between two locations using a purified entangled Bell-state. Entanglement between distant ions can, for example, be generated by splitting an entangled two-ion string and transporting one of the ions or by interfering fluorescence light from two ions on a beam splitter as demonstrated already by Maunz et al. (2007), Moehring et al. (2007) and Matsukevich et al. (2008). Another important issue is the speed of the operations. Having in mind universal quantum computing to outperform classical computers, e.g. in factoring large integers, billions of operations have to be carried out. Thus, the current typical time scales for the basic operations of a few hundreds of \u03bcs seem simply too slow for factoring large numbers even if the operations are carried out to a large extent in parallel. There exist proposals for gate operations which are faster than the trapping frequencies (Garc\u00eda-Ripoll et al., 2003, Garc\u00eda-Ripoll et al., 2005, Zhu et al., 2006), however, there are other bottlenecks such as read-out and ion string separation which might slow down the processor speed. From this perspective, it seems attractive to work on hybrid devices where e.g. quantum information is stored in trapped ions (incl. error correction) and most of the processing is implemented e.g. with Josephson junctions (Makhlin et al., 2001, Steffen et al., 2006, Plantenberg et al., 2007) which operate at speeds roughly three orders of magnitude faster than current ion trapping approaches. Before this can happen, however, tremendous difficulties have to be solved in transferring quantum information between the two systems within the short coherence times of the Josephson junction qubits. Currently, there exist a few proposals to couple ion-trap and Josephson junction qubits (Tian et al., 2004, Tian et al., 2005, S\u00f8rensen et al., 2004), but so far almost no experimental results were achievable. Furthermore, within the field of Josephson junction quantum information processing, there are some open challenges before advantage can be taken of the speed of this system. The biggest of these seems to be that coherence times of only a few \u03bcs have been achieved so far. The original proposal of Cirac and Zoller (1995) is scalable in the sense that it does not require exponentially many resources with an increasing number of qubits. Indeed, Fig. 38 shows that in the last decade larger and larger ion strings have been entangled. However, it seems impractical to construct a device for a large number of qubits by trapping all ions in the same trap because it gets more and more difficult to obtain the required strong radial confinements to work with linear ion strings at reasonably high axial trapping frequencies. Furthermore, the mode structure of the ion crystal gets more complicated with more ions as well as the speed of the sideband operations is reduced with the larger mass of the crystal. Up to date, there is a couple of routes known which potentially ease these technological challenges. Almost all of them are based on distributing the ions across different traps and to interconnect these traps via photons (Cirac et al., 1997), superconducting strip lines (Tian et al., 2004, Heinzen and Wineland, 1990) or even via auxiliary ions (Cirac and Zoller, 2000). The currently most advanced procedure, however, is to merge and shuttle small ion strings in segmented traps (Wineland et al., 1998, Kielpinski et al., 2002). Those ideas have been studied in detail and seem to offer a practicable and viable way to scale ion trap quantum computers. Currently, large efforts are under way in realizing this architecture (c.f. Section 6). Major challenges are the fabrication of such complex small ion traps combining high flexibility of ion movement (junctions), low motional heating rates and high trap frequencies. It is also strongly desirable to integrate the control electronics and optics on such ion trap devices. In summary, the basic requirements for a general purpose quantum computing device with trapped ions have been demonstrated and no fundamental road block is in sight. However, building such a device is extremely challenging. Especially, the stringent requirements for fault tolerance and for scalability to many thousands of qubits pose huge difficulties. However, reaching a good control over a reasonable number of qubits seems feasible in the next decade and might be of quite some interest: already with about forty qubits, physical systems can be simulated which are intractable with current computing technology. It remains to be seen whether and how the dream of universal quantum computing can be implemented with trapped ions.

We present a new computational model, which differs from a QC only in that the result of a measurement is the expectation value of the observable, rather than a random eigenvalue thereof. Such an expectation value QC can solve nondeterministic polynomial-time complete problems in polynomial time. This observation is significant precisely because the computational model can be realized, to a certain extent, by NMR spectroscopy on macroscopic ensembles of quantum spins, namely molecules in a test tube. This is made possible by identifying a manifold of statistical spin states, called pseudo-pure states, the mathematical description of which is isomorphic to that of an isolated spin system. The result is a novel NMR computer that can be programmed much like a QC, but in other respects more closely resembles a DNA computer. Most notably, when applied to intractable combinatorial problems, an NMR computer can use an amount of sample, rather than time, which grows exponentially with the size of the problem. Although NMR computers will be limited by current technology to exhaustive searches over only 15 to 20 bits, searches over as much as 50 bits are in principle possible, and more advanced algorithms could greatly extend the range of applicability of such machines.

MANAGE ALERTS Several physical implementations of computational models other than the standard von Neumann model have recently been proposed, which in principle scale better on certain types of computational problems. Most notably, Adleman (1) has solved a traveling salesman problem by DNA computing, and Shor (2) has shown theoretically that a quantum computer (QC) should be able to factorize integers in polynomial time. Nondeterministic polynomial-time complete (NP-complete) problems are a class of computationally intractable problems of particular interest, both because they are \u201cpolynomially equivalent\u201d to one another and because they are encountered in many important applications (3\u20135). The traveling salesman problem includes a set of NP-complete instances, which indicates that DNA computing may someday be useful in solving NP-complete problems. In contrast, it is widely believed that a QC cannot solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time (6). Until now, however, only very small problems have been solved by DNA computing (7), and no one has yet succeeded in building a QC able to handle more than two bits of information (8\u201310). In this paper, we consider another physical mechanism that is capable of computation, namely NMR spectroscopy. This approach is based on the fact that the spins in each molecule of a liquid sample are largely isolated from the spins in all other molecules. As a result, each molecule is effectively an independent QC. Via radio-frequency electromagnetic pulses, it is straightforward to manipulate each of the spins in every molecule identically across the sample, as in a synchronous, single-instruction parallel machine. Similarly, what one observes in an NMR spectrum is the sum of certain observables over all the molecules in the sample, which is proportional to the ensemble average expectation value of the observable. Thus, such a machine performs a calculation using quantum parallelism at the molecular level and then amplifies its results to the macroscopic level via a form of classical parallelism. We call a computer based on this principle an ensemble QC (EQC). Other researchers have proposed implementing an atomic-scale QC by NMR and analogous physical mechanisms (e.g., refs. 8\u201311). The reason a macroscopic version has not previously been pursued lies in the fact that the magnetic moments of the individual spins are very small, so that even with superconducting magnets, it is not possible to perfectly align the spins at temperatures above \u22481 mK. This in turn makes it impossible to prepare a liquid sample in a pure state, in which the spin states of all the molecules are identical. We have solved this problem by introducing a new concept into NMR spectroscopy, called pseudo-pure states, the behavior of which is similar in many respects to a pure state. In particular, they can be described by a type of spinor, which evolves via unitary transformations under the Hamiltonians of NMR and whose expectation values are easily obtained from the corresponding ensemble-average expectation values. We call these spinors pseudo-spinors, to emphasize the fact that their physical interpretation differs from that of the spinors that describe isolated spin systems. Such an NMR computer can be programmed electronically much like a QC, but it can be implemented using macroscopic liquid samples at room temperature and pressure like a DNA computer. In principle, it can also trade an exponential increase in the amount of time required to solve intractable combinatorial problems, including NP-complete problems, for an exponential increase in the size (physical dimensions) of the sample on which it operates. Preliminary experiments that validate this novel approach to computing have already been performed (12). Although scaling it to problems beyond the reach of conventional computers promises to be very difficult, the theoretical implications of such a machine are intriguing, and its general principles may prove more broadly applicable. Because these principles are derived from several very different fields, an elementary exposition is needed to provide a common knowledge base for future interdisciplinary research. That is the purpose of the present paper. Quantum Computing and Exponential State Spaces Because of its importance in what follows, we begin with a brief account of how a QC works; more detailed accounts may be found in refs. 10, 11, 13, and 14. A distinctive property of multiparticle quantum systems is that the dimensionality of their state space grows exponentially with the number of particles (15). This is because the Hilbert space for a system of distinguishable particles must be taken as the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of the individual particles, to model the correlations among them. In particular, if one considers the spin dynamics of a system of n spin 1/2 particles, the Hilbert spaces of which are all of dimension two, the dimension of the Hilbert space of the combined system is 2n. It is for this reason that many researchers have proposed constructing a QC from a system of spin particles, for example, in an ion trap (16). The vectors (or \u201cwave functions\u201d) in the Hilbert space of a system of spins are called spinors. The standard basis consists of the joint eigenvectors of the total and z-component of the spin angular momentum. The encoding used in quantum computing maps each integer k in the range [0, 2n \u2212 1] to the kth basis element versus a particular ordering of the basis. For a single spin 1/2 particle, the basis consists of the spin \u201cdown\u201d (antiparallel to the z-axis) state, which is represented by the vector [1, 0] and is denoted by the \u201cbra\u201d \u23290|, together with the spin \u201cup\u201d state, which is represented by the vector [0, 1] and is denoted as \u23291|; the corresponding column vectors are denoted by the \u201ckets\u201d |0\u232a and |1\u232a, respectively. The basis vectors of an n-spin system are formed by taking the tensor or Kronecker products of the basis vectors of its constituent spins in some arbitrary but fixed order. The general definition of the Kronecker product \u2297 of an M \u00d7 N matrix A with an M\u2032 \u00d7 N\u2032 matrix B is the matrix MM\u2032 \u00d7 NN\u2032 given by: Undefined control sequence \\enskip Undefined control sequence \\enskip Undefined control sequence \\enskip Undefined control sequence \\enskip [1] Thus the basis vectors of a two-spin system are given by: Undefined control sequence \\enskip Undefined control sequence \\enskip Undefined control sequence \\enskip Undefined control sequence \\enskip [2] In a QC, any logical operation on a register in the basis state |k\u232a must transform it to another basis state |l\u232a. Because energy dissipation rapidly destroys microscopic order and hence the ability to store information, a QC must be essentially completely isolated from its surroundings. Isolated quantum systems naturally evolve by unitary transformations, which are necessarily reversible. This prevents one from implementing conventional logic gates, such as the AND gate. Fortunately, any gate can be made reversible by copying some of the input bits to the output bits. For example, the quantum XOR gate, which copies the first input bit and overwrites the second bit with its output, has the truth table shown on the left in Eq. 3. Undefined control sequence \\enskip Undefined control sequence \\enskip [3] The unitary matrix for the quantum XOR gate is shown on the right. A nontrivial complex linear combination of the basis vectors is called a coherent superposition. Because unitary transformations are linear, the result of operating on a superposition is the same superposition of the results of the transformation applied to the individual basis states. In this sense, a QC can operate in parallel on exponentially many basis states at once. There are, however, serious problems with this approach. The first is that it promises to be very difficult to build a QC of any significant size, because it requires the precise assembly, isolation, control, and measurement of atomic-scale systems. A more fundamental problem lies in the fact that the amount of information that can be extracted from even perfectly precise measurements on quantum systems is extremely limited, because the act of observation irreversibly alters the system. For example, if one places a two-spin system in the superposition c 0 | 00 \u27e9 + c 1 | 01 \u27e9 + c 2 | 10 \u27e9 + c 3 | 11 \u27e9 = [ c 0 \u2217 c 1 \u2217 c 2 \u2217 c 3 \u2217 ] \u2020 , [4] where * denotes the complex conjugate and \u2020 denotes the Hermitian transpose, and measures the z-component of the spins, one will observe one of the four basis states k = 0,\u2009\u2026\u2009, 3, each with probability |ck|2 = ckck*. The system is forced into the observed state by the act of observation, and all subsequent measurements of the same observable will therefore yield the same result. This phenomenon is sometimes called wave function collapse. Thus, it is not possible to completely determine the state of the system (i.e., the coefficients ck) from a finite number of measurements on identically prepared copies of a given quantum system. The Expectation Value QC (EVQC) Let us imagine an abstract computer that functions like a quantum computer in every respect but one: instead of a random eigenvalue, the result of a measurement of an observable on the system is the expectation value of that observable. This computational model further assumes that the expectation value can be measured to arbitrarily high precision, and in an amount of time proportional to the number of digits in the result. We shall call our abstract computer an EVQC. The following result serves as the motivation for much of the rest of this paper: an EVQC is capable of solving NP-complete problems in polynomial time. We shall prove this by showing that an EVQC can solve a well known NP-complete problem, namely the satisfiability (SAT) problem (5), in linear time. In this problem, one is given a Boolean function f: {0, 1}n \u2192 {0, 1} in conjunctive normal form. This is a logical conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of Boolean variables or their negations. The variables are assigned values from the set {0, 1}, and such an assignment is said to satisfy f if the value of f on the assignment is 1. The SAT problem is then to determine if there exists a satisfying assignment for the function f. If the state w of the system is given by the ket |w\u232a versus a fixed basis, and K is the Hermitian matrix that represents some observable K versus the same basis, elementary quantum mechanics tells us that the expectation value of K is the value of the quadratic form \u2329w|K|w\u232a. Given a system of n + 1 spin 1/2 particles, we may represent each assignment x \u2208 {0, 1}n, together with the state of the (n + 1)th output bit y \u2208 {0, 1}, by an elementary basis vector |x, y\u232a in a Hilbert space of dimension 2n+1. Using results from quantum computing (13), it is possible to convert the Boolean operations in f into a sequence of unitary transformations, the product of which, Uf, applied to any single basis state |x, 0\u232a, yields Uf|x, 0\u232a = |x, f(x)\u232a. If we now prepare the input in the superposition of all its possible states given by \u2211x\u2208{0,1}n\u2009c(x,0)|x, 0\u232a, where c(x,0) = 2\u2212n/2 and c(x,1) = 0 for all x, then the result of performing the computation on this superposition is U f \u2211 x \u2208 { 0 , 1 } n c ( x , 0 ) | x , 0 \u27e9 = \u2211 x \u2208 { 0 , 1 } n c ( x , 0 ) | x , f ( x ) \u27e9 \u2261 \u2211 x \u2208 { 0 , 1 } n d ( x , f ( x ) ) | x , f ( x ) \u27e9 \u2261 z f . [5] There exists an observable S, with Hermitian matrix S, such that the expectation value of S is \u2329zf|S|zf\u232a = 2\u2212n|{x \u2208 {0, 1}n|f(x) = 1}|\u2014i.e., 2\u2212n times the number of satisfying assignments. If the basis states |x, y\u232a inherit the order of the integer for which each bit string (x, y) is the binary representation, then S is the diagonal matrix S = 1 \u2297 1 \u2297 \u22ef \u2297 1 \u2297 | 1 \u27e9 \u27e8 1 | = Diag ( 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , \u22ef , 0 , 1 ) , [6] where 1 is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix and Diag is the diagonal matrix of its arguments. Since \u2329zf|S|zf\u232a = \u2211x\u2208{0,1}n|d(x,1)|2 where each nonzero output coefficient d(x,1) = c(x,0) = 2\u2212n/2, the expectation value of S is the fraction of all assignments that satisfy the given function f, as claimed. The time required to program Uf, to prepare the superposition, and (in our computational model) to measure the expectation value of S to the requisite precision of 2\u2212n, are all O(n), thus showing that an EVQC can solve SAT in linear time. Because all NP-complete problems are polynomially reducible to SAT by Cook\u2019s theorem (3), this proves that an EVQC can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. Since our EVQC essentially counts the number of satisfying assignments, we have further shown that it is capable of solving #P-complete problems in polynomial time (5). It should be noted that the operator S \u2261 Sn+1, the expectation value of which tells us the fraction of states in which the (n + 1)th spin is 1, can easily be altered to an operator Sk, the expectation value of which provides the same information about the kth spin. Thus given any computable function g: {0, 1}m \u2192 {0, 1}n and a unitary transformation Ug such that Ug|x, 0\u232a = |x, g(x)\u232a, we can find the value of g(x) on any single input state x \u2208 {0, 1}m by simply measuring the expectation values of the n operators Sm+1 through Sm+n. The implication is that any Turing computable function can be computed by an EVQC, and hence we can use implicit parallelism in any such computation by operating on a superposition. Ensemble Quantum Computing and NMR Spectroscopy An EVQC cannot be precisely realized by any finite physical system, but it can be approximated by an ensemble (large collection) of independent and identical QCs, over which one can measure the sum of the observable evaluated on each QC in the ensemble. Such an EQC performs a calculation using quantum parallelism and then uses a form of classical parallelism to estimate an expectation value. Although an EQC differs from a single QC in significant respects, it also depends on quantum parallelism in an essential way and cannot be equated with an ensemble of conventional computers. In particular, each QC in the ensemble operates on a superposition over all possible inputs, rather than different (or random) single inputs as in an ordinary massively parallel computer. Even more importantly, whereas conventional computers do not appear to occur naturally on the molecular scale, QCs do! In this section, we describe how this fact makes it possible to construct an EQC with \u22481023 QCs in it, using NMR spectroscopy. In the next section, we shall consider the physical limits on what such an NMR computer can do. All atomic nuclei with intrinsic spin behave like tiny magnets (17). Therefore, when they are placed in a magnetic field, their magnetic dipoles tend to align themselves parallel to the field. The Hamiltonian that gives the energy difference between the parallel and antiparallel states is called the Zeeman Hamiltonian. Even with superconducting magnets, this energy difference is very small compared with the thermal energy kBT. Hence when a macroscopic ensemble of identical spins is placed in a magnetic field, the net alignment of their magnetic moments with the field is likewise very small at room temperature. If one could reduce the temperature sufficiently close to absolute zero, however, near perfect alignments would be obtained. Under these conditions, all the spins are in the same quantum state, which is described by saying that the ensemble as a whole is in a pure state. In such a system, the magnetization of the sample is the sum of the magnetizations due to the individual spins. Each of the microscopic observations is a random variable, but when one takes the sum over a macroscopic number of observations, the result is a deterministic quantity equal to the expectation value of the observable times the number of spins. If all the spins in the ensemble were identical, we would only have a one-bit EQC. If all the spins were distinguishable, on the other hand, the result would be a massive QC, but without the ability to measure well defined expectation values. What is needed is a partition of the spins into distinguishable equivalence classes of indistinguishable spins. Fortunately, such a partitioning occurs very naturally in chemistry, where the spin-active nuclei in a molecule are distinguished by their electronic environments, but in a macroscopic sample of identical molecules, each type of spin is indistinguishable between molecules. A standard technique in NMR spectroscopy is to use pulses of radio-frequency radiation to transform the state of the spins by unitary transformations. Since the inequivalent spins in a molecule generally have distinct resonance frequencies, the frequency range of these pulses can be made selective for single spins. For example, a selective pulse that imparts sufficient energy to rotate the net magnetization of the kth spin by \u03c0/2 and is in-phase with the imaginary component of the carrier corresponds to the unitary matrix 1 \u2297 \u22ef \u2297 1 \u2297 U \u03c0 / 2 \u2297 1 \u2297 \u22ef \u2297 1 [7] Undefined control sequence \\enskip Undefined control sequence \\enskip where the matrix U\u03c0/2 occurs as the kth factor of the Kronecker product. For a two-spin system, we have the energy level diagram shown in Fig. 1. The four dashed double-headed arrows are the transitions allowed by the selection rules for angular momenta, and they connect pairs of states that differ by only single spin flips (i.e., pairs with a Hamming distance of 1). The spins are generally also coupled to one another, either by through-space dipole\u2013dipole interactions or by a through-bond effect called scalar coupling. This coupling causes the energy differences associated with the various transitions to be generically distinct. Tipping both spins into the xy-plane with a nonselective \u03c0/2 pulse U\u03c0/2 \u2297 U\u03c0/2 causes them to precess in phase, generating a detectable (macroscopic) rotating magnetic moment. The real part of the Fourier transform of the resulting signal gives an NMR spectrum with two pairs of peaks, as shown in Fig. 2. The intensity of each pair is proportional to the total population difference between states in which the corresponding spin is up and those in which it is down. Figure 1 The four energy levels associated with two spins \u03b1 and \u03b2, whose resonance frequencies are \u03bd\u03b1 and \u03bd\u03b2 (in Hz). The energy levels when there is no coupling between the spins are shown on the left, and those with a coupling of J\u03b1\u03b2 (in Hz) on the right. The allowed transitions between the energy levels are indicated with dashed double-headed arrows. Figure 2 The simulated NMR spectrum of a two-spin system, with \u03bd\u03b1 = 100 Hz, \u03bd\u03b2 = 400 Hz, and J\u03b1\u03b2 = 40 Hz. From left to right, the four peaks in this spectrum correspond to the transitions 0 \u2194 1, 2 \u2194 3, 0 \u2194 2, and 1 \u2194 3 indicated in Fig. 1 (be forewarned, however, that NMR spectroscopists traditionally plot their spectra with frequency increasing from right to left). In practice, this spectrum would be obtained by applying a nonselective \u03c0/2 pulse to the equilibrium state and Fourier transforming the resulting signal. The quantum XOR gate introduced above flips one of these spins, given that the other spin is up, which in turn corresponds to the transitions 1\u20133 and 2\u20133, for an output on the first and second spins, respectively. Thus, one can implement the quantum XOR gate by a single radio-frequency pulse, the frequency range of which spans only the peak of one of these transitions, and which imparts sufficient energy to invert the populations of the corresponding pair of states. This is an example of a Pound\u2013Overhauser double resonance experiment (17). More generally, we have shown that one can implement the universal Toffoli gate via NMR pulse sequences and hence compute any desired Boolean function by these means (12). In particular, the unitary transformation Uf needed to compute the Boolean function f in SAT can be performed by an appropriate pulse sequence. The expectation value of the operator S in the SAT algorithm above corresponds to the sum of the intensities of the 2n peaks that are obtained by flipping the (n + 1)th spin. For a two-spin system, the matrix S = S2 can be written in terms of the operators P01 = Diag(1,\u22121,0,0) and P23 = Diag(0,0,1,\u22121), the expectation values of which give the population differences between the subscript states (and hence the intensities of the corresponding peaks), as S 2 = ( 1 \u2297 1 \u2212 P 01 \u2212 P 23 ) / 2 = ( 1 \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 I z ) / 2 , [8] where Iz = Diag(1,\u22121) is the matrix of the operator for the z-component of the spin. Finally, a superposition in which all the basis states are equiprobable is easily obtained by applying a \u03c0/2 pulse with a frequency range that spans all the peaks, due to flips of the input spins, but which misses those peaks due to the output spin. Thus the SAT problem is easily and naturally solved by NMR spectroscopy, at least in small instances. The Physical Limitations of NMR Computing Although straightforward in principle, there are several theoretical and practical considerations that limit how large of a problem can be solved by an NMR implementation of an EQC. In this section we shall consider the most important such obstacles and, where possible, establish bounds on the corresponding limits. In the following, we denote the number of spins in a molecule by n, the number of molecules present in the sample by M, and the total number of spins by N = nM. The mean-square error in an estimated expectation value is \u03c32/M, where the variance \u03c32 depends on the problem instance. To reliably solve, for example, a SAT problem on n variables, this error must be less than 2\u22122n, but the resulting bound on n depends on \u03c32. To avoid this, we instead require only that at least one molecule samples at least one solution with at least some fixed probability pmin. This probability is given by p = 1 \u2212 e\u2212r, where r = M/2n is the average number of molecules per state. The result turns out to depend on pmin only through the term log(log((1 \u2212 pmin)\u22121)), and hence we shall simply set pmin = 1 \u2212 e\u22121\u2014i.e., r > 1. We typically have N \u2248 1023 \u2248\u2009276 in an NMR sample, so if we wish to solve a problem of size n, we would have M \u2248 276/n, or r \u2248 276/(n2n). This leads to the approximate bound ( n 2 n < 2 76 ) \u21d2 ( log 2 ( n ) + n < 76 ) \u21d2 ( n < 70 ) . [9] This bound on the number of bits over which we can perform a reliable search for a single desired state can be increased by 7 or 8 by time-averaging the signals, and perhaps as much as 10 by using very large samples. Because the number of bits that can be handled depends logarithmically on the number of repetitions and/or size, the absolute limit on what any practical NMR computer can handle remains well below 100 bits. In practice, the finite signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver will reduce these estimates substantially. These estimates, however, apply only to solving combinatorial problems by exhaustive search. With the use of more sophisticated search procedures, it may be possible to reduce the rate of growth in the sample size required and so go considerably larger. It is also conceivable that algorithms for some problems exist that can be implemented more efficiently (in terms of time) on an NMR computer than they can be on conventional or QCs, using only a fixed sample size. Several other obstacles to scaling an NMR computer to large problems also exist, but it is more difficult to establish hard bounds on the size of the problem that these obstacles permit us to solve. For example, it is difficult to find molecules with more than \u224810 spins in them and with a large coupling constant between every pair of spins (particularly if one is relying upon only scalar coupling). In addition, the number of peaks that can be independently resolved in the NMR spectrum of a molecule is limited by both the separation as well as the width of the peaks. Nevertheless, we need only find one suitable molecule (out of the myriads available in chemistry) to obtain a general EQC on that number of spins. As a result, we do not expect this obstacle to be the ultimate bottleneck. The width of the peaks is also important because it is equal to the inverse spin\u2013spin relaxation time T2, otherwise known as the decoherence time in quantum computing. Since decoherence introduces errors into the intermediate results, it limits the time available for computation. The difficulty of isolating microscopic systems from their environment well enough to attain long decoherence times has proven to be one of the chief obstacles to implementing a true QC. In contrast, the nuclear spins in a molecule are generally quite well isolated from its motional and electronic degrees of freedom. In solids, the dominant mechanism of spin\u2013spin relaxation is the dipole\u2013dipole interaction, which typically results in decoherence times of a small fraction of a millisecond. In liquids, on the other hand, the dipole\u2013dipole interaction is averaged to zero by the rapid rotational diffusion of nearby molecules, leading to decoherence times that can be on the order of many seconds. The intramolecular scalar couplings between spins, however, are not averaged to zero, and can exceed 100 Hz. The number of selective pulses that can be used in one experiment, which is of order the ratio of the coupling constants to the decoherence rate, can therefore be over a thousand. It is possible that error correcting schemes like those proposed to control decoherence and other errors in quantum computation (21) can be developed for NMR computing, further increasing the time available for computation. More importantly, this dipolar averaging effect largely isolates the spins in different molecules from one another, thus making each molecule into an independent QC. It follows that liquid NMR samples are an extremely suitable means of implementing an EQC. Unfortunately, the small energies associated with the Zeeman Hamiltonian make it impossible to prepare a pure state at temperatures above about 10\u22123 K, but molecules do not remain in the liquid state as one approaches the absolute zero of temperature. For this reason we have developed a novel means of simulating pure states at room temperature. Pseudo-Pure States A mixed state is a statistical mixture of independent quantum systems that are not all in the same quantum state. The mixed states of spin systems are described by a generalization of spinors, known as the density matrix, that enables us to compute their statistical properties (18). The density matrix \u03a8 of a pure state is obtained from the corresponding spinor \u03c8 simply by taking a dyadic product\u2014i.e., \u03a8 = |\u03c8\u232a\u2329\u03c8|. Such a density matrix is necessarily an idempotent projection operator that has only one nonzero eigenvalue with the value 1. In the case of a two-spin system in the state |00\u232a, for example, we have \u03a8 = |00\u232a\u232900| = Diag(1,0,0,0). The density matrix of a mixed state is obtained by taking the average of the density matrix over a representative ensemble of pure states\u2014i.e., \u03a8 = \u222b { \u03c8 } p ( \u03c8 ) | \u03c8 \u27e9 \u27e8 \u03c8 | d \u03c8 , [10] where p(\u03c8) is the probability density of the pure state described by the spinor \u03c8 and {\u03c8} denotes the set of all unit norm spinors. Thus a density matrix can be an arbitrary positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix normalized to unit trace. In a basis of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, the diagonal elements are the relative populations of the various energy levels, while the off-diagonal elements represent coherences\u2014i.e., correlations in the phases of precessing spins in pairs of energy levels across the sample. Eq. 10 is usually regarded as a Gibbs ensemble average, which is a purely thought construction used to compute time averages. As described above, however, the spins in the different molecules of a liquid are essentially independent of one another. As a consequence, a large number of copies of a single type of molecule in a liquid sample constitutes an excellent physical approximation to a Gibbs ensemble, at least for the spin degrees of freedom. The result is that we can work with a reduced density matrix \u03a8 of size 2n, where n is the number of spins in a single molecule, rather than a density matrix of size 2N, where N = nM is the total number of spins in the sample. The (reduced) density matrix evolves in time according to the Liouville\u2013von Neumann equation d \u03a8 / d t = i [ \u03a8 , H ] = i ( \u03a8 H \u2212 H \u03a8 ) , [11] where H is a matrix representation of the spin Hamiltonian of the molecule, and [\u03a8,H] denotes the matrix commutator. This has the general solution \u03a8 ( t ) = U ( t ) \u03a8 ( 0 ) U \u2020 ( t ) , [12] where U(t) is a time-dependent unitary matrix. For a time-independent Hamiltonian, this matrix has the form U(t) = Exp(\u2212itH). Finally, the ensemble average of the expectation value of any observable K is obtained as the trace product tr(K\u03a8) of the corresponding matrix K with the density matrix. We define a pseudo-pure state to be one that has a density matrix that can be shifted by adding a multiple of the unit matrix to it so as to obtain a scalar multiple of the density matrix of a pure state. Such a density matrix can be written as \u03a8 = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) 1 + 2 \u03b1 | \u03c8 \u27e9 \u27e8 \u03c8 | ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) 2 n + 2 \u03b1 ( \u2212 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1 ) , [13] where |\u03c8\u232a is a unit spinor. In other words, it is a unit trace Hermitian matrix of size 2n \u00d7 2n, with eigenvalues that lie in the interval [0,1], and with 2n \u2212 1 of them degenerate. The spinor |\u03c8\u232a in Eq. 13 will be called a pseudo-spinor, to emphasize the fact that its physical interpretation differs from that of the spinor for an isolated spin system. Pseudo-pure states promise to be of great utility in implementing an EQC for the following reasons. (i) Each pseudo-spinor determines a unique pseudo-pure density matrix via Eq. 13 above, and each pseudo-pure density matrix determines a pseudo-spinor that is unique up to an overall phase factor (assuming that the polarization \u03b1 is known). (ii) When the density matrix of a pseudo-pure state (as in Eq. 13) is transformed by a given unitary transformation (as in Eq. 12), the corresponding pseudo-spinor is transformed by the same unitary matrix, since U\u03a8U\u2020 \u221d (1 \u2212 \u03b1)1 + 2\u03b1(U|\u03c8\u232a)(U|\u03c8\u232a)\u2020. (iii) The ensemble average expectation value of an observable versus a pseudo-pure density matrix as in Eq. 13 yields the ordinary expectation value of the observable versus the corresponding pseudo-spinor, since tr(K\u03a8) \u221d (1 \u2212 \u03b1)tr(K) + 2\u03b1\u2329\u03c8|K|\u03c8\u232a, where tr(K) is a known constant. The molecules of a sample in a pseudo-pure state are in a statistical mixture of quantum states. Nevertheless, there is a preponderance of one particular state present, which manifests itself when we add up the magnetizations of all the molecules, in effect making each molecule cast its \u201cvote\u201d for the final spectrum. The net result is that we can \u201cemulate\u201d a QC by NMR spectroscopy on macroscopic liquid samples in open test tubes at room temperature and pressure. Moreover, the number of operations required to do this is identical to the number of operations executed by the QC! The only real difference is that one can determine the state of the system in terms of its expectation values without wave function collapse, which shows that the requirement for an exponential state space is logically and physically distinct from the probabilistic aspects of quantum computing. For an experimental demonstration of the fact that one can apply quantum logic gates to coherent superpositions of pseudo-spinors, please see ref. 12. The price one pays for using pseudo-pure states in NMR samples at room temperature is the loss of a factor of about one million in the effective number of molecules per state, because even with superconducting magnets, the net polarization of the spins is only about one part in a million. Since this factor figures only logarithmically in the physical limits (Eq. 9), we can in principle still perform exhaustive searches over as many as 50 bits using an NMR computer with ordinary liquid samples. Of course, a number of practical considerations will limit us to substantially smaller problems, at least using the presently available materials and technologies. Prominent among these is the signal-to-noise ratio that can be attained with conventional electronics at room temperatures, which will probably make exhaustive searches over all inputs on more than \u224815\u201320 bits impractical in the foreseeable future. This should nevertheless be sufficient to motivate considerable research into alternative materials, technologies, and perhaps algorithms that enable us to push these limits back yet further. Conclusions Researchers today are divided concerning whether or not it will ever be possible to build a QC of any significant size. We have described a macroscopic analogue of a QC that can be implemented today, using commercially available NMR spectrometers and ordinary liquid samples. Such an NMR computer differs from a QC in that it uses the parallelism inherent in macroscopic ensembles to estimate expectation values, instead of the filtering and amplification concomitant upon wave function collapse. This enables it to efficiently solve a wider variety of problems, including NP-complete problems, although it may need an exponentially increasing sample size to do so. A classical parallel computer can also use an exponentially increasing number of processors to achieve exponential speed-ups, but the only other type of machine that has been implemented with anything approaching 1023 \u201cprocessors\u201d in it is a DNA computer. Unlike a DNA computer, however, an NMR computer can be fully programmed by purely electronic means, much like a QC in principle could be. The fact that one can combine quantum parallelism with thermodynamic averaging to actually implement a machine with many of the advantages of both DNA and quantum computing is decidedly nontrivial. The experimental issues involved in NMR computing, and in particular general methods for the preparation of pseudo-pure states, are being investigated (unpublished work; see also ref. 12). Despite its acknowledged limitations, it is possible that an NMR computer (or possibly some other type of EQC) will someday be built that can (with suitable algorithms) solve problems beyond the reach of conventional computers. Besides NP-complete problems, an NMR computer should be able to factorize integers by either a direct search procedure, or possibly by procedures based on Miller\u2019s approach which scale better (2, 11). Another likely application would be to simulate the statistical behavior of open quantum systems, as originally proposed for closed quantum systems using QCs by R. P. Feynman (see ref. 19). These theoretical questions are likewise under study (unpublished work).

Unlike pure-state models, its power is not derived from the generation of a large amount of entanglement. Instead it has been proposed that other nonclassical correlations are responsible for the computational speedup, and that these can be captured by the quantum discord. In this Letter we implement DQC1 in an all-optical architecture, and experimentally observe the generated correlations. We find no entanglement, but large amounts of quantum discord\u2014except in three cases where an efficient classical simulation is always possible. Our results show that even fully separable, highly mixed, states can contain intrinsically quantum mechanical correlations and that these could offer a valuable resource for quantum information technologies.

Introduction Spin-based electronics (or spintronics) is one of the emerging branches in nanotechnology and the most active area within nanomagnetism. Its central subject is the active manipulation of spin degrees of freedom of charge carriers in solid-state systems, in addition to their electronic charge used in traditional semiconductor electronics. The field has made a major impact on today's daily life, for instance, by improving hard drive information storage and in magnetic sensing. The range of applications of spintronics is now expanding from read-heads devices, to new types of non-volatile magnetic memories (MRAM),1,2 to spin transfer nano-oscillators for applications in future wireless telecommunications,3 to the potential use of an individual electron spin system as a quantum bit in a quantum computer.4 Up to now, \u201cconventional\u201d spintronics has been almost exclusively based on inorganic metals and semiconductors.5,6 However, with the contemporary evolution of molecular electronics and molecular magnetism, and with the evolution of spintronics towards nanospintronics, a new field namely Molecular Spintronics is emerging that combines the ideas and concepts developed in spintronics with the unique possibilities offered by the molecular systems to perform electronic functions, to form self-organized nanostructures and to exhibit quantum effects at the nanoscale.7,8 This new field can take advantage of the possibilities offered by molecular electronics in the materials processing, as well as in the manipulation, measurement and addressing of individual molecules, and by the molecular magnetism in the increasing control over the chemical design of magnetic molecules and materials with desired properties. A standing challenge in molecular spintronics is the preparation of complex functional circuits, because Nature tends to prefer periodic structures such as crystals. Possible solutions include profiting from solid state technology by binding molecules to surface nanopatterns, adopting a cellular automaton strategy by using molecules which individually offer complex functionality or taking clues from biology and advancing in the dynamic science of structure, form and function. An important breakthrough in molecular magnetism that has contributed to this evolution has been the discovery of single-molecule magnets i.e., magnetic molecules showing slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures and quantum effects.9 Owing to these distinctive properties, SMMs have been proposed as useful molecular objects for molecular spintronics.10 Other interesting features of the molecular world come from its chemical, structural and electronic versatilities. Thus, in organic systems electron spins can be preserved for longer periods of time and distances than in conventional inorganic materials.11 On the other hand, the spin-relaxation times of magnetic molecules can be exceptionally long \u2013 between a few milliseconds and seconds.12 Finally, the low-density, flexibility, transparency, processability, ability of self-assembling, and novel added functionalities (magnetic switching at the molecular level, emission of light, etc.) of the molecular systems can also justify this interest. In a similar way to what happens in molecular electronics, molecular spintronics can be divided into two large sub-areas named \u201cmolecule-based spintronics\u201d and \u201cunimolecular spintronics\u201d. The first focuses on the design and study of new molecule-based materials that can mimic the properties of the existing inorganic (spin)-electronic materials/structures/devices or even improve them. It opens the possibility to design cheaper spintronic devices compatible with plastic technology.13 The second is devoted to the study of individual magnetic molecules as active components of nanospintronic devices (including ultra-high density information-storage devices). It takes advantage of the possibility to chemically tailor molecules with control down to the single spin for the construction of ultra small spintronic devices14 with the perspective of using these magnetic molecules as qubits for quantum computing. Very recently, the first steps in the manipulation of molecular spin instead of its charge have been undertaken, revealing tentative potential for memory or quantum information technology. This novel approach should enable the creation of electrically addressable single-molecule magnetic qubits and molecular switches.15 It is time to explore the potential of POMs in this context since, when compared with other coordination compounds, these molecular-metal oxides present some advantageous chemical, structural and electronic features that make them suitable for this goal, namely: (i) They are robust molecules that keep their integrity in the solid state, in solution and probably also on surfaces. (ii) They can accommodate magnetic ions or groups of magnetic ions at specific sites of the rigid POM structure, leading to magnetic molecules and large magnetic clusters with specific topologies and highly symmetric environments. (iii) They can accept various numbers of electrons, while keeping almost intact their structure, leading to mixed-valence systems in which the extra electrons are extensively delocalized over the whole POM framework. In this review we will discuss the relevance of polyoxometalate (POM) chemistry in nanomagnetism and, in particular, in molecular spintronics and quantum computing. Traditionally, the most extended application of these molecular-metal oxides deals with catalysis. Still, owing to their structural and electronic versatilities, we already pointed out in the 1990's that POMs could also be model objects in molecular magnetism, or magnetic components of hybrid molecular materials.16\u201318 Nowadays, these trends have expanded towards nanomagnetism. These recent advances will be presented in the first part of the review, where we will focus in particular on the recent discovery of lanthanide single-molecule magnets. Such a discovery has been seminal for the use of these nanomagnets in molecular spintronics and quantum computing. These new applications of POMs will be discussed in the second part of the review. 2. Relevance of POMs in molecular magnetism 2.1. Historical background: POMs as magnetic models Until very recently the relevance of POMs in molecular magnetism was based on the ability of these molecular metal-oxides to provide ideal examples for studying at the molecular level the two key processes occurring in the extended structures formed by metal-oxide materials, namely magnetic exchange and electron delocalization. Two classes of magnetic POMs are of interest in this context namely the spin-localized POMs and the spin-delocalized mixed-valence (MV) POMs. Spin-localized POMs In these POMs the magnetic moments remain localized on the 3d or 4f magnetic metal ions. To prepare these systems we have benefited from the ability of heteropolyoxometalates, essentially wolframates and, to a lesser extent, molybdates, to act as chelating ligands toward practically all 3d-transition and/or 4f lanthanoid metal ions. This has afforded the encapsulation of these magnetic ions at specific sites of the framework structures, thus creating well-defined magnetic entities formed either by a single magnetic center or by various magnetic centers connected though oxo-bridges (magnetic clusters). Owing to the rigidity of these POMligands, specific coordination geometries and nuclearities of the magnetic entities have been obtained leading, in general, to extensive families of compounds in which these magnetic metal ions can be changed at will, while keeping practically unchanged the structural features of the magnetic entities. This ability has been exploited in particular in the so-called lacunary POMs, which are capped structures obtained by removal of part of the octahedral sites from the initial POM structure (Fig. 1). The literature offers an extensive number of examples of these magnetic clusters.18,19 Fig. 1 Monovacant and trivacant ligands derived from Lindqvist, Keggin and Dawson\u2013Wells structures: (a) [W5O18]6\u2212, (b) \u03b2-[PW9O34]9\u2212 and (c) [P2W15O56]12\u2212. In addition to the wide variety of paramagnetic cations that can be encapsulated, another advantageous feature has been the effective magnetic isolation guaranteed by the bulky non-magnetic POM framework, with typical distances between the magnetic ions of the order of 1\u20132 nm. Furthermore, clusters of higher nuclearity can be constructed from smaller fragments by controlling certain chemical parameters (stoichiometry, pH,\u2026). This feature allows us to control not only the nuclearity but also the type of magnetic interactions between the different ions and thus stabilize a desired spin ground state. All these features have made these complexes ideal candidates for modeling the magnetic exchange interactions in clusters of increasing nuclearities and definite topologies. During the last two decades a large number of highly symmetric clusters with intermediate nuclearities, such as dimers, trimers and tetramers, have been widely studied as model systems for the development of magnetic exchange theories.18 A relevant case that illustrates the possibilities offered by POM chemistry to conduct detailed studies on magnetic exchange interactions is provided by the cobalt(ii) clusters. This d7 ion, when octahedrally coordinated by the weak ligand field of POMs, shows a high-spin S = 3/2 with an unquenched orbital momentum, thus exhibiting a large spin anisotropy.20 In fact, the first order spin\u2013orbit coupling results in an effective and highly anisotropic spin doublet, S = 1/2. Still, the magnetic properties in these compounds have been shown to be largely insensitive to the exchange anisotropy and thus, other physical techniques have been used to extract this information. The key technique in this context has been Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS). This spectroscopic technique provides a direct access to the splitting of the low-lying energy levels of a cluster caused by exchange interactions. Therefore, it allows a much deeper and more detailed insight into the nature of the magnetic coupling compared with the usual magnetic susceptometry. In 1992 we started to use this technique to study a tetranuclear rhomb-like Co(ii) cluster encapsulated by lacunary POMs of formula [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10\u2212 (see Fig. 2a).21 These studies provided for the first time direct evidence about the Co(ii)\u2013Co(ii) exchange anisotropy.22 More recently we have shown that INS data are sensitive not only to the magnitude and anisotropy of the exchange parameters but also to the relative orientation of the exchange anisotropy axes. An illustrative example has been provided by studying two closely related trinuclear Co(ii) clusters derived from the tetranuclear rhomb-like Co(ii) cluster.23 The first trimer is an angular Co3 cluster obtained by replacement of a Co situated in the short diagonal of the rhomb by W (shorthand Co3W) (Fig. 2c). It has been isolated in the POM salt Na12[Co3W(H2O)(ZnW9O34)2]\u00b7nH2O. The second trimer is a triangular Co3 cluster obtained by replacement of a Co placed in the long diagonal of the rhomb by Na+ (shorthand NaCo3) (Fig. 2b). It has been isolated in the POM salt Na17[(NaOH2)Co3(H2O)(P2W15O56)2]\u00b7nH2O. The INSspectra of Co3W show three cold peaks and three hot ones, while NaCo3 shows up to two cold peaks and two hot peaks (Fig. 3, left).24 From these data an energy splitting pattern can be obtained (Fig. 3, right). The diagrams show four doublets arising from the three coupled effective spins S = 1/2. These results have been closely reproduced by using a fully anisotropic exchange model that takes into consideration the molecular symmetry of the system. In this anisotropic model, the orientation of the local anisotropy axes is assumed to be parallel to the W\u2013O bonds, and the three components (x, y and z) of each exchange interaction are different. Making use of the molecular symmetry of the cluster, it has been possible to describe the INS spectra of both systems from a set of 5 parameters, which are the following: (i) the three components of the exchange parameters J13(x,y,z) associated with the side of the rhombus (similar for both clusters) and (ii) the two components of the axial exchange J23(x,y,z) through the short diagonal (J23x = J23y due to the Cs symmetry). In conclusion, the possibility of studying these Co clusters through INS has provided the opportunity to demonstrate for the first time in a direct way the anisotropic nature of the exchange interactions in magnetic clusters formed by this anisotropic metal ion.23 Fig. 2 Structures of the (a) [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10\u2212, (b) [(NaOH2)Co3(H2O)(P2W15O56)2]17\u2212 and (c) [Co3W(H2O)(ZnW9O34)2]12\u2212 clusters. Fig. 3 INSspectra of polycrystalline sodium salts of [Co3W(H2O)(ZnW9O34)2]12\u2212 (top) and [(NaOH2)Co3(H2O)(P2W15O56)2]17\u2212 (bottom) clusters and experimentally determined ground-state splitting with observed transitions represented by arrows. Mixed-valence POMs To prepare these compounds one takes advantage of the electron acceptor ability of these metal-oxide clusters, by which a variable number of electrons can undergo a rapid electron transfer from one center to the other of the POM framework. This feature shows that POMs provide unique examples in coordination chemistry of high-nuclearity MV clusters. These spin-delocalized clusters represent a formidable challenge in molecular magnetism since their electronic complexity is much higher than that encountered in the spin-localized magnetic clusters. In fact, apart from the magnetic superexchange J, three additional processes need to be taken into account to model their properties, namely: \u2022 Electron transfer, t, between adjacent \u201coccupied\u201d and \u201cempty\u201d sites, i.e. between two metals with different oxidation states (W(v)\u2013W(vi); Mo(v)\u2013Mo(vi); V(iv)\u2013V(v)), which tends to delocalize the electron over the cluster. \u2022 Coulombic repulsion, V, between every pair of electrons, which tends to place the electrons as far as possible to minimize its repulsion. \u2022 Vibronic coupling, \u03bb, that couples the \u201cblue\u201d electrons with the vibrational modes of the cluster, tending to localize the electron on a given site. In addition, the unique ability of POMs to act as electron sponges hosting a variable number of electrons in the POM framework can provide an efficient way to tune the strength of the exchange coupling as well as the electron delocalization in the cluster and, consequently, its spin state. Such a control can be achieved either physically, by an electrical gating in a single-molecule setup, or chemically, during the synthesis of the POM. As we will see later on, this feature will be quite interesting in spintronics as it is expected to afford the control of the spin state of the cluster by applying an electric field. A classic example of diamagnetic MV POM is provided by the anion [PW12O40]5\u2212, which is reduced by two electrons. The diamagnetism of this Keggin heteropolyblue was originally attributed to a multiroute superexchange mechanism. Later on it was demonstrated that the large spin-triplet gap could originate from the interplay between Coulombic repulsion and electron transfer, provided the transfer routes have a certain relation in sign and magnitude.25,26 Indeed, while the electrons are far away from each other at all times in the ground state, the possible electron transfer routes are different for singlets and triplets, and the result is a strong stabilization of the singlet. This study of the electron pair delocalization was also performed on similar systems such as the Dawson\u2013Wells polyanion. In this system the movement of electrons is focused on the two central 6-membered rings. The singlet ground state stabilization is obtained for the same signs for the single-transfer parameters (if double-transfer processes are negligible) as in the case of the Keggin anion, and the delocalization of the electron pair implies that an electron is delocalized over each 6-membered ring to minimize Coulomb repulsion.27 The effect of vibronic coupling on electron location was studied for the two electron reduced Keggin anion taking into account an adiabatic approximation.28 The conditions of singlet and triplet stabilization discussed above are strongly affected by the vibronic interactions that tend to localize the electrons and thus effectively reduce the transfer parameters. The degrees of localization prove to be different for the spin-triplet and spin-singlet states that essentially influence the magnetic properties of the reduced Keggin anion. For a strong vibronic coupling, spin-triplet states become partial or even fully localized, and fully delocalized states can be achieved only for spin-singlets. For weak vibronic coupling in all cases a fully delocalized configuration can be found. The adiabatic approximation gives very qualitative information about localization and restricts the accuracy of calculations of the magnetic characteristics and profiles of the intervalence optical bands. Recently we have presented a powerful theoretical approach to obtain an accurate solution of the dynamic vibronic problem in large scale Jahn\u2013Teller systems. The approach uses a symmetry adapted vibronic basis to reduce the dimension of the problem.29 The application of this procedure to the Keggin anion is being developed and it is hoped to give an accurate description of the combined JT/pseudo JT problems for the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states in this high-nuclearity system. Due to chemical control of electron population, polyoxovanadates represent a remarkable class of high-nuclearity MV clusters. These compounds are therefore ideal systems for studying the influence of the number of delocalized electrons in the magnetic properties. The [V18O48]n\u2212 cluster (Fig. 4) forms a family of compounds from the 18 electrons fully localized member for n = 12 to the mixed-valence member with 10 delocalized electrons for n = 4.30 This series of polyoxovanadates presents an unexpected magnetic behavior: as the electronic population is decreased, meaning a growing distance between unpaired electrons, an increasing antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling is measured. A complete study of the influence of the exchange and transfer parameters on the low-lying spin levels has been performed. A combination of ab initio calculations with model t-J Hamiltonian was used to analyze the properties of this family. The electron-transfer integral, calculated from the ab initio calculations, plays the key role in the macroscopic AF properties of these MV polyoxovanadates, while both the structural effect of removing electrons from the initial spin-localized cluster on the amplitude of the magnetic coupling and the effect of alleviating the spin frustration only play a minor role.31 Fig. 4 (a) Structure of [V18O48]n\u2212 cluster and (b) temperature dependence of \u03c7T for the spin-localized n = 12 and delocalized n = 4 (from ref. 30). In conclusion, POMs are model systems to study the interplay between electron delocalization and magnetic exchange in high-nuclearity clusters. Their highly symmetric structures facilitate the development of exact quantum-mechanical models from which a clear picture of the local parameters involved in the magnetic properties can be extracted. 2.2. Recent advances: single-molecule magnets based on POMs Very recently the interest for these two classes of magnetic POMs has moved from their use as model systems in molecular magnetism towards the design of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) and their use as molecular spin-qubits in nanospintronic devices. In this section we will summarize the major breakthroughs achieved in the area of molecular nanomagnets, while the aspects related with the spin-qubits will be presented in a final section specifically devoted to the discussion of the relevance of POMs in spintronics and quantum computing. The magnetic behavior of SMMs is characterized by the presence of slow-relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures (superparamagnetic blocking) giving rise to a magnetic memory effect similar to that found in hard magnets, together with quantum tunneling effects. The most quoted example, which dates back to the early nineties, is [Mn12O12(O2CMe)16(H2O)4] (Mn12),32 a molecule that combines a high axial anisotropy and a high spin ground state.9 This molecule has been the subject of many magnetic and structural studies.33\u201335 The magnetic cluster is formed by eight Mn3+ ions ferromagnetically coupled (external ring) and four Mn4+ ions in the central cube also ferromagnetically coupled. Coupling between these two moieties is antiferromagnetic, leading to a total ground spin of S = 10. Thus, owing to the uniaxial anisotropy of Mn12, characterized by a negative D value, this S splits into its Ms components in such a way that the Ms doublet = \u00b110 is stabilized and becomes the ground spin state of the cluster, while the rest of spin sublevels becomes more and more excited as |Ms| decreases (Fig. 5). Such a spin structure creates an energy barrier of about 50 cm\u22121 that needs to be overcome to reverse the orientation of the magnetic moment (from Ms = +10 to Ms = \u221210). That explains the superparamagnetic blocking observed at low temperatures in these nanomagnets and the occurrence of a magnetic hysteresis. At the same time, the presence of quantum-tunneling effects allows the spin reversal to occur without the need of overcoming the barrier. Fig. 5 Schematic structure of the Mn12 core and energy level scheme for the ground S = 10 multiplet of the Mn12 SMM. Two routes are possible between the wells, either the thermal route above the barrier, or a quantum tunneling shortcut. Shortly after the magnetic characterization of Mn12, an octanuclear iron complex ([Fe8O2(OH)12(tacn)6]8+ with tacn representing 1,4,7-triazacyclononane)36 was also found to display SMM properties with more pronounced quantum effects.37,38 Later, a rising number of lower nuclearity cluster systems were reported to behave as SMMs, for instance, the tetranuclear complex [Mn4(O2CMe)2(pdmH)6](ClO4)2, where pdmH2 is pyridine-2,6-dimethanol.39 The major synthetic challenge in this field was to increase the energy barrier and, consequently, the blocking temperature TB, by designing molecules having the maximum values of S and D. In this context, many examples of magnetic clusters with larger and larger nuclearities were reported40\u201343 in an attempt to increase the spin state of the cluster and hence, the superparamagnetic barrier. However, the success of this approach has been very limited as demonstrated by the fact that Mn12 is still among the systems exhibiting the highest effective barriers (ca. 45\u201350 cm\u22121) and hysteresis up to 4 K. More recently magnetic clusters containing highly anisotropic lanthanoid ions have also been synthesized.44\u201348 These complexes have shown effective barriers as high as 100 cm\u22121 and hysteresis up to 8 K. In the POM area some examples of magnetic clusters exhibiting a SMM behavior have recently been described. Thus, a small number of high-spin, high-anisotropy POMs have been characterized as, for instance, the [MnIII4MnII2O4(H2O)4]8+ cluster embedded in a POM,49 a couple of iron(iii) with hexa and nonanuclearity, [Fe4(H2O)2(FeW9O34)2]10\u2212 and [(Fe4W9O34(H2O))2(FeW6O26)]19\u2212, respectively,50 a cobalt(ii) with hexadecanuclearity, [{Co4(OH)3PO4}4(PW9O34)4]28\u2212,51 and a heptanuclear manganese(iii)\u2013manganese(iv) cluster, [(\u03b1-P2W15O56)MnIII3MnIVO3(CH3COO)3]8\u2212.52 Although, these magnetic clusters add some new examples to the hundreds of already known SMMs, their novelty in the field of SMMs is very limited due to the very low energy barriers (10\u201312 cm\u22121) they exhibit and to the lack of other interesting effects coming from the POM ligand. This result contrasts with the key role that POM chemistry is playing in the new generation of SMMs known as Single-Ion Magnets (SIMs). These systems represent the limit in the miniaturization of a nanomagnet since a mononuclear complex formed by a single magnetic center, instead of a magnetic cluster, has been shown to be sufficient to behave as a SMM. The first example of this kind was reported by Ishikawa et al. in 2003 in the lanthanoid complexes of general formula [LnPc2]\u2212, with a \u2018double-decker\u2019 structure and phthalocyanines as ligands (Fig. 6).53 Thus, the antiprismatic D4d crystal field induced by the eight coordinated atoms around the Ln3+ splits its ground magnetic state, characterized by the total angular momentum, J, into \u00b1MJ sublevels. In some cases this leads to a sublevel scheme in which the levels with the higher |MJ| values are stabilized with respect to the levels with the lower |MJ| values. This creates a barrier that explains the SMM behavior observed in the Tb derivative for which the ground magnetic doublet corresponds to that with the maximum MJ value (= \u00b16), being separated from the first excited level (MJ = \u00b15) by more than 300 cm\u22121 (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 Structure of terbium phthalocyaninato derivative and energy level scheme for the ground J = 6 multiplet. In view that POM chemistry also provides lanthanoid complexes with antiprismatic D4d symmetry, we decided to study the magnetic properties of the series [Ln(W5O18)2]9\u2212, in short LnW10 (Fig. 7). Thus, in 2008 we discovered a second family of SIMs, whose best example was the Er derivative.54 This compound exhibited a slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures and a frequency-dependent out-of-phase susceptibility signal, \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (Fig. 8), which agrees with the presence of an energy barrier for the reversal of the magnetization (Ueff = 38.5 cm\u22121) very close to that observed for the archetypical Mn12 cluster (Ueff \u2248 50 cm\u22121).55 This key result showed that the concept of SIMs was not restricted to the bisphthalocyaninato molecules and motivated since then the search for other mononuclear complexes exhibiting SMM behavior. Nowadays, this is becoming a hot topic in molecular magnetism which has led to the discovery of tens of SIMs having different coordination geometries and different types of ligands,56\u201358 thus demonstrating that the SIM concept is quite general and can also be extended to other anisotropic metal ions in axial environments, such as mononuclear uranium complexes59,60 and mononuclear d-transition metals.61,62 Fig. 7 Structures of [Ln(W5O18)2]9\u2212 and [Ln(\u03b22-SiW11O39)2]13\u2212 derivatives. Fig. 8 In-phase and out-of-phase dynamic susceptibility of Na9[Er(W5O18)2]\u00b7xH2O at high-frequency measurements from left to right: 1, 10, 100, 332, 997 Hz and energy level scheme for the ground J = 15/2 multiplet. Coming back to the [Er(W5O18)2]9\u2212 complex, it is interesting to discuss why this system exhibits a SMM behavior, while in the [LnPc2]\u2212 series this behavior is observed for the Tb derivative. The reason for this difference lies in the different distortion of the antiprismatic site. Thus, the antiprism formed by 8 nitrogen atoms in the bisphthalocyaninato molecules has a height dpp = 2.76 \u00c5, which is very similar to the square side din = 2.80 \u00c5. In contrast, in the polyoxometalate [Ln(W5O18)2]9\u2212 the 8 oxygen atoms form a compressed antiprism, with dpp = 2.47 \u00c5 vs. din = 2.86 \u00c5 (Fig. 9). This small structural change leads to different LF parameters and, in particular, to a change of the sign of the second order axial ZFS parameter, A 0 2 (which is related to the more familiar ZFS parameter D). As a consequence, the lowest-lying energy levels for Er and Tb are very different and almost reversed in the two classes of complexes. In fact, while in the case of Er the POM ligands stabilize larger |MJ| values (\u00b113/2, \u00b115/2), the phthalocyaninato ligand stabilizes the lowest value, MJ = \u00b11/2. In a similar way, in the Tb case, the POM derivatives stabilize the singlet MJ = 0, while the doublet with the largest J value, MJ = \u00b16, becomes the ground state in the phthalocyaninato derivative. That explains why in the POM series, the Er behaves as a SMM, while the Tb not. Fig. 9 Detail of the coordination structure of approximate D4d symmetry, a square antiprism of side din and height dpp. We have extended this research to the Keggin-type series [Ln(\u03b22-SiW11O39)2]13\u2212 (Ln(iii) = Dy, Ho, Er, and Yb)63 in order to study the influence of the distortion of the antiprismatic site on the spin relaxation processes. One can notice that the spin relaxation processes are faster in POMs than in the phthalocyaninato complexes showing SMM behavior. The reason may be related to the smaller separation between the lower-lying energy levels caused by the LF splitting, which in POM derivatives often contain two or more levels separated by less than 30 cm\u22121. Another related question is the observation that, in general, for a given lanthanide, the magnetization of the Keggin-type series relaxes faster than that for the Lindqvist one. This is due to the presence of non-axial distortions in the Keggin-type derivatives (the two coordinating planes are not parallel). In fact, apart from having a non-negligible influence on the sublevel structures, this distortion can also mix the different wave functions, therefore enhancing the quantum tunneling. Table 1 shows the most important structural parameters for some members of both series. We can see that the main difference between the two series is the larger deviation from perfect symmetry D4d in the case of the Keggin series members, and also a slightly lower axial compression that results in a lower second-order crystal parameter.

Such a behavior is specific for this class of SMMs and is in sharp contrast to that observed in the cluster-based SMMs (Mn12, for example) in which \u03c7\u2032\u2032 tends to vanish below the blocking temperature. In the mononuclear lanthanide SMMs, both processes, the thermally activated relaxation process giving rise to the observation of a maximum in \u03c7\u2032\u2032, due to the superparamagnetic blocking of the magnetic moments, and a very fast quantum tunneling process within the \u00b1MJ ground-state doublet giving rise to a divergence in \u03c7\u2032\u2032, seem to coexist. It is remarkable that the spin relaxation in the quantum tunneling regime can be tuned \u201ca la carte\u201d both chemically and physically. This unique feature has been shown in Na9Er(W5O18)2 (ref. 55). Thus, it has been found that the quantum tunneling process can be blocked at low temperatures by diluting the magnetic sample in the yttrium analog, or by applying an external magnetic field. Furthermore, it has also been found that quantum tunneling provides a spin relaxation that is ten orders of magnitude more efficient than what is predicted by accepted theories. Speculative explanations for this fast spin-lattice energy flow have been proposed based on the collective emission of single phonons by a group of spins. Notice that POM chemistry also offers other coordination geometries for lanthanoid ions different from the typical D4d antiprism present in the [LnPc2]\u2212 series and [Ln(W5O18)2]9\u2212 systems. An interesting case in this context is provided by the well-known Preyssler anion, [LnW30O110]12\u2212 (Fig. 10). This anion has a central coordination site with an unusual fivefold axial symmetry C5. Recently we have studied both experimentally and theoretically the possibilities of preparing new SIMs based on this series.64 In spite of the low symmetry provided by this anion, we have observed that Dy and Ho derivatives behave as SMMs exhibiting slow relaxation of the magnetization. Still, the spin dynamics, especially at low temperatures, are dominated by fast tunneling processes. To rationalize this behavior we have developed a general theoretical approach that determines the effect of the crystal field on both the splitting of the J ground state and the mixing of the resulting magnetic levels, providing at the same time an indication of the leading anisotropy parameters that control such a splitting/mixture.65 The remarkable difference between this system and the previous one is the presence of a large off-diagonal anisotropy parameter A 5 6 due to the five fold symmetry, which mixes magnetic states with different MJ values. In addition to this off-diagonal parameter, the ground state is determined by the sign of the A 0 2 parameter. In contrast to the compounds with D4d symmetry studied up to now, this family has both five oxygen ligands in equatorial positions belonging to the POM and a water molecule in an apical position. Equatorial and apical ligands contribute different signs to the A 0 2 parameter (positive for apical and negative for equatorial), giving for the case of Ho and Dy suitable conditions to stabilize the doublets with maximum MJ values. Fig. 10 (a) Structure of the Preyssler anion and (b) top and lateral views showing the near-C5v coordination of the lanthanoid ion in a fivefold environment. Compared with the phthalocyaninato systems, SIMs based on POMs present several advantages: (i) The geometry around the lanthanoid is not restricted to the fourfold D4d antiprism; other geometries are also possible such as the Oh cube or the fivefold axial symmetry C5; (ii) The POM diamagnetic framework also provides a better magnetic insulation of the lanthanoid and an easy way to dilute the SIM in an isostructural matrix formed by the Y derivative; (iii) Insofar as the composition of some POM shells only includes W/Mo, O and maybe Si, they can in principle be prepared as nuclear spin-free systems. As the interaction with nuclear spins is a major source of decoherence for electron spins, these molecules are in a nearly unique position to function as model spin-1/2 systems (spin qubits) for sophisticated experiments aiming to address fundamental problems in quantum computing (this aspect will be discussed in more detail in Section 4).66 3. Relevance of POMs in molecular spintronics With the recent advances in nano-fabrication of single-molecular devices, the manipulation of the spin state of a molecule has become a challenging task in molecular spintronics. An attractive way to control the spin state of a molecule is that of using electric fields or currents in order to achieve an all-electrical control of the nanodevice.7 In fact, the use of an electric field, instead of a magnetic field, presents some advantages as it is easy to obtain (with gates or STM-tips), it undergoes fast switching (\u2248 ps) and can be applied on the nanoscale, thus providing the possibility to address selectively a single molecule. Still, very few magnetic molecules have been proposed for this purpose, with none of these proposals having been experimentally demonstrated. These electrically responsive magnetic molecules are the following: (1) spin-crossover metal complexes,15 (2) valence-tautomeric metal complexes,67 (3) mixed-valence metal complexes68\u201371 and (4) dipolar metal complexes, as for example asymmetric dimers72 or molecular triangles formed by three antiferromagnetically coupled spins.73 Notice that the most relevant examples for classes 3 and 4 are provided by POM chemistry. In fact, MV POMs may be ideal magnetic molecules to study the electrical control of the spin state. In this section we present some examples of MV POMs that can change their ground spin state by the application of an external electric field, or electric injection of extra electrons. For magnetic switching, one needs to stabilize two levels with different electronic properties that are close enough in energy to overcome this difference by applying an electric stimulus. A first possibility is that of reducing the singlet-to-triplet gap in the two-electron reduced POMs. This can be achieved by separating the two electrons at farther positions in the anion, reducing thus their delocalization. An example of this kind is provided by the direduced [GeV14O40]8\u2212 (Fig. 11, right).74 In this MV cluster the two electrons do not interact with each other; thus, the two S = 1/2 spins are independent and the compound is paramagnetic. This system was studied by ab initio calculations on embedded fragments. Surprisingly, both the connectivity of the molecule and the magnitude of most parameters in the Hamiltonian are similar to those of decatungstate, which is diamagnetic.75 And yet the diagonalization of the t-J Hamiltonian for the whole molecule using the ab initio parameters resulted in two independent S = 1/2 spins, in full agreement with the experimental result. The key to explaining this apparently anomalous behavior lies in the central square [GeV4O12] of the cluster, which is sandwiched between the two square pyramids [V5O14]. Because of a combination of poor electron transfer between the two square pyramids and a high orbital energy of the central square, the two electrons behave as independent. When an electric field is applied along the main axis of this POM, our theoretical calculations predict that the electronic distribution changes in such a way that the spins are forced to approach and to be strongly coupled. Thus, an electric field of the order of 10 V nm\u22121 is predicted to cause a sharp crossover from a paramagnetic state to an antiferromagnetic S = 0 state. Although in the present example the magnitude of this electric field is too strong, a way to reduce it could be by increasing the size and the asymmetry of the POM, as these effects are expected to decrease the Coulomb repulsion between the two spins when they will be forced to be antiferromagnetically coupled. Fig. 11 Structure of the two electron reduced [GeV14O40]8\u2212 anion and electron position and interactions before and after electric field. A second example is provided by [PMo12O40(VO)2]q\u2212 (Fig. 12). In this POM, two (VO)2+ sit at opposite tetragonal sites of the Keggin anion and host an S = 1/2 spin. On the other hand, the central Keggin structure PMo12O40 can act as an electron acceptor giving rise to a MV cluster able to accommodate a variable number of electrons. Thus, when the number of injected electrons is odd, the delocalized spin of the central Keggin cluster will be strongly coupled with the two localized spins located at the (VO)2+. As a result, these two distant spins will be ferromagnetically coupled. In turn, if the number of injected electrons is even, the coupling between the localized spins will be very weak. The injection of electrons can be performed through the tunneling current provided by a STM setup. Hence, in this device a control of the exchange interaction through injection of electrons can be achieved. The use of this kind of device as an electrically addressable quantum gate will be discussed in the next section. Fig. 12 Structure of [PMo12O40(VO)2]q\u2212 and [PMoVI11MoVO40{Ni(phen)2(H2O)}2] anions. Finally, a third example of a switchable magnetic POM is provided by the new bicapped mixed-valence polyoxometalate [PMoVI11MoVO40{Ni(phen)2(H2O)}2] where two Ni2+ (S = 1) are placed in two opposite MoO6 positions. In this case, a compound with an odd number of delocalized electrons has been isolated, and, as expected, the \u201cextra\u201d electron, which is fully delocalized at room temperature, is simultaneously coupled antiferromagnetically with the two S = 1 sites. The result is an effective S = 3/2 ground state (two parallel spins S = 1 antiferromagnetically coupled to a central spin S = 1/2). At temperatures around 10 K, a trapping of this central spin near one Ni2+ center occurs as a consequence of the vibronic coupling. As a consequence, the magnetic communication between the Ni2+ centers is effectively switched off so the ground state corresponds to that of two independent spins: an S = 1/2, coming from the antiferromagnetic coupling between the S = 1 and the trapped spin S = 1/2, and an S = 1 from the second Ni2+ center. In this case the switch between the different spin states is thermally controlled. 4. Relevance of POMs in quantum computing 4.1. Molecular spin qubits Quantum computing consists of the explicit use of quantum mechanical phenomena \u2013 such as quantum superposition and entanglement \u2013 for the purposes of information technology.76 The coherent manipulation of quantum systems would enable quantum information processing, which for a series of problems notably including the simulation of quantum systems themselves is qualitatively more efficient than classical information processing. The basic pieces of quantum computing are quantum bits and quantum gates, analogous to classical bits and logic gates. A quantum bit or qubit is a two-level system, e.g. a spin S = 1/2; a quantum gate is a logic operation between two or more such qubits. A typical example is the Controlled-NOT gate, where the target qubit is flipped from |0\u3009 to |1\u3009 and vice versa if and only if the value of the control qubit is |1\u3009 (Fig. 13). Fig. 13 Sample fragment of a quantum circuit illustrating the effect of some typical quantum gates: a \u201cSWAP\u201d operation between the upper and center qubits is effected through three consecutive \u201ccontrolled-NOT\u201d operations, while the lower qubit suffers a simple phase rotation. Dark dots mark control qubits, empty circles mark target qubits. Two extremely challenging requisites needed for useful qubits are a long quantum coherence time and the possibility to scale up the system to many hundreds of qubits that can be manipulated in a non-trivial way. Scalability is mostly an engineering problem, which from the point of view of chemistry translates simply into extremely sophisticated processability. Here, we shall focus on decoherence instead. Decoherence can be defined as the loss of the fragile quantum phase information because of an uncontrolled entanglement with its environment. It is a fundamental physical problem, with deep philosophical consequences.77 We still lack a general analysis of every relevant mechanism of decoherence, but much progress is being made in some areas such as that represented by the SMMs.78 The most used experimental parameter to estimate the decoherence time is the spin\u2013spin relaxation time T2, which in combination with the oscillation frequency permits to estimate the average number of oscillations before the system loses quantum phase information. Over the past few decades, physics has offered a large range of quantum bits such as trapped ions or trapped atoms, quantum dots, quantum optical cavities, rf SQUIDs and, notably, nitrogen-vacancy defects on diamond. To learn more about physical qubits, the reader is referred to excellent reviews such as ref. 79 and references therein. Over the same timeframe, chemistry has proposed, synthesized and studied a wide variety of proof-of-principle systems in the field of molecular spin qubits and quantum gates. In this context, the chemical bottom-up approach consists of studying and understanding individual spin qubits first, building up toy models with one or a few quantum gates next, and finally working towards organization to aim for scalability. In the rest of this review we will focus on electron spin qubits, but, given its relevance in chemistry, one needs to briefly mention NMR quantum computing since it was precisely here where molecules played a key role in the early successes of Quantum Information Processing.80 The reason behind these results is the recontextualization of technical expertise. NMR scientists already had decades of experience with powerful pulse sequences that use phenomena such as population inversion, quantum transfer or spin\u2013lattice relaxation. Often, these sophisticated sequences, designed to extract information about complicated molecules, could be used for coherent manipulation of the quantum states of the molecular nuclear spins. Before reviewing the existing examples of molecular spin qubits, a very brief explanation of the mechanisms of decoherence for these systems is necessary; for more details the reader is referred to ref. 66. Broadly speaking, the three decoherence sources for these systems are spin bath decoherence, oscillator bath decoherence and pairwise dipolar decoherence. They can be regulated by a combination of temperature, magnetic field and chemical design of the system.78 The spin bath mainly consists of nuclear spins, but, in general, it also includes any localized excitation able to couple to the qubit state, e.g. a crystallographic disorder, or the spin of a paramagnetic impurity. It causes precessional decoherence, topological decoherence and noise decoherence. Precessional decoherence, the most important of the three, is non-dissipative and is described as the spin bath absorbing phase information from the qubit. Note that only noise decoherence is directly related to the well-known T1/T2 characterization. In insulators, the oscillator bath is mainly the phonon bath. For conductors, the temperature-independent Ohmic bath typically contributes very strongly to decoherence, so it is usually safer to avoid conductors. Pairwise dipolar decoherence is caused by distant qubits being resonant and thus having a probability of spin-flip. This phenomenon is not solved by mere dilution and requires either low dimensionalities, or sophisticated quantum error correction procedures, or both. In the context of quantum computing, molecular nanomagnets offer various potential advantages over other spin systems. These are strongly coupled spin clusters that function at low temperature as an effective S = 1/2, i.e. single qubits. Strategies for the implementation of quantum algorithms in such nanoscale magnets have been described by A. Ardavan et al.81 The determination of the phase relaxation time appropriate for an individual molecular spin is essential. Experiments utilizing pulsed ESR techniques show that the phase relaxation times in at least some molecular magnets are long enough to permit multiple qubit operations to be performed; these operations would also take place viaEPR pulses. Coherent manipulation of the spin in SMMs by using Landau\u2013Zener transitions, which provides the possibility to tune the resulting magnetization due to quantum interference effects, has also been theoretically discussed.82 Interesting examples about the deployment of molecular nanomagnets in quantum information have been performed in Cr7M heterometallic wheels (see Fig. 14), with M = Ni or Mn, where phase-coherence relaxation is dominated by the coupling of the d electron spin to protons within the molecule.83 In these systems, at low temperatures and for perdeuterated samples, excellent T2 = 3.8 \u03bcs were measured. Fig. 14 Structure of the Cr7M heterometallic wheel. A related S = 1/2 system is the antiferromagnetic V15POM, where decoherence times are in the order of T2 = 0.1 \u03bcs. This system will be presented in more detail later on. Another example is provided by the SMM Fe8. In this nanomagnet coherence times of the order of T2 = 0.5 \u03bcs at T = 1.2 K and transverse fields of the order of H = 10 T. Through a theoretical and experimental study, it was found that at this magnetic field, phonons are the main source of decoherence at temperatures below 1.2 K and magnons \u2013 intermolecular dipolar interactions \u2013 dominate at higher temperatures. The theoretical treatment allows the exploration of the parameter space for further optimization. With an adequate transverse field and at T < 0.13 K, times up to T2 = 50 \u03bcs would be expected. In these conditions, the nuclear spins are the main source of decoherence, so that perdeuteration would extend coherence even further, to T2 = 500 \u03bcs. Due to the fast development of the field, several chemical quantum computation reviews using magnetic molecules as spin qubits have been published over the past decade, covering both experimental and theoretical results.66,81,84 As far as the quantum gates are concerned, research on multi-qubit molecules starts with the synthesis and characterization of systems which seem to embody more than one qubit, e.g. systems with weakly coupled electron spins. The next step is usually the preparation of actual entanglement i.e. of non-trivial superpositions that involve more than one qubit. A preliminary but complete task would be the implementation of a full process of initialization, quantum gating and readout. To build a useful quantum computer one would need to scale up the system indefinitely, so a criterion to evaluate partial achievements is whether one can build upon them to get closer to that ultimate goal. An influential theoretical work by Leuenberger and Loss proposed the implementation of a (multi-qubit) Grover database search algorithm using pulsed ESR on the low-energy S = 10 manifold of just one Mn12 (or Fe8) single molecule magnet.85 Using an ad hoc coding scheme, one would encode up to 22S\u22122 > 105 numbers in 2S+1 = 21 sublevels with a complicated pulse sequence. A single EPR pulse would be able to decode the information, so that the Grover database search algorithm would be used as a data compression tool. More recently, other ideas in the field of quantum information processing have developed on spin\u2013electric effects for the electrical control of either molecular nanomagnets86 or molecular antiferromagnets.87 Several studies have been developed concerning SIMs. There exist full quantum computing proposals, including interactions between spin qubits in the solid state, which would also be applicable to a molecular crystal based on lanthanoid SIMs.88 On a smaller scale, the capability to implement a Controlled-NOT quantum logic gate using molecular clusters containing two Tb3+ ions was demonstrated (see Fig. 15). Here the definition of control and target qubits is based on the strong magnetic anisotropy and the magnetic inequivalence of both ions, which also provides a method to realize a SWAP gate in the same cluster.89 An introduction to the requirements for a paramagnetic molecule to act as a 2-qubit quantum gate is proposed in a tutorial review published by G. Arom\u00ed et al., where two synthetic strategies are presented, based on ligand design and inorganic synthesis, preparing dinuclear complexes of anisotropic metal ions that present dissimilar environments and magnetic coupling.90 Fig. 15 An EPR pulse can reverse the orientation of the magnetic moment of a Tb3+ ion, provided its neighbour is pointing \u201cup\u201d, this selective switching being equivalent to the quantum logic gate Controlled-NOT (C-NOT). 4.2. Polyoxometalates as spin qubits A distinctive advantage of POMs is the possibility of combining a rich magnetochemistry with an environment that is relatively free of nuclear spins. Indeed, nuclear spins are one of the main sources of decoherence for molecular spin qubits and it is not trivial to get rid of them, as every isotope of every element with an odd number of protons bears a nuclear spin.66 In POMs this can be achieved by avoiding heteroelements like phosphorus, and instead relying on Mo and W POMs where the natural abundance of their I = 0 isotopes are high. Moreover, in the salts crystallization water molecules and alkali counterions should also be minimized. Of course, crystalline solids, such as simple or ternary oxides, can also be free of nuclear spins, but these typically lack the flexibility of molecular chemistry. It is not uncommon that the same molecule can be seen either as a nanomagnet or as a spin qubit. Here we will discuss the possibility of using the two types of magnetic POMs presented in Section 2 as possible spin qubits. In the spin-localized POMs, the manipulation can take place through time-dependent magnetic fields, i.e., EPR pulses. These are analogous to other molecular spin qubits presented earlier. In the spin-delocalized MV POMs, the extra electrons enable a manipulation through a time-dependent electric field, which allows a more detailed temporal and geometrical control. Focusing on spin-localized POMs, recent observations have demonstrated the possibility of using as qubits POM cage complexes with an S = 1/2 ground state. One example is provided by the {V15} SMM (Fig. 16).91 Each cluster contains 15 antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 spins, leading to an S = 1/2 collective ground state. When this system is placed into a resonant cavity, the microwave field induces oscillatory transitions between the ground and excited collective spin states (Rabi oscillations), indicative of long-lived quantum coherence (Fig. 16).92 The theoretical analysis allowed a rough estimation of the different contributions to decoherence of the 1H and 51V nuclear spins, which in this case dominates over the phonons and dipolar interactions. Later, a model of spin\u2013vibronic relaxation was proposed which allowed a detailed study of the mechanism of phonon-mediated relaxation in this system.93 Recently, it has been possible to distinguish between the Rabi oscillations of the ground state S = 1/2 (T2 = 149 ns) and the first excited state S = 3/2 (T2 = 187.7 ns) in a frozen trichloromethane solution at 2.4 K.94 Fig. 16 Structure of V15POM spin qubit candidate and time evolution of the average spin \u3008Sz\u3009 after a spin\u2013echo sequence (from ref. 92). Simpler molecular nanomagnets are provided by the mononuclear lanthanoid complexes described in Section 2. In these POMs the control over the spin\u2013lattice relaxation in the quantum regime, studied in ErW10, indicated that these SIMs are promising candidates to act as the hardware for quantum information.55 In fact, Rabi oscillations were observed in the Ho derivative indicating long decoherence times as a consequence of the large tunneling splitting of the ground state of this SIM (ca. 0.3 cm\u22121).95 In addition, the family of Preyssler POMs of general formula [Ln(P5W30O110)]12\u2212 (in short: LnW30) shows, as pointed out above, an unusual fivefold molecular symmetry (see Fig. 10), which gives rise to remarkably large off-diagonal anisotropy parameters of the fifth order. In the case of TbW30, the ground-state doublet is found to be MJ = \u00b15. This means that a strong mixing occurs in the ground doublet, with the participation of MJ = 0. As a consequence, the tunneling splitting of this ground state is extraordinarily large (\u0394 \u2248 2 cm\u22121), orders of magnitude larger than that typically found for cluster-type SMMs (of the order of 10\u22124 to 10\u22126 cm\u22121).64 The spin dynamics, especially at low temperatures, is then dominated by fast tunneling processes. This feature is detrimental for their use as (classical) magnetic bits. However, it can provide very attractive candidates for the application as solid-state spin qubits. In fact, the high tunneling rates should enable the coherent manipulation of these two states, by for example using external electromagnetic radiation. Note that two of the main mechanisms for decoherence, namely interaction with nuclear spins and with neighboring spin qubits, are strongly quenched by this large tunneling splitting.80 Also of interest, for different reasons, are the cases of GdW30 and GdW10. In these systems the magnetic anisotropy arises via the quantum mixture of the ground state with excited multiplets having a nonzero orbital momentum, a process that is usually neglected in lanthanoid SIMs. For GdW30, this results in an easy-plane anisotropy, while GdW10 displays an easy axis magnetic anisotropy.96 Both compounds show the typical SMM behavior at low temperatures (with a frequency-dependent \u03c7\u2032\u2032 signal). Of course, as this effect arises from a mixture with excited states, the anisotropy is rather weak and can only be observed at sub-Kelvin temperatures. In the case of GdW30, even at 200 mK the relaxation rate is still temperature-dependent. These systems were also analyzed as qubit candidates, and decoherence times of the order of T2 = 410 ns were found for diluted samples, at 6 K and with an applied field of 0.1 T. A figure of merit QM = 2\u03a9RT2 > 50 was determined, where WR is the frequency of coherent oscillation for a radiofrequency field hrf = 1 mT and T2 is the spin\u2013spin relaxation time. This parameter is related to the number of coherent quantum operations we are able to perform.96 4.3. Qu-gates on polyoxometalates In the previous discussion we have shown that magnetic POMs can provide useful examples of spin qubits. Here we will take advantage of the possibility of POMs to obtain several spins that can act as qubits to develop some quantum operations by coupling these spins. The starting point for this purpose will be to use those POMs in which an electric control of this spin coupling can be achieved (see Section 3). A first example is provided by [PMo12O40(VO)2]q\u2212 connected to an electric circuit through a STM set up (Fig. 17). As we have pointed out above, in this device one can control the magnetic coupling between the two spins located at the (VO)2+ sites through an electric tunneling current that injects a controlled number of electrons in the central MV Keggin cluster.70 Fig. 17 Top: proposed setup to effect two-qubit gates onto [PMo12O40(VO)2]q\u2212, a mixed-valence POM that combines two localized electrons on the lateral vanadyl groups with a variable number of delocalized electrons in the Keggin core. Bottom: during \u03c4gate the voltage is Vg,on and the Keggin structure hosts an extra electron, which induces a rapid exchange of the vanadyl spins. Adding an accurate time control to this spintronic switch, it can be used as a quantum gate. At the starting point of the graph in Fig. 17 the Keggin cluster has an even number of electrons; this can be achieved with the help of a backgate potential. The quantum operation begins by changing the gate voltage so that an electron tunnels from the tip into the molecule, and ends at a certain \u03c4gate by reverting to the initial voltage so that the electron tunnels back out. The time needed to achieve a SWAP between the left and right spin qubits, as well as the quantum fidelity of the said operation, is a function of J1, JC and the tunnel coupling to the tip \u0393. Several analogue structures have been described (Fig. 18) that could serve as extensions of this scheme.71 In these molecules the complexity of the qubit network is augmented either by using NiII (S = 1) instead of VIV (S = 1/2) or by having four magnetic sites instead of two, or both. Of course, if the proposed experiments with Mo12V2 are already very demanding, further complications can only increase the difficulty. Fig. 18 POMs where two or more localized magnetic moments are linked by polyoxomolybdate units capable of hosting one or more delocalized electrons. (a) [PMo12O40(VO)2]q\u2212, (b) [PMo12O40(Ni(phen))2]2\u2212, (c) [Si2Mo24O80(VO)4]8\u2212, and (d) [Mo12O30(\u03bc2-OH)10H2(Ni(H2O)3)4]. One of the mentioned natural extensions is that of substituting the two S = \u00bd (VO)2+ sites by two S = 1 Ni2+ sites. The magnetic properties of the resulting cluster [PMo12O40(Ni(phen))2]2\u2212 have been discussed in Section 3. If one operates only within the ground MS = \u00b11 doublet, the Ni system seems to be very close to the V analogue. Nevertheless, the spin dynamics and even the allowed quantum processes are expected to be different between an MS = \u00b11/2 and an MS = \u00b11 doublet. Moreover, this system may benefit from the additional MS = 0 singlet, which should enrich the quantum system. Another example is provided by the MV POM [GeV14O40]8\u2212, which was also discussed in Section 3. In this case, just like for [PMo12O40(VO)2]q\u2212 or [PMo12O40(Ni(phen))2]2\u2212, the gating would also happen by the accurate control of the magnetic exchange between the two spin qubits through the application of a short-lived electric field. In quantum information terms, a SWAP gate \u2013 or its square root \u2013 could thus be performed. 5. Concluding remarks The progress of our theoretical understanding, together with the availability of some experimental techniques, has allowed us to change our perspective on POMs and move the focus from the macroscopic to the nanoscopic scale. Indeed, while POMs have always been nano-objects, we have seen how in the history of molecular magnetism they were used merely as models for solid-state phenomena. Spin-localized POMs were studied to deepen our understanding of basic interactions such as (anisotropic) superexchange. In particular, magnetostructural analogies in series of compounds were used in combination with sophisticated Inelastic Neutron Scattering data, which proved to be sensitive not only to the magnitude and anisotropy of the exchange parameters but also to the relative orientation of the exchange anisotropy axes. Complementary processes such as electron transfer and vibronic coupling were studied in spin-delocalized POMs in the search for an understanding of the interplay between magnetic exchange and electron transfer in mesoscopic objects. For example, the magnetic properties of an extremely complex polyoxovanadate system formed by 10 spins delocalized over 18 metal sites were analyzed by means of a combined strategy of ab initio quantum chemistry calculations and exact diagonalizations of a model t-J Hamiltonian. More recently, the impact of POMs has been evolving towards their potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing. The use of POMs as switches or spintronic components can be based on different effects: (i) Control of the number of electrons in the system, or the oxidation state in terms more familiar to chemists, by means of a gate voltage. The best known scheme, based on [PMo12O40(VO)2]q\u2212, defined a class of molecular systems: those where two localized spins are coupled to a redox-active unit. The scheme was exemplified using this mixed-valence POM, for which the model parameters were calculated using an ab initio approach; but the general principles behind this proposal also apply to non-POM molecular systems. (ii) Control of the distribution of charge in the system by means of an electric field, which could be seen as producing a position-dependent chemical potential. In either case, an electrical contact of the molecule with an electronic circuit may provide an external control of its magnetic properties. This observation will open a new trend in unimolecular spintronics. In the future we will see more and more studies devoted to the control of the spin state of a molecule by means of an external stimulus different from a magnetic field. (iii) Minimization of the quantum decoherence. The main problem to design qubits is the minimization of decoherence, particularly from nuclear spins and dipolar interactions. The use of molecular spin qubits offers important advantages, namely reduced decoherence and high reproducibility. Currently, research is oriented towards a better understanding of these basic yet extremely fragile building blocks. In this context, POM chemistry strives to design and offer qubits with the longest possible coherence time. In POM molecules the main sources of quantum decoherence (hyperfine couplings and dipolar spin\u2013spin interactions) can be minimized by preparing nuclear-spin-free compounds and by diluting the magnetic centers, while conserving the crystallinity. The ability of POMs to accommodate the lanthanoids in very different symmetries (D4dvs. C5) also offers the possibility of tuning the magnetic anisotropy in these nanomagnets, while keeping them magnetically isolated (the magnetic ordering in these materials only occurs at very low temperatures; typically below 0.01 K). (iv) Fabrication of quantum gates. The implementation of quantum gates can be seen as an extension of the switching devices. Instead of aiming for a classical switching between two states (ON and OFF), a coherent quantum manipulation may happen during a controlled, short-lived OFF\u2013ON\u2013OFF process, thanks to the long coherence times exhibited by POM qubits. In summary, while magnetic polyoxometalates pose complex theoretical problems and tough experimental challenges in molecular magnetism, these nanomagnets open a window for the manipulation of quantum spins at the molecular level, a nanotechnological feat that would be crucial not only in nanomagnetism but also for molecular spintronics and its applications in quantum computing.

Rev. A 62, 012306 \u2013 Published 13 June 2000 More Article References Citing Articles (702) PDFExport Citation ABSTRACT We apply the full power of modern electronic band-structure engineering and epitaxial heterostructures to design a transistor that can sense and control a single-donor electron spin. Spin-resonance transistors may form the technological basis for quantum information processing. One- and two-qubit operations are performed by applying a gate bias. The bias electric field pulls the electron wave function away from the dopant ion into layers of different alloy composition. Owing to the variation of the g factor ( Si : g = 1.998 , Ge : g = 1.563 ) , this displacement changes the spin Zeeman energy, allowing single-qubit operations. By displacing the electron even further, the overlap with neighboring qubits is affected, which allows two-qubit operations. Certain silicon-germanium alloys allow a qubit spacing as large as 200 nm, which is well within the capabilities of current lithographic techniques. We discuss manufacturing limitations and issues regarding scaling up to a large size computer.

The construction provides an explicit representation of any such state as a mixture of product states. We give upper and lower bounds on the size of the neighborhood, which show that its extent decreases exponentially with the number of qubits. The bounds show that no entanglement appears in the physical states at any stage of present NMR experiments. Though this result raises questions about NMR quantum computation, further analysis would be necessary to assess the power of the general unitary transformations, which are indeed implemented in these experiments, in their action on separable states.

INTRODUCTION\nOver the span of a few years, Majorana zero modes in\ntopological superconductors (SCs) evolved from a largely\ntheoretical topic into an active experimental field at the\nforefront of condensed matter physics [1\u20136]. This trans-\nformation was driven in part by the translation of abstract\nmodels [7,8] into realistic blueprints realizable with estab-\nlished laboratory capabilities (see, e.g., Refs. [9\u201316]).\nProposals based on semiconductor nanowires [13,14]\nprovide a good illustration of this evolution. Within\nthis approach, stabilizing Majorana zero modes requires\nspin-orbit\ncoupling,\nmoderate\nmagnetic\nfields,\nand\nproximity-induced superconductivity.\nFollowing the initial experiments of Mourik et al. [17] in\n2012, several groups reported transport features consistent\nwith Majorana modes in a variety of related superconduc-\ntor-semiconductor systems [18\u201322] (see also Ref. [23]). In\nparallel, fabrication advances [24,25] have improved device\nquality, leading to cleaner transport characteristics [26]\nas well as surprisingly long quasiparticle poisoning times\nin proximitized nanowires [27] and related setups [28].\nBranched wires, another key ingredient toward Majorana\nnetworks [29\u201335], have also been realized and investigated\nrecently [36].\nWith this rapid progress, we anticipate that nanowire-\nbased experiments will soon move beyond the problem\nof Majorana detection to demonstrations of non-Abelian\nstatistics and ultimately to implementations of topological\nquantum information processing [6,37,38]. Our objective in\nthis paper is to facilitate this progression in two ways. First,\nwe propose a new method for manipulation and read out of\nMajorana modes in semiconducting wires that borrows from\nthe quantum-dot toolbox. Second, within this scheme we\noutline a series of milestones that identify the key challenges\nand signature results that connect the current status of\nexperiments to these longer-term challenges.\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of\nthe Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

Here, a\nsemiconducting wire is partially coated with a mesoscopic\nsuperconducting island on the right side and a bulk grounded\nsuperconductorontheleft.Thesuperconductorsareseparated\nby a gate-tunable \u201cvalve\u201d that controls the ratio of the\nJosephson energy EJ to the island\u2019s charging energy EC.\nAdditionally, the wire is subjected to a magnetic field needed\nto form Majorana zero modes. References [39,40] introduced\na very similar device to construct a gate-controlled transmon\nqubit, though herewe are interested in a different regime [41].\nWhen the valve is \u201copen\u201d\u2014i.e., one or more modes in the\nbarrier provide sufficient coupling that the junction\u2019s\nJosephson energy dominates over charging energy\u2014the\nisland hosts a pair of Majorana zero modes \u03b31;2 that encode\natopologicaldegeneracybetweengroundstateswithevenand\nodd fermion parity; see Fig. 1(a). Closing the valve by\ndepleting the barrier renders charging energy dominant over\nthe Josephson energy, lifting the degeneracy of parity eigen-\nstates by converting them into charge states of the island, as\nsketched in Fig. 1(b). We note that this scheme closely\nresembles the \u201cCoulomb-assisted\u201d Majorana manipulation\napproaches described in Refs. [33,34,43] (see also Ref. [44]),\nbutusesdepletiongatesratherthanfluxestocontroltheratioof\nJosephson coupling to charging energy.\nGate tuning of Josephson and Coulomb energies is\nparticularly useful when integrated into devices with\nmultiple islands. For instance, this capability allows\nMajorana zero modes to be initialized by evolving known\ncharge states into degenerate parity eigenstates [e.g.,\nsmoothly passing from Fig. 1(b) to 1(a)], alter the length\nof a topological superconductor by selectively opening and\nclosing valves connecting adjacent islands [45], introduce\nrotations within the ground-state subspace, and braid\nMajorana modes in network geometries. Converting parity\neigenstates back into charge states\u2014an adaptation of \u201cspin-\nto-charge conversion\u201d used in spin qubits\u2014further enables\nread out of the state formed by Majorana modes.\nWe discuss three specific experiments that use these\ncapabilities.\nA. Fusion-rule detection (Sec. III)\nA fundamental property of non-Abelian anyons is their\nbehavior under fusion, which describes how these emergent\nparticles coalesce. In our setups, the topological super-\nconductors\u2019 end points, where Majorana zero modes\nlocalize, essentially realize \u201cIsing\u201d non-Abelian anyons.\nIsing anyons obey a particularly simple fusion rule: pairs\ncan either annihilate or combine into a fermion \u03c8. These\ntwo \u201cfusion channels\u201d correspond to the ordinary fermionic\nstate arising from a pair of hybridized Majorana modes\nbeing empty or filled. The presence of multiple fusion\nchannels intimately relates to non-Abelian statistics, and,\nin fact, is commonly used to define non-Abelian anyons in\nthe first place. Detecting this foundational property has,\nnevertheless, received very little attention.\nWe introduce two experimental methods for probing\nIsing-anyon fusion rules, both invoking a relatively simple\nsingle-wire geometry with two superconducting islands\nand three gate-tunable valves. The first method operates the\nvalves to nucleate a set of anyons and then restore charging\nenergy to fuse them in a manner that accesses the fusion\nchannels with known probabilities; charge sensors detect\nthe fusion outcomes. The second method converts the\nmicroscopic difference between the two fusion channels\ninto a macroscopic current, simplifying the setup by\neliminating\ncharge\nsensing.\nThis\napproach\nuses\na\nMajorana-mediated charge pump to cyclically create and\nfuse anyons, shuttling a Cooper pair across the system\nwhenever the \u03c8 channel appears. As a bonus, the protocols\npermit direct measurement of additional topological data\nfor the underlying anyon theory (see Appendix A) [46], as\nwell as time-domain measurements of device parameters\nsuch as quasiparticle poisoning times, excitation gaps, and\nresidual Majorana-zero-mode splittings.\nB. Topological qubit validation (Sec. IV)\nA single-wire, two-island geometry supporting four\nMajorana modes realizes a prototype topological qubit.\nFIG. 1.\nSemiconducting wire coated with a superconducting\nisland and bulk SC that are bridged by a gate-tunable \u201cvalve.\u201d\nThe valve controls the carrier density in the barrier region and\nthereby modulates the ratio of Josephson energy EJ to the island\ncharging energy EC. In addition, a back gate at voltage Vg tunes\nthe charge on the island. (a) When the valve is open (EJ \u226b EC)\nan applied magnetic field B drives the wire into a topological\nsuperconducting state hosting Majorana zero modes \u03b31;2. The\nsystem thus supports degenerate ground states with even and odd\nfermion parity. (b) Closing the valve (EJ \u226a EC) restores charging\nenergy and converts these parity eigenstates into nondegenerate\nstates with island charges Qo and Qe, as shown on the right.\nThe gate-controlled \u201cparity-to-charge conversion\u201d illustrated here\nis central to the manipulation and read out schemes developed\nin this paper.\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-2\nThe two fixed-parity degenerate ground states available in\nsuch a setup form the logical j0i and j1i states. How can\none validate the topological nature of this qubit (assuming\nthe usual conditions required for topological protection\nare maintained)? For instance, what set of measurements\nwill distinguish a Majorana qubit from a similar setup in\nwhich degenerate ground states instead arise from acci-\ndental zero-energy Andreev bound states? We show that\nthe difference can be found in the coherence times and\noscillation frequency \u03c90 of the qubit. In particular, relax-\nation and dephasing times, T1 and T2, as well as \u03c90, exhibit\nexponential dependence on the (experimentally tunable)\nsplitting of ground states encoded by Majorana modes,\nleading to scaling relations among these quantities that can\nbe used to identify topological protection. Topological\nqubit validation along these lines uses the same setup as\nfusion-rule detection, together with the ability to implement\nqubit rotations via pulsing of gate-tunable valves.\nC. Non-Abelian statistics (Sec. V)\nMoving to branched geometries, we present a new\napproach to demonstrating non-Abelian statistics and the\nassociated fault-tolerant qubit rotations in wire networks.\nThe hallmark of non-Abelian statistics is that such\nexchanges rotate the system\u2019s quantum state within the\ndegenerate ground-state manifold generated by the zero\nmodes; this outcome can be detected using either charge\nsensors or the Majorana-mediated pump introduced earlier.\nConveniently, aside from the need for trijunctions, braiding\nin the setups that we study involves the same capabilities\nrequired for fusion-rule detection.\nThis list of goals aims to demonstrate consequences of\nMajorana zero modes that are directly relevant for long-\nterm quantum computing applications. Fusion-rule detec-\ntion and topological qubit validation stand out as attractive\nnear-term milestones that reveal important aspects of non-\nAbelian anyons along with useful device characteristics.\nBoth classes of experiments should be adaptable to other\nMajorana platforms and manipulation schemes as natural\nprecursors to braiding in comparatively simple geometries.\nSection VI summarizes near-term prospects and elaborates\non several longer-term questions raised by our work.\nII. BUILDING BLOCKS\nIn this section, we describe in greater depth the building\nblocks underlying the manipulation and read out schemes\nused throughout this paper. The backbone of all devices\nis a clean [47] spin-orbit-coupled semiconducting nanowire\nsubjected to both an applied magnetic field and proximity-\ninduced superconductivity\u2014which together allow the\nformation of a topological phase supporting Majorana\nzero modes [13,14]. More precisely, we use mesoscopic\nsuperconductors to proximitize selected regions (islands).\nThe islands contain a macroscopic number of electrons but\nare sufficiently small that charging energies exceed temper-\nature in the Coulomb-dominated regime. At the valve\npositions, the proximitizing metal is interrupted, allowing\ndepletion via nearby electrostatic gates.\nA. Single-island geometry and\nparity-to-charge conversion\nLet us revisit the setup in Fig. 1. The mesoscopic island\non the right forms a Josephson junction, bridged by the\nintervening nanowire segment, with the grounded bulk\nsuperconductor on the left. We assume that beneath the\nisland the nanowire chemical potential is adjusted via\ngates to a value required for topological superconductivity,\nwhile elsewhere a trivial gapped phase always forms.\nUnder this assumption, we model the low-energy properties\nof the junction using a phenomenological Hamiltonian\nH \u00bc HC \u00fe HJ. The first term,\nHC \u00bc EC\u00f0\u02c6n \u2212 n0\u00de2;\n\u00f01\u00de\ndescribes Coulomb effects for the island, with EC the\ncharacteristic charging energy, \u02c6n an integer-valued operator\ngiving the electron occupancy of the island, and n0 a\ncontinuous offset charge, tunable via a nearby electrostatic\ngate at voltage Vg \u221d n0 (see Fig. 1).\nThe second term encodes Josephson coupling. Assuming\nthat the barrier hosts N channels with transmission prob-\nabilities Ti\u00bc1;\u2026;N and that the junction is short on the scale\nof the superconducting coherence length, we model the\nJosephson energy with a Hamiltonian\nHJ \u00bc \u2212\u0394\nX\nN\ni\u00bc1\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n1 \u2212 Tisin2\u00f0\u02c6\u03c6=2\u00de\nq\n:\n\u00f02\u00de\nHere, \u0394 denotes the pairing gap (assumed equal on both\nsides of the valve) that sets a characteristic Josephson\nenergy EJ \u2261 \u00f0\u0394=4\u00de PN\ni\u00bc1 Ti, while the operator ei\u02c6\u03c6 tunnels\na Cooper pair across the junction, incrementing \u02c6n by two.\nEquation (2) recovers the well-known form of the\nJosephson energy that one can derive in the absence of\ncharging energy [49]; see also Ref. [50] for a recent\ndiscussion in a similar context. But is HJ valid also with\nnonzero EC? In the limit EJ \u226b EC one can safely include\nthe charging energy in Eq. (1) as a perturbation to Eq. (2).\nWhen all Ti \u226a 1\u2014corresponding to the opposite limit\nEC \u226b EJ when N is not too large (see below)\u2014the\nJosephson Hamiltonian reduces to\nHJ \u2248 \u2212EJ cos \u02c6\u03c6;\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhich is the familiar weak-tunneling formula expected at\n\u201clarge\u201d charging energy. (See Ref. [51] for a derivation\nin a junction with many weakly coupled channels.) It is\ntherefore reasonable to take H \u00bc HC \u00fe HJ with Eqs. (1)\nMILESTONES TOWARD MAJORANA-BASED QUANTUM \u2026\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-3\nand (2) for both the Josephson- and charging-energy-\ndominated regimes of interest here.\nImportantly, the Hilbert space factorizes into even and\nodd fermion-parity sectors that do not mix under the\ndynamics of H. The space within each sector can be\nspanned with either number \u02c6n eigenstates, which we denote\nby jn \u2208 eveni and jn \u2208 oddi, or phase \u02c6\u03c6 eigenstates with\neven and odd parity, denoted j\u03c6; ei and j\u03c6; oi. These bases\nare related by [44]\nj\u03c6;ei \u221d\nX\nneven\ne\u2212i\u03c6n=2jni; j\u03c6;oi \u221d\nX\nnodd\ne\u2212i\u03c6n=2jni:\n\u00f04\u00de\nWe thus see that in the phase basis, fermion parity is reflected\nin how the wave functions behave under winding the eigen-\nvalue \u03c6 by 2\u03c0; even states are invariant while odd states\nacquire a minus sign [44]. Note also that the Hamiltonian\ndistinguishes opposite-parity states only through charging\nenergy\u2014this is crucial for capturing topological supercon-\nductivity within our phenomenological model.\nIn practice, the junction is expected to support a few\nchannels, each with Ti\u2019s that can be tuned by voltage on a\nlocal gate (valve) acting in the nonproximitized nanowire\nsegment in Fig. 1 [39,40]. We refer to the valve as \u201cclosed\u201d if\nthe gate is adjusted so that the barrier is depleted of carriers,\ncreating a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS)\njunction with all Ti \u2248 0. Charging energy EC for the\nessentially isolated mesoscopic island then dominates over\nthe Josephson energy EJ. Conversely, an \u201copen\u201d valve\nrestores carriers to the barrier and hence boosts the Ti\u2019s,\nideally with at least one of the channels approaching unity\ntransmission. We assume that the maximal Josephson\nenergy in this regime greatly exceeds the charging energy;\ni.e., EJ \u226b EC.\nIt is instructive to first examine the physics of an open\nvalve in the limit EJ=EC \u2192 \u221e. In this case, the phase\ndifference \u02c6\u03c6 between the island and bulk superconductor\nbecomes a classical variable locked at zero. The island\nthen forms a topological superconductor with Majorana\nzero modes \u03b31;2\u2014which satisfy \u03b3i \u00bc \u03b3\u2020\ni and f\u03b3i; \u03b3jg \u00bc\n2\u03b4ij\u2014localized to its ends, as Fig. 1(a) sketches. (We\nneglect the exponentially small overlap among these modes\nfor now, though such corrections will become important\nin later sections.) Accordingly, our phenomenological\nHamiltonian supports degenerate, opposite-parity ground\nstates j\u03c6 \u00bc 0; ei and j\u03c6 \u00bc 0; oi characteristic of this phase.\nThe Majorana-zero-mode operators toggle the system\nbetween these ground states: \u03b3ij\u03c6\u00bc0;e=oi\u221dj\u03c6\u00bc0;o=ei.\nAt large but finite EJ=EC, residual charging energy\nweakly splits this degeneracy (see Appendix B). Adopting\nthe form of HJ in Eq. (3) yields a splitting [52]\n\u0394E \u2248\n32\n\u00f02\u03c02\u00de1=4 EC\n\u0003EJ\nEC\n\u00043=4\ne\u2212\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\np8EJ=EC\ncos\u00f0\u03c0n0\u00de:\n\u00f05\u00de\nNotice that \u0394E vanishes exponentially as EJ=EC increases,\nso that the topological degeneracy remains robust provided\nEJ=EC \u226b 1 [33,34,43,53]. Figure 2(a) sketches the low-\nlying energy levels at EJ=EC \u226b 1 versus the back gate\nvoltage Vg that tunes n0. Red and blue curves respectively\ncorrespond to even- and odd-parity states. It is worth\nemphasizing that Eq. (5) likely overestimates the topologi-\ncal degeneracy splitting in these setups. A more efficient\nsuppression of \u0394E appears if one employs the more general\nform of the Josephson Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) with all\nTi \u2192 1, though the results are otherwise qualitatively\nsimilar; see Appendix B. Our phenomenological model\nalso assumes that the two ends of the junction couple\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFIG. 2.\nEnergy levels versus back gate voltage Vg for the single-island setup in Fig. 1 with the gate-tunable valve (a) fully open,\n(b) partially transmitting, and (c) fully closed. Red and blue curves correspond to states with even and odd electron number. For the open\nconfiguration in (a), Josephson energy EJ dominates charging energy EC. The island thus hosts a pair of Majorana zero modes that\nencode an approximate twofold topological ground-state degeneracy. Residual charging energy splits the degeneracy, but only by an\namount \u0394E exponentially small in EJ=EC. Closing the valve effectively ramps up Coulomb effects, which dominate in the fully closed\nconfiguration of (c). There, the eigenstates are generally nondegenerate (except with fine-tuning) and carry well-defined island charges\n\u2026Q \u2212 1; Q; Q \u00fe 1\u2026, as labeled on the right. Crucially, the topologically degenerate ground states smoothly evolve into nondegenerate\ncharge eigenstates as the valve closes\u2014signifying parity-to-charge conversion. The red and blue dots illustrate this phenomenon at one\nparticular gate voltage indicated by the vertical dashed line.\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-4\nweakly on the scale of the pairing gap since only Cooper-\npair tunneling is included. The validity of this assumption is\nnot obvious in the maximally open valve configuration. The\nopposite strong hybridization limit requires a more micro-\nscopic treatment of the junction that will not be pursued\nhere but may suppress the degeneracy splitting further still.\nFinally, we note that the parameter EC may renormalize\ndownward as the Ti\u2019s increase from zero [54], thus also\nreducing the splittings compared to estimates based on EC\nextracted for an isolated island (see also Sec. II D).\nAs the valve is closed more and more, the ratio EJ=EC\ndecreases to values of order 1, leading to the situation in\nFig. 2(b). Going further, the fully closed valve gives\nEJ=EC \u2192 0. Energy eigenstates in this limit are charac-\nterized by well-defined island charges, as illustrated in\nFig. 2(c). We do not refer to the island as topological in\nthis charging-energy-dominated regime. Except with fine-\ntuning, the system admits a unique ground state, and hence\nMajorana zero modes are absent [56]. The lack of an offset\nfor even- versus odd-charge parabolas in Fig. 2(c) does,\nhowever, reflect a remnant of the zero modes that exist\nwhen charging energy is quenched; indeed, the island can\nstill accommodate an odd number of electrons without\npaying the pairing energy \u0394 [44,57]. This property alters\nthe even-odd pattern for Coulomb blockade relative to a\nmore conventional superconducting dot. Small residual\nJosephson coupling EJ=EC \u2260 0 merely produces avoided\ncrossings between levels with common charge parity.\nFigures 2(a)\u20132(c) illustrate an essential feature in our\nproposal: The topologically degenerate parity eigenstates\nsmoothly and uniquely evolve into nondegenerate charge\nstates upon closing an initially open valve, and vice versa.\nThis is the phenomenon of parity-to-charge conversion\nintroduced briefly in Sec. I. As a trial application, suppose\nthat one begins in a closed-valve configuration with the\nisolated island relaxed into its unique charge ground state.\nSlowly opening the valve nucleates Majorana zero modes\nand deterministically (and reproducibly) initializes the\nsystem into one of the two degenerate parity ground states.\nPassing instead from degenerate parity states to charge\nstates in a useful way requires an important implicit\nassumption invoked throughout this paper: When a valve\ncloses, the energy difference between the lowest two charge\nstates must not exceed the quasiparticle gap \u0394bulk for the\nadjacent bulk superconductor, which prevents charge from\nescaping from the islands. Such a condition is always\nsatisfied if \u0394bulk > EC. Figure 2(c) illustrates this criterion\ngraphically.\nB. Two-island geometry\nWe now extend the preceding discussion to the two-\nisland geometry shown in Figs. 3(a)\u20133(d). The device\ncontains three valves to control the Josephson coupling\nto the leads and between the two islands.\nWe model the two-island setup with a Hamiltonian\nH0 \u00bc H0\nC \u00fe H0\nJ analogous to that used earlier. Let \u02c6nL\u00f0R\u00de\ndenote the electron number operator for the left (right)\nisland, and ei\u02c6\u03c6L\u00f0R\u00de move a Cooper pair from the left (right)\nisland\ninto\nthe\nadjacent\nouter\nbulk\nsuperconductor.\nCoulomb interactions are described by\nH0\nC \u00bc\nX\na\u00bcL;R\nEC\u00f0\u02c6na \u2212 n0;a\u00de2;\n\u00f06\u00de\nwhere n0;L=R are tunable offset charges for the islands. We\nneglect cross capacitance, which is small in this geometry.\nIn practice, we find experimentally that cross capacitances\nin a double-dot nanowire geometry are typically less than\n0.1 of the total capacitance for each dot.\nFor the Josephson coupling we write\nH0\nJ \u00bc HJ;L \u00fe HJ;R \u00fe HJ;inter:\n\u00f07\u00de\nThe first two terms represent straightforward generaliza-\ntions of Eq. (2) for the left and right junctions while HJ;inter\nhybridizes the two islands. This last term requires some\nFIG. 3.\nGeometries utilized for the proposed milestone experiments.

Various interesting regimes are possible\ndepending on the valve configurations: When cut off from the outer bulk superconductors, the islands can (a) form independent double\nquantum dots or (b) effectively combine into a single dot. Restoring the connection to the outer superconductors quenches charging\nenergy and generates topological superconductivity on the islands.

In the Josephson-dominated regime the\nislands form topological superconductors that couple not\nonly through Cooper-pair tunneling but also through the\nMajorana-mediated fractional Josephson effect that coher-\nently transfers unpaired electrons yielding an anomalous\n4\u03c0-periodic current-phase relation [8].

If all trans-\nmission probabilities are small, the latter reduces to the\nfamiliar expression [8]\nHFJE \u00bc \u2212\u0393\u03c3x cos \u00bd\u00f0\u02c6\u03c6R \u2212 \u02c6\u03c6L\u00de=2\u0002;\n\u00f09\u00de\nwhere \u0393 > 0 and the operator \u03c3x flips the island parities\nwhen acting on phase eigenstates. (Away from the weak-\ntransmission limit higher harmonics can arise, similar\nto the usual Josephson coupling.) The central valve in\nFigs. 3(a)\u20133(d) turns both Ti;M and \u0393 \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d in\ntandem.\nAdjusting the three valves allows access to several\nuseful\nconfigurations.\nWith\nall\nthree\nvalves\nclosed\n[Fig. 3(a)], the islands form independent quantum dots\n(except for cross capacitance) with energy eigenstates\ncharacterized by well-defined charges on each island.\nOpening the central valve [Fig. 3(b)] strongly Josephson\ncouples the islands, which then behave as a single\nisolated dot with energy eigenstates carrying fixed total\ncharge. Opening the outer valves [Fig. 3(c)] converts the\nisolated dot into a topological superconductor hosting a\npair of Majorana zero modes that encode degeneracy\nbetween even- and odd-parity ground states. And finally,\nreclosing the middle valve [Fig. 3(d)] cuts the topological\nsuperconductor in half, nucleating a second pair of\nMajorana zero modes that yield a twofold degeneracy\nwithin each total parity sector. The flexibility afforded by\nthis two-island geometry enables both fusion-rule detec-\ntion and topological qubit validation. Moreover, the\nmanipulations possible in this setting generalize naturally\nto more elaborate geometries including the trijunction in\nFig. 3(e) employed for braiding.\nC. Read out methods\nDetecting the state formed by a topological supercon-\nductor after some prescribed sequence of manipulations\ncan be achieved by closing the appropriate valves to\nconvert degenerate parity ground states into charge states\n(Figs. 1 and 2), which can then be readily measured via\ncharge detection [58,59].\nThe most direct read out method uses charge sensing of\nan isolated island, accomplished with capacitive coupling\nto a proximal sensor such as a quantum point contact or a\nquantum dot. This technique is routinely used for read out\nin spin qubits [60\u201362]. Quantum-dot charge sensors have\nalso been implemented in nanowires, obtaining couplings\nsimilar to the GaAs case [63,64]. Based on these experi-\nments, high-quality charge read out (signal-to-noise ratio\n\u223c5, corresponding to 99% fidelity) should be achievable\nwith \u03c4M \u00bc 1 \u03bcs integration time. Single-shot read out is\npossible when the charge state\u2019s lifetime\u2014which is set by\npoisoning events and relaxation processes\u2014exceeds \u03c4M\nat the measurement point. Even if this criterion is not\nsatisfied, read out may be performed over several identical\ncycles to obtain the expectation value for the island charge.\nAlternatively, one can employ dispersive read out, which\nmeasures changes in the average charge hQi of a device by\nprobing its quantum capacitance \u2202hQi=\u2202Vg. This tech-\nnique is experimentally well established for both semi-\nconductor quantum dots [65,66], including InAs nanowires\n[67], as well as conventional Cooper-pair boxes [68]. To\nadapt dispersive read out for parity measurements, one\ncould operate the superconducting island in the intermedi-\nate regime EJ=EC \u223c 1 and tune close to an avoided crossing\nfor one of the parity states [see Fig. 2(b)]. At such a point,\nthe quantum capacitance is maximal for the parity asso-\nciated with the avoided crossing, while the lower-energy,\nopposite-parity state exhibits a stable charge configuration\nand thus admits a rather small quantum capacitance. Read\nout can therefore proceed by detecting the capacitance\ndifference between these states [69]. Based on experiments\nin InAs nanowires, dispersive parity read out should be\npossible with less than a millisecond of integration time\nusing standard amplifiers [67], or much faster with nearly\nquantum-limited amplifiers [71].\nFinally, we consider an approach based on continuous\ncyclic gate operation, which requires fast gate operation but\nallows slow, time-averaged read out. For now, we simply\nprovide a glimpse of the recipe; a detailed discussion\nappears in Sec. III C. Consider again the double-dot\nconfiguration in Fig. 3(a), and suppose that we wish to\ndistinguish two different charge states C1 and C2 that\nevolve from topologically degenerate states under parity-\nto-charge conversion. Under an appropriate gate-voltage\ncycle, one can arrange to have charge q shuttled across the\nsystem if C1 appears, but not if C2 appears. Repeating the\nentire process with a frequency f then produces a pumping\ncurrent I \u00bc Pqf, where P denotes the probability for\nobtaining state C1. Majorana modes enter the story in that\nthey fix very precise values for the probability P dependent\non how the user manipulates the topological superconduc-\ntors prior to read out. One can thereby detect the ensemble-\naveraged outcome of fusion-rule experiments, topological\nqubit manipulations, and even braiding through dc current\nmeasurements.\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-6\nD. Operating requirements and\noptimization strategies\nVarying Josephson-to-charging energy ratios via gate-\ntunable valves provides an all-electrical alternative to the\nrelated proposals in Refs. [33,34,43]. The latter studies\noperate solely in the EJ \u226b EC regime, control EJ=EC using\nlocal magnetic-flux tuning in split junctions, and perform\nread out by measuring the frequency of a transmission line\nresonator. Our approach, by contrast, utilizes charge-based\nread out methods outlined in Sec. II C and requires tuning\nbetween the Josephson- and charging-energy-dominated\nlimits. More precisely, we demand\n\u0003EJ\nEC\n\u0004\nmax\n\u226b 1;\n\u0003EJ\nEC\n\u0004\nmin\n\u2272 1;\nEC \u2273 kBT;\n\u00f010\u00de\nwhere EJ refers to the Josephson coupling between an\nisland and a trivial bulk superconductor [72]. The first\ncriterion in Eq. (10) minimizes unwanted topological\ndegeneracy splitting due to residual Coulomb effects in\nopen-valve configurations (see Sec. II A) and is essential\nfor providing a reasonable window between the upper and\nlower speed limits at which our proposed protocols should\nproceed; see Sec. III B 2 and Ref. [73] for in-depth\ndiscussions. The second and third criteria facilitate read\nout of isolated islands bordered by closed valves. Note that\nfor these latter criteria EC refers to closed-valve, unrenor-\nmalized charging energies (see below) [74]. The extent to\nwhich one can satisfy these inequalities constitutes an\nimportant figure of merit for our scheme.\nIn practice, we expect the second and third inequalities to\nbe readily satisfied: One can efficiently reduce EJ near zero\nby fully depleting a given barrier, while charging energies\nfor isolated islands can easily exceed temperature (typical\nbare EC values correspond to a few tenths of a kelvin).\nThe first inequality, on the other hand, requires more\ncare in our setups, though we anticipate that values of\n\u00f0EJ=EC\u00demax \u223c 10\u2013100 can be realized with fully open\nbarriers and optimized capacitance.\nFirst, as alluded to in Sec. II A, EC is expected to\nrenormalize downwards as a valve is opened. To contextu-\nalize this point, for a superconducting island coupled to a\nnormal lead via a single fully transmitting channel, the\ncharging energy is known to renormalize all the way to zero\n[75]. For thepresentsuperconductor-normal-superconductor\n(SNS) junctions of interest, the extent of this renormalization\nis still unknown, but it is not unreasonable to expect\nsubstantial boosts in the achievable EJ=EC ratios from this\neffect alone.\nFeasible options are available, however, even in the\nworst-case scenario of negligible renormalization. Most\nsimply, one can increase the length of the islands and/or\nthickness of the superconducting shells to increase their\ncapacitance and decrease EC [76]. One can also connect\nthe shells to larger superconducting islands to efficiently\nreduce EC; Refs. [39,40] employed this strategy in closely\nrelated nontopological transmonlike qubits with reported\ncharging energies of a few mK. [Contrary to those works,\nhowever, we require the third inequality in Eq. (10), so EC\nshould not be decreased too substantially.] Yet another\noption is to connect the islands to trivial superconducting\nwires that form gate-tunable Josephson junctions with\nconventional grounded bulk superconductors, as illustrated\nin Fig. 4 for a two-island setup. Because these \u201cshunt\njunctions\u201d are trivial on both ends, the wire mediating the\nJosephson coupling may host many channels and yield\ncorrespondingly large EJ values without spoiling the\nMajorana physics of interest. By contrast, the upper wire\nin Fig. 4 that harbors the Majorana modes should support\nonly a few channels and thus carry a relatively large\nnormal-state resistance.\nWhile we hereafter concentrate on minimalist setups\nbased on Figs. 1 and 3, the above variations offer practical\nalternatives that facilitate satisfying the operating require-\nments of Eq. (10) and may be straightforwardly substituted\ninto all of our proposed experiments.\nIII. FUSION-RULE DETECTION\nA. Motivation\nOne of the signature properties of non-Abelian anyons\nis their exotic exchange statistics: Braiding these particles\nrotates the host system\u2019s quantum state within a degen-\nerate ground-state manifold. An intimately related and\nequally fundamental property is that non-Abelian anyons\nexhibit nontrivial \u201cfusion rules.\u201d That is, they can coalesce\nto yield multiple quasiparticle types. One can understand\nthe connection between non-Abelian statistics and non-\ntrivial fusion rules by examining the evolution of ground\nstates. Non-Abelian braiding properties require that the\nanyons possess zero-energy degrees of freedom that\nnonlocally encode ground-state\ndegeneracy.\nBringing\ntwo non-Abelian anyons together hybridizes these degrees\nof freedom and thus generically splits the initial ground-\nstate manifold into a (smaller) ground-state set and excited\nFIG. 4.\nAlternative two-island setup involving trivial super-\nconducting wires forming gate-tunable Josephson junctions with\nconventional bulk superconductors. This shunt-junction configu-\nration is expected to more efficiently quench the island charging\nenergy in the open-valve configuration shown here. Indeed, the\nvertical wires can support N \u226b 1 channels (unlike the horizontal\nwire hosting Majorana modes), thus enhancing the maximum\nJosephson energy EJ.\nMILESTONES TOWARD MAJORANA-BASED QUANTUM \u2026\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-7\nstates. Each distinct energy then corresponds to a different\npossible fusion product for the anyons.\nIn the present context the ends of 1D topological\nsuperconductors behave as Ising non-Abelian anyons,\ndenoted \u03c3, and the Majorana zero modes that they bind\nconstitute the degrees of freedom guaranteeing degeneracy.\nThese anyons obey the fusion rule\n\u03c3 \u00d7 \u03c3 \u00bc I \u00fe \u03c8;\n\u00f011\u00de\nwhich indicates that two \u03c3\u2019s can fuse into the trivial particle\nI (i.e., they can annihilate) or a fermion \u03c8 [77]. The fusion\noutcomes on the right side simply reflect the fact that two\nMajorana modes brought together form an ordinary, finite-\nenergy fermionic level that can be either vacant (I) or filled\n(\u03c8). Figure 5 summarizes the relation between statistics and\nfusion rules for this case.\nA comparison may help contextualize the connection\nbetween non-Abelian statistics and fusion. Consider a\npair of isolated spin s \u00bc 1=2 moments each with degen-\nerate \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d levels. When brought together,\nthe spins experience exchange coupling that splits the\ndegeneracy\ninto\n(say)\na\nlower\nsinglet\nwith\ntotal\nspin stot \u00bc 0 and an upper triplet with stot \u00bc 1. These\nquantum numbers follow from the familiar angular-\nmomentum\naddition\nrule\n1=2 \u00d7 1=2 \u00bc 0 \u00fe 1,\nwhich\nappears reminiscent of Eq. (11). A crucial distinction\nexists, however. In the spin example, a perturbation such\nas a local Zeeman field splits the degeneracy even when\nthe spins are well separated. By contrast, no local\nperturbation can split the degeneracy encoded by distant\nnon-Abelian anyons since the corresponding ground\nstates are locally indistinguishable. Fusion of non-\nAbelian excitations thus involves degeneracy lifting of\na very special nature.\nFusion rules like Eq. (11) can even serve to define the\nnon-Abelian character of anyons. Specifically, non-Abelian\nstatistics implies multiple fusion outcomes, and vice\nversa [78,79]. References [29,80] proposed schemes for\ndetecting fusion rules in nanowires and cold atoms setups.\nRelated ideas in a quantum-Hall context appear even earlier\n[81]. Below, we develop two new approaches for demon-\nstrating this milestone based on the two-island setup from\nFigs. 3(a)\u20133(d).\nB. Fusion rules via charge sensing\n1. Idealized limit\nWe first outline the charge-sensing fusion-rule experi-\nment in the ideal case, i.e., with exactly zero overlap\nbetween Majorana zero modes (when present), infinite\ntunability of Josephson-to-charging energy ratios, no\nquasiparticle poisoning, and limitless patience of exper-\nimentalists conducting the measurements. Under these\nassumptions all manipulations we describe below proceed\npurely adiabatically. Section III B 2 discusses corrections\nresulting from inevitable nonidealities.\nThe protocol begins from the topmost configuration\nof Fig. 6, wherein the central valve remains open but\nthe outer valves are closed. In this configuration, the\ntwo islands\u2014which strongly Josephson couple to one\nanother\u2014effectively form a single Coulomb-blockaded\nquantum dot with a unique ground state jQtoti characterized\nby a fixed total charge Qtot. (Here and below, we assume\nthat potentials on the islands are not fine-tuned to give\naccidentally degenerate charge states.) Suppose that we\ninitialize the system into this ground state and, as a warm-\nup control experiment, carry out the following steps\ndepicted in the right path of the figure:\n(b1) Close the central valve. The system then evolves\ninto a double dot with unique ground state jQL; QRi,\nwhere QL=R denote the charges on the left or right islands\n(which of course sum to Qtot).\n(b2) Open the outer valves. Quenching the charging\nenergy in this manner drives the islands into topological\nsuperconductors with Majorana zero modes \u03b31;\u2026;4 enumer-\nated from left to right as in the figure. Let\nFIG. 5.\nCorrespondence between non-Abelian statistics and\nnontrivial\nfusion\nrules\nfor\nIsing\nanyons\n\u03c3\nthat\nobey\n\u03c3 \u00d7 \u03c3 \u00bc I \u00fe \u03c8.

Adiabatically braid-\ning a pair of anyons sends \u03c8i \u2192 Uij\u03c8j, where Uij denotes the\nbraid matrix. Bottom: Alternatively fusing the pair of anyons\nhybridizes the associated Majorana modes and splits the twofold\nground-state degeneracy. The lower and upper states correspond\nto the Ising anyons coalescing into the identity \u00f0I\u00de and fermion\n\u00f0\u03c8\u00de fusion channels. While fusion and braiding are intimately\nlinked, establishing the former experimentally is expected to be\nmuch simpler; see Figs. 6 and 7.\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS. REV.

Since the topological superconductors\nemerged from decoupled islands, it is conceptually useful\nto envision this step as pulling Ising anyons binding \u03b31 and\n\u03b32 out of the vacuum, and similarly for \u03b33 and \u03b34. (Figure 6\nlinks such Majorana pairs with dashed lines.) The system\ntherefore evolves into a state with well-defined values of\nn12 and n34. Without loss of generality, we assume that\nthese occupation numbers both vanish, yielding a wave\nfunction j012; 034i [82]. We have now prepared a system\nwith four non-Abelian anyons and initialized into one of\nthe two degenerate ground states available when total\nfermion parity is fixed.\n(b3) Close the outer valves. This final step removes\nthe ground-state degeneracy by resurrecting charging\nenergy\u2014thus fusing the very same pairs of non-Abelian\nanyons nucleated from the vacuum above. The system then\nsimply retraces its footsteps back to the double-dot state\njQL; QRi initialized at the end of step (b1). A charge-\nsensing measurement of either island here clearly yields a\nunique outcome. In terms of the fusion rule in Eq. (11), the\nsequence concluded here deterministically reveals only\nfusion channel I. Of course the same deterministic charge\nmeasurement would also occur for nontopological super-\nconducting islands.\nThis so-far unremarkable conclusion establishes a very\nuseful baseline. A much more interesting scenario appears\nif we merely swap the order in which we apply steps (b1)\nand (b2) from the preceding control protocol, thereby\nfollowing the left path in Fig. 6. Let us begin anew from\nthe state jQtoti in the topmost configuration of the figure\nand explore this alternative sequence in some detail:\n(a1) Open the outer valves. Because the islands are now\nwell Josephson coupled, this process generates a single\ntopological superconductor and pulls Ising anyons binding\nMajorana zero modes \u03b31 and \u03b34 out of the vacuum. One can\nassemble these modes into a complex fermion operator,\nf14 \u00bc \u00f0\u03b31 \u00fe i\u03b34\u00de=2;\n\u00f013\u00de\nwhose occupation number n14 takes on a unique value due\nto global fermion parity conservation. The system therefore\nevolves into the quantum state j014i.\n(a2) Close the central valve. Quenching the Josephson\ncoupling between the islands effectively slices the topo-\nlogical superconductor in half. Consequently, a second pair\nof Ising anyons with Majorana zero modes \u03b32 and \u03b33\nappears opposite the middle valve. Similarly defining a\nfermion\nf23 \u00bc \u00f0\u03b32 \u00fe i\u03b33\u00de=2\n\u00f014\u00de\nwith occupation number n23, we then arrive at the state\nj014; 023i. In the basis introduced in Eq. (12), this state\nequivalently reads [83]\nj014; 023i \u00bc 1\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n2\np \u00f0j012; 034i \u00fe j112; 134i\u00de:\n\u00f015\u00de\nThe superposition on the right side merely reflects a basis\nchange related to so-called F symbols for Ising anyons;\nsee Appendix A. In the ideal case, where the topological\nground-state degeneracy is exact and immune to noise,\nthis state does not dephase. This sequence prepares four\nnon-Abelian anyons as before\u2014in fact, in an ostensibly\nidentical setup\u2014but, interestingly, initializes the system\ninto a different degenerate ground state that maximally\nentangles the two decoupled islands.\nFIG. 6.\nProtocol to detect the Ising-anyon fusion rule \u03c3 \u00d7 \u03c3 \u00bc\nI \u00fe \u03c8 via charge sensing. The device contains two superconduct-\ning islands (red) Josephson coupled to outer trivial bulk super-\nconductors (blue); intervening gate-tunable valves control the\nJosephson-to-charging-energy ratios. The system is initialized\ninto a unique ground state by opening the middle valve while\nclosing the outer valves. In the control experiment (right path),\nthe middle valve closes before opening the outer valves, thus\nnucleating out of the vacuum two pairs of Ising anyons binding\nMajorana modes \u03b31;2 and \u03b33;4, as indicated by dashed lines.\nReclosing the outer valves fuses these same pairs back into the\nvacuum, corresponding to the I fusion channel. Charge read out\non the islands is correspondingly deterministic. Instead, closing\nthe middle valve after opening the outer valves (left path) first\nnucleates Ising anyons binding \u03b31;4 and later \u03b32;3. Closing the\nouter valves now fuses the anyons in a nontrivial way that\naccesses both the I and \u03c8 fusion channels. This leads to an equal-\namplitude superposition of states in the measurement basis and\nthus probabilistic charge read out.\nMILESTONES TOWARD MAJORANA-BASED QUANTUM \u2026\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-9\n(a3) Close the outer valves. Restoring charging energy\nonce again removes the ground-state degeneracy; this\nprocess fuses the anyons binding \u03b31 and \u03b32, and also the\npair binding \u03b33 and \u03b34. Notably, these are not the same pairs\nnucleated from the vacuum, contrary to the left sequence in\nFig. 6, which allows us to now access both fusion channels\non the right side of Eq. (11). As we restore charging energy,\nj012; 034i evolves into the unique ground state jQL; QRi,\nprecisely as noted earlier. The wave function j112; 134i\ninstead evolves into an excited state with opposite\ncharge parities on the islands compared to jQL; QRi. We\nassume for concreteness that the gates are adjusted such\nthat the excited state corresponds to a charge configuration\njQL \u2212 1; QR \u00fe 1i. With this assumption, the state in\nEq. (15) becomes\n1\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n2\np \u00f0jQL; QRi \u00fe ei\u03b1jQL \u2212 1; QR \u00fe 1i\u00de;\n\u00f016\u00de\nwhere the first and second terms respectively reflect\nfusion into the I and \u03c8 channels. Contrary to the state\nin Eq. (15), the superposition in Eq. (16) would dephase\nquickly in practice due to charge noise that produces the\nnonuniversal phase \u03b1 indicated above. This phase is\nirrelevant, however, since it is in any case invisible in\nour measurement scheme. More importantly, charge\nmeasurement of an island at the end of this sequence\nis probabilistic, returning even and odd electron numbers\nfor a given island with equal probability.\nThe control experiment laid out earlier distinguishes\nthis interesting scenario\u2014which is deeply rooted in the\nnontrivial anyon fusion rules\u2014from a boring \u201cnoisy\u201d\nexperiment with rapid charge fluctuations. One may\nworry that the nontrivial protocol may happen to be\nmore susceptible to charge fluctuations than the control\nprotocol, since the intermediate steps are not exactly the\nsame. Additional control experiments can rule out such a\nscenario. For example, one can perform the protocols in\nFig. 6 with magnetic fields and/or back gate voltages\nadjusted so that the islands definitely do not support\nMajorana modes; the measurement outcomes should then\nbe identical for both the control and nontrivial sequences.\nObserving this expected outcome would provide further\nevidence for fusion rules underlying the path dependence\nfor the topological case.\nIt is worth remarking that probabilistic read out already\nsuffices to demonstrate multiple fusion channels. We stress\nthat the equal probabilities we predict here reflect more\ndetailed topological information for the anyon theory. In\nparticular, these probabilities are given by ratios of appro-\npriate quantum dimensions of particles in the topological\nquantum field theory or, equivalently in this case, by the\nabsolute value of certain F symbols [38]. We discuss these\npoints in detail in Appendix A.\nAlthough we are not probing non-Abelian statistics,\nthere is a distinct \u201cnon-Abelianness\u201d to this fusion rule\nexperiment: The two sequences we outline above apply\nprecisely the same adiabatic manipulations in a different\norder yet deliver dramatically different results. In a refer-\nence nontopological system with no Majorana zero modes,\nthe ground state would generically be unique throughout,\nnegating any such nontrivial path dependence under\nadiabatic evolution, as nicely emphasized in Ref. [80].\n2. Practical considerations\nWith the ideal schemes fleshed out, we now highlight\nseveral practical issues pertinent for experimental imple-\nmentation. First, as with any experiment, it is technically\npossible to obtain measurements in a nontopological setup\nthat emulate our predictions based on nontrivial fusion\nrules. We stress, however, that such a scenario is highly\nimprobable and requires multiple levels of fine-tuning. For\none, accidental degeneracies would be required. Suppose,\nfor example, that a trivial system harbors a pair of fine-\ntuned zero-energy Andreev bound states located opposite\nthe (closed) middle valve; for an illustration, see Fig. 9(b).\nAlthough the right path of Fig. 6 again trivially decouples\nthe islands, the left path can entangle the two sides.\n(Without degeneracy, adiabatic evolution would preclude\nthe latter.) Importantly, however, the probabilities for even\nand odd charges at the end of the left path in Fig. 6 would\ngenerically differ without additional fine-tuning beyond\nthat needed for accidental degeneracy. In sharp contrast, the\nIsing-anyon fusion rules rigidly lock these probabilities\ntogether in the topological setup.\nNext, we quantify the upper speed limit over which the\nsteps in Fig. 6 can be conducted while effectively remain-\ning adiabatic. Quite generally, this speed limit is set by the\nminimal gap for accessible excited states (which should\nremain unoccupied) during a given stage of the protocol.\nThe rate for all steps must certainly fall below the pairing\nenergy \u0394 for the islands to avoid generating unwanted\nBogoliubov\u2013de\nGennes\nquasiparticles.\nWhen\nclosing\nvalves in steps (a3), (b1), and (b3) from Fig. 6, we must\nalso avoid producing spurious excited charge configura-\ntions that would corrupt initialization and read out of the\nanyons. [For example, rapidly shutting the middle valve in\n(b1) would yield an entangled superposition of various\ncharge states for the islands rather than the unique ground\nstate jQL; QRi.] Charging energy EC determines the rate\nlimit required to sidestep this type of corruption. These\nconsiderations indicate that the protocols in Fig. 6 approxi-\nmate adiabatic evolution if carried out over a time scale\ntprotocol \u226b max\n\u0005\u210f\n\u0394 ; \u210f\nEC\n\u0006\n\u00f0adiabatic criterion\u00de:\n\u00f017\u00de\nThis standard criterion can be justified by analyzing\nthe protocol steps using the phenomenological model\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-10\ndescribed in Sec. II; see Ref. [73]. To quantify the times we\nassume a pairing gap near 1 K and a charging energy on the\nsame scale (which is not unreasonable for islands a few\nmicrons in length). With these simple estimates, Eq. (17)\nbecomes tprotocol \u226b 10 ps.\nIn practice, the fusion-rule protocols also face a lower\nspeed limit due to both quasiparticle poisoning and residual\nsplitting of the ground-state degeneracies encoded by the\nMajorana modes. To appreciate constraints from the for-\nmer, suppose that one carried out the right control sequence\nfrom Fig. 6 on a time scale much longer than the poisoning\ntime tpoisoning. While the outer valves remain open, stray\nquasiparticles can leak onto the islands, stochastically\nflipping the occupation numbers n12 and n34. Distinction\nfrom the nontrivial right sequence from Fig. 6 is then lost.\nOne must therefore maintain\ntprotocol \u226a tpoisoning\n\u00f0poisoning limitation\u00de\n\u00f018\u00de\nto suppress poisoning events that obscure fusion-rule\ndetection.\nThe\nsecond\nissue\u2014unintentional\nground-state-\ndegeneracy\nlifting\u2014originates\nfrom\nseveral\nsources:\n(i) wave function overlap of Majorana modes opposite a\ngiven island, (ii) overlap of Majorana modes from neigh-\nboring islands, and (iii) residual charging energy present\neven when the outer valves are maximally open. Stages of\nthe protocol where ideally exact degeneracies appear must\ntranspire at a rate faster than the resulting energy splittings\nEsplitting, i.e.,\ntprotocol \u226a tsplitting\n\u00f0degeneracy limitation\u00de;\n\u00f019\u00de\nwith tsplitting \u2261 \u210f=Esplitting. Satisfying this inequality ensures\nthat time evolution due to residual splitting is unimportant.\nLet us quantify each of the three contributing sources\nnoted above to get a rough sense for the time scales\nrequired.\n(i) Majorana overlap across a single island yields a\nsplitting that scales, modulo an oscillatory prefactor, like\nE\u00f0i\u00de\nsplitting \u223c \u0394e\u2212L=\u03be, where L and \u03be denote the size of the\nisland and induced coherence length, respectively (see, e.g.,\nSupplemental Material of Ref. [84]). Taking \u03be \u00bc 500 nm,\nL \u00bc 3 \u03bcm, and a 1 K pairing energy gives E\u00f0i\u00de\nsplitting \u223c 3 mK.\nThis yields a time scale t\u00f0i\u00de\nsplitting \u223c 3 ns.\n(ii) Overlap of the outermost Majorana modes \u03b31 and \u03b34\nin Fig. 6 generically contributes a tiny splitting compared to\nthat considered above. Splitting due to hybridization of \u03b32\nand \u03b33 across the central (closed) valve is more important to\nestimate. Suppose that the nanowire hosts carriers with\neffective mass m, spin-orbit coupling \u03b1, and a Zeeman field\nVZ that exceeds the proximity-induced pairing energy \u0394 as\nrequired for topological superconductivity in the islands\n[13,14]. We model the barrier between the islands as a\nregion of length W with a chemical potential shifted below\nthe band bottom by an amount U that is large compared to\nother energy scales for the wire. The overlap of the inner\nMajorana modes then scales as e\u2212W=\u03beU, with \u03beU \u00bc\n\u210f=\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n2mU\np\n. Moreover, using the canonical single-band wire\nHamiltonian from Refs. [13,14] in the large-field limit\nVZ \u226b m\u03b12, \u0394 for simplicity, we find a splitting of [85]\nE\u00f0ii\u00de\nsplitting \u2248 \u0394\n\u0003m\u03b1\u03beU\n\u210f\n\u0004\ne\u2212W=\u03beU:\n\u00f020\u00de\nConsider reasonable parameters \u0394 \u00bc 1 K, W \u00bc 100 nm,\nU \u00bc 2 meV, \u03b1 \u00bc 2 \u00d7 104 m=s,\nand m \u00bc 0.05me\n(me\ndenotes the bare electron mass) as appropriate for wurtzite\nInAs wires [86].

Suppose that EC \u00bc 0.5 K.\nWith EJ \u00bc 2 K, one gets E\u00f0iii\u00de\nsplitting \u2248 75 mK and t\u00f0iii\u00de\nsplitting \u2248\n0.1 ns, while a larger EJ \u00bc 5 K yields E\u00f0iii\u00de\nsplitting \u2248 6 mK and\nt\u00f0iii\u00de\nsplitting \u2248 1 ns. Still more favorable numbers appear with a\nmodestly reduced EC \u00bc 0.2 K (recall the discussion in\nSec. II D): In this case, EJ \u00bc 2 K yields E\u00f0iii\u00de\nsplitting \u2248 2 mK\nand\nt\u00f0iii\u00de\nsplitting \u2248 3 ns,\nwhile\nEJ \u00bc 5 K\ngives\nE\u00f0iii\u00de\nsplitting \u2248\n0.02 mK and t\u00f0iii\u00de\nsplitting \u2248 300 ns.\nWe have intentionally used conservative numbers in the\nestimates above. The Esplitting values that result already\nsuggest a comfortable window between the upper and\nlower speed limits for the fusion-rule protocol. We stress,\nhowever, that the splittings could be reduced by orders of\nmagnitude\u2014thus widening the window further still\u2014by,\ne.g., lengthening the islands and optimizing the efficacy of\ngate-tunable valves in the setup. We also reiterate that the\nexpression used in Eq. (21) likely overestimates the\nCoulomb contribution (see Secs. II A and II D).\nSatisfying Eqs. (17)\u2013(19) is essential for implementing\nthe charge-sensing fusion-rule experiment\nenvisioned\nabove. It is also illuminating, however, to explore the\nlimits at which the predictions break down. Starting at rates\nthat violate the adiabatic criterion specified in Eq. (17), the\nMILESTONES TOWARD MAJORANA-BASED QUANTUM \u2026\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-11\npredictions we describe in Sec. III B 1 should be recovered\nas the rates are reduced, thus giving information about the\nsystem\u2019s minimal (accessible) excitation gap. Assuming the\nlikely scenario tpoisoning \u226b tsplitting, further reducing the rate\nnext invalidates the degeneracy criterion in Eq. (19). The\nleft and right paths in Fig. 6 would then yield identical\nresults, as in this regime the system simply follows a unique\nground state throughout either protocol. Here, the crossover\nscale determines the precision of Majorana-related degen-\neracies. This information is useful in the regime where the\ndegeneracy is exponentially small [87] and thus difficult to\notherwise resolve [57]. Further reducing the protocol rate\neventually violates Eq. (18), thus revealing the quasiparticle\npoisoning time at the rate where the left and right paths\nagain yield identical results, but with uncorrelated charge\nread outs of the two islands.\nC. Majorana-mediated charge pump:\nFusion rules via transport\nNext, we describe a variation on the fusion-rule-detection\nexperiment from Sec. III B using current detection rather\nthan charge sensing. In short, we cyclically fuse Ising-anyon\npairs using the same sequences as before, but now selectively\npump charge across the system in a fusion-channel-\ndependent fashion.\nFigure 7(a) depicts the nontrivial cycle of interest (see\nbelow for a companion control experiment). The first three\nsteps of this cycle repeat those in Fig. 6(a): start from a\ncharge state jQtoti, nucleate Ising anyons binding Majorana\nmodes \u03b31;\u2026;4, and restore charging energy to fuse them\nnontrivially. Figure 8(a) illustrates the energy levels of the\ncharge states versus gate voltages Vg;L\u00f0R\u00de for the left (right)\nislands. Suppose that the gate voltages are adjusted to initial\nvalues VL=R such that after the fusion step (a3) the system\u2019s\nwave function is \u00f01=\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n2\np\n\u00de\u00f0jQL;QRi\u00feei\u03b1jQL \u22121;QR \u00fe1i\u00de,\nprecisely as in Eq. (16). Again, the first and second terms\nin the superposition\u2014indicated by circles in Fig. 8(a)\u2014\ncorrespond to the anyons fusing into the I and \u03c8 channels,\nrespectively.\nAt this stage our strategy departs from the protocol\ndiscussed in Sec. III B. Rather than performing a charge\nmeasurement for read out, we continue with the steps\nshown on the left half of Fig. 7(a) and open slightly the\nouter valves to Josephson couple the islands to the trivial\n(grounded) bulk superconductors. The energy levels thus\nexhibit avoided crossings between states of equivalent\ncharge parity as Fig. 8(b) illustrates. Next, we sequentially\nsweep the gate voltages to values V0\nL=R, reclose the outer\nvalves, and return the gate voltages to VL=R [Figs. 8(b)\nand 8(c)]. After these steps, the ground state jQL; QRi\nFIG. 7.\n(a) Nontrivial cycle that selectively pumps charge 2e whenever Ising anyons fuse into the \u03c8 channel, yielding a quantized zero-\nbias dc current [Eq. (22)] passing between the outer grounded superconductors. The sequence initially follows the left path from Fig. 6.\nOnce the anyons nontrivially fuse into a superposition of I and \u03c8 channels (bottom configuration), the cycle probabilistically pumps\ncharge by pursuing the manipulations sketched in Fig. 8 and described in the text. Opening the middle valve then restores the islands to\ntheir original state, whereupon the process repeats. (b) Control cycle that initially follows the right path from Fig. 6 but is otherwise\nidentical to (a). This alternate sequence blocks the \u03c8 fusion channel and hence eliminates the current.

While the\nformer outcome is trivial, the latter corresponds to\nthe left island borrowing a Cooper pair from the left\ngrounded superconductor and the right island analo-\ngously shedding a Cooper pair rightward. In other\nwords, we pump charge 2e from left to right, but only\nif the anyons fuse into the \u03c8 channel. At this point, the\nwave function collapses into either jQL; QRi or jQL \u00fe\n1; QR \u2212 1i with equal probability. In either case, open-\ning the middle valve evolves the system back into the\nstate jQtoti. We are now back at the top of our pumping\ncycle in Fig. 7(a) and ready to start anew.\nRepetition of the cycle with frequency f yields a time-\naveraged current of strength\nIpump \u00bc 1\n2\u00f02e\u00def \u00bc ef \u00f0nontrivial pumping cycle\u00de\n\u00f022\u00de\nflowing between the grounded superconductors. The factor\nof 1=2 accounts for the fact that the anyons fuse into a\nfermion \u03c8\u2014thus contributing to the current\u2014with only\n50% probability. Remarkably, the fusion channel \u03c8 respon-\nsible for the presence of the excited state in Eq. (16) has\nthus led directly to a measurable and quantized dc current at\nzero bias.\nApplying the same sequence of operations in a different\norder restricts the allowed fusion outcomes and thus yields\nqualitatively different predictions. Consider, in particular,\nthe control cycle sketched in Fig. 7(b), which initially\nfollows the right path in Fig. 6 but is otherwise identical to\nFig. 7(a). Most importantly, step (b3) uniquely fuses the\nanyons back into the vacuum\u2014deterministically yielding\nthe ground state jQL; QRi. Since the \u03c8 fusion channel is\nunavailable, the remainder of the cycle is trivial and the\ntime-averaged current vanishes:\nIcontrol \u00bc 0\n\u00f0control cycle\u00de:\n\u00f023\u00de\nIt is worth noting the non-Abelian nature of the experiment\nevident in Eqs. (22) and (23). The dependence on the order\nof applied external perturbations requires the topological\ndegeneracy encoded by the Majorana zero modes and\nwould not arise if the ground state was unique throughout\nthe cycles (at least in the adiabatic limit).\nThe practical considerations outlined in Sec. III B 2\napply equally well in the measurement scheme proposed\nhere. Essentially, the cycles in Fig. 7 should be adiabatic\nwith respect to the minimal allowed excitation gap but\nswift compared to both the quasiparticle poisoning time\nand any inadvertent topological degeneracy splitting. Two\nadditional considerations are also noteworthy. First, the\ngate voltage sweep VL=R0 \u2192 VL=R in Fig. 8(c) should occur\nfaster than residual avoided crossings (not shown) between\nthe QL=R \u2212 1 and QL=R \u00fe 1 curves; this condition avoids\nrelaxing into an unwanted charge branch. And second, the\nrelaxation time for resetting to a single-dot state jQtoti at\nthe top of the cycle in Fig. 7 should ideally occur on a time\nscale comparable to or shorter than the other steps.\nA \u201clong\u201d relaxation time would bottleneck the cycle and\nlimit the realizable pumped current.\nOverall, operating as fast as possible within these\nconstraints maximizes the current predicted by Eq. (22).\nAccording to the time scales estimated in Sec. III B 2, a\ncycle frequency of f \u223c 100 MHz easily satisfies the adia-\nbatic criterion and yields a readily detectable current\nIpump \u223c 10 pA. Higher frequencies\u2014which, depending\non parameters, may help satisfy the lower speed limits\ndiscussed earlier\u2014boost the signal further still.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFIG. 8.\nManipulations used to pump charge in the cycle\nsketched in Fig. 7(a).

Charging effects provide an important\ningredient in all cases. Moreover, the current orientations in\nsuch devices follow not from the sign of a bias voltage\n(which is not even necessary) but rather from the applied\nperturbations during the cycle. We can indeed reverse\nthe current flowing between the outer superconductors in\nFig. 7(a) simply by swapping the gate voltages applied to\nthe left and right islands.

PROTOTYPE TOPOLOGICAL QUBIT\nVALIDATION\nA. Motivation\nThe two-island setup that Sec. III exploits for fusion-rule\ndetection is also interesting because it constitutes a proto-\ntype topological qubit. Assuming fixed total parity, the\nconfiguration with Majorana zero modes \u03b31;\u2026;4 shown in\nFig. 9(a) admits two ground states that we may associate\nwith a logical 0 and 1 [6]. It is most natural to employ the\nbasis in Eq. (12) and specifically define\nj0i \u2261 j012; 034i;\nj1i \u2261 j112; 134i:\n\u00f024\u00de\nThese states carry opposite parities within each island and\ncan thus be read out using techniques outlined in Sec. II C.\nIt is worth elaborating on this qubit\u2019s special properties\n\u2014particularly the conditions necessary for topological\nprotection against decoherence. Very generally, no local\nmeasurement can read out the state of the qubit when the\nMajorana zero modes remain well separated from one\nanother; the quantum information is encoded nonlocally\nthrough the island parities. Though certainly promising\nfor the coherence of the qubit, it can still be prone to\ndecoherence due to deviations from the ideal limit, as\nshown explicitly in numerous studies [96\u2013101]. For exam-\nple, a stray quasiparticle entering the islands from one of\nthe outer superconductors can take the qubit out of the\ncomputational subspace. Protection against such errors\nrequires qubit manipulations on a time scale shorter than\nthe typical poisoning time. Moreover, to take full advantage\nof the Majorana-based qubit, the system should, with high\nprobability, be confined to the ground-state subspace\ngenerated by the non-Abelian anyons. This condition is\nsatisfied if temperature as well as the typical frequencies\nfor environmental perturbations both fall well below the\nexcitation gap of the system.\nIn this section, we assume that the above criteria are\nmaintained and investigate the following question: How\ncan one characterize the Majorana-based qubit in a manner\nthat validates its topological protection?\nAs part of the validation we aim to qualitatively\ndistinguish the topological qubit in Fig. 9(a) from the\nhypothetical \u201cAndreev qubit\u201d depicted in Fig. 9(b). For the\nlatter, the islands form trivial superconductors that happen\nto host near-zero-energy Andreev bound states (indicated\nby ellipses) localized near the central valve. One could\nequally well encode a qubit in such a system using the\noccupation numbers nL\u00f0R\u00de of the left (right) Andreev\nmodes, i.e., j0i \u2261 j0L; 0Ri and j1i \u2261 j1L; 1Ri. The two\nqubits in Fig. 9 in fact share several common features\ndespite their different physical origin. In either case, one\ncan introduce (not topologically protected) qubit rotations\nby opening the middle valve for a specified time, read\nout may be performed using charge-sensing protocols, and\nboth qubits appear similarly susceptible to errors from\npoisoning events. Exposing the unique characteristics that\nstem from the nonlocal nature of the topological qubit\ntherefore requires some care [102].\nThe\nfusion-rule\nexperiments\ndescribed\npreviously\nalready shed some light on the issue. Indeed, the different\npaths in Fig. 6 rigidly initialize the topological qubit into\neither j0i (right path) or \u00f0j0i \u00fe j1i\u00de=\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n2\np\n(left path);\nreproducing the same initializations for the Andreev qubit,\nby contrast, would require fine-tuning as discussed at\nthe end of Sec. III B 1. As a much more compelling\nFIG. 9.\n(a) Topological qubit and (b) reference nontopological\n\u201cAndreev qubit\u201d that we seek to sharply distinguish. For the\nformer, the qubit is stored in the topologically degenerate ground\nstates encoded by Majorana zero modes; in the latter, the\noccupation numbers for \u201caccidental\u201d near-zero-energy Andreev\nlevels specify the qubit states. Because of the very different\nsensitivity to local noise sources, we argue that the topological\nqubit\u2019s coherence times and oscillation frequency exhibit non-\ntrivial scaling relations that are generically absent in the Andreev\nqubit and can be used to identify topological protection in a\nmodest pre-braiding experiment.\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-14\ndemonstration, one could exchange a pair of Majorana zero\nmodes to implement the fault-tolerant qubit rotations\ngenerated by the non-Abelian braid matrices. Certainly\nno analog exists for the trivial Andreev qubit. While we do\nexplore braiding in Sec. V, such an experiment requires\ndeparting from the single-wire geometry of Fig. 9\u2014which\nwe wish to presently avoid.\nInstead, we argue that one can meaningfully contrast the\nqubits in Fig. 9 through the behavior of their coherence\ntimes T1 and T2, which can be extracted via nontopological\nmanipulations. To obtain precise experimental predictions,\nwe focus on how these quantities scale with the (exper-\nimentally tunable) qubit oscillation frequency \u03c90 stemming\nfrom residual average splittings of the j0i and j1i energies.\nAssuming that decoherence is primarily caused by low-\nfrequency environmental noise in the low-energy subspace,\nwe obtain characteristic scaling relations that link 1=T1,\n1=T2, and \u03c90 for the topological setup.\nBefore turning to details, we sketch an intuitive picture\nfor the origin of these scaling relations. Suppose for\nconcreteness that the oscillation frequency \u03c90 arises pre-\ndominantly from overlap of Majorana zero modes across a\ngiven superconducting island, which scales as e\u2212L=\u03be (up to\nan important oscillatory prefactor discussed below; as\nusual, L denotes the island size while \u03be is the induced\ncorrelation length). Environmental fluctuations stochasti-\ncally modify the Majorana overlap and thus the degeneracy\nsplitting\u2014thereby\ndephasing\nthe\ntopological\nqubit.\nCrucially, since all local noise sources affect the instanta-\nneous splitting through e\u2212L=\u03be (or the oscillatory prefactor),\nsuch noise-induced energy variations are bounded by the\nsame exponential envelope as the oscillation frequency \u03c90\nitself [106]. Hence, fluctuations and time-averaged quan-\ntities are linked for the topological qubit. This property\nrelates \u03c90 to the dephasing time T2 and applies quite\ngenerally provided the topological degeneracy holds within\nexponential accuracy. The relaxation time T1 of the\ntopological qubit also varies with the average splitting\n\u03c90, thus linking T1 and T2 as well. We stress that such\nrelations do not hold for the nontopological Andreev qubit;\nthere, purely local noise sources induce stochastic energy\nvariations that need not bear any relation to the time-\naveraged bound-state energies.\nB. Model for noise in a topologically protected qubit\nAs discussed above, we assume that the relevant sub-\nspace consists solely of logical qubit states j0i \u00bc j012; 034i\nand j1i \u00bc j112; 134i. We therefore model noise with the\nfollowing time-dependent Hamiltonian:\nH\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc hz\u00f0t\u00de\u03c3z \u00fe hx\u00f0t\u00de\u03c3x:\n\u00f025\u00de\nIn the basis specified above, the Pauli matrix \u03c3z is diagonal,\nwhereas \u03c3x flips the qubit.\nWe consider two physical contributions to the qubit\ncoupling hz\u00f0t\u00de: (i) Overlap of the Majorana zero modes\nacross a given island in Fig. 9(a) produces a degeneracy\nsplitting \u221d cos\u00f0\u03baL\u00dee\u2212L=\u03be, where the parameter \u03ba is related\nto the wire\u2019s effective Fermi wave vector [84]. Both \u03ba and\nthe correlation length \u03be depend on microscopic param-\neters such as the Zeeman splitting and the nanowire\u2019s\nchemical potential. (ii) Residual charging energy of the\nislands yields a splitting exponentially small in EJ=EC,\nwith a prefactor \u221d \u00f0ECE3\nJ\u00de1=4 cos\u00f0\u03c0n0\u00de [see Eq. (5)].\nThese\ntwo\nmechanisms\nweakly\nlift\nthe\ntopological\ndegeneracy and thus energetically split the j0i and j1i\nqubit states.\nThe\nhx\u00f0t\u00de\ncoupling\narises\nfrom\nhybridization\nof\nMajorana zero modes \u03b32 and \u03b33 residing opposite the\ncentral valve and is exponentially small in W=\u03beU, where\nW is the width separating the islands and \u03beU is the\nMajorana decay length into the barrier region; see the\ndiscussion near Eq. (20). Beginning from a \u03c3z eigenstate,\nthis coupling tends to rotate the qubit between the j0i and\nj1i states.\nFluctuations in nearby gates, the applied magnetic field,\netc., stochastically impact the parameters \u03ba, \u03be, EJ, EC, n0,\nand \u03beU, thus generating time dependence in the qubit\ncouplings. The specific noise source is not especially\nimportant for our analysis, since for the topological qubit\nthere exist no local noise sources that lead to an instanta-\nneous splitting not involving an exponential. The minimal\nmodel we define here allows us to quantify how the\nintimate connection between time averages of these cou-\nplings and their typical fluctuations affect the topological\nqubit\u2019s properties.\nC. Dephasing time T2\nWe focus first on dephasing of the topological\nqubit. For simplicity, we suppose that the \u03c3z coupling\ndominates, which seems reasonable given the closed\nmiddle valve in Fig. 9(a). We thus set hx\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 0 unless\nstated\notherwise\nand\nparametrize\nthe\nremaining\ncoupling via\nhz\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u210f\u03c90\n2 \u00fe \u03b4hz\u00f0t\u00de:\n\u00f026\u00de\nHere, \u03c90 denotes the qubit oscillation frequency while\n\u03b4hz\u00f0t\u00de encodes noise.\nOne can probe dephasing using the following standard\nmanipulations sketched in Fig. 10: (1) Initialize the qubit\ninto the state j0i. (2) Apply a \u03c0=2 pulse U\u03c0=2 \u00bc ei\u00f0\u03c0=4\u00de\u03c3x\nby opening the middle valve to turn on the hx coupling in\nEq. (25) for a prescribed duration, thus orienting the\nqubit on the equator of the Bloch sphere. (Note that the\nMajorana wave functions do not oscillate in the barrier\nbetween the islands, which facilitates the controlled\nrotation of the qubit [107].) (3) Let the system evolve\nMILESTONES TOWARD MAJORANA-BASED QUANTUM \u2026\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-15\nfor a time t. (4) Apply a second \u03c0=2 pulse. After this\nsequence the probability of measuring the qubit in\nstate j1i reads\nP\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1\n2\n\u0007\n1 \u00fe cos\n\u0003\n\u03c90t \u00fe 2\n\u210f\nZ t\n0\ndt0\u03b4hz\u00f0t0\u00de\n\u0004\b\n:\n\u00f027\u00de\nFollowing closely Ref. [52], we now investigate how\nP\u00f0t\u00de behaves upon averaging over noise, i.e., when\naveraging over many measurements. We take \u03b4hz to\nobey\nGaussian\ncorrelations\nwith\nh\u03b4hz\u00f0t\u00dei \u00bc 0\nand\nh\u03b4hz\u00f0t\u00de\u03b4hz\u00f0t0\u00dei \u00bc Sz\u00f0t \u2212 t0\u00de, where Sz\u00f0t \u2212 t0\u00de determines\nthe noise power spectrum.

Equation (28) applies for frequencies \u03c9\nbetween an \u201cinfrared\u201d cutoff \u039bmin and an \u201cultraviolet\u201d\ncutoff \u039bmax given by the bulk gap. Noise averaging the\nprobability in Eq. (27) then yields [52]\nhP\u00f0t\u00dei \u2248 1\n2 \u00bd1 \u00fe cos\u00f0\u03c90t\u00dee\u2212\u00f0\u0394Ez\ntypt=\u210f\u00de2f\u00f0t\u00de\u0002:\n\u00f029\u00de\nIn the limit \u039bmint \u226a 1 and \u039bmaxt \u226b 1, the function f\u00f0t\u00de\nabove depends on time only logarithmically. Ignoring this\nweak dependence, we thus obtain a dephasing time\nT2 \u223c\n\u210f\n\u0394Ez\ntyp\n:\n\u00f030\u00de\nSimilar behavior is, of course, valid for any type of qubit.\nAgain, the special property of the topological qubit is that\n\u03c90 and the typical fluctuations \u0394Ez\ntyp are linked through\nthe exponential suppression of the ground-state splitting,\nwhich leads to our first scaling relation:\n\u03c90 \u223c 1\nT2\n\u223c\n\u0005 e\u2212L=\u03be\nMajorana-overlap dominant\ne\u2212\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\np8EJ=EC\n;\ncharging-energy dominant:\n\u00f031\u00de\nThus, as the topological qubit becomes \u201cperfect,\u201d both \u03c90\nand 1=T2 vanish in a correlated fashion. The right side\nindicates more precisely how these quantities scale in the\nlimits where Majorana overlap and weak residual charging\neffects dominate the topological degeneracy splitting; note\nthat the prefactors suppressed in Eq. (31) exhibit subexpo-\nnential dependence on parameters. In practice, one can\nexplore this relation by varying \u03be with, e.g., a back gate, or\nby modifying EJ=EC through modulation of the outer\nvalves in Fig. 9(a).\nIn the Majorana-overlap-dominated regime, the scaling\nrelation in Eq. (31) emphasizes the exponential envelope\nof the degeneracy splitting that is central to topological\nprotection. As noted above, however, here the time-\naveraged splitting \u03c90 also includes an oscillatory prefactor\ncos\u00f0\u03baL\u00de with quite interesting physical consequences. For\ninstance, when \u03c90 becomes extremal, \u03b4hz is much less\nsensitive to noise in \u03ba if the typical fluctuations in \u03baL are\nsmall\u2014thus suppressing 1=T2. When \u03c90 is instead tuned\nnear zero, \u03b4hz is maximally sensitive to noise in \u03ba leading to\nenhancement of 1=T2. One thereby obtains out-of-phase\noscillations in \u03c90 and 1=T2 when changing the system\u2019s\nFIG. 10.\nProtocol for measuring the topological qubit\u2019s dephas-\ning time T2 and oscillation frequency \u03c90. The left side illustrates\nthe valve manipulations while the right shows the corresponding\nqubit orientation on the Bloch sphere. After initialization and a\n\u03c0=2 pulse, the qubit unitarily evolves for time t. During this\nevolution, the relative phase between j0i and j1i changes by an\namount \u03b4\u03d5\u00f0t\u00de set by \u03c90 and time-dependent noise in the splitting\nof the qubit states. Crucially, the latter two factors are intimately\nrelated for the topological qubit because they are constrained by\nthe same exponential suppression. After a second \u03c0=2 pulse,\nthe probability of measuring the j1i state is P\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc j\u03b2j2 \u00bc\n1\n2 \u00bd1 \u00fe cos \u03b4\u03d5\u00f0t\u00de\u0002. Noise averaging gives Eq. (29), which simulta-\nneously probes both T2 and \u03c90. The nontrivial connection\nbetween uniform quantities and fluctuations for the topological\nqubit implies the unusual scaling relation between \u03c90 and 1=T2 in\nEq. (31) that signifies topological protection. A similar scaling\nrelation links T1 and T2; see Eq. (33).\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-16\nparameters\u2014another key consequence of the unconven-\ntional link between time averages and fluctuations for the\nqubit. Exploring refinements of the scaling behavior on top\nof the dominant exponential e\u2212L=\u03be thus reveals additional\nfingerprints of Majorana modes that provide further evi-\ndence of topological protection. We stress that the oscil-\nlations described above may actually be easier to observe\nthan the exponential itself since they should be visible\neven with modest parameter changes that only weakly\nimpact L=\u03be.\nA few remarks are in order to put our discussion in\nproper perspective:\nFirst, the precise scaling between \u03c90 and T2 depends on\nthe noise model used. For example, with short-range-\ncorrelated noise it is straightforward to show, again\nfollowing Ref. [52], that \u03c90 \u223c 1=\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\npT2\nand hence both\nquantities continue to vanish exponentially as the qubit\nbecomes perfect. The important universal feature is that the\ndephasing rate exhibits some characteristic dependence on\nthe typical fluctuation amplitude for the \u03c3z coupling in\nEq. (25); that alone is sufficient to link \u03c90 and T2 via a\nscaling relation akin to Eq. (31).\nSecond, the entirety of Eq. (31) (or a straightforward\nextension if the noise is not 1=f-like) needs to be satisfied\nto verify topological protection according to the ideas in\nthis section. That is, \u03c90 and 1=T2 must scale with one\nanother, and they must both scale exponentially with some\nparameter. Merely demonstrating \u03c90 \u221d 1=T2 is not suffi-\ncient. This weaker relation in fact arises in the seminal spin\nqubit work of Petta et al. [108], where topological physics\nis not operative; in that case, exponential scaling is absent.\nFinally, for realizing our predicted scaling relations, it is\nmost certainly not sufficient to simply have a qubit with\nan exponentially small time-averaged splitting in some\nparameter. To illustrate this important point, consider two\nlocalized spin-1=2 particles whose orbital wave functions\ndecay exponentially on a length scale \u03bes [cf. the example\ndiscussed after Eq. (11)]. When these spins are infinitely far\napart and with all time-averaged external fields \u201cturned\noff,\u201d the singlet and triplet states for the two-spin system are\nexactly degenerate. Moreover, at large but finite spatial\nseparation Ls, these states split by a time-averaged amount\n\u03c90 \u221d e\u2212Ls=\u03bes; i.e., this spin qubit exhibits an exponential \u03c90\nscaling quite similar to our topological qubit. For the spin\nqubit, however, local noise sources that time average\nto zero produce additional terms in the instantaneous\nsplitting that are by no means constrained by the above\nexponential\u2014the\nmost\nobvious example being\nstray\nZeeman fields acting separately on each spin. These addi-\ntional local noise sources yield a dephasing rate 1=T2 that\nviolates the exponential scaling relation in Eq. (31).\nConversely, all local noise sources present for our topo-\nlogical qubit, including fluctuations in the Zeeman field,\nfeed into the prefactor and/or exponent of the exponentially\ndependent instantaneous splitting, e.g., cos\u00f0\u03baL\u00dee\u2212L=\u03be.\nHence, the dephasing rate due to all local noise sources\ncan be exponentially suppressed by changing a single\ndimensionless parameter, and Eq. (31) is fully satisfied.\nThe part of Eq. (31) involving T2 thus verifies, in a rather\ngeneral and universal fashion, the topological qubit\u2019s\ninherent nonlocality.\nD. Relaxation time T1\nWe now briefly address the time scale T1 at which the\ntopological qubit relaxes towards its thermodynamic equi-\nlibrium state; a more in-depth discussion can be found in\nAppendix C. Suppose for simplicity that we work in the\ntemperature regime \u210f\u03c90 \u226a kBT \u226a bulk gap (which is not\nunreasonable) and that relaxation is induced by classical\nnoise in weak \u03c3x coupling hx\u00f0t\u00de \u226a \u210f\u03c90 in Eq. (25). If one\ninitializes the system into, say, the j0i logical qubit state\n(which is split from the j1i state by a finite energy \u210f\u03c90) via\nthe manipulations in the top two panels of Fig. 10, the hx\u00f0t\u00de\ncoupling will subsequently induce \u201cbit flips\u201d and thereby\ncause the initial state to decay in the presence of noise.\nGiven the assumptions specified above, measuring the\nqubit at later times t \u226b T1 will yield j0i or j1i with equal\nprobability.\nAssuming low-frequency-dominated noise, the relaxa-\ntion time T1 generally decreases upon reducing \u03c90; i.e.,\nthe system relaxes more quickly as the topological\ndegeneracy splitting tends to zero. This trend arises\nbecause smaller \u03c90 renders random \u03c3x bit flip processes\nmore efficient. One can thus probe \u03c90 not only from the\noscillations\nin\nEq.\n(29)\nbut\nalso\nby\nprobing\nT1.\nAppendix C evaluates T1 in a simplified model (see also\nRef. [109]) with hx\u00f0t\u00de exhibiting 1=f noise of typical\namplitude \u0394Ex\ntyp and specifically finds\nT1 \u223c\n\u210f2\u03c90\n\u00f0\u0394Ex\ntyp\u00de2 :\n\u00f032\u00de\nNote that since we assume \u03c90 \u226b \u0394Ex\ntyp, the T1 time is still\nexponentially long despite the \u03c90 dependence in the\nnumerator. Combining Eqs. (31) and (32) leads to our\nsecond scaling relation,\nT1\u00f0\u03c90\u00de \u221d\n1\nT2\u00f0\u03c90\u00de ;\n\u00f033\u00de\nwhich relates the dependence of the two coherence times on\nthe ground-state splitting encoded in \u03c90 and holds at fixed\n\u0394Ex\ntyp. In practice, it should be possible to vary \u03c90 nearly\nindependently from \u0394Ex\ntyp and hence probe this scaling\nrelation; for instance, modulating the outer valves in Fig. 9(a)\ncould tune the former while impacting the latter very little.\nWe stress that Eq. (33) relates information about the uniform\noscillation frequency \u03c90 encoded in T1 to information about\nfluctuations encoded in T2.

Preliminaries\nDemonstration of fusion-rule detection and topological\nqubit validation as outlined earlier would provide strong\nevidence for the protection of quantum information stored\nin Majorana-based qubits. This section introduces an\nall-electrical braiding protocol that allows topologically\nprotected qubit manipulations, thereby stepping further\ntowards applications. We continue to focus on minimal\ngeometries sufficient to establish the desired effect in a\ncontrolled experiment difficult to emulate with nontopo-\nlogical means. Specifically, we seek to demonstrate \u201crigid\u201d\nrotation of a single topological qubit under an exchange,\nwhich lies at the heart of non-Abelian statistics and\ntopological quantum information processing.\nFor this purpose, we must abandon the elegant single-\nwire geometries and turn to networks [29\u201335]. Throughout\nthis section, we consider the T junction sketched in Fig. 11.\nThree superconducting islands coat the junction and are\nseparated from each other and outer bulk superconductors\nby gate-tunable valves. One can view the two islands on the\nhorizontal leg as furnishing the topological qubit, very\nsimilar to Fig. 9(a), that we manipulate by braiding\nMajorana zero modes with the aid of the vertical island.\n[Note that if the inner valves in the figure sit too close to\none another, operating them independently may prove\ntechnically challenging. The protrusion of the vertical\nisland onto the horizontal leg alleviates this issue due to\nscreening from the intervening superconducting segment.\nIts width should be smaller than the correlation length to\navoid trivially decoupling the left and right islands (a length\nscale of \u223c200 nm or so seems reasonable).]\nIn what follows we first introduce our scheme for\nmodulating valves to effect an elementary braiding oper-\nation, and then turn to more detailed protocols for initial-\nization, rotation, and read out of the topological qubit. All\nmanipulations discussed hereafter should be carried out\nslowly relative to the minimal excitation gap for the system\nbut fast compared to residual degeneracy splittings and\nquasiparticle poisoning times; for details, see Ref. [73] as\nwell as the related discussion in Sec. III B 2.\nB. Elementary braid\nThe sequence of operations comprising the single braid\nof interest appears in Fig. 11(a).

Beginning from the\nground state of decoupled, charging-energy-dominated islands, the topological qubit is initialized into the j0i state by opening the outer\nvalves. A single braid (upper path) or double braid (lower path) rotates the topological qubit, and then charging energy is restored for\nread out. Under the single braid the qubit rotates into an equal superposition of j0i and j1i leading to maximally uncertain measurement\noutcome; the double braid flips the qubit to j1i and returns a unique measurement value.\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS.

(The essentially isolated vertical island contributes\nno zero modes at this stage since charging energy\ndominates there.) At fixed parity the system therefore\nsupports two degenerate ground states that encode one\nlogical\nqubit.\nIn\nterms\nof\noccupation\nnumbers for\nfermions\nf12 \u00bc \u00f0\u03b31 \u00fe i\u03b32\u00de=2\nand\nf34 \u00bc \u00f0\u03b33 \u00fe i\u03b34\u00de=2\ndefined in Eq. (12), we take these states to be\nj0i \u2261 j012; 034i;\nj1i \u2261 j112; 134i;\n\u00f034\u00de\nprecisely as in Sec. IV. Our goal is to electrically braid\nthe inner Majorana modes \u03b32;3 by operating the valves in\nFig. 11(a), and to recall how the qubit transforms as a\nresult.\nOne can distill the braid into three steps summarized\nbelow and in Fig. 11(a). For brevity, let L, R, and V\nrespectively denote the left, right, and vertical islands in the\ntrijunction.\n(1) Open both the left and bottom valves adjacent to\nisland V. Opening these valves extends the topological\nphase for island L down into the vertical leg\u2014whose\ncharging energy is then quenched by strong Josephson\ncoupling to the adjacent bulk superconductor as well as\ncoupling to island L. Majorana mode \u03b32 thereby shuttles to\nthe bottom end of island V. (Precisely how one opens the\nvalves is unimportant. One should, however, avoid com-\npletely opening the bottom valve while the left valve\nremains closed since V would then host an additional,\nunwanted pair of Majorana zero modes. This spurious\ndegeneracy would spoil the topological nature of the\nmanipulation. Similar remarks hold for the subsequent\nsteps outlined below.)\n(2) Close the left valve adjacent to island V while\nopening the right one, thus transporting \u03b33 from island R\nto L. The topological superconductors have now been\n\u201cresewn\u201d such that V and R form a continuous topologi-\ncal phase.\n(3) Close all valves adjacent to V to restore dominant\ncharging energy for that island. This operation transfers \u03b32\nto island R [analogously to step (1)] and completes\nthe braid.\nWe note that the bottom bulk superconductor in Fig. 11\nis, strictly speaking, unnecessary for this braiding protocol,\nthough it is practically useful. Without this component the\ncharging energy for the lower island can still be quenched if\ninter-island Josephson coupling overwhelms its charging\nenergy. Weaker inter-island Josephson couplings can,\nhowever, be tolerated if charging energy is quenched by\nstrong Josephson coupling to the bottom bulk supercon-\nductor, thus relaxing the operating requirements for some\nof the valves.\nThe above sequence exchanges \u201chalf\u201d of the fermion f12\nwith \u201chalf\u201d of f34 and thus quite naturally impacts the qubit\nin a dramatic way. More precisely, Refs. [29\u201332,35] show\nfrom various viewpoints that the qubit undergoes unitary\nrotation specified by the braid matrix\nUbraid \u00bc e\u0003i\u00f0\u03c0=4\u00de\u03c3x:\n\u00f035\u00de\nThe operator \u03c3x in Eq. (35) flips the qubit state while the\nsign in the exponent depends on details of the trijunction\n[29\u201331]. (This sign does not affect the measurement\nprobabilities in the protocols discussed below, but we\nretain it for completeness.) Interestingly, essentially the\nsame braiding properties arise for quasiparticles in the non-\nAbelian Moore-Read quantum Hall state and vortices in 2D\ntopological superconductors [7,110,111].\nOne may recall that precisely the same \u03c0=2 qubit rotation\nencoded in Eq. (35) was invoked in Sec. IV for topological\nqubit validation, but via unprotected manipulations that\nrequired fine-tuning. We stress that Eq. (35), on the contrary,\nrepresents the rigid rotation that we are interested in\ndemonstrating; it requires no fine-tuning and is exact in\nthe limit where the topological degeneracy is perfect and the\nsystem remains in the ground-state manifold throughout\nthe braid.\nC. Experimental protocols\nWe now propose a series of experiments designed to\nprobe the braid matrix in Eq. (35). Consider first the\ninitialize \u2192 single braid \u2192 read out protocol sketched in\nthe upper part of Fig. 11(b). The starting point is a\n\u201ctriple-dot\u201d configuration where all valves in the trijunction\nare closed, leaving three isolated islands dominated by\ncharging energy. We let the system relax into the ground\nstate jQL; QRi with charges QL\u00f0R\u00de on the left (right) islands\n(charge on the vertical island is unimportant and thus\nsuppressed). Subsequently opening the outermost left and\nright valves nucleates our four Majorana modes and\ninitializes the topological qubit into the logical j0i state.\nThis stage of the protocol thus sends\njQL; QRi \u2192 j0i\n\u00f0initialization\u00de:\n\u00f036\u00de\nNext, the inner Majorana modes \u03b32;3 undergo a single braid\nas outlined in Sec.

This probabilistic result indicates that the qubit\ntransforms nontrivially, despite the fact that the protocol\nreturns the device to its precise starting configuration.\nWe must, nevertheless, exercise caution: Exactly the\nsame outcome would arise if, say, charges hopped ran-\ndomly between the two horizontal islands during the\nprotocol, even if one failed to braid. Fortunately, control\nexperiments can rule out uninteresting noise-related origins\nof such behavior. For example, suppose that instead of\nbraiding we simply transport Majorana modes from the\nhorizontal islands to the vertical island and then back again\n[e.g., complete step (1) from Fig. 11(a) and then immedi-\nately undo it]. Although the Majorana modes shuttle along\nthe trijunction in a similar fashion, the absence of a braid\nshould return the topological qubit deterministically to its\noriginal state. A successful warm-up experiment of this\ntype would demonstrate controllable transfer of Majorana\nmodes between islands in the trijunction. Moreover,\nobserving the predicted distinction between the braid\nand such control protocols would support the qubit trans-\nformation having its roots in non-Abelian statistics.\nThe initialize \u2192 double braid \u2192 read out protocol from\nthe lower end of Fig. 11(b) provides an even more\ncompelling control. In a straightforward modification of\nthe single-braid experiment, here we obtain\njQL; QRi \u2192 j0i\n\u00f0initialization\u00de\nj0i \u2192 \u00f0Ubraid\u00de2j0i \u00bc \u0003ij1i\n\u00f0double braid\u00de\nj1i \u2192 jQL \u2212 1; QR \u00fe 1i\n\u00f0read out\u00de:\n\u00f039\u00de\nWhereas singly braiding yields a maximally uncertain\nmeasurement outcome, a double braid flips the qubit with\n100% probability so that measurement becomes determin-\nistic. Confirming this remarkable behavior would not only\ndefinitively rule out random charge fluctuations as the\nsource of qubit rotation under a single braid, but also verify\nthe \u201crigidity\u201d of the braid matrix in Eq. (35).\nRegarding the latter point, we note that our measurement\nscheme is not sensitive to the relative phase of \u0003i between\nj0i and j1i in Eq. (38). Equal measurement outcomes\nmerely imply that a braid rotates the qubit by \u03c0=2 about\nsome axis normal to the poles of the Bloch sphere. In\ngeneral, the double-braid control experiment deterministi-\ncally flips the qubit only if each individual braid imple-\nments a \u03c0=2 rotation about the same axis. Deviations from\nperfect rigidity can, however, arise from imperfections such\nas dephasing during the protocol and residual splitting of\nthe ground-state degeneracy. Investigating the precision of\nbraid transformations experimentally should allow one to\nfurther validate the topological qubit beyond the means\ndescribed earlier.\nVI. OUTLOOK\nSuccessful completion of each milestone explored in this\npaper would arguably comprise a major achievement in the\nMajorana problem and topological physics more generally.\nFusion-rule detection promises to reveal the fundamental,\nin fact defining, property of non-Abelian anyons that\nunderlies their exotic exchange statistics. The first vali-\ndation of a prototype topological qubit would partially\nverify the basic tenets of topological quantum computation\nand thus mark a significant step towards quantum infor-\nmation applications. An unambiguous demonstration of\nnon-Abelian braiding would march the field further in this\ndirection\u2014while also establishing the most exotic form of\nexchange statistics permitted by nature. For all of these\nmilestones we endeavored to devise experimental protocols\nwhose outcome can be mimicked by nontopological setups\nonly in quite pathological cases.\nWe focused on one platform\u2014wires coupled to meso-\nscopic superconducting islands with gate-tunable Coulomb\ninteraction effects\u2014that appears particularly amenable to\nexperimental advances along these lines. The ability to\nelectrically\ntune\nbetween\nCoulomb-dominated\nand\nJosephson-dominated regimes for the islands indeed ena-\nbles efficient initialization, manipulation, and read out of\nMajorana-based qubits through a variety of techniques.\nPreliminary experiments that seek to optimize gate control\nover Coulomb effects would be extremely interesting in\ntheir own right. This approach essentially borrows tools\nfrom the well-developed area of spin qubits to accelerate\nprogress in the burgeoning field of topological super-\nconductivity. The philosophy closely resembles the merger\nof transmons with Majorana platforms advocated in\nRefs. [33,34,43]; see also Refs. [112,113].\nOur emphasis notwithstanding, the above milestones\nshould apply broadly to Majorana-supporting media and\nneed not rely on the precise platform and manipulation or\nread out schemes exploited here. For instance, with only\nstraightforward modifications, fusion-rule detection and\ntopological qubit validation experiments should be adapt-\nable to transmon-based devices; other setups, such as\nferromagnetic atomic chains on superconductors [16,23],\nmay require more dramatic modifications and thus pose\ninteresting challenges for future research. These pre-\nbraiding Majorana milestones are worth pursuing generally\nsince they yield nontrivial physics that belies the simplicity\nof setups required.\nIt is, of course, also interesting to ponder longer-term\ndirections related to our study. A well-known issue in\nMajorana systems is that braiding alone does not provide a\nuniversal gate set. One way to achieve computational\nuniversality involves introducing an additional (unpro-\ntected) single-qubit phase gate together with read out of\nthe state encoded by quartets of Majorana modes; for\nan excellent recent discussion, see Ref. [6]. One could\ncalibrate the former using precisely the same methods that\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-20\nwe outlined for topological qubit validation. Quantifying\nthe fidelity of such a phase gate would constitute a\nworthwhile experiment complementary to that proposed\nin Sec. IV. We expect that read out of Majorana quartets can\nproceed by performing charge measurements of islands\nconnected center to center with a tunable Josephson\njunction. And finally, exploring fusion-rule detection and\nvalidation of topological qubits remains a fascinating\nchallenge for more exotic types of non-Abelian anyons\nas well.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Sven Albrecht, Parsa Bonderson, Michael\nFreedman,\nFabian\nHassler,\nTakis\nKontos,\nFerdinand\nKuemmeth, Olivier Landon-Cardinal, Roman Lutchyn,\nKaren Michaeli, Roger Mong, Felix von Oppen, Yuval\nOreg, Nick Read, and Zhenghan Wang for illuminating\ndiscussions.

III in terms of a general anyon\nmodel. Consider an anyon theory for which particles live at\npoints in two spatial dimensions. Each particle carries a\nlabel indicating the anyon type; for example, in the Ising\ntheory, these labels are I, \u03c3, and \u03c8. Consistency requires\nthat bringing two point particles together results in another\npoint particle\u2014a process known as fusion. Possible fusion\noutcomes of particles with labels a and b are described by\nthe fusion rule\na \u00d7 b \u00bc\nX\nc\nNc\nabc:\n\u00f0A1\u00de\nHere, Nc\nab are integers denoting the number of ways in\nwhich a and b can fuse to c. For simplicity, we assume that\nall the Nc\nab are either 0 or 1 (as is the case with the Ising\ntheory).\nAll physical processes in the anyon model can be\nrepresented diagrammatically. The diagrams are given by\nworld lines that track the particles\u2019 positions as a function\nof time, with each world line labeled by the corresponding\nanyon type. States are represented by terminating the\nparticle world lines at some constant time slice. A fusion\nprocess corresponds to a trivalent vertex in a diagram, at\nwhich two particles coalesce into a third; the labeled\nvertices must be compatible with the fusion rules given\nin Eq. (A1). And a closed diagram represents an amplitude\nfor a given process.\nMany processes can generate the same particles at\nidentical positions\u2014yielding states that live in the same\nvector space and are hence related by a unitary trans-\nformation. We encountered one example in Fig. 6, where\nthe right path initializes four Ising anyons into the state\nj012; 034i while the left path initializes the same anyons into\nthe state j014; 023i \u00bc \u00f0j012; 034i \u00fe j112; 134i\u00de=\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n2\np\n[recall\nEq. (15)]. The latter expression reflects the nontrivial linear\nrelations between quantum states in different \u201cfusion\nchannels.\u201d (For an explicit computation of the linear\nrelations, see, for example, Sec. III B 2 of Ref. [38]).\nDiagrammatically, these unitary transformations are\ngiven by linear relations on the diagrams. The two\nfundamental relations are so-called R and F moves. R\nmoves relate diagrams with braiding to those without, while\nF moves linearly relate the state found from a single\nparticle splitting into three particles in two distinct ways:\n\u00f0A2\u00de\nThe diagram on the left shows one d particle splitting into\nan x and c particle, followed by x splitting into a and b; the\none on the right shows a d particle splitting into y and a and\nthen y splitting into b and c. The matrix Fabc\nd \u2014known as an\nF symbol\u2014is unitary for an anyon model. Self-consistency\nof the theory strongly constrains the F and R moves. The\nmathematical structure governing this theory is known\nto be a unitary braided modular tensor category; see\nRefs. [114,115] for excellent expositions of this structure\nand how it relates to anyons.\nWe now discuss the nontrivial fusion-rule protocol (left\npath of Fig. 6) in the context of a general anyon model. The\ndiagram corresponding to the initialization appears on the\nleft side of Eq. (A3). First, we create two particles a and \u00afa\nout of the vacuum and fix their position far from one\nanother. In Fig. 6, this step nucleates Majorana zero modes\n\u03b31;4 at the outer ends of the nanowire. Next, we create two\nmore particles b and \u00afb out of the vacuum in some other\nMILESTONES TOWARD MAJORANA-BASED QUANTUM \u2026\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-21\nregion far from the a and \u00afa particles. In Fig. 6, this\ncorresponds to nucleating the zero modes \u03b32;3 located near\nthe nanowire\u2019s center. The nontrivial fusion rules reveal\nthemselves when we fuse the left and right pair of anyons\nand measure the charge. In terms of diagrams, this means\nwe measure in the basis shown on the right side of\n\u00f0A3\u00de\nThe norm square of the coefficients Cx gives the probability\nof a particular fusion process. For our fusion rule protocol\nwe have a \u00bc b \u00bc \u00afa \u00bc \u00afb \u00bc \u03c3, and we measure in the basis\nx \u00bc I, \u03c8. The coefficients Cx are related to the F symbols\nsince\n\u00f0A4\u00de\nThe diagram on the right further relates to Eq. (A3) by\npulling the b line past the bottom vertex and moving it over\nso that it fuses with a. Generically, moving a line in this\nfashion results only in an extra phase [116]. We therefore\nobtain\njCxj2 \u00bc j\u00f0Fb\u00afb \u00afa\n\u00afa\n\u00deI\u00afxj2.\nSetting\na \u00bc ::: \u00bc \u03c3\nyields\njCxj2 \u00bc 1=2 for x \u00bc I or \u03c8. In other words, the equal\nmeasurement probabilities for even- and odd-charge states\nin the nontrivial fusion-rule protocol, deduced from a\ndifferent viewpoint in Sec. III, can be interpreted as a\ndirect measurement of the absolute value of certain F\nsymbols in the Ising theory.\nSince the measurement reads off only the absolute value\nof these F symbols, we can reinterpret this experiment in a\ndifferent, somewhat more fundamental way. The particular\nmatrix elements it measures can alternatively be inferred\nfrom the relation\n\u00f0A5\u00de\nHere, dx is the so-called quantum dimensions of particle\ntype x\u2014which can be inferred directly from the fusion\nrules of the theory. The quantum dimension dx is the\ndominant eigenvalue of the matrix \u00bdM\u00f0x\u00de\u0002ab \u00bc Na\nxb, and\nphysically represents the Hilbert space dimension per\nparticle. Using Eq. (A5) one can predict the probabilities\nassociated with charge measurements on each island, which\nare given by\njCxj2 \u00bc jC\u00afxj2 \u00bc dx\ndadb\nNx\nab;\n\u00f0A6\u00de\nknowing only the fusion rules and no other information\nfrom the anyon theory. Inserting the known quantum\ndimensions\nfor\nthe\nIsing\ntheory,\ndI \u00bc d\u03c8 \u00bc 1\nand\nd\u03c3 \u00bc\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n2\np\n, we recover equal measurement probabilities of\n1=2 for each fusion channel. In this sense, our proposed\nexperiment\nindeed\ndirectly\nprobes\nthe\nIsing-anyon\nfusion rules.\nAPPENDIX B: LEVEL STRUCTURE\nAND CHARGE SCREENING BY\nSUPERCONDUCTING JUNCTIONS:\nROLE OF BARRIER TRANSMISSION\nWithin our approach, manipulation of topological super-\nconductors and Majorana zero modes relies critically on\nefficient gate control over Josephson junctions bridged by\nnanowires (see, e.g., Fig. 3). Josephson coupling in these\nsetups has a slightly different physical origin compared to\nconventional SIS junctions typical for superconducting\nqubits [52]. Junctions in the latter context host many\nchannels with low transmission probability, so that\nJosephson coupling can be well modeled with a simple\nVSIS\u00f0\u02c6\u03c6\u00de \u00bc \u2212EJ cos \u02c6\u03c6\n\u00f0B1\u00de\npotential. We expect that gating in our nanowire devices\ninstead opens a few channels tunable to the regime of large\ntransmission probability (cf. Refs. [39,40]). Consider the\nsingle junction shown in Fig. 1, which we modeled in\nSec. II with a phenomenological Hamiltonian of the form\nH \u00bc EC\u00f0\u02c6n \u2212 n0\u00de2 \u00fe V\u00f0\u02c6\u03c6\u00de;\n\u00f0B2\u00de\nV\u00f0\u02c6\u03c6\u00de \u00bc \u2212N\u0394\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n1 \u2212 Tsin2\u00f0\u02c6\u03c6=2\u00de\nq\n;\n\u00f0B3\u00de\nwhere in the second line we assume for simplicity that all N\nchannels have identical transmission probabilities Ti \u00bc T.\nThe goal of this Appendix is to contrast the low-lying level\nstructure and screening effects obtained with the standard\nVSIS potential and that in Eq. (B3). We focus on the\nJosephson-dominated regime throughout.\nAs noted in the main text, Eq. (B3) in fact reduces to VSIS\nin the T \u226a 1 limit (up to a constant) with\nEJ \u00bc N\u0394T=4:\n\u00f0B4\u00de\nFor large transmissivity, however, quantitative deviations in\nthe energy spectrum clearly arise for the two cases. One can\nanticipate some nontrivial T dependence from the plots of\nV\u00f0\u03c6\u00de (normalized by EJ) shown in Fig. 12, which illustrate\n\u201cstiffening\u201d of the potential at larger T. (Equivalently,\nlarger T potentials are softened, relative to a parabolic\nDAVID AASEN et al.\nPHYS. REV. X 6, 031016 (2016)\n031016-22\nextrapolation, to a lesser degree than a simple cosine.) We\nargue that these differences are, nevertheless, qualitatively\nrather minor for our purposes and can be reasonably\nneglected given the rough phenomenological modeling\nthat we employ.\nFirst, we stress that we are interested exclusively in\nground states and low-lying excitations. These low-energy\nstates can be well captured by taking a harmonic approxi-\nmation for Eq. (B3) and expanding about \u02c6\u03c6 \u00bc 0:\nV\u00f0\u02c6\u03c6\u00de \u2248 EJ\n2 \u02c6\u03c62:\n\u00f0B5\u00de\nThis is precisely the same small-\u02c6\u03c6 dependence obtained\nby expanding VSIS. Within this rough approximation the\ntwo potentials thus yield identical harmonic-oscillator-like\nspectra with energy levels\nEn \u00bc\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n8EJEC\np\n\u00f0n \u00fe 1=2\u00de;\nn \u00bc 0; 1; 2; \u2026;\n\u00f0B6\u00de\nas discussed in Ref. [52] and sketched in Fig. 2(a). The\ncoupling EJ of course varies with transmission T through\nEq. (B4), but splitting between the ground state and first\nexcited state is simply given to a good approximation\nby\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\np8EJEC\nfor any T between 0 and 1. We verified this\nbehavior by simulating the Hamiltonian with the exact\npotentials numerically.\nIn the harmonic treatment above, the ground state\nexhibits an exact twofold degeneracy consisting of even-\nand odd-parity states; moreover, the energies are indepen-\ndent of the gate-tuned offset charge n0 in Eq. (B2). We turn\nnow to the full anharmonic potentials. Anharmonicity both\nlifts the exact degeneracy and causes the energies to\ndisperse with n0, as depicted in Fig. 2(a). Let us focus\non the even-parity ground-state sector and consider the\nenergy difference\n\u0394Emax \u2261 max E0\u00f0n0\u00de \u2212 min E0\u00f0n0\u00de\n\u00f0B7\u00de\nbetween the maximal and minimal ground-state energies\nE0\u00f0n0\u00de obtained upon varying the offset n0. Note that\n\u0394Emax is equivalent to the maximal degeneracy splitting\nbetween even- and odd-parity states [recall Fig. 2(a)] and is\nthus particularly important for this work.\nThe energy \u0394Emax is closely connected with the prob-\nability for phase slips \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 \u00fe 2\u03c0 that tunnel through\nmaxima of the potential barrier in Fig. 12 [49]. Since\nincreasing T \u201cstiffens\u201d the confining potential (in units of\nEJ), we expect the maximal degeneracy splitting to be\nparametrically further suppressed as T \u2192 1. For the\nJosephson-dominated limit EJ=EC \u226b 1 considered here,\nwe can compute \u0394Emax for general T using the same WKB\napproach [117] as for the cosine potential VSIS valid at\nT \u226a 1 [52]. The result takes the form\n\u0394Emax \u00bc \u03b1\u00f0T\u00deEC\n\u0003EJ\nEC\n\u00043=4\ne\u2212\u03b2\u00f0T\u00de\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\np8EJ=EC\n:\n\u00f0B8\u00de\nFor T \u226a 1, we have \u03b2 \u00bc 1 [52], whereas in the opposite\nlimit of T \u00bc 1, we find a mild enhancement to \u03b2 \u2248 1.17; the\nprefactor \u03b1 is also slightly reduced for increased T. Direct\nnumerical simulations of Eqs. (B2) and (B3) validate this\nanalysis (for simulation details, see Ref. [73]). Increasing T\nat fixed EJ thus reduces the degeneracy splitting, consistent\nwith the above intuition. This observation justifies our use\nof the simpler potential VSIS to conservatively estimate the\ndegeneracy splittings and related time scales in Sec. III B 2.\nDespite the quantitative differences highlighted above,\nsuppression of charging effects is qualitatively the same for\na junction with either many channels of low transmission or\na few channels with large transmission.

First, we continue to use the two-\nlevel qubit Hamiltonian in Eq. (25) to treat fluctuations that\nproduce relaxation. Thus, we incorporate only classical\nnoise. This assumption confines our analysis of T1 to the\nregime where the qubit frequency \u03c90 is small compared to\ntemperature [118], which is actually quite reasonable given\nits exponential suppression. (One should at least expect\n\u210f\u03c90 \u2272 kBT experimentally; see Sec. III B 2 and Ref.

Third,\nwe retain only the random part of the \u03c3x coupling, taking\nhx\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u03b4hx\u00f0t\u00de, where \u03b4hx\u00f0t\u00de satisfies Gaussian correlations:\nh\u03b4hx\u00f0t\u00dei \u00bc 0;\nh\u03b4hx\u00f0t\u00de\u03b4hx\u00f0t0\u00dei \u00bc Sx\u00f0t \u2212 t0\u00de:\n\u00f0C1\u00de\nAssuming again 1=f noise, we take\nSx\u00f0\u03c9\u00de \u223c \u00f0\u0394Ex\ntyp\u00de2\nj\u03c9j\n;\n\u00f0C2\u00de\nwith \u0394Ex\ntyp the typical fluctuation amplitude in the \u03c3x\ncoupling.

The probability of measuring the qubit in state\nj1i at a later time t is then given by\nh ~P\u00f0t\u00dei \u00bc 1\n2 \u00f01 \u2212 e\u2212t=T1\u00de;\n\u00f0C5\u00de\nwith relaxation time [118]\nT1 \u00bc 1\n2\n1\n\u03930\u21921\n\u00bc 1\n2\n\u210f2\nSx\u00f0\u03c90\u00de \u223c\n\u210f2\u03c90\n\u00f0\u0394Ex\ntyp\u00de2 :\n\u00f0C6\u00de\nWe thereby obtain the \u03c90 dependence quoted in the main\ntext. The connection between fluctuations and time-\naveraged quantities for the topological qubit correspond-\ningly establishes the unconventional scaling relation\nbetween T1 and the dephasing time T2 provided in Eq. (33).\nNote that, as with T2, the precise form of T1 clearly\ndepends on details of the noise model. Nevertheless,\nsome nontrivial dependence on \u03c90 is all that we require\nto nontrivially link the qubit coherence times. The\ndependence of T1 on \u0394Ex\ntyp, on the other hand, is more\nstraightforward: 1=T1 \u221d \u00f0\u0394Ex\ntyp\u00de2 independent of noise\nmodel, by the very general Eq. (C6). According to\nEq. (20), we expect \u0394Ex\ntyp \u221d e\u2212W=\u03beU, where \u03beU is the\ndecay length of the Majorana wave functions into the\nregion of width W separating the islands. One can tune \u03beU\nby modulating the middle valve in Fig. 9(a) to exper-\nimentally probe the dependence of T1 on \u0394Ex\ntyp, which\nwould certainly be worthwhile as a further quantitative\nqubit characterization. We caution, however, that such\nan experiment does not by itself provide evidence for\ntopological protection. Indeed, the same exponential\ndependence predicted for \u0394Ex\ntyp would appear for the\nconventional Andreev qubit in Fig. 9(b). Sharp distinc-\ntions instead follow through the dependence on \u03c90 noted\nabove and in the main text.\nGenerally speaking, our treatment of qubit decoherence\ntimes T1 and T2 is meant to highlight universal aspects of\nthe physics, as is the theme for much of the present work.\nWe leave for future work a more microscopic treatment of\nrelaxation processes relevant to our putative topological\nqubit, including consideration of quantum mechanical\nproperties of specific noise sources.\n[1] C.

Using the tools of transcendental number theory it is demonstrated that quantum Turing machines (QTM) with rational amplitudes are sufficient to define the class of bounded error quantum polynomial time (BQP) introduced by Bernstein and Vazirani [Proc. 25th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computation, 1993, pp. 11--20, SIAM J. Comput., 26 (1997), pp. 1277--1339]. On the other hand, if quantum Turing machines are allowed unrestricted amplitudes (i.e., arbitrary complex amplitudes), then the corresponding BQP class has uncountable cardinality and contains sets of all Turing degrees. In contrast, allowing unrestricted amplitudes does not increase the power of computation for error-free quantum polynomial time (EQP). Moreover, with unrestricted amplitudes, BQP is not equal to EQP. The relationship between quantum complexity classes and classical complexity classes is also investigated. It is shown that when quantum Turing machines are restricted to have transition amplitudes which are algebraic numbers, BQP, EQP, and nondeterministic quantum polynomial time (NQP) are all contained in PP, hence in You can't use 'macro parameter character #' in math mode You can't use 'macro parameter character #' in math mode and PSPACE. A potentially practical issue of designing \"machine independent\" quantum programs is also addressed. A single (\"almost universal\") quantum algorithm based on Shor's method for factoring integers is developed which would run correctly on almost all quantum computers, even if the underlying unitary transformations are unknown to the programmer and the device builder.

For the\nimplementation of arbitrary operations, a quantum computer\nrequires a universal set of quantum logic gates. As in classical\nmodels of computation, quantum error correction techniques3,4\nenable recti\ufb01cation of small imperfections in gate operations,\nthus enabling perfect computation in the presence of noise. For\nfault-tolerant computation5, it is believed that error thresholds\nranging between 10\u22124 and 10\u22122 will be required\u2014depending on\nthe noise model and the computational overhead for realizing the\nquantum gates6\u20138\u2014but so far all experimental implementations\nhave fallen short of these requirements. Here, we report on a\nM\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen-type gate operation9,10 entangling ions with\na \ufb01delity of 99.3(1)%. The gate is carried out on a pair of\nqubits encoded in two trapped calcium ions using an amplitude-\nmodulated laser beam interacting with both ions at the same\ntime. A robust gate operation, mapping separable states onto\nmaximally entangled states is achieved by adiabatically switching\nthe laser\u2013ion coupling on and o\ufb00. We analyse the performance of\na single gate and concatenations of up to 21 gate operations.\nFor ion traps, all building blocks necessary for the construction\nof a universal quantum computer1 have been demonstrated over\nthe past decade. Currently, the most important challenges consist\nof scaling up the present systems to a higher number of qubits\nand raising the \ufb01delity of gate operations up to the point where\nquantum error correction techniques can be successfully applied.\nAlthough single-qubit gates are easily carried out with high quality,\nthe realization of high-\ufb01delity entangling two-qubit gates11\u201316 is\nmuch more demanding because the inter-ion distance is orders\nof magnitude bigger than the characteristic length scale of any\nstate-dependent ion\u2013ion interaction. Apart from quantum gates of\nthe Cirac\u2013Zoller type2,12, where a laser couples a single qubit with\na vibrational mode of the ion string at a time, most other gate\nrealizations entangling ions have relied on collective interactions of\nthe qubits with the laser control \ufb01elds11,13\u201315. These gate operations\nentangle transiently the collective pseudospin of the qubits with the\nvibrational mode and produce either a conditional phase shift17\nor a collective spin \ufb02ip9,10,18 of the qubits. Whereas the highest\n\ufb01delity F = 97% reported until now13 has been achieved with\na conditional phase gate acting on a pair of hyper\ufb01ne qubits\nin\n9Be+, spin-\ufb02ip gates have been limited so far to F \u2248 85%\n(refs 11,14). All of these experiments have used qubits encoded\nin hyper\ufb01ne or Zeeman ground states and a Raman transition\nmediated by an electric-dipole transition for coupling the qubits.\n\u23a5SD,n+1\u232a\n\u23a5DD,n\u232a\n\u23a5SS,n\u232a\n\u23a5SD,n\u232a\n\u23a5SD,n\u20131\u232a\n\u23a5DS,n+1\u232a\n\u23a5DS,n\u232a\n\u23a5DS,n\u20131\u232a\n\u03b4\n\u03c9\n\u03b4\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u2013\n\u03c9+\n\u03c9+\n\u03c9+\n\u03c9+\n\u03c9\u2013\n\u03c90\n\u03c4 \u2248 1 s\n\u03c9\u2013\n\u03c9\u2013\nD\nS\n729 nm\na\nb\nFigure 1 Gate mechanism. a, A bichromatic laser \ufb01eld with frequencies \u03c9+, \u03c9\u2212\nsatisfying 2\u03c90 = \u03c9+ + \u03c9\u2212 is tuned close to the upper and lower motional sideband\nof the qubit transition.

The Rabi frequency \u2126(t ) is smoothly switched on and off within 2 \u00b5s and adjusted such that a maximally entangled state is created at \u03c4gate = 50 \u00b5s. The\ndashed lines are calculated for \u00afnCOM = 0.05 from the propagator (1), neglecting pulse shaping and non-resonant carrier excitation. The solid lines are obtained by numerically\nsolving the Schr\u00a8odinger equation for time-dependent \u2126(t ) and imbalanced Rabi frequencies \u2126+/\u2126\u2212 = 1.094 (see the Methods section). b, A (\u03c0/2)\u03c6 analysis pulse applied\nto both ions prepared in \u03a81 gives rise to a parity oscillation P(\u03c6) = sin(2\u03c6) as a function of \u03c6.

The precise value of the phase \u03c60 is without signi\ufb01cance.

Moreover, adiabatic switching makes the collective\nspin-\ufb02ip operator independent of \u03b6 as Sy,\u03c8 \u2192 Sy for \u2126 \u2192 0. To\nachieve adiabatic following, it turns out to be su\ufb03cient to switch\non the laser within 2.5 oscillation periods of the ions\u2019 axial COM\nmode. When the laser is switched on adiabatically, equation (1) can\nbe simpli\ufb01ed by dropping the factor e\u2212iF(t)Sx and replacing Sy,\u03c8 by\nSy. To realize an entangling gate of duration \u03c4gate described by the\nunitary operator Ugate = exp(\u2212i(\u03c0/8)S2\ny), the laser intensity needs\nto be set such that \u03b7\u2126 \u2248 |\u03b4\u2212\u03bd|/4.\nTwo\n40Ca+ ions are con\ufb01ned in a linear trap21 with axial\nand radial COM mode frequencies of \u03bdaxial/2\u03c0 = 1.23 MHz\nand \u03bdradial/2\u03c0 = 4 MHz, respectively. After Doppler cooling and\nfrequency-resolved optical pumping22 in a magnetic \ufb01eld of 4 G,\nthe two axial modes are cooled close to the motional ground\nstate (\u00afnCOM, \u00afnstretch < 0.05(5)). Both ions are now initialized to\n|SS\u27e9 with a probability of more than 99.8%. Then, the gate\noperation is carried out, followed by an optional carrier pulse for\nanalysis. Finally, we measure the probability pk of \ufb01nding k ions\nin the |S\u27e9 state by detecting light scattered on the S1/2 \u2194 P1/2\ndipole transition with a photomultiplier for 3 ms. The error\nin state detection due to spontaneous decay from the D state\nis estimated to be less than 0.15%. Each experimental cycle is\nsynchronized with the frequency of the a.c.-power line and repeated\n50\u2013200 times. The laser beam carrying out the entangling operation\nis controlled by a double-pass acousto-optic modulator, which\nenables setting the frequency \u03c9L and phase \u03c6 of the beam. By\nmeans of a variable gain ampli\ufb01er, we control the radiofrequency\ninput power and hence the intensity pro\ufb01le of each laser pulse.\nTo generate a bichromatic light \ufb01eld, the beam is passed through\nanother acousto-optic modulator in single-pass con\ufb01guration that\nis driven simultaneously by two radiofrequency signals with\ndi\ufb00erence frequency \u03b4/\u03c0 (see the \ufb01rst paragraph of the Methods\nsection). Phase coherence of the laser frequencies is maintained by\nphase-locking all radiofrequency sources to an ultrastable quartz\noscillator. We use 1.8 mW average light power focused down to a\nspot size of 14 \u00b5m gaussian beam waist illuminating both ions from\nan angle of 45\u25e6 with equal intensity to achieve the Rabi frequencies\n\u2126/(2\u03c0) \u2248 110 kHz required for carrying out a gate operation with\n(\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4)/(2\u03c0) = 20 kHz and \u03b7 = 0.044. To make the bichromatic\nlaser pulses independent of the phase \u03b6, the pulse is switched on and\no\ufb00 by using Blackman-shaped pulse slopes of duration \u03c4r = 2 \u00b5s.\nMultiple application of the bichromatic pulse of duration \u03c4gate\nideally maps the state |SS\u27e9 to\n|SS\u27e9\n\u03c4gate\n\u2212\u2192 |SS\u27e9+i|DD\u27e9\n|\n{z\n}\n\u03a81\n\u03c4gate\n\u2212\u2192 |DD\u27e9\n\u03c4gate\n\u2212\u2192 |DD\u27e9\n+ i|SS\u27e9\n\u03c4gate\n\u2212\u2192 |SS\u27e9\n\u03c4gate\n\u2212\u2192 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n(2)\nup to global phases.

The length of the pulse is equivalent to the application of up to 17 gate operations. Maximally entangled states are created whenever p0(\u03c4) and p2(\u03c4) coincide\nand p1(\u03c4) vanishes.\nF = \u27e8\u03a81|\u03c1exp|\u03a81\u27e9 = (\u03c1\nexp\nSS,SS + \u03c1\nexp\nDD,DD)/2 + Im\u03c1\nexp\nDD,SS, with the\ndensity matrix \u03c1exp describing the experimentally produced qubits\u2019\nstate, is inferred from measurements on a set of 42,400 Bell states\ncontinuously produced within a measurement time of 35 min.\nFluorescence measurements on 13,000 Bell states reveal that\n\u03c1\nexp\nSS,SS + \u03c1\nexp\nDD,DD = p2 + p0 = 0.9965(4).

Starting from state |SS\u27e9, Fig. 3 shows the time\nevolution of the state populations for pulse lengths equivalent to\nup to 17 gate times. The ions are entangled and disentangled\nconsecutively up to nine times, the populations closely following\nthe predicted unitary evolution of the propagator (1) for \u03b6 = 0\nshown in Fig. 3 as solid lines.\nTo study sources of gate imperfections we measured the \ufb01delity\nof Bell states obtained after a pulse length \u03c4m for up to m = 21\ngate operations. The sum of the populations p0(t) + p2(t) does\nnot return perfectly to one at times \u03c4m as shown in Fig. 4 but\ndecreases by about 0.0022(1) per gate. This linear decrease could\nbe explained by resonant spin-\ufb02ip processes caused by spectral\ncomponents of the qubit laser that are far outside the laser\u2019s\nlinewidth of 20 Hz (ref. 21) (see the Methods section). The \ufb01gure\nalso shows the amplitude of parity fringe pattern scans at odd\ninteger multiples of \u03c4gate similar to the one in Fig. 2b.

For m = 21, the \ufb01delity is still F21 = 80(1)%. Similar results are achieved\nwhen replacing the entangling pulse of length \u03c4m by m amplitude-shaped pulses\neach of which is realizing an entangling gate operation.\nquantum algorithms with tens of entangling operations look\nrealistic, the gate presented here also opens interesting perspectives\nfor generating multiparticle entanglement23 by a single laser\ninteracting with more than two qubits at once. For the generation\nof N-qubit Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger states, there exist no\nconstraints on the positioning of ions in the bichromatic beam\nthat otherwise made generation of Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger\nstates beyond N = 6 di\ufb03cult in the experiment with hyper\ufb01ne\nqubits described in ref. 24.

Akin to\nnuclear magnetic resonance techniques, this method should enable\nrefocusing of unwanted qubit\u2013qubit interactions27 and open the\ndoor to a wide variety of entangling multiqubit interactions.\nMETHODS\nA.C.-STARK-SHIFT COMPENSATION\nThe red- and the blue-detuned frequency components \u03c9\u00b1 of the bichromatic\nlight \ufb01eld cause dynamic (a.c.-) Stark shifts by non-resonant excitation on\nthe carrier and the \ufb01rst-order sidebands that exactly cancel each other if the\ncorresponding laser intensities I\u00b1 are equal. The remaining a.c.-Stark shift\ndue to other Zeeman transitions and far-detuned dipole transitions amounts\nto 7 kHz for a gate time \u03c4gate = 50 \u00b5s. These shifts could be compensated by\nusing an extra far-detuned light \ufb01eld28 or by properly setting the intensity\nratio I+/I\u2212. We use the latter technique, which makes the coupling strengths\n\u2126SS\u2194DD \u221d 2\u221aI+I\u2212, \u2126SD\u2194DS \u221d I+ +I\u2212 slightly unequal. However, the error is\ninsigni\ufb01cant as \u2126SD\u2194DS/\u2126SS\u2194DD \u22121 = 4\u00d710\u22123 in our experiments.\nSOURCES OF GATE INFIDELITY\nA bichromatic force with time-dependent \u2126(t) acting on ions prepared in an\neigenstate of Sy creates coherent states \u03b1(t) following trajectories in phase space\nthat generally do not close20,29. For the short rise times used in our experiments,\nthis e\ufb00ect can be made negligibly (<10\u22124) small by slightly increasing the\ngate time.\nSpin \ufb02ips induced by incoherent o\ufb00-resonant light of the bichromatic laser\n\ufb01eld reduce the gate \ufb01delity. A beat frequency measurement between the gate\nlaser and a similar independent laser system that was spectrally \ufb01ltered indicates\nthat a fraction \u03b3 of about 2\u00d710\u22127 of the total laser power is contained in\na 20 kHz bandwidth B around the carrier transition when the laser is tuned\nclose to a motional sideband. A simple model predicts spin \ufb02ips to cause a gate\nerror with probability p\ufb02ip = (\u03c0\u03b3|\u03bd\u2212\u03b4|)/(2\u03b72B). This would correspond to\na probability p\ufb02ip = 8\u00d710\u22124, whereas the measured state populations shown\nin Fig. 4 would be consistent with p\ufb02ip = 2\u00d710\u22123. Spin-\ufb02ip errors could be\nfurther reduced by two orders of magnitude by spectrally \ufb01ltering the laser light\nand increasing the trap frequency \u03bd/(2\u03c0) to above 2 MHz where noise caused\nby the laser frequency stabilization is much reduced.\nImperfections due to low-frequency noise randomly shifting the laser\nfrequency \u03c9L with respect to the atomic transition frequency \u03c90 were\nestimated from Ramsey measurements on a single ion showing that an average\nfrequency deviation \u03c3(\u03c9L\u2212\u03c90)/(2\u03c0) = 160 Hz occurred. From numerical\nsimulations, we infer that for a single gate operation this frequency uncertainty\ngives rise to a \ufb01delity loss of 0.25% (an in\ufb01delity of 10\u22124 would require\n\u03c3(\u03c9L\u2212\u03c90)/(2\u03c0) = 30 Hz). In our parity oscillation experiments shown in Figs 2b\nand 4, however, this loss is not directly observable because a small error in\nthe frequency of the bichromatic laser beam carrying out the gate operation is\ncorrelated with a similar frequency error of the carrier ( \u03c0\n2 )\u03c6 pulse probing the\nentanglement produced by the gate so that the phase \u03c6 of the analysing pulse\nwith respect to the qubit state remains well de\ufb01ned.\nVariations in the coupling strength \u03b4\u2126 induced by low-frequency laser\nintensity noise and thermally occupied radial modes were inferred from\nan independent measurement by recording the amplitude decay of carrier\noscillations. Assuming a gaussian decay, we \ufb01nd a relative variation of\n\u03b4\u2126/\u2126 = 1.4(1)\u00d710\u22122. For m entangling gate operations, the loss of \ufb01delity\nis approximately given by 1\u2212 F = (\u03c0m/2)2(\u03b4\u2126/\u2126)2 and contributes with\n5\u00d710\u22124 to the error of a single gate operation. For the multiple gate operations\nshown in Fig. 4, this source of noise explains the gaussian decay of the parity\nfringe amplitude, whereas laser frequency noise reduces the fringe amplitude by\nless than 1% even for 21 gate operations. In combination with error estimates\nfor state preparation, detection and laser noise, the analysis of multiple gates\nprovides us with a good understanding of the most important sources of\ngate in\ufb01delity.\nReceived 19 December 2007; accepted 25 March 2008; published 27 April 2008.\nReferences\n1.\nNielsen, M.

In adiabatic quantum computing3,4,5, a system is slowly evolved from the ground state of a simple initial Hamiltonian to a final Hamiltonian that encodes a computational problem. The appeal of this approach lies in the combination of simplicity and generality; in principle, any problem can be encoded. In practice, applications are restricted by limited connectivity, available interactions and noise. A complementary approach is digital quantum computing6, which enables the construction of arbitrary interactions and is compatible with error correction7,8, but uses quantum circuit algorithms that are problem-specific. Here we combine the advantages of both approaches by implementing digitized adiabatic quantum computing in a superconducting system. We tomographically probe the system during the digitized evolution and explore the scaling of errors with system size. We then let the full system find the solution to random instances of the one-dimensional Ising problem as well as problem Hamiltonians that involve more complex interactions. This digital quantum simulation9,10,11,12 of the adiabatic algorithm consists of up to nine qubits and up to 1,000 quantum logic gates. The demonstration of digitized adiabatic quantum computing in the solid state opens a path to synthesizing long-range correlations and solving complex computational problems. When combined with fault-tolerance, our approach becomes a general-purpose algorithm that is scalable.

Such Hamiltonians would enable universal adiabatic quantum computing14,15 and improve the performance for difficult instances of classical optimization problems16. Additionally, simulating interacting fermions for applications in physics and chemistry requires non-stoquastic Hamiltonians1,17. In general, these Hamiltonians are more difficult to study classically, because Monte Carlo simulations fail to converge owing to the \u2018sign problem\u201918. A hallmark of non-stoquastic Hamiltonians is the need for several distinct types of coupling, for example, \u03c3z\u03c3z and \u03c3x\u03c3x couplings with different signs, where \u03c3x and \u03c3z are Pauli operators. With a digitized approach, different couplings can be constructed without change of hardware. Long-range multibody interactions can be assembled to aid in quantum tunnelling19 or to encode the non-local terms for fermionic simulations20,21. And finally, analogue systems exhibit noise, which can thwart the evolution, whereas digital systems can be fully fault-tolerant. Crucially, this ability makes the digitized approach scalable, because any non-corrected implementation is ultimately limited by the accumulation of error. Our experiment addresses the challenge of adiabatically evolving to final problem Hamiltonians that are non-stoquastic. We explore the adiabatic quantum evolutions of one-dimensional spin chains with nearest-neighbour coupling. We start with a simple ferromagnetic problem to visualize the adiabatic evolution process. We identify specific error contributions, and follow up by exploring the scaling of errors with system size. We finish by testing the device on random stoquastic and non-stoquastic problems. The initial (\u2018I\u2019) and problem (\u2018P\u2019) Hamiltonians are where and denote local field strengths of the ith qubit, and denote the \u03c3z\u03c3z and \u03c3x\u03c3x coupling strengths, respectively, between qubits i and i + 1 and Bx,I denotes the initial field strength, which is equal for all qubits. The Ising model is recovered when Bx\u2009=\u2009Jxx\u2009=\u20090 for all i. We initialize the system with HI and vary the system Hamiltonian to the final problem: H\u2009=\u2009sHP\u2009+\u2009(1\u2009\u2212\u2009s)HI, with s going from 0 to 1. An example problem is shown in Fig. 1a. Figure 1: Spin-chain problem and device. a, We implement one-dimensional spin problems with variable local fields and couplings between adjacent spins. An example of a stoquastic problem Hamiltonian with local x and z fields, indicated by the gold arrows in the spheres, and \u03c3z\u03c3z couplings, whose strength is indicated by the radius of the links, is shown. Red denotes a ferromagnetic (J\u2009=\u2009+1) and blue an antiferromagnetic (J\u2009=\u2009\u22121) link. The problem Hamiltonian is for the instance shown in Fig. 4c. b, Optical picture of the superconducting quantum device with nine Xmon22 qubits Q0\u2013Q8 (false-coloured cross-shaped structures), made from aluminium (light) on a sapphire substrate (dark). Connections to read-out resonators are at the top; control wiring is at the bottom. Scale bar, 200 \u03bcm. PowerPoint slide Full size image The spin system is formed by a superconducting circuit with nine qubits. The qubits are the cross-shaped structures22, patterned out of an aluminium layer on top of a sapphire substrate, and arranged in a linear chain; see Fig. 1b. Each qubit is capacitively coupled to its nearest neighbours, and can be individually controlled and measured; for details see ref. 23. By tuning the frequencies of the qubits we can implement a tunable controlled-phase entangling gate. We use the first-order Trotter expansion to digitize24. The evolution is divided into many steps and implemented using gates; see Supplementary Information. For quantifying digitized adiabatic evolutions there are four sets of data:(1) the ideal continuous time evolution, for infinite time, which is free of error and provides the perfect solution, and which we refer to as the \u2018target state\u2019;(2) the ideal continuous time evolution for a finite time T, which is sensitive to non-adiabatic errors, and which we call \u2018ideal continuous evolution\u2019;(3) the \u2018ideal digital evolution\u2019, where the finite ideal continuous evolution is digitized, and which therefore includes digital error as well as non-adiabatic errors; and (4) the experimental results, which include a contribution from gate errors as well. We start with a ferromagnetic chain problem with N\u2009=\u20094 spins, and equal coupling strength Jzz\u2009=\u20092. The qubits are initialized in the |+\u3009\u2297N state, and we use five steps to evolve the system to the problem Hamiltonian, performing quantum state tomography after each step. We linearly decrease the Bx term to zero, starting at Bx\u2009=\u20092, and simultaneously increase the coupling strength from 0 to 2, ending the evolution at a scaled time of |J|T\u2009=\u20096. The density matrices are shown in Fig. 2a. With each step, the quantum state evolves and matrix elements in the middle vanish while the elements at the four corners grow to form the density matrix \u03c1 of the Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger (GHZ) state\u2014the solution to the ferromagnetic problem\u2014with a fidelity tr(\u03c1target-state\u03c1)\u2009=\u20090.55. The density matrix is constrained to be physical25. The ideal digital evolution is plotted in Fig. 2b, reaching a fidelity of 0.85. The Hamiltonian during evolution, construction of the algorithm and the pulse sequence are shown in Fig. 2c\u2013e. In each Trotter step, we perform a \u03c3z\u03c3z operation on each pair to implement the ferromagnetic \u03c3z\u03c3z coupling, followed by single-qubit rotations around the x axis to simulate the transversal magnetic field. In the pulse sequence, the rectangular-like frequency detuning pulses indicate where \u03c3z\u03c3z interaction is implemented by bringing qubits near resonance (highlighted for s\u2009=\u20090.2 in Fig. 2d, e). The wave-like pulses are microwave gates. The decrease in Bx is reflected by the reduction in amplitudes of the corresponding pulses (highlighted for s\u2009=\u20090.4 and s\u2009=\u20091.0 in Fig. 2d, e). Additional microwave echo pulses decrease coupling to other qubits and the environment. We find mean phase errors from neighbouring parasitic interactions to be around 0.05 rad, equivalent to an error contribution below 10\u22123 (see Supplementary Information). Figure 2: Quantum state tomography of the digital evolution into a Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger state. A four-qubit system is adiabatically evolved from an initial Hamiltonian in which all spins are aligned along the x axis to a problem Hamiltonian with equal ferromagnetic couplings between adjacent qubits (Jzz\u2009=\u20092). a, Real part of the experimental density matrix \u03c1 at the start (left-most panel) and after each Trotter step, showing the growth of the major elements on the four corners, measured using quantum state tomography.

Implementations of \u03c3z\u03c3z coupling and local x-fields are highlighted. Angles of rotation are denoted by \u03d5 and \u03b8. See Supplementary Information for imaginary parts of the density matrices and the ideal continuous evolution. PowerPoint slide Full size image The experiment in Fig. 2 shows that digital synthesis of adiabatic evolutions can successfully be implemented in a solid-state quantum platform. Using five Trotter steps, 15 entangling gates and 144 single-qubit microwave gates, the system produces a GHZ state with a fidelity that indicates genuine entanglement. It shows that complex pulse sequences are possible, and that the errors make sense: the fidelity of the experimental data with respect to the ideal digital evolution is 0.64. The overlap between the ideal digital evolution and ideal continuous time evolution for finite time is 0.93, and the overlap of this continuous evolution with the GHZ state (see Supplementary Information) is 0.88. The product of the above three values (0.52) is close to the experimental fidelity of 0.55, and shows that the experimental error is a combination of non-adiabatic, digitization and gate errors. Adopting the entangling gate error of 7.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 and 8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 as measured in ref. 25, we expect an accumulated gate error of 0.23 whereas we find an infidelity of 0.36; we attribute the difference to errors in maintaining the phases of the four-qubit system for a duration of 2.1\u2009\u03bcs. An important feature of the errors is the prevalence of populations and correlations of the |0001\u3009, |0011\u3009 and |0111\u3009 states and their bit-wise inverses; see arrows in Fig. 2a. Their elements are also present in the ideal digital results and in the ideal continuous evolutions (see Supplementary Information). These are states that deviate by a single kink from the target state, having a residual energy of 2|J|, indicating the presence of non-adiabatic errors. These kink errors are connected to the formation of defects during a phase transition, as described by the Kibble\u2013Zurek mechanism26,27. To explore the scaling of errors we vary the system size from two to nine qubits and measure the likelihood of kinks and residual energy. We keep the ferromagnetic problem Hamiltonian, Jzz\u2009=\u20092, but vary the scaled time such that |J|T goes from 0 to 3. For the two- to six-qubit systems we use five Trotter steps and for seven to nine qubits we use two steps, to limit the total number of gates. The kink likelihood for the four-qubit system is shown in Fig. 3a. Here, the likelihood of one kink is given by the sum of the probabilities of all states with one kink. When increasing |J|T from 0 to 3 the kink likelihood decreases, and the likelihood of no kinks increases (black line in Fig. 3a). The experimental data closely follow the ideal digital evolution (dashed lines in Fig. 3a). This picture is repeated for all systems; see Supplementary Information. Figure 3: Kink errors, residual energy and scaling with system size. a, Kink likelihood for the four-qubit configuration. Solid lines, experiment; dashed lines, ideal digital evolution; dotted lines, ideal continuous time evolution. b, Residual energy in the adiabatic evolutions of ferromagnetic chains (Jzz\u2009=\u20092) in configurations with two to nine qubits (as indicated by the coloured-coded numerals). The green solid line shows the ideal square-root trend for the large-scale limit (Supplementary Information). Distinct contributions to error are highlighted. PowerPoint slide Full size image The kink likelihood indicates that the final state has residual energy, because a state with a single kink has energy 2|J| above the target state. The residual energies for all systems are plotted in Fig. 3b. Initially, the residual energy is constant at |J|T\u2009\u2248\u20090, then starts to decrease around |J|T\u2009\u2248\u20090.5, following the ideal digital (dashed lines in Fig. 3b) and ideal continuous time (dotted lines in Fig. 3b) evolutions. For two to six qubits, this decrease continues until the traces start to settle around |J|T\u2009=\u20093. For the seven- to nine-qubit systems, the residual energy starts to increase again around |J|T\u2009=\u20092, following the ideal digital evolution. See Supplementary Information for the pulse sequence for the nine-qubit experiment, all kink likelihoods and the differences between the residual energies. The main result is that Fig. 3 distinctly shows the different contributions to error (highlighted): for , the residual energy is dominated by non-adiabatic errors because the evolution moves too fast. For |J|T\u2009>\u20092, the flattening out of the residual energy for the configurations with two to six qubits indicates that gate errors dominate, because the predictions from the ideal digital evolutions are substantially lower. For the larger qubit configurations with seven to nine qubits, the residual energy follows the digital predictions upwards, indicating that digitization errors dominate. In addition, the residual energy visibly decreases at |J|T\u2009=\u20091 for all configurations, implying that the digitized evolutions are able to approach the target state even for nine qubits. We also applied local fields to explore the lifting of degeneracy and generation of long-range correlations; see Supplementary Information. We next discuss how the digitized approach can solve stoquastic and non-stoquastic problems with comparable performance, by testing random problems on three, six, seven, eight and nine qubits. Problems have local fields and couplings with random strength and sign. We independently choose Bz and Bx from [\u22122, 2] for each spin and Jzz from [\u22122, \u22120.5] or [0.5, 2] for each link. This creates a random Ising problem with frustration. For non-stoquastic problems we also add Jxx coupling for each link, with values from [\u22122, \u22120.5] or [0.5, 2], effectively doubling the amount of entangling gates. We avoid small couplings to reduce the number of gates. For the three-qubit systems we used quantum state tomography on 100 separate instances to include off-diagonal elements in the fidelity metrics. For six or more qubits tomography is not practical and so we measured the correlated probabilities on 250 separate instances, and use a measure of success that is equal to |\u3008\u03a8ideal|\u03a8\u3009|2 (with \u03a8 the wavefunction) to first order and sets an upper bound on the fidelity: , in which Pk,ideal and Pk are probabilities and k runs over the computational basis. In Fig. 4 we show the results for stoquastic problems with three, six and nine spins, and non-stoquastic problems with three, six and seven spins. For each case, we highlight a single instance and show histograms of the fidelities. Figure 4: Digital evolutions of random stoquastic and non-stoquastic problems. As stoquastic problems we use frustrated Ising Hamiltonians, with random local x and z fields, and random \u03c3z\u03c3z couplings. a\u2013c, Stoquastic results for three, six and nine qubits. a, For three qubits we have done tomography. An example instance is provided on the left, where we show the real part of the density matrix \u03c1. Coloured bars denote the experimental data, and black and grey outlined bars show the ideal digital evolution and the target state, respectively. The diagonals of the experiment (colour) and the target state (grey) are shown in the bottom right panel (as indicated by the dashed arrow), sorted by ideal target state results. The fidelity results for all 100 instances are summarized in the histogram (top right), where ratio denotes the normalized occurrence; coloured bars, fidelities of experimental results with respect to the target state; grey bars, fidelities of the ideal digital evolution with respect to the target state. b, c, The correlated probabilities for six (b) and nine (c) qubits, sorted by target state results. Experimental data are in colour, the target state is in grey. The results for all 250 instances are summarized in the insets. For the nine-qubit instance (c), the first 100 elements are shown. In a\u2013c, the coloured squares surrounding or below the plots indicate qubit indices, as in Fig. 2. d\u2013f, As in a\u2013c, but for non-stoquastic problems, which have additional random \u03c3x\u03c3x couplings. Here we plot the data for three, six and seven qubits, for which the average measure of success is above the random baseline (not shown; see text). The results show that the system can find the ground states of stoquastic and non-stoquastic Hamiltonians with similar performance. PowerPoint slide Full size image For the three-spin stoquastic problems, the real part of the density matrix of one instance and a histogram of its diagonal elements are shown in Fig. 4a. In the tomography plot (left panel of Fig. 4a), we overlay the experimental results (colour) with the ideal digital (black) and target state (grey) results. For this example, we find fidelities tr(\u03c1ideal-digital\u03c1)\u2009=\u20090.70 and tr(\u03c1target-state\u03c1)\u2009=\u20090.63. In the top right panel of Fig. 4a, we show the histograms for all instances of the fidelities tr(\u03c1target-state\u03c1) in colour. The fidelity of the ideal digital evolution with respect to the target state is shown in grey. Stoquastic problems with six and nine qubits are displayed in Fig. 4b and c, respectively. The main figures show the measured probabilities (colour) sorted by the target state results (grey), and the insets display the histograms. Results for the non-stoquastic problems are displayed in Fig. 4d\u2013f. The key result from Fig. 4 is that the physical system can find solutions to non-stoquastic problems with a performance similar to that of stoquastic problems. The three-qubit examples show major diagonal as well as off-diagonal elements close to the expected positions. For six and more qubits, the coloured bars in the example instances are mostly on the left, indicating that the system has a clear preference for returning the probabilities associated with the ideal solutions. The physical system produces results that are comparable to the expectations, as demonstrated by the histograms showing a substantial overlap between experiment and theory. Moreover, the numbers are consistent, as we now discuss for the six-qubit stoquastic example. The mean success rate between the ideal adiabatic evolution and target state is 0.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, indicating that the scaled time is large enough to capture the evolution dynamics. The mean success rate of the ideal digitized evolution with respect to the ideal adiabatic evolution is 0.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, indicating a proper Trotterization of the evolution. Finally, the value for the experimental evolution with respect to the ideal digitized evolution is 0.714\u2009\u00b1\u20090.006, indicating that the experiment follows the ideal digital evolution reasonably well. The product of these three numbers, 0.31, is very close to the mean value between the experimental data and the target state, 0.296\u2009\u00b1\u20090.007. This shows that the experimental errors arise from comparable contributions of non-adiabatic, digital and gate errors. For the six-qubit non-stoquastic case, experimental-to-target state values are higher than this product, suggesting that errors partially cancel. A further reason for the higher success rate could be that the presence of \u03c3x\u03c3x terms is helpful for difficult problems in general16. This experiment took up to nine qubits and up to 103 gates. See Supplementary Information for pulse sequences, gate counts, problem parameters and additional metrics. To further quantify the performance of the system, we compare experimental and random probabilities with the theoretical results. In essence, we take a uniform random distribution over the 2N possible measurement outputs as a baseline sanity check. We find that, for the stoquastic problems, the measures of success of all six- to nine-qubit configurations are significantly above this baseline: for six qubits, the success measure of the experimental data with respect to the target state is 0.296\u2009\u00b1\u20090.007, whereas using uniform random probabilities produces a value of 0.168\u2009\u00b1\u20090.005. For the nine-qubit case the numbers are 0.122\u2009\u00b1\u20090.006 for the experimental data and 0.074\u2009\u00b1\u20090.004 for random. For the non-stoquastic problems the numbers are 0.380\u2009\u00b1\u20090.009 and 0.335\u2009\u00b1\u20090.008 for the six-qubit configuration, and 0.311\u2009\u00b1\u20090.009 and 0.277\u2009\u00b1\u20090.008 for the seven-qubit configuration. A complete listing for all configurations is provided in Supplementary Information. This experiment shows that digital synthesis of the adiabatic evolutions can be used to find signatures of the ground states of random stoquastic and non-stoquastic problems. Errors arise from a comparable contribution of non-adiabatic, digital and gate errors, and success rates are significantly above a uniform random baseline. For larger qubit systems, the number of Trotter steps needs to be limited to reduce the accumulation of gate error, in turn limiting the evolution we can simulate. Therefore, the experimental error is larger, arising from a combination of gate, digitization and non-adiabatic error. However, in an error-corrected system, the number of gates is in principle unconstrained, digitization can be made arbitrarily accurate and one can move more slowly through critical parts of the evolution. Although we have used Trotterization28, the scaling of the digitization becomes more appealing with recent methods based on the truncation of Taylor series29. See Supplementary Information for further motivations and discussions. We believe that the digitized approach to adiabatic quantum evolutions of complex problems\u2014where local fields, variable coupling strengths and types, and multibody interactions can be constructed\u2014would become viable on the small scale with lower gate errors, and that large-scale applications could be achieved in conjunction with error correction. We hope our work accelerates further improvements in superconducting quantum systems and motivates research into the encoding and measurement of non-stoquastic computational problems. In addition, we anticipate that these results encourage work on the efficient digitization of algorithms for small- and large-scale systems, for which reducing the effects of noise by, for example, dynamical decoupling techniques, or reducing the circuit complexity is paramount.

Although adiabiatic quantum computers can be very fast at specific tasks, they are limited by noise and errors that cannot be corrected during the computation. In contrast, universal quantum computers are digital devices that use logic gates and allow for error correction. Here, Rami Barends . combine the advantages of adiabiatic and universal quantum computers by digitizing an adiabiatic quantum computation. This approach allows for encoding non-stoquastic Hamiltonians, which are crucial for simulating physical and chemical systems with interacting fermions. show all Nature (Nature) ISSN 1476-4687 (online) ISSN 0028-0836 (print) About Nature Portfolio About us Press releases Press office Contact us Discover content Journals A-Z Articles by subject Protocol Exchange Nature Index Publishing policies Nature portfolio policies Open access Author & Researcher services Reprints & permissions Research data Language editing Scientific editing Nature Masterclasses Research Solutions Libraries & institutions Librarian service & tools Librarian portal Open research Recommend to library Advertising & partnerships Advertising Partnerships & Services Media kits Branded content Professional development Nature Careers Nature Conferences Regional websites Nature Africa Nature China Nature India Nature Italy Nature Japan Nature Korea Nature Middle East Privacy Policy Use of cookies Your privacy choices/Manage cookies Legal notice Accessibility statement Terms & Conditions Your US state privacy rights \u00a9 2024 Springer Nature Limited",

Thus, interaction would then need to be on a quantum client:quantum server basis. Barz et al. (p. 303; see the Perspective by Vedral) implemented a proof-of-principle protocol that illustrates complete security in such a setup\u2014for both the client and the server. In this blind quantum computing protocol, the client maintains the security of their data and the specifics of the calculation they want to perform, and the server cannot access the data or calculation of the client. Abstract Quantum computers, besides offering substantial computational speedups, are also expected to preserve the privacy of a computation. We present an experimental demonstration of blind quantum computing in which the input, computation, and output all remain unknown to the computer. We exploit the conceptual framework of measurement-based quantum computation that enables a client to delegate a computation to a quantum server. Various blind delegated computations, including one- and two-qubit gates and the Deutsch and Grover quantum algorithms, are demonstrated. The client only needs to be able to prepare and transmit individual photonic qubits. Our demonstration is crucial for unconditionally secure quantum cloud computing and might become a key ingredient for real-life applications, especially when considering the challenges of making powerful quantum computers widely available. SIGN UP FOR THE SCIENCE eTOC Get the latest table of contents from Science delivered right to you! SIGN UP Among many quantum-enhanced applications, quantum computing has generated much interest because of the discovery of applications (1\u20134) that outperform their best-known classical counterparts. Although vast technological developments already allow for small-scale quantum computers with ionic (5\u20138), photonic (9\u201316), superconducting (17\u201321), and solid-state (22\u201324) systems, the hurdles encountered in realizing quantum devices are enormous. This intrinsic technical complexity may result in, initially, only a few powerful quantum computers, or quantum servers, operating at specialized facilities. A key challenge in using such central quantum computers is enabling a quantum computation on a remote server while keeping the client\u2019s data hidden from the server (25\u201330). The classical analog of this issue was addressed in 1978 (31) and became one of the most active fields in cryptography. A full solution was over 30 years in the making and enables (32) the evaluation of data-processing circuits over encrypted data without the need for any decryption, but provides only computational security. In analogy to many widely used cryptographic protocols, this means that the security relies on the assumption of a limit to the adversary\u2019s computational power, as well as on the difficulty of the underlying mathematical problem. Recent theoretical work (29) overcomes this limitation and shows that quantum computers can provide unconditional security in data processing, a hitherto unrecognized potential of quantum computers that is not known to be achievable classically. This new fundamental advantage of quantum computers is manifested in the blind quantum computing (BQC) protocol that combines notions of quantum cryptography and quantum computation to achieve the delegation of a quantum computation from a client with no quantum computational power to an untrusted quantum server, such that the client\u2019s data remains perfectly private. BQC uses the concept of one-way quantum computing (33\u201337), a measurement-based model of computation (38, 39) that represents a paradigm shift in the understanding of complex data processing by clearly separating the classical and quantum parts of a computation. In the most general case, a one-way quantum computer has its basis in highly entangled multiparticle states, so-called cluster states, which are a resource for universal quantum computing. On these cluster states, adaptive single-qubit measurements alone are sufficient to implement deterministic universal quantum computation. Different algorithms require only a different pattern of single-qubit measurements on a sufficiently large cluster state. Therefore, a quantum computation is hidden as long as these measurements are successfully hidden. In order to achieve this, the BQC protocol exploits special resources called blind cluster states that must be chosen carefully to be a generic structure that reveals nothing about the underlying computation (Fig. 1). These blind cluster states are multiparticle entangled states created by preparing qubits in | \u03b8 j \u232a = 1 / 2 ( | 0 \u232a + e i \u03b8 j | 1 \u232a ) , where |0\u232a and |1\u232a are the computational basis of the physical qubits and \u03b8j is chosen uniformly at random from {0, \u03c0/4, \u2026,7\u03c0/4}, and then interacting each qubit via controlled-phase (CPhase) gates with its nearest neighbors (here, CPhase | i \u232a | j \u232a \u21a6 ( \u2212 1 ) i j | i \u232a | j \u232a with i, j \u2208 {0, 1}). Similar to the one-way quantum computer, a blind computation is described by a pattern of consecutive adaptive single-qubit measurements. Measuring the first qubit, initially in state |\u03b81\u232a, of a one-dimensional linear blind cluster in the basis | \u00b1 \u03b4 1 \u232a = 1 / 2 ( | 0 \u232a \u00b1 e i \u03b4 1 | 1 \u232a ) has the effect of applying a single-qubit rotation Rz(\u2212\u03b41 + \u03b81) on the encoded input state |+\u232a, followed by a Hadamard, H. Here, Rz(\u03d5) = exp(\u2212i\u03d5\u03c3z/2), H = ( \u03c3 x + \u03c3 z ) / 2 , and \u03c3x, \u03c3y, and \u03c3z denote the usual Pauli matrices. As long as the angle \u03b81 of the rotated qubit is unknown, the real rotation remains secret. Fig. 1 The universal blind cluster state for BQC. This family of cluster states can be built by joining (yellow edges), for example, using optical fusion operations, smaller cluster states (purple edges, gray background) that are in one of the configurations of | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a as implemented in the laboratory. The resulting state allows universal blind quantum computation when combined with measurements in the basis |\u00b1\u03b4\u232a, \u03b4 \u2208 {0, \u03c0/4, \u2026 7\u03c0/4}. This feature of blind cluster states is used to perform a delegated computation on a server such that all data and the whole computation remain hidden. The only quantum power that is required from the client is the preparation of each qubit j in a state |\u03b8j\u232a and the transmission of the qubits to the server; in particular, there is no need for any quantum memory (40) or ability to perform quantum gates. From this point on in the protocol, the client communicates only measurement instructions and can be considered completely classical. The quantum server, which can perform universal quantum computation, performs a CPhase gate between qubits received from the client. Then in each round of interaction, the server performs adaptive single-qubit measurements in the | \u00b1 \u03b4 j \u232a basis, as instructed by the client. The measurement basis is chosen such that \u03b4j = \u03d5j + \u03b8j + \u03c0rj, where \u03d5j is the desired target rotation and rj is a randomly chosen value in {0, 1} that hides the value of the measurement outcome. These classical measurement angles are set in such a way to compensate for the initial random rotation \u03b8j and any other Pauli by-products (12, 41) produced by previous measurements. We present an optimized version of the original protocol that uses photonic qubits. Photons are ideally suited for BQC because they provide the natural choice as quantum information carrier for the client and enable quantum computing for the server. This is a unique feature of photonic systems and so far not realizable in other quantum systems. We experimentally demonstrate the concept of BQC via a series of blind computations on four-qubit blind cluster states. These photonic states can be combined via optical gates to create a universal resource state for BQC (Fig. 1) (29). Our protocol uses, compared with the original BQC proposal (29), the experimental resources in an optimized way, independent of the physical system and without affecting blindness. Optimized BQC. It is a conceptual strength of the BQC protocol that perfect security can be established over a subset of computations even if not all of the qubits are unknown to the server. For the four-qubit blind cluster state, it is sufficient for the client to be able to prepare only one or two of the qubits in arbitrary states |\u03b8j\u232a for delegating various one- and two-qubit circuits as well as quantum algorithms (Fig. 2). This is a remarkable optimization for the experimental requirements and is demonstrated here [see supporting online material (SOM) section S1 for theoretical details]. Furthermore, this optimization is scalable beyond our four-qubit experimental setting and creates an interesting challenge on the design level to construct a computation such that the sensitive measurements remain hidden. Fig. 2 Blind circuits and corresponding measurement patterns. (A to F) We implement various types of blind computations by using different configurations for | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a . For all implementations, \u03b82 and \u03b83 are blind, as has been demonstrated in the experiment. The angles \u03b81 and \u03b84 are fixed to be zero. The measurement angle \u03b4j, as instructed by the client, depends on the initial rotation of the qubit \u03b8j (unknown to the server), the target rotation \u03d5j, and a randomly chosen value rj in {0, 1}. We thus fix \u03b81 and \u03b84 equal to zero while varying the choices of \u03b82 and \u03b83. The resulting four-qubit linear blind cluster state is | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a = 1 2 [ | + 00 + \u232a 1234 + e i \u03b8 3 | + 01 \u2212 \u232a 1234 + e i \u03b8 2 | \u2212 10 + \u232a 1234 \u2212 e i ( \u03b8 2 + \u03b8 3 ) (1) where \u03b8 ^ = ( n 2 , n 3 ) and ( \u03b8 2 , \u03b8 3 ) = ( n 2 \u03c0 4 , n 3 \u03c0 4 ) . Our experimental implementation of BQC has its basis in such a family of four-qubit linear blind cluster states. These are produced by using photon emissions of a non-collinear type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion process (SPDC) (10, 42) (SOM sections S3 and S4). If four photons are emitted into the output modes of the polarizing beam splitters 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 3A), they are in a highly entangled state that is equivalent to the state | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a under the local unitary operation H \u2297 I \u2297 I \u2297 H: Fig. 3 Experimental setup, measurement results (solid), and ideal values (wireframe).

(C) Experimental demonstration of a single-qubit rotation around the Z axis of the Bloch sphere and its consistency with blindness. Fixed measurement angles on the blind linear cluster result in rotations on the encoded qubit that depend on the initial rotation \u03b83. By varying \u03b83 and averaging over all resulting density matrices, we obtain a totally mixed state. (D) Experimental demonstration of a two-qubit gate and its consistency with blindness. Fixing measurements at a subset of all 64 possible states and averaging over all output density matrices results in a totally mixed state. The imaginary part of the density matrices (C and D) is below 0.05 and hence not shown. For details, see figs. S36 and S42. | \u03a6 L \u03b8 ^ \u232a = 1 2 [ | 0000 \u232a 1234 + e i \u03b8 3 | 0011 \u232a 1234 + e i \u03b8 2 | 1100 \u232a 1234 \u2212 e i ( \u03b8 2 + \u03b8 3 ) | 1111 \u232a (2) We use the polarization of photons to represent the qubits, with |0\u232a denoting the horizontal polarization state and |1\u232a denoting the vertical polarization state. The client prepares the value of \u03b8j, which is done in our case by a human client. By aligning our setup to produce | \u03a6 L ( 2 , n ) \u232a for n = 0, \u2026, 7 and | \u03a6 L ( 6 , m ) \u232a for m = 0, 4, we have demonstrated the preparation of various four-qubit blind cluster states. Moreover, we have implemented 1962 different four-qubit measurements, chosen from a list of measurement settings, with 31,392 measured outcomes. These measurements outcomes can be seen as implementing all possible computational branches (because of different measurement outcomes), which is equivalent to directly performing the feedforward mechanism (12). However, a feature of the BQC protocol is that the client\u2019s privacy is always preserved, whether or not feedforward mechanisms have been implemented. Similarly, obtaining all the possible measurement outcomes is equivalent to implementing all possible values of rj as if the client randomly re-interprets the measurement outcomes, implicitly subsuming rj. Note that, whenever all qubits are measured in our setup, this method allows the client\u2019s choice of configuration to also be hidden from the server. We use an overcomplete state tomography for each of our cluster states in order to reconstruct the four-qubit density matrix (SOM section S5). The most likely physical density matrix for each four-qubit state is extracted by using a maximum-likelihood reconstruction (43) (Fig. 3B). Uncertainties in quantities extracted from these density matrices are calculated by using a Monte Carlo routine and assumed Poissonian errors. Our computed fidelities for the various blind cluster states achieve maximum values of up to 0.679 \u00b1 0.004% via local unitary transformation. These nonideal fidelities arise because of experimental imperfections (SOM section S4). Experimental influences on the server\u2019s side only affect the correctness of the computation, whereas imperfections in the client\u2019s qubit preparation might also weaken the assumption of an unbiased state distribution. Blind single- and two-qubit unitaries. The four-qubit linear blind cluster | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u2192 (Fig. 2) can be used to implement an arbitrary single-qubit unitary gate. Measuring qubit 1 in the eigenstates of \u03c3x, \u03c3y, or \u03c3z has the effect of preparing the input on qubit 2 in the state |0\u232a, |+i\u232a, or |+\u232a, respectively, where | + i \u232a = 1 / 2 ( | 0 \u232a + i | 1 \u232a ) . We are thus left with a three-qubit linear cluster state that implements a single-qubit rotation gate with rotations determined by the measurements of the second and third qubits; this rotates the input qubit |\u03a8in\u232a to the final state |\u03a8out\u232a = Rx(\u2212\u03d53)Rz(\u2212\u03d52)|\u03a8in\u232a, where Rx(\u03b1) = exp(\u2212i\u03b1\u03c3x/2). By fixing \u03b82 and varying \u03b83, we can demonstrate a blind X rotation. In the same way, a blind Z rotation can be achieved by using the four-qubit linear blind cluster state | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u2190 , which has the order of measurements going from qubit 4 down to qubit 1. Figure 3C depicts a blind Z rotation. By varying \u03b83 and averaging over all resulting density matrices, we obtain a totally mixed state with a linear entropy of 0.989 \u00b1 0.010 that is close to the entropy of 1 for a perfectly mixed state (Fig. 3C). Because the experiments include the preparation of all eight blind cluster states | \u03a6 L ( 2 , n ) \u232a , we can quantify the blindness of the single-qubit rotations demonstrated experimentally. The value of the Holevo information \u03c7 (see SOM section S2 for details) must then be between 0 (for perfect blindness) and 3 (for no blindness). By using the tomographic measurements performed on these input states, we determine \u03c7 of such states to be 0.169 \u00b1 0.074, far below the three bits necessary to uniquely identify the client\u2019s choice of \u03d52 and \u03d53, proving that within the assumptions of our model these experimental implementations of the protocol maintains close to perfect blindness. The above value of \u03c7 assumes the initial state is chosen uniformly at random. However, even when this value is maximized over all possible prior distributions on the choice of states, it increases only slightly to 0.185 \u00b1 0.087. Two-qubit gates are required for universal quantum computation; by choosing the order of measurements in a suitable way, the blind cluster | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a implements blind two-qubit gates (Fig. 2, C to F). One family of two-qubit gates generated in our experiment has its basis in the blind horseshoe cluster | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u2282 , where measuring qubits 2 and 3 of the blind cluster state performs a transformation on the logical input qubits (Fig. 2C). Both implemented rotations are blind, and the entire computation remains hidden. Analyzing the output state, that is, measuring qubits 1 and 4, delivers the result of the computation. Figure 3D shows an example of a two-qubit computation using the blind horseshoe cluster. Consistency with blindness can be seen by averaging over all output states, giving as a result a totally mixed state with a linear entropy of 0.955 \u00b1 0.011. It is an interesting challenge to demonstrate the consistency with blindness in full generality by producing 64 blind cluster states. Our demonstration uses a selection of four states, which suffices to hide the choice of rotations among four possibilities: Rz(\u03c0/2 \u00b1 \u03c0) \u2297 Rz(\u03c0/2 \u00b1 \u03c0). In a similar way, the consistency with blindness of the rotated horseshoe cluster | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u2283 (Fig. 2D) can be shown (SOM section S10). We also realize blind computations based on the blind staircase cluster (Fig. 2E) and blind triangle cluster | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u0394 (Fig. 2F). The state | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u0394 is obtained via local complementation (44) on qubit 2 of | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u2282 . Thus U | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u0394 = | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u2282 , where U = \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 x \u2297 \u03c3 z \u2297 I (with U acting on qubits ordered as 1, 2, 3, and 4), and measuring the qubits of | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u2282 by absorbing the action of U into the measurements yields a computation on | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u0394 as represented by measurement instructions \u03b4\u2032 (Fig. 2F). However, blindness on qubit i is guaranteed only if the resulting measurement can be expressed as a basis | \u00b1 \u03b4 i \u2032 \u232a . We will show that the blind staircase cluster allows for the blind implementation of Deutsch\u2019s algorithm, whereas the blind triangle cluster allows for the blind implementation of Grover\u2019s algorithm. To demonstrate the quality of our gate operations, we performed various single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates with each of the blind cluster states; the resulting density matrices, obtained via quantum state tomography, are shown in SOM sections S6 and S7. Blind algorithms. One of the most prominent examples where quantum mechanics demonstrates its superiority in computational speedup is Grover\u2019s search algorithm (3, 45), which provides a quadratic speedup to the following problem: Given a function f: {0,1}n \u2192 {0,1}, find an x such that f(x) = 1. We demonstrate a blind implementation of Grover\u2019s search for n = 2, where blindness ensures that the server is unable to distinguish the actual computation from within a given family of circuits implementing [I \u2297 Rz(\u03be)H]. Whereas previous realizations (10, 12) are not amenable to blind implementations, our computation, embedded into the blind triangle cluster | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u0394 (Fig. 2F), remains blind. The algorithm proceeds as follows: The values of x are represented by the states |00\u232a, |01\u232a, |10\u232a, and |11\u232a, respectively. A superposition of all four states is initially created, and the oracle tags one element by applying a phase of \u03c0, thus flipping the sign of this term (Fig. 4A). Then each of the four states is mapped to an output such that measuring both qubits in the basis |\u00b1i\u232a reveals the tagged item. This computation can be embedded into the blind triangle cluster, | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u0394 (Fig. 2F); the choice of \u03d52 and \u03d53 determines which element is tagged. Figure 4C shows the results of a Grover search for the tagging of the state |01\u232a. For each blind cluster state, we show the probability of identifying the tagged state as well as the probabilities of finding the unwanted states, because of the experimental noise. We achieve probabilities of finding these positive events of up to 0.850 \u00b1 0.039 with an average over all blind states of 0.720 \u00b1 0.015. No classical algorithm can succeed in this scenario with probability higher than 0.5. Fig. 4 Blind implementation of Grover\u2019s algorithm. (A) Quantum circuit. The input to the circuit is |+\u232a|+\u232a; the tagging of one of the four input states |00\u232a, |01\u232a, |10\u232a, or |11\u232a applies a phase shift of \u03c0 to that state. These four states are then mapped to an output that is measured in the basis (|+i\u232a, |\u2212i\u232a). (B) Corresponding implementation on a triangle cluster | \u03a6 \u03b8 ^ \u232a \u0394 . Here, the measurement of qubits 2 and 3 corresponds to the tagging of one of the elements, measuring the output qubits 1 and 4 identifies then which input was tagged. Without the knowledge of the initial rotation of the qubit, the quantum server is unable to distinguish the algorithm from a given family of circuits. (C) Measurement outcomes for tagging the |01\u232a element for all states | \u03a6 ( n 2 , n 3 ) \u232a \u0394 are shown. The corresponding error bars are smaller than 0.056 for all results. Another algorithm that demonstrates the power of quantum computing is the Deutsch-Josza algorithm (2) that takes as input an oracle (or black box) for computing an unknown function f: {0,1}n \u2192 {0,1} with the promise that f is either constant, meaning f(x) is the same for all x, or balanced, meaning f(x) = 0 for exactly half of the inputs x and f(x) = 1 for the other half. The algorithm determines whether f is constant or balanced by making queries to the oracle. Whereas the best possible classical algorithm to solve this problem uses at least 2n\u22121 + 1 queries in the worst case, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm takes advantage of quantum superposition and interference to determine whether f is constant or balanced with only one query. In contrast to previously realized implementations of Deutsch\u2019s algorithm using traditional cluster states (16, 46), we exploit blind staircase cluster states for the implementation of this quantum algorithm for the case n = 1. Figure 5A shows the quantum circuits that realize oracles corresponding to constant and balanced functions. The corresponding implementation on is given in Fig. 5B, where the choice of oracle is done by fixing the measurement on qubits 2 and 3. Blindness of qubit 3 guarantees that the quantum server will not recognize the implementation of a constant oracle from the Grover algorithm or general circuits implementing Rz(\u03be)H \u2297 I and a balanced oracle from (I \u2297 H) CPhase[Rz(\u03be)H \u2297 H] (Fig. 5). Figure 5, C and D, shows the outcome of our measurement for the case of . A tomography of the state of qubit 4 is performed in order to fully characterize the output of the computation. In this case, the obtained fidelity for the output state is F = 0.930 \u00b1 0.025 for the constant oracle and F = 0.887 \u00b1 0.033 for the balanced oracle, with the algorithm producing the correct result with probabilities 0.899 \u00b1 0.006 for the constant and 0.895 \u00b1 0.022 for the balanced oracle. Fig. 5 Blind implementation of Deutsch\u2019s algorithm. (A and B) The quantum circuits and the corresponding measurements on a staircase cluster state for the constant and the balanced oracle, distinguished by the measurement of qubit 2 and qubit 3. Blindness of qubit 3 guarantees that the quantum server cannot distinguish between the execution of each of these scenarios (constant or balanced oracles) and corresponding families of quantum circuits. ( and ) Experimental (solid) and theoretical (wireframe) results for a constant (C) and a balanced (D) oracle for the example of the state . Expand for more Toward verifying the quantumness. Self-testing is a verification process for the operations of a collection of untrusted quantum devices (47, 48); a key application of the blind computing protocol is also toward such verification of quantum devices (29, 30). We demonstrate a notion of verification that can be used as a heuristic probabilistic test for whether the server indeed possesses any quantum technology or is a completely classical device. For this, the client chooses a measurement setting for which, for each measurement outcome, there exists a state with a detection probability of zero. Because of blindness, however, the quantum server has no information about which initial states the client has prepared. If it has no quantum technology in hand, it attempts to use its classical devices and guesses the outcome for the client\u2019s computation wrong with probability at least 1/8. Better bounds can be achieved by using statistics of several rounds and comparing it with the known theoretical statistics to test whether the quantum-computing server is producing the expected outcome or not. The testing procedure uses statistics of several outcomes for different measurement instructions. Figure 6 shows relevant theoretical predictions as well as experimental outcomes that confirm the quantum nature of the server. By instructing the quantum server to measure, for example, this statistical distribution, the client can see whether the outcomes coincide with the expectations. Our demonstration is a first step toward an efficient verification scheme for quantum technology and acts as an experimental benchmark for future fault-tolerant protocols using more qubits that are expected to enable the detection of a cheating quantum server with probability exponentially close to one. Fig. 6 Testing of the quantum server. By measuring the probability distributions of a fixed measurement setting for all blind cluster states and comparing them with the theoretical expectations, the client can find out whether the server possesses any quantum technology. For example, fixing the measurement settings to \u03b41 = \u2212\u03c3z, \u03b42 = \u03c0, \u03b43 = \u2212\u03c0/2, and \u03b44 = \u03c0/2 leads to different theoretical (blue) and experimental (green) probability distributions dependent on the underlying blind cluster state. A pure classical server guesses every outcome with the same probability (1/16) and can be detected in this way (red line). Conservatively, we show Poissonian errors, which constitute a lower limit for the experimental error because of imperfections in the state generation (SOM section S4). Discussion. The blind quantum computation protocol demonstrated here is most naturally viewed in the context of measurement-based quantum computation. The required operations, however, can be implemented in any model of computation that is universal for quantum computation on unencoded data and allows intermediate measurements. Finding extensions to other models, such as the adiabatic model, remains an open question. From our proof-of-principle experiment to a full implementation of the BQC scheme, there are several technical challenges to be faced: Emitted photons that do not contribute to the generation of the cluster state can in principle reveal information about the blind phases. Furthermore, postselection and photon losses decrease the efficiency of the protocol. Therefore, the realization of single-qubit states on demand and the heralded generation of blind cluster states using measurement-induced interactions with high fidelity and low losses will be crucial for future applications. In our experiment, the blind angles were chosen by the human client, and the measurement settings were selected from a prepared list. Ideally, the source of randomness should be carefully scrutinized to avoid any correlations with the server, and an efficient shot-by-shot randomization should be implemented. Considering the photon rates in our experiment, the realization of full randomization for each measurement is a major challenge. The question of how far imbalances and deviations from the uniform distribution can be acceptable is a topic of current research. Our experiment is a step toward unconditionally secure quantum computing in a client-server environment where the client\u2019s entire computation remains hidden, a functionality not known to be achievable in the classical world. This should present an important privacy-preserving technique in future quantum computing networks or clouds (49). Especially considering the tremendous challenges encountered in making quantum computers widely available, such future networks could consist of a few powerful quantum-computer nodes. The only quantum requirement for the clients would be to communicate with the nodes via quantum links enabling the transfer of arbitrary qubits. Although photonic quantum systems seem to be ideally suited for privacy-preserving quantum computing, we stress that our results are applicable to any physical implementation of qubits and that in the near future the precise quantum control of multiqubit quantum systems (50) will allow for implementing more complex algorithms.

An introduction to the requirements for a paramagnetic molecule to act as a 2-qubit quantum gate is provided in this tutorial review. We propose synthetic methods aimed at accessing such type of functional molecules, based on ligand design and inorganic synthesis. Two strategies are presented: (i) the first consists in targeting molecules containing a pair of well-defined and weakly coupled paramagnetic metal aggregates, each acting as a carrier of one potential qubit, (ii) the second is the design of dinuclear complexes of anisotropic metal ions, exhibiting dissimilar environments and feeble magnetic coupling. The first systems obtained from this synthetic program are presented here and their properties are discussed.

Its material realization is a classical physical system with two well defined states. In contrast, the QC counterpart is a quantum system termed qubit with quantum microstates that can be either |1\u3009 or |0\u3009, but also any arbitrary superposition of these two (namely, |\u03c6\u3009 = \u03b1|0\u3009 + \u03b2|1\u3009, see Fig. 1, left). The \u201cquantum parallelism\u201d, associated with the use of such superpositions, is expected to enormously increase the potential of information processing2\u20134 if it becomes possible to reliably extract and manipulate this information from a quantum system. Fig. 1 Left, schematic representation of a qubit: the points on the Bloch sphere represent the permitted states of the qubit two-dimensional space \u03b1|0\u3009 + \u03b2|1\u3009, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are complex numbers with |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1. Right, representation of CNOT and \u221aSWAP operations; only the |1,1\u3009 \u2192 |1,0\u3009 (for the CNOT) and |1,0\u3009 \u2192 (|1,0\u3009 + i|0,1\u3009)/(1 + i) (for the \u221aSWAP) transformations are shown. QC operations are performed by logic quantum gates (QGs). The simplest of these are single qubit unitary rotations which, starting from a basis state, say |1\u3009 or |0\u3009, produce a superposition \u03b1|0\u3009 + \u03b2|1\u3009. Any algorithm can, in principle, be realized as a sequence of such unitary rotations and universal quantum gates, operating on two coupled qubits.1 Archetypes of such universal QGs are the controlled-NOT (CNOT) and the \u221aSWAP (Fig. 1, right) gates. The CNOT gate inverts the state of one qubit (target qubit) if and only if the other (control qubit) is in the |1\u3009 state. The \u221aSWAP turns a two-qubit state |a,b\u3009 (with a and b being 0 or 1, and different) into a superposition (|a,b\u3009 + i|b,a\u3009)/(1 + i).5,6 Both the CNOT and the \u221aSWAP gates return a 2-qubit output that might correspond to an entangled state, i.e. a state that cannot be expressed as a product of states of each of the two quantum systems embodying the QG. In the case of the CNOT gate, entanglement occurs when the input control qubit lies in a superposition of two states. Entanglement is a natural occurrence of quantum systems that are correlated by some weak interaction.7 In order to achieve the implementation of some QC algorithms, it is necessary that the possibility exists of generating entanglement between the states of two connected qubits. Currently, the potential of QC for the realization of algorithms to solve efficiently extremely complex problems has been well established at the theoretical level.1\u20134 However, the physical implementation of quantum information processing (QIP) is an extremely challenging task and remains far from being a reality. One could argue that QC may be the inevitable consequence of the miniaturization of electronic devices: with components' size reaching the nanoscale, quantum mechanics laws are expected to take over, and thus provide the ingredients for the realization of QIP.1,8\u201310 A number of potential candidates have been proposed and investigated as the physical systems to constitute the hardware of QC.8 The range of proposed systems spans a wide spectrum of modern materials physics and includes ion traps,11photons,12 nuclear spins,13 superconducting circuits14 or spin-based systems such as electrons confined to quantum dots in semiconductors.10,15 Among the most attractive candidates to become the qubits of future quantum computers are electronic spins. As isolated species, they constitute true two-level systems, while any radical or open-shell metal-containing molecule may be appropriate carriers of such qubits.16,17 The realization of algorithms requires the organization of qubits into QGs capable of undergoing logic operations with these qubits. Quantum computation could be carried out if an appropriate and addressable set of quantum gates are disposed in a scalable manner.18 Coordination magnetic molecules could serve for the construction of 2-qubit QGs, offering important advantages over other proposed systems; all molecules are identical, their structure may be easily tuned through chemical methods and their behaviour is governed purely by quantum mechanics.19,20 It is not strictly necessary that the qubits of such QGs consist of monoelectronic S = 1/2 systems. The two state levels may be embodied by any spin system that in a certain regime exhibits two states (effective S = 1/2) such as the isolated ground state of a collection of antiferromagnetically exchanged coupled spin moments Si,21,22 or the two level system of the ground state of highly anisotropic lanthanides.23 Coordination chemistry provides means of assembling within a molecule two such paramagnetic ions or groups of strongly-coupled open-shell metals, while interconnecting them through convenient and potentially switchable interactions. The use of specifically designed or selected multidentate ligands is at the core of this rational synthetic approach to QC. This tutorial review aims at defining the requirements of such coordination assemblies for their use in QC, briefly reviews the few existing proposals, and develops in more detail our initial approaches to the preparation of such smart materials. 2 Requirements for spin-based molecular quantum gates The basic conditions that any physical system needs to fulfil in order to act as a QG were clearly defined by Di Vincenzo a decade ago in the form of five criteria (plus two more to implement quantum communication).9 These remain valid for potential spin-based QGs, as discussed in more detail elsewhere.10,17 Here, we shall discuss them in relation to the endeavour of designing the synthesis of coordination molecules as candidates for 2-qubit QGs. Along this idea, these requirements can be summarized and expressed as follows: (i) Properly defined and scalable qubits In molecular spin-systems, this means that each spin qubit is sufficiently isolated within the molecule to exhibit a proper two-level qubit basis |1\u3009 and |0\u3009 (which will be denoted as |\u21d1\u3009 and |\u21d3\u3009 from now on), well separated from any possible excited states. This is the case of a true spin 1/2 moiety such as a Cu(ii) ion isolated within a complex molecule, but also in principle for any metallic aggregate having, under certain conditions, a well-isolated ground-state doublet. This may also be the case for lanthanide ions within a strong crystal field or metal cluster complexes of particular characteristics (see below).21\u201323 Scalability is a key factor to build realistic quantum computers. It implies the possibility of engaging many identical qubits, while still adhering to all requirements presented here. This is also important for quantum error correction, for which some mechanisms have been proposed that require additional qubits.9 Chemical methods are particularly attractive in this respect since macroscopic arrays of identical molecules are naturally accessible. The actual disposition of truly identical molecules within a device (typically on its surface) is nevertheless not as straightforward. The misalignment or molecular isomerism induced through the interaction with the surface may easily result in codification information errors. In this respect, the use of robust complexes containing one or several qubits as defined above, externally functionalized for grafting them to a surface while keeping the chemical structure, appears as a good avenue. It has also been proposed that Single-Molecule Magnets (SMMs) could serve to implement quantum computation, through the multiple MS states accessible within their high-spin ground state.24 Nevertheless, relying on single multilevel systems impedes true scalability.10 Therefore such proposals do not seem appropriate under this criterion. (ii) Easy and efficient initialization One should be able to set each qubit in a well-defined initial state at any time and in an efficient manner. For a molecular spin, this can simply be done by taking it into its grounds state, e.g. by cooling it under a magnetic field. Quantum error correction, which is inherent to real world quantum operations, requires the supply of additional \u201cfresh\u201d qubits.8,9 (iii) Long decoherence times The decoherence time (\u03c4d) characterizes the quantum dynamics of a qubit in contact with its environment.25 It is the time during which the quantum information stored in a qubit is maintained before it is lost because of the interaction with the surroundings. For QC operations it is of course fundamental that the quantum nature of the qubits is tenable. Originally, this was thought to be a major obstacle for electronic spins to be considered as potential qubits. It is generally accepted that the decoherence times should be at least 104 times larger than the time required for the basic computation action, the so-called gate time (\u03c4gate, see below). This is a stringent condition, especially considering that the value already takes into account the implementation of quantum error corrections, which allows a reduction of the decoherence time.9,26 Limiting decoherence must therefore be one of the main factors to take into account in the chemical design of QGs. Pulsed EPR has been the primary tool for investigating and characterizing the coherent spin dynamics of molecular spin systems.22,27\u201330 For spin-based qubits, decoherence can mainly arise through interaction with phonons and nuclear spins, as well as dipolar interactions with neighbouring qubits. In this respect, the necessary coupling between qubits during computation may be in itself a source of decoherence. Dipolar interactions can in principle be reduced by using low-spin systems and controlling the disposition (topology/distance) of the qubits. Studies on diluted solutions of [Cr7Ni] (see below)29 qubits showed for the first time the feasibility of performing coherent manipulations of their S = 1/2 molecular spins. These experiments also revealed that the hyperfine coupling between the electronic and the nuclear spins is the main source of decoherence (with estimated \u03c4d of a few \u03bcs). More recently, the quantum Rabi oscillations observed on frozen solutions of [V15] clusters (a polyoxometallate anion with a formula [V15As6O42(H2O)]6\u2212) separated by cationic surfactant molecules were studied and their frequency measured.22 Here also, the decoherence, characterized by relaxation times \u03c4d of the order of 800 ns, was mainly attributed to the hyperfine coupling with the 51V nuclear spins. In this respect, metals exhibiting a nuclear spin could be problematic if these cannot be enriched with a zero-spin isotope. Nitrogen donor ligands may also pose difficulties, since these locate spin active nuclei (14N; I = 1) very close to the electronic spins. The amount of hydrogen nuclei should also be limited as much as possible, although their location further away from the unpaired electrons may cause little decoherence.22,29 (iv) Implementing universal quantum gates Molecules containing two well defined qubits fulfilling the above conditions and the properties described in what follows might provide attractive prototypes for the universal CNOT and \u221aSWAP quantum gates. For the realization of a CNOT, both qubits must exhibit a mutual interaction much smaller than the energy difference between both states within each qubit in the presence of an external magnetic field, which may be achieved with strong axially anisotropic spins. In addition, the control and target qubits must be different so they can be addressed specifically. Therefore, the structure of the molecule should impose this dissymmetry between both qubits. The \u221aSWAP gate on the other hand requires that the spins of both qubits exhibit a weak antiferromagnetic Heisenberg-type coupling that one must be able to modify at will during a desired period of time (gate time), in order to let the system evolve quantum mechanically so as to undergo the transformation dictated by this operation.31 In order to carry out these two operations it is necessary that the qubits of the QG have the possibility to exhibit entangled states. Aspects of entanglement in spin-based systems have been discussed in detail recently, showing in particular that the magnetic susceptibility may be used as a so-called entanglement witness.17,32 (v) Readout of qubits The state of the target qubits within the quantum gates, i.e. the output, has to be determined once the computation is finished. This implies that any qubit, including those within QGs, has to be addressed selectively, either spatially, spectrally, magnetically or by any other means. It is clear from above that implementing QC using coordination chemistry is a very difficult prospect, and a huge synthetic challenge. Work in this direction seems limited to only few groups devoted to chemical synthesis and it has only started to surface. The following sections summarize some of the most important reported examples of molecular systems portrayed as prototypes of spin-based QGs that have arisen from coordination chemistry, as well as some of the work carried out in our laboratory in order to face this challenge. 3 Current coordination chemistry proposals of 2-qubits Despite the many advantages that electronic spins of discrete molecules may offer as the possible hardware in QIP, very few coordination systems have been proposed for this purpose. A reason for this is presumably that the awareness of this potential is only beginning to grow among coordination chemists and therefore the full reach of their synthetic skills has not yet been put to its service. In addition, the conditions that molecules must fulfill to realize universal quantum gates, i.e. the magnetic asymmetry in the case of CNOT gates and the switchability of magnetic interactions needed for \u221aSWAP operations, are difficult to achieve. We review in this section the few systems that have been explicitly portrayed as models of 2-qubit QGs and also a few examples in the literature that exhibit interesting properties in this respect, even if they have not been studied in such context. Currently, one of the most versatile approaches to QIP using molecular chemistry is linking heterometallic rings of transition metals to either covalent or supramolecular assemblies of two such units. The original family of these rings is very extensive and they exhibit the general formula (NH2R2)[Cr7MF8(O2CR\u2032)8] (MII = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cd; R, R\u2032 = various).33 Among these, the Ni derivative is suitable as a possible qubit, since it exhibits a spin ground state S = 1/2, well separated energetically from excited states. One feature of these molecular rings that is attractive for QC is that they exhibit relatively long spin decoherence times. This has been determined by measuring through pulsed EPRspectroscopy the dephasing time, T2, which at 4 K amounts to 0.4 \u03bcs, enabling the realization of coherent quantum operations within a molecule.29 Controlling the magnetic interaction between two connected rings is also essential for their role as 2-qubit QGs. The linking of the rings has been achieved in three different ways:35 (i) exploiting a combination of coulombic and H-bonding interactions between the (anionic) rings and diammonium long linkers, (ii) selectively replacing a carboxylate from the ring by another one acting as the linker, and (iii) using ring derivatives that contain one labile coordination site through which two of them can be linked. The first strategy has produced systems with and without the presence of additional paramagnetic elements (CuII) in between the rings, depending on the nature of the linker.36 It has usually led to spectacular architectures exhibiting however negligible magnetic coupling between their various parts. The second method allows the inclusion of carboxylates that can coordinate to a free Cu(ii) ion, the latter acting as a \u201cglue\u201d between two rings, also mediating the magnetic interaction between them (Fig. 2). This interaction is shut off if instead of a single ion the bridging element is a pair of strongly antiferromagnetic Cu(ii) ions.34 The last approach is attractive because it allows the use of a large variety of bidentate bridging ligands to connect two wheels, providing a way of finely tuning the magnetic exchange between both parts of the assembly.37 Fig. 2 Representation of the anion of a \u201cdouble-ring\u201d assembly involving a paramagnetic bridge (CuII), with a formula ([NH2Pr2][Cr7NiF8(O2CCMe3)15(O2CC5H4N)])2[Cu(NO3)2(OH2)].34 Dark green, Ni; pink, Cr; turquoise, Cu; yellow, F; red, O; purple, N; rest, C. H atoms excluded. The demonstration that pairs of single molecule magnets (SMMs) exhibit quantum superpositions of their spin wave functions is of great significance in this context, since such entanglement is the necessary ingredient for the realization of QC operations by multi-qubit QGs. SMMs are high spin clusters that exhibit slow relaxation of their molecular magnetic moment.38 Therefore, each of these molecules behaves as a tiny magnet. The superposition of the spin ground states of a pair of SMMs with a formula [Mn4O3Cl4(O2CEt)3(py)3], held together in the crystal lattice by means of supramolecular interactions, was shown through high field EPR.39 The literature contains other discrete coordination clusters that could be very interesting in this context. One relevant example is a family of helicate clusters with formulae [(CuLn)2L2(NO3)6(H2O)2] (LnIII = Gd, Y, Tb; H2L = a bis-iminophenol flexible ligand), featuring in the same molecule two weakly coupled heterometallic dinuclear entities (Fig. 3).40 The CuTb derivative is particularly important since it exhibits slow relaxation of the magnetization, which can only be attributed to the properties of each of the two dinuclear entities of the molecule. This unusual fact was not emphasized when these compounds were reported. Only the observation of intramolecular based exchange bias of the magnetization (perhaps for the first time!) is briefly mentioned. Fig. 3 Representation of [(CuLn)2L2(NO3)6(H2O)2] (LnIII = Gd, Y, Tb). Colors as in Fig. 2, plus orange, Ln. H atoms excluded.40 Another relevant molecular system, which constitutes the theoretical basis for an interesting proposal to realize \u221aSWAP quantum gate operations, is a polyoxometalate with a formula [PMo12O40(VO)2]q\u2212.41 This compound consists of a mixed valence Keggin cage of Mo(V/VI), capped at both ends by two (VO)+ units, each with a spin moment of S = 1/2. The core of the cage acts as a reservoir of a variable number of electrons delocalized over the Mo ions. If the number of the core electrons is even, the resulting central spin is zero and the (VO)+ units are then weakly coupled antiferromagnetically. If instead, the core hosts an odd number of electrons, its spin is S = 1/2, the ensemble thus featuring a total of three coupled S = 1/2 spins. A very appealing aspect of this system is that it could be addressed by electrical means so that electrons may be injected or extracted at will, which would allow to control the interaction between the S = 1/2 moments of the (VO)+ groups by switching on and off the presence of the central spin. This would allow the realization of a \u221aSWAP operation if the central spin is maintained during a given amount of time (gate time, \u03c4gate), which must fulfil a certain relation with the intramolecular magnetic exchange constants.6 An interesting development in the realization of spin-based qubits for QC is the demonstration that different transition metal centers in molecular helicates may also show different gyromagnetic factors, that is, a different Zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field. This property might enable addressing them specifically by use of pulsed Q-band EPR. This was chemically engineered in a dinuclear triple stranded helicate of Mn(ii), using a four-membered oligo-imidazoleligand.42 In fact, there are many metallic helicates of this kind in the literature. This work underscores the benefits of a good dialog between chemists, physicists and engineers for the advance of applied nanosciences. In the following sections we review the results obtained from the design and use of a series of \u03b2-diketone based ligands for the preparation of coordination molecular assemblies as potential prototypes for 2-qubit QGs. 4 Design of multidentate ligands to access 2-qubits Our synthetic approach towards the preparation of potential qubit systems involves the engagement of the \u03b2-diketone coordinating unit. This O-donor chelating ligand has proven its value in the creation of remarkable metallocluster assemblies.43 The synthesis of \u03b2-diketonic molecules is usually straightforward. Multidentate ligands can easily be obtained through a simple Claisen condensation, sketched in Fig. 4.43 Fig. 4 Synthetic pathway for the preparation of poly \u03b2-diketonic ligands through Claisen condensation.43 The first category of targeted qubits, i.e. molecular pairs of well-defined, weakly coupled metal clusters, is achieved using poly \u03b2-diketone ligands exhibiting two groups of \u201ccoordination pockets\u201d (Fig. 4). These pockets serve to aggregate metals in close proximity (as in molecules of \u201cclass A\u201d; defined below) or simply to clamp pre-formed clusters and link them to each other (\u201cclass B\u201d molecules; see below). These ligands are obtained by condensation of two ketone molecules with a diester (usually ethyl esters), in the presence of a base (for instance, sodium hydride). Hence, a large variety of multidentate ligands can be prepared through a simple and highly versatile synthetic route. If additional donor groups are featured on the position \u201cX\u201d, the ligands may then act as a \u201ctemplate\u201d for the aggregation of metals into linear clusters which can then be linked as molecular pairs by auxiliary ligands (\u201cclass C\u201d molecules, see below). Thus, ligands such as H4L1, H4L2 and H2L3 (see Fig. 4) have in this manner been designed in our group, and some of their coordination compounds are described in the following section (Molecules featuring two weakly coupled clusters). Eventually, such ligands might be modified so as to engineer a structural dissymmetry within the cluster. The second category of qubits that we aim to synthesize, namely the dinuclear complexes of anisotropic metal ions, is achievable with \u03b2-diketonic ligands such as H3L4, which is depicted in Fig. 5. H3L4 is an asymmetric \u03b2-diketone exhibiting additional functional groups, namely a phenol unit and a pyridine-2-carboxylic acid moiety. Hence, the coordination of two highly anisotropic metal ions, as could be the lanthanides (Ln), may generate dinuclear complexes whose metal centres could display distinct environments; therefore, two inequivalent qubits may be integrated within the same molecule. If the interaction between these is weak, they might constitute a model for a CNOT QG (see section Complexes of two dissimilar and weakly coupled lanthanides). Fig. 5 Schematic representation of the ligand H3L4, aimed at coordinating two lanthanide ions (Ln). 5 Molecules featuring two weakly coupled clusters The first proposals for using molecular nanomagnets (or SMMs) to implement the qubits for QC24 naturally give place to the idea that molecules featuring two well-defined coordination clusters could represent ideal systems for realizing 2-qubit QGs, if these clusters exhibit the appropriate spin properties. In this section, we describe the progress made towards the synthesis of such molecular architectures using bis-\u03b2-diketone ligands. In exploring this chemistry, we identified a series of molecular assemblies responding to this definition, which could be divided into three classes depending on the structural role played by the multidonor \u03b2-diketone, L, within them. These assemblies are schematically represented in Fig. 6 and are defined next. In \u201cclass A\u201d molecules, L is responsible for having metals grouped into two clusters and also keeping both aggregates together within the molecule. In molecules of \u201cclass B\u201d, the metal clusters are held together by other ligands while L links them pairwise within molecules. Finally, in the case of molecules of \u201cclass C\u201d, L gathers metals as clusters that are then linked as pairs by external ligands. Examples of each class are described below, together with discussions with regard to their potential as 2-qubit QGs. Fig. 6 Schematic representation of classes A, B and C molecular cluster pairs as defined in the text. Black and red lines represent multidonor \u03b2-diketone (L) and additional auxiliary ligands, respectively. 5.1 Class A cluster pairs Ligand H4L1 is ideal for the construction of this type of clusters, given the alignment of its coordination pockets as two separate groups. Reactions of H4L1 with divalent transition metals in coordinating solvents using strong basic conditions produce assemblies that can be described as two dimetallic entities well separated within one molecule. In Fig. 7 are represented the CuII and NiII analogues, [Cu4(L1)2(py)4] and [Ni4(L1)2(py)6], made in pyridine. The corresponding complex with CoII has also been prepared.44 Fig. 7 Representation of [Cu4(L1)2(py)4] and [Ni4(L1)2(py)6]. Colors as in Fig. 2. H atoms excluded. In all these compounds, the deprotonated species L14\u2212 organizes the metals as molecular linear arrays by saturating all their equatorial coordination sites, while solvent molecules occupy some axial sites. It is interesting to note that, while all the CuII ions exhibit their preferred square-pyramidal pentacoordinated geometry, in [Ni4(L1)2(py)6], the inside NiII ions are six-coordinate (as usual) whereas the external metals are five-coordinate (much more uncommon). The latter situation is also observed in the CoII derivative. This is related to structural constrains to achieve six coordination as imposed by the whole architecture and it could be exploited to prepare heterometallic assemblies with selective disposition of different metals within the molecule (see below). These systems appear topologically appropriate as 2-qubit assemblies. However, bulk magnetic measurements indicate that the metals within each dinuclear fragment always couple antiferromagnetically, therefore, the ground state spin of each fragment vanishes. A possible way to have suitable qubits on each side of the molecule is by locating metals with different spin numbers within each of the pairs. The preferences in coordination geometry observed for the various positions of the tetranuclear assemblies (see above) suggest the possibility of achieving this by making heterometallic complexes. This could be done by mixing in the reaction a metal with preference for five coordination (CuII; S = 1/2) together with a metal prone to adopt the octahedral geometry (NiII; S = 1). In Fig. 8 is the structure of the heterometallic cluster [Cu2Ni2(L1)2(py)6], obtained in this manner.44 Good evidence of the topology as revealed from X-ray single crystal diffraction came from metal analysis, which confirmed the 1\u2006\u2236\u20061 ratio of both metals in the bulk of the sample. Additionally, the molecular structure of the compound, which is considered representative of the bulk (since the sample is homogeneous), was calculated by DFT methods to have much higher energy for any distribution of two NiII and two CuII ions other than the CuNi\u22efNiCu sequence suggested by the refinement of the crystallographic data (Fig. 8, left). Fig. 8 Representation of [Cu2Ni2(L1)2(py)6] (left). Colors as in Fig. 6 (H atoms excluded) and its \u03c7MT vs. T curve (right). The red line is a fit of the experimental data (see the text). Confirmation that each NiII ion in this compound is coupled antiferromagnetically to a CuII comes from bulk magnetization data (Fig. 8, right), the fit of which gave JNi\u2013Cu = \u221272.9 cm\u22121 (in the H = \u22122JS1S2 convention). Both [CuNi] pairs of the cluster exhibit S = 1/2 ground states, that are weakly coupled, as necessary for a 2-qubit QG. From its physical behavior, this molecule may be considered equivalent to many of the ring pairs discussed previously. The potential of entanglement of the spin wave functions of both qubits needs to be studied in detail. Also, the synthesis may be refined in order to ensure that both sides of the molecule are non-equivalent. 5.2 Class B cluster pairs The strategy for preparing this type of architecture is to create conditions for the formation of transition metal clusters in the presence of a ligand L, suitable to link them as separate entities within one molecule. It is known from the literature that MnIII trinuclear aggregates of the type [Mn3O(O2CR)6(S)3]X (R = various; S = solventligands; X\u2212 = various anions, Fig. 9, left) rearrange in the presence of some \u03b2-diketones forming tetranuclear aggregates, usually called \u201cbutterfly\u201d, featuring the chelate as terminal ligands at both ends (Fig. 9, right).45 The use of a bis-\u03b2-diketone could lead to molecular pairs of such aggregates. H4L2 seems appropriate for this purpose since it displays two 1,3-dicarbonyl units separated by a methoxyphenylene moiety, which prevents the formation of class Aassemblies, simply for steric reasons. Fig. 9 Representation of the cation [Mn3O(AcO)6(py)3]+ and [Mn4O2(AcO)6(dbm)2(py)2], obtained from the reaction of the former with dibenzoylmethane (Hdbm).45 Colors as in Fig. 2, plus dark brown, Mn. H atoms excluded. Indeed, the reaction of H4L2 with [Mn3O(O2CR)6(py)3](ClO4) (R = Me, Ph, pMePh; py = pyridine) leads to the corresponding assemblies [Mn8O4(O2CR)12(H2L2)2(pz)2] if the additional bridge pyrazine (pz) is present.46 These remarkable clusters feature two well-defined \u201cbutterfly\u201d moieties, weakly connected within a stable molecule (Fig. 10). The robustness of these assemblies is confirmed by 1H NMR, which shows unambiguously that their structure is maintained in solution of chloroform. Fig. 10 Representation of the molecular cluster pair [Mn8O4(AcO)12(H2L2)2(pz)2]. Colors as in Fig. 9. H atoms excluded. Variable temperature bulk magnetization measurements under a constant magnetic field show that a combination of ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions within the tetranuclear moieties leads to a lowest energy spin state of S = 2 for each [Mn4] fragment. If these two half-molecules were isolated, their spin state immediately above would be \u223c10 cm\u22121 higher in energy. Instead, both sides exhibit a weak antiferromagnetic interaction of nearly \u22121 cm\u22121. For this molecule to constitute a 2-qubit QG, both tetranuclear moieties should exhibit effective S = 1/2 spin moments at the ground state. This could be the case at very low temperature if the spin ground state of these fragments were of the Ising type. Ultra-low temperature measurements should help to elucidate this question. This reactivity is not exclusive to manganese; the reaction of the FeIII cluster [Fe3O(OBz)6(py)3](NO3) (HOBz = benzoic acid) with H4L2 and pyrazine produces the analogous cluster pair [Fe8O4(BzO)12(H2L2)2(pz)2]. In this case, the same procedure in the absence of pyrazine allows the preparation of another cluster of the same category, [Fe6O2(BzO)10(H2L)2(py)2], consisting of a pair of triangles linked within the same molecule by H2L22\u2212 units.47 The magnetic properties of the latter reveal that the assembly is composed of two S = 5/2 moieties (resulting from antiferromagnetic interactions within each approximately isosceles triangle). Each of these units may act as a qubit if the transitions between the MS = +1/2 and MS = \u22121/2 of the S = 5/2 sextets are addressed selectively.42 The magnetic study also shows that the triangles exhibit weak antiferromagnetic coupling. Assemblies of this kind could constitute \u221aSWAP QGs if the bridging bis-\u03b2-diketone is modified at the central position to incorporate an electroactive or photoactive component that could serve to turn on and off the interaction between both qubits during the appropriate gate times (\u03c4gate). There are some other compounds in the literature that respond to this definition of molecular cluster pairs that would be worth studying under this perspective.48,49 5.3 Class C cluster pairs Systems under this category consist of closely spaced metals grouped by ligands designed to do so, which are then linked to molecular pairs by other external ligands. A way of doing this using bis-\u03b2-diketones is well represented by the chemistry of ligand H2L3 with CoII. It was first demonstrated that this multidonor has the ability to stabilize linear metal chains such as the cluster [Co4(L3)2(MeOH)8](NO3)4 (Fig. 11).50 This complex features four aligned CoII ions sandwiched by two L32\u2212 donors that occupy all their equatorial sites, forming a very flat platform. Each metal also has its two axial coordination sites occupied by molecules of methanol, leading to distorted octahedral (outer ions) and pentagonal bipyramidal (central metals) coordination geometries. These axial positions are highly labile, as demonstrated by the fact that they can be replaced completely by water molecules from atmospheric moisture. This suggests the possibility of using these coordination sites as a way of linking the [Co4] clusters to each other. Indeed, the use of a difunctional ligand such as 4,4\u2032-bipyridine (bpy) in the above reaction allows the formation of the cluster pair [Co8(L3)4(OH)2(H2O)4(NO3)2(bpy)4](NO3)4 (Fig. 11).51 Fig. 11 Representation of the cation of [Co4(L3)2(MeOH)8](NO3)4 and the reaction leading to it (top) and the molecular structure of the cation of [Co8(L3)4(OH)2(H2O)4(NO3)2(bpy)4](NO3)4 (bottom). Colors as in Fig. 2, plus blue, Co. H atoms excluded. The main drawback of this assembly as a possible 2-qubit QG is the fact that each cluster within the molecule has an S = 0 ground state as a result of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the metals. One way of solving this problem would be to variate the oxidation state of some metals of each chain electrochemically. 6 Complexes of two dissimilar and weakly coupled lanthanides: molecular prototypes of CNOT QGs One possible way of having two inequivalent qubits within a molecule, as required for a CNOT QG, is using non-symmetric ligands. Ligand H3L4 exhibits a collection of donor groups disposed in a way that could favour the aggregation of two metals in different coordination environments. This is the case with lanthanide, LnIII, cations. Indeed, single lanthanide ions are good candidates for encoding quantum information, since they very often exhibit, as a result of their strong zero field splitting (ZFS), a very well isolated ground state doublet, \u00b1mJ, which represents an effective S = 1/2, thus providing for good realizations of qubits. In addition, their spin states exhibit long decoherence (with measured relaxation times, T2, of up to 7 \u03bcs), adding a very important quality to their functionality in QC.22 The reaction of H3L4 with LnX3 (LnIII = a lanthanide; X\u2212 = Cl\u2212 or NO \u2212 3 ) in pyridine forms dinuclear complexes with a general formula [Ln2X(HL4)2(H2L4)(py)(S)] (S = py or H2O) for practically the entire 4f series.52 All these compounds involve two LnIII ions surrounded by three deprotonated H3L4 ligands along the molecular axis, thus, with one side of the complex being different from the other. In Fig. 12 is a representation of the compound [Tb2Cl(HL4)2(H2L4)(py)2], emphasizing the difference between the coordination environments of both metal ions. On the right side of Fig. 12 are \u03c7MT vs. T plots for the [Tb2], [Gd2] and [Eu2] analogues. At high temperatures, the curve of the gadolinium complex denotes a Curie-like behavior corresponding to a couple of independent Gd(iii) ions (S = 7/2) down to near 10 K, where a small decline is observed reflecting a very weak antiferromagnetic coupling between both cations. The red solid line in this curve is a fit of the experimental data that reveals the coupling constant to be J = \u22120.014 cm\u22121 (in the H = \u22122JS1S2 convention). A very weak coupling between both qubits is necessary for the realization of a CNOT quantum gate, together with a strong anisotropy of both spin carriers. The curve of the europium complex shows that the ground state of each metal is diamagnetic (J = 0), with some paramagnetic Stark levels populated at higher temperatures. The case of terbium is the most relevant for QC; the high temperature \u03c7MT values are consistent with two uncoupled TbIII ions (7F6, S = 3, L = 3, J = 6, g = 3/2) whereas the decline observed upon cooling is a consequence of the depopulation of the various mJ states, down to the Ising limit where only the two orientations mJ = \u00b16 of the J = 6 state of each metal are populated. These orientations correspond to the two states embodying each qubit. Ac magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity studies performed on this complex in a very broad temperature range (from room temperature down to 100 mK) enabled us to determine the axial ZFS parameter D (D = 12 cm\u22121, using the Hamiltonian H = \u2212D[J 2 1,z + J 2 2,z ] and the appropriate temperature regime) of the metals and also the magnetic exchange, Jex, between them (Jex = \u22120.011 cm\u22121, in the H = \u22122JS1S2 convention). This, together with the evidence that these two ions are not equivalent, is a demonstration that the [Tb2] molecule provides a good realization of two coupled and magnetically distinguishable qubits.53 The magnetic inequivalence between both metals is manifested by the observation that cooling down to very low temperature does not cause the product \u03c7MT to vanish. This is because the anisotropy axes of the metals in each molecule form an angle \u03b4 different than zero, causing the two antiferromagnetic states |\u21d1\u30091 \u2297 |\u21d3\u30092 and |\u21d3\u30091 \u2297 |\u21d1\u30092 to preserve a net magnetic moment (Fig. 13, left). The low temperature susceptibility and heat capacity measurements furnish, independently, an estimation of the angle \u03b4 of 66\u00b0. This is confirmed by isothermal magnetization measurements (at T = 0.26 and 2 K) which show that the antiferromagnetic states give a paramagnetic response starting at H = 0, contrary to what would be observed if the magnetic moments of both metals cancelled each other. The angle formed between both anisotropy axes makes the magnetic moment of each metal to couple differently to an external magnetic field, H, applied in a given orientation, thus making both spins inequivalent. The energy level structure of the [Tb2] complex (Fig. 13, right) fulfills then all the ingredients of a CNOT QG. Indeed, the magnetic asymmetry allows to single out any of the desired transitions necessary for the realization of a CNOT operation. For example, at \u03bc0H = 0.28 T, only the two states that could convert into each other during such operation (i.e. those with the control qubit up; |\u21d1\u30091 \u2297 |\u21d3\u30092 and |\u21d1\u30091 \u2297 |\u21d1\u30092) are separated by the energy of 9.8 GHz radiation (X-band EPR). Under these conditions, sending photons of that energy would take any of these two states into the other while leaving the other two states unaffected (Fig. 12, right), which represents the implementation of this logic operation. Intriguing related questions are the coherence and fidelity of these operations. In particular, it will be necessary to ascertain how the off-diagonal anisotropy terms, which ultimately determine the possibility of performing the gate operations and their rates, might affect the wavefunction after a sequence of gate operations are performed on a given input state.54 In view of these very interesting properties, other members of the lanthanide series are being investigated in detail, involving for example the selection of isotopes with zero nuclear spin. One particularly attractive prospect is the possibility of using the non-equivalence of both metal sites in this complex to make heterometallic systems. This would allow to better differentiate the control from the target qubits of a CNOT QG, and choose the metals that would better fulfil either one or the other function.

The examples shown here from different laboratories demonstrate that the same goals can be addressed via a variety of approaches. Clearly, the possibility of using coordination molecules as hardware for QC is still remote. However, we have shown here that significant progress has been made, including the experimental demonstration of suitable decoherence times, the capacity of devising ways to ensemble various types of cluster nanomagnets as pairs within molecules, or the possibility of generating an energy scheme potentially addressable for the realization of a CNOT logic operation. The value of this compilation is not only to show what has been done but to hint what might be achieved. The challenges of the still utopic goal of implementing QIP using coordination magnetic complexes are huge, but the process will need to involve the capacity of organizing the molecules into devices, introducing mechanisms to tune and switch the interaction between different qubits or different parts of a QG or addressing or reading out the information codified in the qubits. The next decade will undoubtedly witness many spectacular developments of this multidisciplinary area which is emerging with force as a key topic in Nanotechnology.

Since these phenomena have no classical analogue, similar results cannot be achieved within the framework of traditional computing. The experimental insights of quantum computing technologies have already been demonstrated, and several studies are in progress. Here we review the most recent results of quantum computation technology and address the open problems of the field.

Introduction Quantum computing technology offers fundamentally different solutions to computational problems and enables more efficient problem-solving than what is possible with classical computations. The experimental results are promising, and quantum computers may be available commercially within a few years [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. One of the most famous algorithms that demonstrate the power of quantum computers is Shor\u2019s prime factorization algorithm [11]. The difference between the power of classical and quantum computing is demonstrable via the breaking speed of the Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman (RSA) algorithm [12]. Solving this computational problem requires billions of years in a traditional computational setting, while in theory, a quantum computer can solve it within a few hours [11], [13]. In 1994, this algorithm caused the \u201cbig bang\u201d of quantum computations and paved the way for the development of quantum computing technology and the evaluation of quantum computers [14]. Quantum computers integrate several different elements\u2014from a functional point of view, such elements are similar to traditional functional ones (registers, gates, memories, buses, CPUs, storage devices), but in the physical layer, the structures of classical and quantum devices are fundamentally different. In a quantum computational framework, the quantum operations are applied on quantum registers. In the quantum register, quantum states formulate quantum superposition, while in a quantum circuit, the quantum states are entangled. These phenomena lead to a fundamentally different system characteristic than what is present in a traditional computer. Besides these, quantum hardware restrictions such as the no-cloning theorem also require different circuit design technologies since a quantum state cannot be simultaneously present in more than one quantum gate [5], [10]. A quantum computer has reversible quantum gates that perform a unitary operation on the quantum systems. Quantum computers are working today, but currently we have only a few quantum computer devices in a laboratory environment [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. However, several new fields and interesting results have recently emerged that can significantly boost these developments. The large-scale quantum computers are realized in a distributed setting, where smaller quantum computers communicate with one another via a quantum bus. These physically large quantum computers can also be shrunken into small-sized devices via new technologies in the next few years. The situation is very similar to the evolution phases of classical computers both in size and performance. The most recent research papers and results of quantum computation technology are reviewed here. All sections also address the open problems of the field. State-of-the art references are summarized in the Related Work subsection at the end of each section. The novel contributions of our manuscript are as follows: \u2022 We review the most recent results of quantum computation technology and address its ongoing issues. \u2022 We summarize the most recent and relevant papers on quantum computing technology. \u2022 We present the results in a well-structured, easily understandable, and easily acceptable form. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the fundamentals of quantum computations. In Section 3, we discuss the basic quantum hardware elements. In Section 4, we review the results of large-scale quantum computations. In Section 5, quantum algorithm implementations are summarized. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude the paper. 2. Quantum computations Quantum computers are based on the fundamental concept of quantum information. In these computers, information is represented by quantum states, and with the exploitation of quantum effects provided by quantum mechanics (such as quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, quantum interference, the no-cloning theorem, decoherence [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] etc.), quantum computations can be performed in a quantum computer. In the physical layer, quantum systems can manifest in several different ways (atom energy levels, spin, polarization). A general quantum system refers to a d -dimensional quantum system (for a qubit system, d = 2 ), and therefore, a quantum register (a set of n quantum states) in a superposition allows us to represent d n possible classical values simultaneously. In quantum circuit computations, the quantum states are naturally modeled as entangled systems; thus, the state of each quantum system depends on the other. Quantum computations are based on the fundamental concept of reversible computation. In theory, in a reversible computation, the complete initial state can be recovered from the output state [19]. Reversible circuits can also be designed for classical systems [20] such that the number of inputs and outputs of a reversible gate must be equal, and the mapping of a particular input onto a given output must be one-to-one. These rules must also be satisfied for a quantum computation system; thus, the input quantum states of a quantum circuit evolve reversibly via unitary operations. Practically, such reversibility is achieved by a series of quantum gates (for example, applying a second NOT gate \u2013 a quantum gate that negates the input \u2013 on the output of the first NOT gate recovers the original input, etc.). The temporary quantum systems in a quantum computation setting are called ancilla states, which are neglected as the output is realized. Finally, a measurement is applied on the quantum register to extract a classical numerical value for further calculations. Quantum algorithms utilize the fundamentals of quantum computational complexity. Several quantum algorithms have been proposed so far, whose general conclusion is that utilizing the effects of quantum mechanics would result in a significant speedup (exponential, polynomial, superpolynomial) over the classical algorithms. Besides this (as demonstrated in the prime factorization problem), it is implied that several problems currently intractable via classical algorithms can be solved via quantum algorithms. For the basic requirements on the physical implementations of quantum computers, the DiVincenzo criteria [21] establish the fundamental guidelines. These criteria imply the requirement of extensible quantum registers, the initialization of the quantum registers to a known state, the requirement of a universal gate set to run arbitrary quantum algorithms on the quantum computer, and requirements on the coherence time and fidelity to perform long processes, and the results of the quantum computations have to be extractable from the quantum computer via measurements. These are the fundaments of the practical implementation of any quantum computation. The conceptual diagram of the evolution of quantum computing technology is depicted in Fig. 1. In the functional layer, the aims of classical and quantum computation technology are similar, but in the physical layer, these fields are completely different. The physical foundations of quantum computing technologies are laid down by the DiVincenzo criteria, which are supplemented with particular physical layer attributes. From quantum computing technology, quantum computers are derived with particular conditions on the physical layer attributes of quantum registers, gates, circuits, and memories The problem of quantum computational complexity has been analyzed from several different aspects. In [22], the authors studied the computational complexity of linear optics and provided new evidence that quantum computers cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. The authors also defined a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, and then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. They also studied the prospects for realizing the model using current photonics and optics technology. The authors concluded that the proposed model can solve sampling problems and search for problems that are classically intractable.

Quantum computers employ the results integrated by quantum computing technologies. Aaronson in [23] studied the so-called \u201clearnability\u201d of quantum states. As shown in this work, a quantum state can be characterized by using a number of measurements that grows only linearly with the number of quantum states. The author analyzed the complexity of quantum tomography and showed the possibility of a new simulation of quantum one-way communication protocols by the framework. The paper also analyzed the problem of using a trusted classical advice to verify an untrusted quantum advice. 2.1.

Building blocks of quantum computers To discuss the most recent updates regarding the fundamental building blocks of quantum computers, we use the following classification: quantum gates, quantum memories, quantum CPUs, quantum controlling and measurement, and quantum error-correction tools. 3.1. Quantum gates The quantum gates of a quantum computer perform unitary operations on quantum states. The Toffoli and Fredkin quantum gates [14], [15], [17], [18], [19] are three-bit gates and are essential since any quantum circuit can be decomposed into a set of Toffoli gates or Fredking gates and can also simulate NOT or CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gates. In other words, either gate can be used to realize universal quantum computations [18]. Since quantum gates are reversible, the ancilla states are cleared, and only the valuable outputs are kept. In the physical layer, the quantum gates can be realized by ion traps, superconductors, linear optic tools, diamonds, quantum dots, donor-based systems, or topological quantum computing elements, see the related references in the Related Work subsection. Handling the errors of the quantum gates for practical implementations requiring efficient quantum error-correction codes is still an open problem [8], [10], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52]. In [53] the authors studied the achievable quantum advantages with shallow circuits. As the authors have found the constant-depth quantum circuits are more powerful than their classical counterparts. As the authors concluded that any classical probabilistic circuit that solves that particular problem must have depth logarithmic in the number of input quantum states. The authors also found that this problem can be solved with unit certainty by a constant-depth quantum circuit. This quantum circuit has to contain only one- and two-qubit gates acting locally on a two-dimensional grid, which represents a practically implementable gate model structure. In [54], the authors studied the power of IQP (instantaneous quantum polynomial-time) circuits in the presence of some physically motivated constraints. The results are particularly important, since it is hard to simulate classically an IOP circuit. In this work the authors found that there exists a family of IQP circuits that can be implemented on a square lattice of n qubits with a particular depth. They also found that if an arbitrarily small constant amount of noise is added to each qubit there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that can simulate sampling from the resulting distribution. In [55], the authors studied the design methods of high-fidelity three-qubit gates (Toffoli, Controlled-Not-Not and Fredkin), These quantum gates are particularly important for quantum error correction and experimental quantum information processing. The proposed model is based on the fundamentals of machine-learning. As the authors have found, the procedures are applicable to a system comprising three nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting artificial atoms. The authors concluded that the proposed scheme achieves 99.9% fidelity. This result is particularly convenient since it is a threshold fidelity for fault-tolerant quantum computing. 3.2. Quantum memories In quantum circuit computations, quantum memories are formulated by n stationary quantum states. The quantum memories store these quantum systems in a quantum register for information processing. Several different concepts exist in the literature for the realization of quantum memories. An interesting approach is topological quantum memory [56], which is achieved via an array or torus of quantum states. These quantum systems are entangled in some patterns to formulate a stable logical quantum system. Regarding the physical implementations of quantum memories, improving the memory lifetimes are still an open problem [8], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], - however the results are encouraging. A room-temperature quantum bit memory exceeding one second has been demonstrated in [60], while in [61], a large-scale quantum-computer architecture has been proposed with atomic memory and photonic interconnects. For the discussion on quantum random access memory, see [59]. As the authors defined, a quantum random access memory (qRAM) uses n qubits to address any quantum superposition of N memory cells. The authors proposed an architecture that exponentially reduces the requirements for a memory call. As the authors found, the results allows to construct a more robust qRAM algorithm and also leads to an exponential decrease in the power needed for addressing. The work concluded with a quantum optical implementation. The exponential capacity of associative memories under quantum annealing recall is studied in [65]. In this work the authors showed that using quantum annealing for recall tasks endows associative memory models (that models can store a sublinear number of memories in some theoretical models) with exponential storage capacities. The authors also demonstrated the application of their scheme via the Dwave processor that provided a programmable quantum annealing device. The optimization of dynamical decoupling for quantum memory via recurrent neural networks is studied in [57]. In this work the authors utilized the methods of traditional machine learning that are based on recurrent neural networks to optimize dynamical decoupling sequences. As the authors note, these decoupling method is a relatively simple technique for suppressing the errors in quantum memory. The authors showed that at the present of some prior knowledge and with some conditions on the iteration procedure, the analyzed models are useful for error correction in quantum memories. In [66] a definition of quantum memristors (resistors with memory whose resistance depends on the history of the crossing charges) is included. The decoherence mechanism in the proposed model is controlled by a continuous-measurement feedback scheme. The authors also demonstrated that memory effects actually persist in the quantum regime, and the superconducting circuits are ideal for their practical implementation. As the authors concluded, the introduced model of quantum memristor can be used as a building block for neuromorphic quantum computations, and quantum simulations of non-Markovian systems. The quantum memristors are resistive quantum elements retaining information of their past dynamics [67]. In [67], the authors analyzed the quantum memristors implementations using superconducting circuits. The authors introduced a quantum device whose memristive behavior arises from quasiparticle-induced tunneling when supercurrents are canceled. As the authors have introduced a model for the quantification of quantum memory retention, and concluded the hysteretic behavior is achievable via currently implementable measurement procedures in superconducting quantum circuits. In [68], an analysis of qubit-based memcapacitors and meminductors is proposed. As the authors found, the capacitive and inductive devices offer remarkable functionalities for quantum computations (superconducting charge and phase qubits are quantum versions of memory capacitive and inductive systems). As it is shown in this work, the qubit-based memcapacitors and meminductors exhibit unusual hysteresis curves for some special inputs. As a main result of this paper, the set of known memcapacitive and meminductive systems can be extended to qubit-based quantum devices. 3.3. Quantum CPUs Quantum CPUs use a quantum bus for the communication between the functional elements of a quantum computer. From a computing perspective, quantum CPUs can be approached through the building blocks that formulate it: quantum adders. Several different reversible quantum adder types have been defined, see quantum Fourier-transform-based adders, linear-time adders,quantum carry-save adders, carry-lookahead adders, conditional-sum adders, quantum carry-select adders, quantum carry-rippleadders [19] to realize quantum computations in different architectural models. The quantum versions of the classical adders can also be made for quantum computations, with reversible structure and parallel implementations. The quantum adders are all reversible and use ancilla quantum states, but they are equipped with different working mechanisms, circuit depths, latencies, and performance; thus, the realization of their cooperation brings up several open problems [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77]. For the parallelization of the quantum circuits, two basic networks models were defined in [19]. The first network model allows long-distance communication between a set of quantum states (set of states that are involved in the quantum computations). Meanwhile, the second model allows only local communications; it is precisely possible only between the nearest neighbors in a linear layout [9], [19]. The performance of the various quantum adders was characterized in these network models, and it has been concluded that the performance of the different configurations is close to each other. For the implementation of the quantum communications between the quantum CPU and the functional elements of the quantum computer, the different experimental quantum error-correction methods can be used [19]. By theory, the performance of a quantum circuit is denoted by O \u22c5 , and because of the nature of signal propagations, the latency of any circuit is limited to O n D in an n -bit system, and with D -dimensional structure (practically, D = 3 ). In [19], five different qubus interconnect topologies were analyzed using Shor\u2019s prime factorization algorithm. For the basic gate structure of the quantum prime factorization algorithm, see Fig. 2. The quantum algorithm aims to increase the probabilities of the solutions (red dots) in the quantum register A . As it has been concluded in [19], the quantum carry-ripple adder provides the best performance for a wide range of parameters. As it is concluded in this work, the small nodes (up to five logical qubits) and a linear interconnection network provide adequate performance; more complex networks are unnecessary as the number of bits of the factorized number reaches several hundred bits. Regarding the performance of these quantum adders, in this work it also has been concluded that these adders makes possible to factorize a 6000-bit number one million times and thirteen thousand times faster than it is possible by the BCDP (Beckman\u2013Chari\u2013Devabhaktuni\u2013Preskill) modular exponentiation algorithm.

(a) The quantum circuit of the factorization algorithm. The quantum circuit consists of two quantum registers: the first quantum register A (depicted by the dashed box) contains t qubits; the second quantum register B (dashed box) contains n qubits. First, the superposition of the qubits of register A is prepared via the H Hadamard operation. Then, a U unitary operation is applied that is required for the period-finding method. Next, the qubits of register B are measured via the M 1 measurement operator. Afterward, a second unitary operation U I Q F T , the inverse quantum Fourier transformation (IQFT), is applied on quantum register A . Finally, the qubits of A are measured by the M 2 operator. (b) The state of register A after M 1 but before U I Q F T . (c) The state of register A after U I Q F T . Before U I Q F T , the p probabilities of the solutions (depicted by red dots) in A are low, p = r \u2215 2 t (the nonsolutions are depicted by blue dots, and b is a constant), where r is the period. After U I Q F T , the values of p are increased to p = 1 \u2215 r . After the second measurement M 2 , some postprocessing steps (dashed box) need to determine r from the measurement result. In [70] the authors also studied the properties of quantum adders, specifically the method of protected state transfer using an approximate quantum adder. In this work the authors defined a decoherence protected protocol for transmitting photonics quantum states over depolarizing quantum channels. The studied protocol was implemented by an approximate quantum adder engineered through spontaneous parametric down converters. As the authors concluded a higher success probability can be achieved via the method than by distilled quantum teleportation protocols for distances below a threshold. In [72], the authors studied the approximate quantum adders with genetic algorithms. Particularly, the authors proposed the theoretical aspects of approximate quantum adders, and defined an optimization method that is based on genetic algorithms. As the authors have found the results makes possible to improve the achievable efficiency and fidelity of some previous protocols. The authors practically implemented an approximate quantum adder using the IBM Quantum Experience. As the authors concluded the approximate quantum adders can help to enhance quantum information processing. In [78], a method for quantum state transfer via noisy photonic and phononic waveguides is studied. The authors defined a protocol in which a quantum state of photons stored in a first cavity can be faithfully transferred to a second distant cavity via an infinite one-dimensional waveguide. As the authors found this transfer is possible while the transferred information being immune to arbitrary noise (e.g. thermal noise) injected into the waveguide. The authors also studied a cavity QED setup, where atomic ensembles, or single atoms represented the quantum memory. As the authors concluded the proposed models and results can be applied in the various fields of phononic quantum information processing. In [71], the authors studied the realization of quantum autoencoders using quantum adders with genetic algorithms. As the authors stated, there exists a useful connection between approximate quantum adders and quantum autoencoders. As the authors found, it is possible to develop optimized approximate quantum adders using genetic algorithms. As the authors have concluded, the results also have several practical consequences, since quantum autoencoders can be implemented for a variety of initial states, and quantum autoencoders can be designed via controllable quantum platforms. In [73], the authors studied the problem of space-efficient design for reversible floating point adder in quantum computing. As the authors emphasized, reversible logic has crucial significance in experimental low-power computing and quantum computing. The authors defined a space-efficient reversible floating-point adder for quantum computers. The proposed model can be used for binary quantum computation, and to improve the designs of the expensive units. The authors proposed techniques for the cost reduction, and for the fault-tolerant designs for the circuits. In [79], the competing and cooperating technological trends related to experimental quantum computing and quantum computer implementations are studied. As it is concluded here, classical computers will still play a relevant part, however the classical computations are limited by thermodynamics and by the nature of atomic matter and quantum effects. 3.4. Controlling and measurement The appropriate control mechanisms are a necessity for quantum state manipulations, readout, error-correction processes, and fault-tolerant quantum computations. Relevant progress has been made since the ion trap-based implementations [10], [61], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], such as superconducting quantum circuits [1], [4], [8], [42], [67], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], linear optics [10], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115], [116], [117], [118], topological quantum computing [43], [47], [52], [119], [120], [121], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129], [130], quantum dots [75], [77], [131], [132], [133], [134], [135], [136], [137], [138], donor-based quantum implementations [10], [62], [69], [138], [139], [140], [141], [142], [143], [144], [145], [146], anyon-based quantum computing [10], [96], [123], [126], [130], [147], [148], and others (see Related Works). An important open problem in this fields is the preparation of quantum systems for the computations [149], [150], [151], [152], [153], as well as the experimental realization of the measurements [48], [49], [101], [113], [154], [155], [156], [157], [158], [159], [160], [161], [162], [163], [164] that extracts valuable information from the quantum states. In [151] the authors studied the practical superposing of two pure quantum states with partial prior knowledge. The results are particularly important in experimental quantum information processing since generating superposition of any two unknown pure states is a challenge since it can be achieved only with some prior knowledge about the input states but only in a probabilistic way. The apriori knowledge is represented by the overlap between the two unknown states with respect to some given referential state. In [151], the authors implemented the probabilistic protocol of superposing two pure states in a three-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system. They also studied the feasibility of the protocol by preparing a families of input states, and determined the average fidelity between the prepared state. Since the achieved fidelity was high, the authors have also concluded that the proposed implementation can be extended to more complex situations and to complex quantum circuits. In [149], the authors also studied the problem of superposing unknown quantum states. Particularly, in this work the authors defined an experimentally feasible protocol to superpose multiple pure states of a d dimensional quantum system. The authors also proposed a practical realization on a two-qubit NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) quantum processor. In [165] the authors studied some quantum sampling problems, particularly focusing on boson sampling and quantum supremacy. The authors gave a summary on the arguments that are in use to deduce when sampling problems are hard for classical computers to simulate, particularly focusing on boson sampling. The authors gave a conclusion on these classes and reviewed the recent experimental realization connected to quantum supremacy in boson sampling. In [166], the authors studied the application of differential equations in photonic quantum information processing. The authors introduced a model for the realization of photonic quantum circuits whose dynamics is determined by some differential equations. As the authors have concluded, the studied model enables the implementation of quantum feedback and feedforward without requiring any intermediate measurements in the quantum circuit. The results concluded, the proposed results represent a promising way towards chip-based integrated quantum control. In [167], a machine-learning-based model is studied for the prediction and real-time compensation of qubit decoherence. The authors applied some techniques from traditional control theory and traditional machine learning to predict the future evolution of the state of a qubit. As the authors concluded, the studied experimental models demonstrate significant improvements in qubit phase stability over the standard measurement-based feedback approaches. As the authors have found the proposed models require no further extensions on the hardware-layer, and also well applicable for qubit systems where the measurement are achieved by projective measurements. As another application of quantum artificial intelligence in the field of superconducting circuits can be found in [95]. The analysis covers some basic protocols of quantum reinforcement learning using superconducting circuit implementations. It is also assumed in the paper that these superconducting circuits are equipped with feedback-loop control. The paper also defines some diverse scenarios for superconducting circuits. In [168], the authors studied the determination and correction of persistent biases in quantum annealers. The paper addresses of some performance issues of quantum annealers. The authors defined a strategy to determine and correct persistent, systematic biases between the actual values of the programmable parameters and their user-specified values. The authors also tested their model in experiment using the D-Wave quantum device implementations. The work concluded that the proposed model can enhance the performance of the actual quantum device. In [169], the authors studied quantum state discrimination using the minimum average number of copies. As the authors stated, in the task of discriminating between nonorthogonal quantum states from multiple copies, the key parameters are the error probability and the resources (number of copies) used. The authors defined a new state discrimination task, since in their framework the average resources are minimized for a fixed admissible error probability. They concluded that this new task is not performed optimally by previously known strategies, and they also derived and experimentally test. In [152], the authors studied the problem of superposition generation of some unknown quantum states. The authors proposed a theorem that forbids the existence of a universal probabilistic quantum protocol producing a superposition of two unknown quantum states. The paper also introduced a probabilistic protocol for the creating of superposition of two unknown states, such that the quantum states have a fixed overlap with the known referential pure state. As the authors found, the protocol can be implemented on arbitrary Hilbert spaces allowing a wide-range of practical implementations. In [150], a study on the experimental creation of superposition of unknown photonic quantum states is provided. The authors defined a method for the creation of superposition of arbitrary two unknown photonic qubits as long as they have nonzero overlaps with the horizontal polarization state. As the paper concluded, the average fidelity as high as 0.99, thus a practical implementations could have a significant importance in experimental quantum computations. A possible practical application of the protocol is information compression by coherent superposition. In [153], the authors added some knowledge to the current results regarding the generation of superposition of two unknown states. The authors showed that in the presence of closed time like curves, it is possible to generate superposition of unknown quantum states and evade the no-go result of [152]. 3.5. Quantum error correction The development of quantum error-correction methods allows us to satisfy the requirements on high fidelity and adequate coherence times in quantum computations. The nature of errors in a quantum computation system significantly differs from that of classical system errors [45]. Different physical technologies were introduced for the various quantum hardware implementations to achieve reliable, fault-tolerant quantum computations, but a universal model for quantum error correction is still an open problem [8], [10], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52]. The quantum error-correction methods generally use the input data quantum states and syndrome quantum states that are used to identify error information. In experimental quantum computations, a distinction exists between the logical and physical representations of quantum states in that a logical quantum system is encoded by several quantum states in the physical layer. The developed quantum error-correction codes (such as designs of topological error correction, etc.) are adaptable for the different requirements of the various physical implementations. In [46], the authors studied the problem of surface code error correction on a defective lattice. The motivation behind these error correction schemes, as it is also stated by the authors is that the implementations of quantum computers will be susceptible to loss in the form of physically faulty quantum states. The adaptive error correction schemes will therefore have a crucial significance in practical quantum computations and in the implementations of quantum computers. The authors in this work simulated statically placed single-fault lattices and lattices. The authors concluded that a static loss at the periphery of the lattice has less negative effect than a static loss at the center. The authors also analyzed different metrics for predicting quantum chip performance, and they concluded that the depth of the deepest stabilizer circuit in the lattice gave the strongest correlation with post-correction residual error rates. The results are particularly convenient for experimental quantum computations. In [170], the authors studied the problems of state injection, lattice surgery and dense packing of the deformation-based surface code. The authors defined a deformation-based surface code using superstabilizers to detect short error chains connecting the superstabilizers. The results concluded that it is possible to place logical qubits close together in practical quantum computations. The authors also studied the process of conversion from the defect-based surface code, and they introduced a placement design for the deformation-based surface code. The results are particularly convenient for experimental large-scale quantum computations. In [44], the authors studied the quantum sample complexity of learning with errors. The authors found that there exists an efficient quantum learning algorithm with polynomial sample and time complexity for a learning problem. As the authors have concluded, the results have some implications for cryptography. In [171], the authors studied the implementation aspects of silicon-based surface code quantum computers. The work focused on the conflict between nanometer separation for qubit\u2013qubit interactions, and proposed a solution for the separation problem by establishing the feasibility of surface code quantum computing using solid state spins. The proposed method utilizes probe spins that are aimed for the mechanical separation, and includes a protocol for error correction due to the spins being imperfectly located. As the authors have concluded, the defined architecture overcomes many of the difficulties facing solid state quantum computing, and provides qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude greater than other systems. In [147], the authors studied the so-called \u201cmajorana zero modes\u201d that are quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter systems. These majorana zero modes have a crucial significance since these can be used as building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers. In their model, the authors have used the so-called \u201cCoulomb-blockade spectroscopy\u201d in a nanowire segment that results in a superconducting Coulomb island (a \u201cMajorana island\u201d). As the authors have found, the introduced model helps to clarify the trivial-to-topological transition in finite systems and to study the advanced properties of topological protection. The authors in [8] showed that the lifetime of a quantum bit can be extended with error correction in superconducting circuits. The implemented qubits are encoded in superpositions of Schr\u00f6dinger-cat states of a superconducting resonator. The practical implementation covers a quantum error correction protocol that uses a feedback control mechanism. In the proposed implementation, the corrected qubit lifetime was 320 microseconds. As the authors have concluded, these results illustrate the benefits of a hardware-efficient qubit encoding rather than traditional quantum error correction schemes. In [172], the question of quantum supremacy (quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined computational task beyond the capabilities of currently available classical computers) is studied. In this work, the authors analyzed the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits. As the authors have found, sampling the distribution classically requires a high-cost numerical simulation of the circuit. This cost is increases exponentially in function of the number of qubits of the system. The authors analyzed quantum circuits up to 42 qubits. As the authors have found, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term quantum devices with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. In [173], the authors studied the characterization of decohering quantum systems using a machine learning approach. They analyzed the decoherence effects in adaptive characterization processes, where measurement settings are updated via data feedback. As the authors have found, adapting measurements can provide estimates whose error decreases exponentially in the number of measurements. The authors also developed a framework for handling high initial parameter uncertainty and for the presence of imperfections in the readout in decohering quantum systems. In [174], the authors defined quantum autoencoders for efficient compression of quantum data. By theory, the task of an autoencoder is to map the input to a lower dimensional point such that the input can likely be recovered from the mapped point. The authors defined a model of a quantum autoencoder to perform these operations on quantum data. As the authors found, the parameters of the quantum autoencoder can be trained using classical optimization algorithms. The authors also demonstrated the results for the compression of quantum systems. 3.6.

Large-Scale quantum computing A large-scale quantum computer is desired for the realization of complex quantum algorithms. Compared to traditional transistor technologies, the structural properties of quantum devices require larger physical distances (because of the physical position of quantum states in the space) and therefore larger building blocks in the physical layer. As a consequence, instead of a large quantum computer (macro-architecture), several smaller quantum computers (micro-architecture) will communicate with each other in a particular network structure to realize distributed computations. Since in the physical layer the actual model used for the implementation of quantum error correction determines the possible theoretical architectures, multiple designs exist to realize large-scale quantum architectures. Finding a universal model of large-scale quantum computations is still an open problem [22], [61], [87], [104], [186], [200], [201], [202], [203], [204]. One of the most promising approaches are the theoretical architectures yielded by the topological error-correction framework [43], [47], [52], [119], [120], [121], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126], [127], [129], [130], [205], for further results see the Related Works. 4.1. Gate model quantum computers In gate model quantum computers, the quantum computations are performed by several layers of quantum gates. Each quantum gate performs a unitary operation on the input quantum systems. The gates are applied in several rounds because of hardware restrictions such as the no-cloning theorem that makes it impossible for a given quantum system to participate in more than one quantum gate simultaneously [5]. Current practical implementations of gate model quantum computers (Google, MIT [5], [202], [203], [204], [206]) are based on qubit systems with a particular qubit-to-qubit coupling topology, and the achievable circuit depth depends on the fidelity of the quantum gates. In [206], the authors defined the so-called Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which is a quantum algorithm for the efficient solution of combinatorial optimization problems. As the authors defined, the quantum algorithm outputs approximate solutions, and the working mechanism of the algorithm depends on a positive integer. As they stated, the quality of the approximation of the quantum algorithm improves as this positive integer is increased. As the authors defined, the quantum circuit consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function (the goal is to find the optimum of the objective functions). As the authors showed, the depth of the quantum circuit grows linearly within their framework. The authors analyzed the performance of the quantum algorithm on regular graphs, and concluded that it offers several benefits over the classical algorithms. In [207], the authors applied the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to a well-defined combinatorial problem. In the studied model, the input system is a set of linear equations each of which contains exactly three boolean variables and each equation outputs that the sum of the variables mod 2 is 0 or is 1. The authors showed, that their quantum algorithm will efficiently solve the input problem, and provides several additional benefits over the classical algorithms. In [208], the authors studied the relevance of quantum supremacy, using their algorithm called Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. As the authors stated this algorithm is designed to run on gate-model quantum computers. The algorithm takes as input a combinatorial optimization problem and outputs a string. As the authors stated, this output string satisfies a high fraction of the maximum number of clauses. The authors proved that for certain problems the proposed quantum algorithm has well-characterized performance bounds. As the authors also showed the output distribution of the quantum algorithm cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device. This statement was further verified via the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm. As the authors concluded, the proposed framework can be run on near term quantum computers and can be used to demonstrate quantum supremacy. In [5], the authors studied the theory of quantum algorithms for fixed qubit architectures. The analysis is based the gate-model quantum computers. The authors developed a method for programming gate-model quantum computers without the requirement of error correction or compilation. As the authors concluded as an important consequence, the number of logical qubits will be equal to the number of qubits on the device. The proposed methods use a sequence of parameterized unitaries that sit on the qubit layout to produce quantum states depending on those parameters. The authors also defined strategies for parameter optimization and studied the performance of the defined algorithms. The results are particularly important for the development of quantum computers, and can be utilized well in the gate-model qubit quantum computer layouts. In [19] an architecture of a quantum multicomputer is developed. The architecture of the quantum computer was optimized for Shor\u2019s factoring algorithm. In the proposed model, the quantum multicomputer is realized via a large number of nodes that are communicating through a quantum-bus (qubus). As the author stated, the primary metric chosen was the performance of the factorization process. As the author found, the quantum modular exponentiation step represents a computational bottleneck in the development of the quantum architecture and it requires a solution. A number of optimization methods have been proposed in the work to reduce the latency and circuit depth. As a final conclusion of the work, these modifications makes possible to achieve the modular exponentiation of an n -bit number with latency O n 2 log 2 n or O n 2 log n , while the initial latency was O n 3 . Some analysis revealed that the proposed quantum circuits can be more than one million times faster in comparison to other exiting methods (the study used a 6,000-bit number for the demonstration). The model also defined five different qubus interconnect topologies for the construction of quantum computer networks. The work also defined different forms of quantum adder circuits. As the authors concluded the serial links in the quantum multicomputer structure represent an optimal solution, since, as the author concluded, the parallel links would provide only very modest improvements in system reliability and performance. 4.2. Distributed topologies Because of the physical distance between the quantum states in the space, large-scale quantum computations seem to be realized by distributed topologies [9], [10], [19]. In a distributed topology, the smaller quantum computers communicate with each other via a quantum bus (implementable by optical fibers, wireless quantum channels, etc.), and the quantum algorithms and error-correction processes are also executed in a distributed manner. It requires not just a well-designed infrastructure but also protocols of the distributed quantum computations, distributed quantum applications, and quantum error correction, as well as distributed quantum control and measurements. Practically, the smaller quantum computers are connected via a particular system area network (SAN). In a SAN model, the quantum computers could have an arbitrary quantum hardware with diverse quantum coding approaches, which are handled and controlled by some appropriate protocols (the model also implements classical protocols). For larger distances, quantum metropolitan area networks (Q-MAN) or quantum wide area networks (Q-WAN) can be constructed. In [10], the authors studied the models and methods of local and distributed quantum computation. This paper provides a great review on the different construction methods and experimental quantum error correction models that are relevant for the implementation of scalable quantum computing are also studied. In [80], the authors proposed a model for designing a million-qubit quantum computer. As the authors found, an appropriate balance is needed between the large-scale integration of components in quantum computers and the reliability of hardware technology of quantum computers. As the authors found, this balance can be evaluated by appropriate modeling tools. The authors modeled the execution of quantum logic operations on a realistic quantum hardware with limited computational resources, and provided a performance simulation. The work also demonstrated the results through the Shor algorithm to factor a 1,024-bit number with a baseline budget of 1.5 million qubits. The authors concluded that a trapped-ion quantum computer can factor a 2048-bit integer in less than five months. In [209], the authors proposed a model for distributed secure quantum machine learning that enables a classical client to delegate a remote quantum machine learning to the quantum server. The authors defined a protocol that assumes a remote small-scale photon quantum computation processor. Since the method is based on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, the protocol is secure without leaking any relevant information to an eavesdropper. In [210], the authors studied the quantum generalization of feedforward neural networks. The authors used the fundamental result that classical neurons can be generalized to the quantum case with reversibility. In this work the authors showed that these quantum networks can be used to compress quantum states onto a minimal number of qubits, creating a quantum autoencoder, and also useful to discover quantum communication protocols such as teleportation. As the authors concluded, the defined quantum neuron module can naturally be implemented photonically, therefore the model can also be implemented in practice. In [131], the authors studied the feasible implementation of quantum neural networks using quantum dots. The model is based on dipole\u2013dipole interactions. They have found that the proposed implementation is both feasible and versatile. As the authors defined, the physical implementation of framework uses GaAs based quantum dot qubits coupled to a reservoir of acoustic phonons. The authors showed that the quantum coherence in the defined neural networks survive for over a hundred picosec even at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K). As they concluded, this result is three orders of magnitude higher than current implementations which are operating at temperatures in the mili Kelvin range. 4.3. Physical implementations The currently implemented seven quantum technologies (ion traps, distributed and monolithic diamonds, superconductors, linear optics, quantum dots, donor systems, and topological quantum computing) used to realize quantum computers can be classified into four generations [10]. The first-generation quantum computers are realized via ion traps, with some KhZ as physical speed and some Hz as logical speed [10], [61], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90]. The footprint ranges of these quantum computers are in mm\u2013cm. The second-generation quantum computers are implemented by the distributed diamonds [60], [97], [211], [212], [213], [214], [215], [216], superconducting quantum circuits [1], [4], [8], [42], [67], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], and linear optical [10], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115], [116], [117], [118] technologies. These quantum computers could produce MhZ ranges as physical speed, and their logical speed is in the kHz domain, with footprint sizes in \u03bc m \u2013 mm . The third-generation quantum computers are based on monolithic diamonds [51], quantum dots [75], [77], [131], [132], [133], [134], [135], [136], [137], [138], or donor [10], [62], [69], [138], [139], [140], [141], [142], [143], [144], [145], [146] technologies. Their physical layer speed is in the GhZ range, while their logical speed is in the MhZ range, with footprint sizes in nm \u2013 \u03bc m . The fourth-generation quantum computers use the topological quantum computing technology [10], [96], [123], [126], [130], [147], [148] (also referred to as anionic quantum computing [10]). These technologies are currently in development and continuously evolving. An important impact of the fourth generation is that no active quantum error correction is needed since the system is developed to be naturally protected from decoherence. It allows the establishment of reliable quantum computations in practice without dedicated quantum error correction. An open problem in the current fourth-generation implementations is the realization of distributed quantum computing between distant points via anionic particles [96], [123], [126], [130], [147], [148]. For the related research results, see the Related Work subsection. In [7] the authors proposed a practical realization of a scalable Shor algorithm on quantum computers. Due to the fact that several practical implementations of the factorization algorithm have been demonstrated using different quantum computer architectures, the general scalability of the algorithm was still not addressed before this result. The authors demonstrated factoring the number fifteen by seven qubits and four \u201ccache-qubits\u201d. As the authors showed the scalable Shor algorithm can be realized by an ion-trap quantum computer with success probabilities 90%. In [217] the authors proposed a novel model for the design of superconducting flux qubit. As the authors demonstrated, their solution provides broad-frequency tunability, strong anharmonicity, high reproducibility and relaxation times in excess of 40 microsec at its flux-insensitive point. In the developed framework the qubit dephasing at the flux-insensitive point is dominated by residual thermal-photons in the readout resonator. The results provided a revisit for flux qubit to enhance coherence and reproducibility in quantum circuits and quantum computer implementations. In [82], the authors demonstrated a method of engineering a modular quantum computer of any size from ion crystals. Since trapped atomic ions have great importance for the practical development of first generation quantum computers, the study of ion crystals-based solutions have a crucial significance from the perspective of near-future practical quantum computing. The proposed solution also studies the wiring between ion trap qubits, and the aspects of practical implementations such as experimental quantum computing protocols. In [91], the authors introduced a hardware platform to address the challenge of combination of various quantum elements into a quantum computer. The proposed solution fuses the methods of integrated circuit fabrication and three-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics (3D cQED). The authors defined the multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuit (MMIQC) platform to study scalable quantum computing. In [118], the authors studied quantum dots in electrically controlled cavity structures. To goal of the study was to achieve the simultaneous generation of near-unity indistinguishability and pure single photons with high brightness. The authors demonstrated a method for on-demand, bright and ultra-pure single photon generation. As they have found, this type of new generation of sources open the way to a new level of complexity and scalability in optical quantum manipulation. In [136], a model for an improved operation of exchange-coupled semiconductor quantum dots is presented. As the authors have found, the sensitivity of exchange operations can be reduced, the dephasing effect of charge noise can also be reduced significantly in comparison to operation near a charge-state anti-crossing. The proposed model also allows a performance improvement via rate, therefore the results are particularly convenient for fast quantum operations. In [75], an addressable fault-tolerant qubit model has been introduced that uses a natural silicon double quantum dot with a micromagnet optimally designed for fast spin control. As the authors have found, the model leads to high qubit fidelity (99.6%,) which is the highest reported for natural silicon qubits, and comparable to that obtained in isotopically purified silicon quantum-dot-based qubits. The results are particularly important from the implementation of practical quantum computers, since these result can be applied directly via the current devices. In [139], the authors demonstrated a method for deterministic, on-demand generation of two-qubit entangled states. The practical implementation is based on electron and the nuclear spin of a single phosphorus atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. As the authors have found, by sequentially reading the electron and the nucleus the generated entangled states violate the Bell/CHSH inequality. An extension of their model also allows to implement a high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurement (QND). As the authors have concluded, their experimental results represent a complete control over the two-qubit Hilbert space of a phosphorus atom. In [218], the authors studied the method of Hamiltonian simulation by qubitization. As the authors stated, for a specially given Hermitian operator the problem of Hamiltonian simulation is approximating the time evolution operator at a particular time with a specified error. The authors revealed that this kind of Hamiltonian simulation is possible with a well characterized, optimal query complexity. In [219] the authors showed that if multiple copies of a quantum system with particular density matrix are given, then one can create quantum coherence among different copies of the system to perform quantum principal component analysis. As the authors concluded, it is particularly convenient result for experimental quantum computations, since revealing the eigenvectors corresponding to the large eigenvalues of the unknown state exponentially faster than any existing algorithm. For a study on the advances in quantum metrology, see [220]. As the authors stated, quantum metrology is the study of those quantum techniques that allow one to gain advantages over purely classical approaches. In this work the authors reviewed some of the most promising recent developments in quantum metrology. For a work on the synthesis of arbitrary quantum circuits to topological assembly, see [129]. In this work, the authors proposed a method for the efficient generation of physical quantum circuits and quantum gate implementations for quantum computers. In [221], the authors studied the method of quantum-assisted Gaussian process regression. By theory, the Gaussian processes are a widely used model for regression problems in supervised machine learning. As the authors found, the quantum linear systems algorithm introduced in [222] can be applied to Gaussian process regression. As the authors concluded, it leads to an exponential reduction in computation time in some cases, or a polynomial increase in efficiency is also possible. In [223], a quantum algorithm is defined for linear regression. The quantum algorithm is applied for fitting a linear regression model to a given data set using the least squares approach. As the author stated, contrary to the previous existing algorithms result in a quantum state that encodes the optimal parameters, the proposed quantum algorithm outputs classical values. From the characteristics of the model it follows that by running it once, the fitted model can be completely determined. 4.4.

Quantum algorithm implementations Shor\u2019s prime factorization algorithm [11] is one of the most important quantum algorithms, and it also serves as a benchmark to characterize quantum computation performance [19]. The prime factorization algorithm has been implemented by different physical approaches with various conditions on scalability level. Quantum teleportation, quantum Fourier transform, quantum key distribution, quantum communication protocols [256], [257], [258], [259], [260], [261], [262], [263], [264], [265], [266], [267], [268], and quantum error-correction methods \u2013 which are not computational problems, however \u2013 play a crucial role in the realization of distributed quantum computations [9], [10], [19]. Their practical implementations are essential for any future experimental quantum computations, such as the development of the quantum Internet [269], [270]. Some practically implemented quantum algorithms belong to the quantum machine learning field [2]. Quantum programming languages [3], [10], [236], [240], [243] are also a distinct field with the purpose of developing appropriate programming languages for quantum computers. 5.1. Large-Scale quantum computations Another important field is that of classical algorithmic tools designed to control large-scale quantum computations [127], [129], [205], [238], [239], [241], [242], [252]. These include the mechanism and processes of distributed quantum computing such as quantum error correction in the nodes, protocols for communication between the quantum nodes, information transfer between the nodes and the quantum bus, decoding processes, optimization procedures, and many more. In both the implementation of quantum algorithms and the use of various quantum communication protocols, classical information will likely be present in the system as an auxiliary element [119], [120], [245]. Therefore, these quantum algorithms and methods are will be rather mixed \u201cquantum\u2013classical\u201d systems, with the augmentation of classical information processing, than purely quantum systems. For further references see the Related Work subsection. In [271] the authors proposed strategies for quantum computing molecular energies. The model is based on the application of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the simulation of molecular energies. The VQE algorithm utilizes quantum computers to efficiently determine values with a classical optimization routine in order to approximate ground state energies of quantum systems. As the authors have concluded, the defined strategies make possible to reduce the quantum circuit depth for the implementation of the algorithm and improve the optimization of the wavefunction. In [272], the authors studied the possibilities of practical optimization for hybrid quantum\u2013classical algorithms. The authors analyzed the required number of repetitions that are required for a precise estimation, since the state preparation and measurement phases have to repeated multiple time. Their analysis is based on a particular class of hybrid quantum\u2013classical algorithms. This class is selected by its well applicability in the field of quantum chemistry and combinatorial problems. The work also studied the application of quasi-Newton optimization methods in hybrid algorithms. 5.2. Computational problems In [273], the authors studied the quantum gradient descent for linear systems and least squares. The authors defined a quantum linear system solver that outperforms the current methods for large families of matrices. The proposed scheme is based on an improved procedure for singular value estimation. The authors provided the quantum method for performing gradient descent for cases where the gradient is an affine function, and in this case the cost of the method can be exponentially smaller than the cost of performing the step classically. They also provided applications of their quantum gradient descent algorithm. In [274], the authors studied the problem of quantum gradient descent and Newton\u2019s method for constrained polynomial optimization. The problem of gradient descent algorithms is to determine a local minima by moving along the direction of steepest descent. In the Newton\u2019s the problem solution uses curvature information which can be used to improve the convergence process. In this work, the authors defined the quantum versions of these iterative optimization algorithms. The authors applied them to some optimization problems, and as they concluded the quantum algorithms provide an exponential speed-up over classical algorithms. In [275], the authors analyzed the unified quantum no-go theorems and the transform of quantum states in a restricted set. The authors defined general quantum transformations forbidden or permitted by the superposition principle. The authors introduced the so-called no-encoding theorem. This theorem forbids linearly superposing of an unknown pure state and a fixed state in Hilbert space of finite dimension. The authors proposed two general forms include the no-cloning theorem, the no-deleting theorem, and the no-superposing theorem as special cases. The authors also defined a unified scheme for presenting perfect and imperfect quantum tasks (cloning and deleting). A demonstration of a small programmable quantum computer with atomic qubits is reported in [3]. The authors demonstrated a five-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer that can be programmed in software to implement arbitrary quantum algorithms by executing any sequence of universal quantum logic gates. As the authors have concluded the reconfiguration of the gate sequences provides a way to implement algorithms without altering the hardware. The authors implemented the Deutsch\u2013Jozsa and Bernstein\u2013Vazirani quantum algorithms with average success rates of 95% and 90%, respectively. They also performed a coherent quantum Fourier transform (QFT) on five trappedion qubits for phase estimation and period finding. As the authors concluded the implemented model can be scaled to larger numbers of qubits, and can be further expanded by connecting several modules. The results have great significance from the perspective of practically implementable quantum computations. In [276] the authors studied the fast graph operations in quantum computation that uses the connection between entangled states and graph theory. In this work the authors analyzed this connection and showed that it can be used in the reverse direction to yield a graph data structure. The authors also defined efficient algorithms for transformation and comparison operations on graphs. As the paper concluded, there exists no classical data structure that can achieve similar performance for the set of operations studied. A method for an automated search for new quantum experiments is introduced in [277]. The authors provided a scheme for the development of an algorithm that can determine new experimental implementations for the creation and manipulation of quantum systems. The provided results of the paper range from the first implementation of a high-dimensional Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger (GHZ) state to asymmetrically entangled quantum states. The authors also concluded that new types of high-dimensional transformations can be determined that can perform cyclic operations. In [278] a survey on some known quantum algorithms is given. The analysis focuses on the applications of the algorithms and not the technical description. The author also discusses some near-term applications of quantum algorithms in experimental quantum computing. In [279], the authors introduced a protocol that models the biological behaviors of individuals living in a natural selection scenario. As the authors found, the engineered evolution of the quantum living units represents the fundamental features of life. The authors concluded that the results could be useful in the realization of artificial life and embodied evolution with quantum technologies. In [280], the authors defined a method for quantum singular value decomposition of non-sparse low-rank matrices. The authors defined a quantum algorithm to exponentiate non-sparse indefinite low-rank matrices on a quantum computer. As the authors concluded, in some cases the proposed methods allows to find the singular values and associated singular vectors exponentially faster than it is possible via classical algorithms. In [125], the authors defined quantum algorithms for topological and geometric analysis of data. The authors developed quantum algorithms for the identification of some topological features for information extraction processes applied on large data sets. The proposed quantum algorithms also can be used for finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues. As the authors concluded, the defined quantum algorithms can provide an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for topological data analysis. In [281], the authors studied the methods of efficient phase estimation. The authors defined an efficient adaptive algorithm for phase estimation. The main novelty of the proposed solution is that their algorithm does not require that the user infer the bits of the eigenphase in reverse order. The defined method directly infers the phase and estimates the uncertainty in the phase directly from experimental data. As the authors concluded, the introduced algorithm can be applied in the presence of substantial decoherence with the same speed as the original phase estimation methods. In [282], the authors studied the quantum perceptron models, and analyzed how quantum computation can provide improvements in the computational and statistical complexity of the perceptron model. The authors defined two quantum algorithms for this purpose. As the authors found, improvements can be achieved through the application of quantum amplitude amplification to the version space interpretation of the perceptron model. In [283], the authors used the Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial time class of commuting quantum computations to strengthen the conjecture that quantum computers are hard to simulate classically. As the authors found, if either of two plausible average-case hardness conjectures holds, then these class of computations are hard to simulate classically up to constant additive error. The authors also analyzed the problem using spin-based generalizations of the Boson Sampling problem. In [284], the authors defined quantum algorithms for solving two problems connected to stochastic processes. The first algorithm prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a quantum system, the second algorithm estimates the hitting time of a Markov chain. As the authors concluded, the proposed quantum algorithms are useful for Hamiltonian simulation, spectral gap amplification, and solving linear systems of equations. In [285], the authors studied the problem of digital quantum simulation of many-body non-Markovian dynamics. The authors defined an algorithmic framework for the digital quantum simulation of many-body non-Markovian open quantum systems. As the authors concluded, the proposed method provides a tool for an experimental realization for a variety of problems. In [286], the authors studied the Simulated Quantum Annealing algorithm. This algorithm samples the equilibrium thermal state of a Quantum Annealing (QA) Hamiltonian, and they have concluded that in some cases simulated quantum annealing can be exponentially faster than classical simulated annealing. In [287], the authors studied the impossibility of classically simulating the so-called one-clean-qubit Computation. By theory, in the model of one-qubit quantum computation, the input state is a completely mixed state except for a single clean qubit, and only a single output qubit is measured at the end of the computing. As the authors found, the proposed results weakens the complexity assumption necessary for the existing impossibility results on classical simulation of various sub-universal quantum computing models. The authors also discussed some experimental implication of the results. In [288], the limits on fundamental limits to computation are studied. In this work the fundamental limits to computation with respect to manufacturing, energy, physical space, design and verification effort, and algorithms are reviewed. As it is concluded in the paper, engineering difficulties encountered by emerging technologies may indicate yet-unknown limits. In [289], the authors studied the problem of fault-tolerant operations for universal blind quantum computation. As the authors emphasized, blind quantum computation is an appealing use of quantum information technology because it can conceal both the client\u2019s data and the algorithm itself from the server. The authors defined a protocol to reduce the client\u2019s computational load by transferring the qubit preparation to the server. In the proposed model, for each logical qubit used in the computation, the client is only required to receive eight logical qubits via teleportation then buffer two logical qubits before returning one. As the authors concluded, this protocol can protect the client\u2019s fault-tolerant preparation of logical qubits from some attacks. In [290], the authors studied the problem of simulating chemistry efficiently on fault-tolerant quantum computers. As the authors emphasized this kind of analysis is important since quantum computers can in principle simulate quantum physics exponentially faster than their classical counterparts. The authors defined methods for chemical simulation algorithms computationally fast on fault-tolerant quantum computers. The authors discussed some methods for constructing arbitrary gates which perform substantially faster than some circuits. As the authors concluded, for a given approximation error, arbitrary single-qubit gates can be produced fault-tolerantly in an efficient way. On quantum metropolis sampling, see [291]. In this work, the authors analyzed that how a quantum version of the so-called Metropolis algorithm can be implemented on a quantum computer. As the authors stated, the Metropolis algorithm permits to sample directly from the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and thus evades the some problems that crucial in classical simulations. In [292], the authors defined a quantum algorithm for data fitting. As the authors showed, the proposed quantum algorithm can efficiently determine the quality of a least-squares fit over an exponentially large data set. The method is based on the problem of solving systems of linear equations efficiently, which problem was also addressed in [222]. As the authors found, in some cases the algorithm can also efficiently find a concise function that approximates the data to be fitted and bound the approximation error. The authors concluded, in some cases where the input data is a pure quantum state, the algorithm can be used to provide an efficient parametric estimation of the quantum state. As an important practical application of the quantum algorithm with pure state inputs, the authors showed that it can be applied as an alternative to full quantum state tomography given a fault tolerant quantum computer. In [222], the authors defined a quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations. As the authors stated, the problem of solving linear systems of equations can be significantly improved with the help of quantum computations. The authors considered a case where it is not needed to know the solution itself, but rather an approximation of the expectation value of some operator associated with the solution. As the results concluded the proposed quantum algorithm provides an exponential improvement over the best classical algorithm. 5.3. Quantum machine learning Since quantum artificial intelligence and quantum machine learning are emerging fields [2], the study of these protocols has a crucial significance for experimental quantum information processing. In [95] the authors studied the implementation of some basic protocols of quantum reinforcement learning using superconducting quantum circuits. Superconducting quantum circuits are provide an implementable technique for the practical realization of quantum computations and quantum information processing. In this work, the authors defined some scenarios for proof-of-principle experiments using the currently available superconducting circuit technologies. A model for the practical demonstration of the quantum advantages in machine learning in included in [293]. In this work the authors showed that an oracle-based problem (learning parity with noise), can be solved and implemented by a five-qubit superconducting processor. As the authors practically demonstrated that theoretically known results that there is a large gap in query count between the classical and quantum algorithms on a particular oracle. The authors concluded that the achievable gap increased by orders of magnitude as a function of the error rates and the problem size. As the authors have also concluded, complex fault-tolerant architectures needed for experimental universal quantum computing. In [294], the authors studied quantum recommendation systems. As the authors found, the proposed algorithm provides good recommendations by sampling efficiently from an approximation of a preference matrix. Their method does not require the reconstruction of the entire matrix. As the authors concluded, their scheme is the first algorithm for recommendation systems that runs in time polylogarithmic in the dimensions of the matrix and provides an example of a quantum machine learning algorithm for a real world application. In [295], the authors studied a quantum\u2013classical deep learning framework for industrial datasets in near-term devices. The authors defined a hybrid quantum\u2013classical framework with the potential of tackling high-dimensional real-world machine learning datasets on continuous variables. In the proposed scheme, the authors used deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data. As the authors concluded, the proposed model is suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the training of an unsupervised generative model. The authors also proposed an experimental demonstration on a real-world dataset, and illustrated the proposed concept on a quantum annealer. A method for learning thermodynamics with Boltzmann machines (stochastic neural network in machine learning applications) is proposed in [296]. The authors introduced a Boltzmann machine that is capable of modeling thermodynamic observables for physical systems in thermal equilibrium. As a main novelty of the paper, the authors used unsupervised learning to train the Boltzmann machine on data sets constructed with spin configurations. As the authors concluded, the trained Boltzmann machine can be applied to generate spin states. The authors also showed that this machine can faithfully reproduce the observables of a physical system, and that the number of neurons required to obtain accurate results increases as the system is approaches criticality. In [297], the authors studied the estimation methods of effective temperatures in quantum annealers for sampling applications. The work also extended the analysis to some applications in machine learning. The authors introduced a model to overcome the problem of effectively using a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling. Their solution is based on a simple effective-temperature estimation algorithm. The work also provided an analysis on the impacts of the effective temperatures in the learning of a some Boltzmann machines that were embedded on quantum hardware, and defined further algorithmical solutions for the quantum domain. In [298], the authors studied the quantum Boltzmann machine, and showed a new machine learning approach based on quantum Boltzmann distribution. The authors studied the problem of training of quantum Boltzmann machines that is a non-trivial problem. The authors defined bounds on the quantum probabilities that allows us to train it efficiently by sampling. The authors concluded the results with some examples and analyzed the possibility of using quantum annealing processors like D-Wave for the training of a quantum Boltzmann machine. In [299], the authors studied the quantum annealer driven data discovery. The authors defined experiments for quantum annealers and compared the results to the methods of machine learning. The authors studied a binary classifier that utilizes a quantum annealer to produce a more robust class estimator. The authors also provided a detailed discussion of algorithmic constraints and trade-offs imposed by the use of their hardware model. In [161] the authors studied the models of quantum machine learning that requires no quantum measurements. The authors defined a quantum machine learning algorithm for efficiently solving a class of problems encoded in unitary operations. In the proposed model, an iteration process is defined that uses a quantum time-delayed equation for dynamics feedback such that the method requires no the implementation of quantum measurements. As the paper concluded, the application of time-delayed equations significantly can enhance some methods in experimental quantum machine learning. In [300], the authors studied the methods of quantum-enhanced machine learning. The authors defined an approach for the application of machine learning in quantum information processing. The authors also revealed that it is possible to achieve quadratic improvements in learning efficiency via the model. They also showed that the model makes possible to achieve exponential improvements in performance over limited time periods. As a general conclusion of the paper, the model is well-applicable for a broad class of learning problems in quantum information processing. In [301], the authors studied a fast machine-learning online optimization scheme for of ultra-cold-atom experiments. The authors defined an online optimization algorithm based on Gaussian processes and applied it to optimization of the production of Bose\u2013Einstein condensates (BEC). They utilized the fundaments of machine learning to build up a statistical model of some parameters that are connected to the condensates. They also showed that the internal model developed can be used to determine which parameters are essential in BEC creation which results are particularly convenient for an experimental setting. In [302], the authors studied quantum algorithms for supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Their analysis provides algorithms for cluster assignment and cluster finding. The results are particularly important for quantum artificial intelligence, since Quantum machine learning can provide exponential speed-up over classical learning algorithms. 5.4. Optimization problems A study on the theory of variational hybrid quantum\u2013classical algorithms can be found in [303]. In this paper the authors extended the general theory of the quantum\u2013classical hybrid optimization algorithm using the framework of the so-called \u201cquantum variational eigensolver\u201d algorithm. The authors suggested algorithmic improvements for practical implementations, and introduced the quantum variational error suppression method that makes possible to suppress the errors in the quantum devices. The paper also defined a method for free optimization techniques, and it concluded that these solutions can reduce the computational costs up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques. A prediction method by linear regression on a quantum computer is studied in [304]. The proposed algorithm of the authors is based on a linear regression model with least squares optimization. As the authors concluded, the results can be accessed via a single qubit measurement, and the runtime is logarithmic in the dimension of the input space. In [305], the authors defined genetic algorithms to enhance the versatility of digital quantum simulations. The authors found, that genetic algorithms can be used to increase the fidelity of quantum states, and to optimize the resource requirements of some digital quantum simulation protocols. The authors demonstrated the results via a modular gate made out of imperfect quantum gates. In [306], the authors defined a quantum support vector machine for big data classification. As the authors found, the support vector machine (an optimized binary classifier) can be implemented on a quantum computer. As they showed, the complexity of the quantum algorithm is logarithmic in the size of the vectors and the number of training examples. As they concluded, the quantum algorithm in some cases (if classical sampling algorithms require polynomial time) achieves an exponential speed-up compared to the classical algorithms. In [307], the authors studied the Solovay\u2013Kitaev algorithm and its optimization in quantum computations. As the authors emphasized, the Solovay\u2013Kitaev algorithm is a useful tool for the approximation of arbitrary single-qubit gates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. The authors defined the so-called \u201csearch space expansion\u201d approach to modify the initial stage of the algorithm. As the authors found, after some steps the algorithm allows to reduce the requirements of quantum error correction for quantum algorithms in experimental quantum computations.

We report on a remarkable evolution of the field, where decoherence\u2014one of the main challenges for realizing quantum computers\u2014no longer seems to be the stumbling block it had originally been considered. General concepts, relevant quantities, and basic requirements for spin-based quantum computing are explained; opportunities and challenges of spin-orbit interaction and nuclear spins are reviewed. We discuss recent achievements, present current theoretical proposals, and make several suggestions for further experiments. Keywords quantum computer, spin qubit, quantum dot, decoherence, spin-orbit interaction, nuclear spins   1.\u2002 INTRODUCTION  The concept of entanglement and nonlocality (1), one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics, has been heavily debated since the early days of the field (2). By now, there is abundant experimental evidence (3) that Nature indeed does possess nonlocal aspects, in stark contrast to our everyday-life experience. But it was only relatively recently (4), when Richard Feynman (5, 6), David Deutsch (7), and other researchers in the 1980s, envisioned the idea of exploiting the quantum degrees of freedom for a novel way of information processing. The central questions then were whether and how it is possible to efficiently simulate any finite physical system with a man-made machine. Deutsch argued that such a simulation is not possible perfectly within the classical computational framework that had been developed for decades (7). Instead, the universal computing machine should be of a quantum nature, i.e., a quantum computer. Since then, progress in different areas of research and industry has tremendously influenced the advent of quantum computing. First, the booming computer industry led to major progress in semiconductor, nano-, and laser technology, a prerequisite for the fabrication, addressing, and manipulation of single quantum systems needed in an experimental realization. Second, several algorithms have been developed, such as those by Deutsch (7, 8), Grover (9), and Shor (10, 11), which clearly illustrate that quantum computers, exploiting the existence of entanglement, can solve problems much faster than classical computers. A recent review on using quantum computers for quantum simulations can be found in Reference 12. In addition, the theories of quantum complexity and entanglement are currently being established, a process that is still far from complete. The emerging fields of nano- and quantum information science have inspired and motivated each other in various ways. Shortly after the first quantum algorithms were developed, setups were suggested to turn quantum computing into reality. These ideas, among others, are based on quantum dots (QDs) (13, 14), cold trapped ions (15), cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) (14, 16), bulk nuclear magnetic resonance (17), low-capacitance Josephson junctions (18), donor atoms (19, 20), linear optics (21), molecular magnets (22), spin clusters (23), or color centers in diamond (24\u201326). Many interesting results have followed, some of which are reviewed here. In 1997, encoding quantum information in the spin states of QDs was proposed (13). The tunnel barrier between neighboring dots, which can be varied via gates (see Figure 1 ), induces time-dependent electron-electron interactions and affects the spin states via the Heisenberg exchange coupling. The proposal demonstrates theoretically that such a setup allows for universal and scalable quantum computing, controllable by purely electrical means at ultrahigh clock speed. Here, we particularly focus on the experimental and theoretical achievements following Reference 13 because substantial progress in this field has been made within the past few years. An overview on recent results in other setups can be found in, e.g., Reference 27, where different qubit platforms are also compared to each other. For previous reviews, see References 4, 28, and 29. Figure 1 Basic scheme for the physical implementation of a quantum computer as proposed in Reference 13. (a) The qubits are encoded in the single-electron spin states of quantum dots (QDs), where the barrier between adjacent QDs is controllable via electric gates. When the barrier is reduced, the electron wave functions overlap and the spins S L and S R (here in units of \u210f) interact via the Heisenberg exchange coupling J(t) S L \u22c5 S R , where J(t) is a function of gate voltage and corresponds to the energy splitting of the spin singlet and triplet states. This allows for electrically controlled two-qubit gates with fast operation times (13). (b) A QD array based on panel a, where the qubits in the two right dots are coupled while the others are decoupled. Rotations of individual spins may be achieved by pulling the desired electron down into a region of high magnetization or high g factor via back gates, such that the Zeeman splitting and, hence, the resonance condition changes for this electron in the presence of a static magnetic field B \u22a5. A resonantly applied oscillating magnetic field pulse then rotates the addressed qubit (electron spin resonance, ESR) while all others remain unaffected due to off-resonance. Exploiting spin-orbit interaction, the rotations may also be driven fully electrically via electric-dipole-induced spin resonance (EDSR). For details on ESR and EDSR, see Section 3.1.1. Alternatively, fast single-qubit gates may be implemented via exchange-controlled spin rotations (13, 198). The combination of single- and two-qubit gates results in a universal set of quantum gates, so that the proposed schemes allow for fast and purely electrically controlled quantum computation with electron spins in QDs (13).

In Section 2, we introduce the three QD systems discussed in this review: self-assembled QDs, lateral QDs, and nanowire-based QDs. We also comment on basic requirements for quantum computation and define the spin lifetimes T 1, T 2, and . Spin-orbit interaction and nuclear spins are covered in Section 3. These present an undesired (noise) source of relaxation and decoherence for the spin qubits on the one hand, but on the other hand allow for all-electrical spin manipulation via electric-dipole-induced spin resonance or for strong (effective) magnetic field gradients. In Section 4, recent progress in these QD systems is summarized, compared, and discussed. Newly proposed architectures for long-distance qubit-qubit coupling are reviewed in Section 5, followed by our summary and final remarks in Section 6.  2.\u2002 PROMISING QUANTUM DOT STRUCTURES, DEFINITION OF LIFETIMES, AND ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS  QDs confine electrons or holes (missing valence band electrons) in all three dimensions, on length scales which are comparable to the wavelengths of the particles, i.e., typically \u223c10\u2013100 nm in each spatial direction. There are many possibilities to realize such confinement, which is evident from the variety of systems under study. In this report, we mainly focus on three of them. The first category is self-assembled QDs. These form naturally during growth, where InGaAs dots within a GaAs matrix are commonly used examples. When InGaAs is grown on GaAs (Stranski-Krastanov mode), islands form spontaneously, due to the mismatch in the lattice constants, after a small critical thickness of only a few monolayers is reached. These may then be covered with further layers of GaAs. Such QDs are typically lens shaped, with heights of \u223c5 nm (growth direction) and diameters \u223c20 nm, and confinement results from the difference in the conduction and valence band edges of the involved materials. Alternatively, interface fluctuation QDs arise from monolayer fluctuations in thin quantum wells, typically resulting in GaAs dots within AlGaAs (30). The second category, lateral QDs, is based on two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) and two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs), which exist in heterostructures from materials with suitable band properties and additional dopants. For instance, AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures are routinely used to form 2DEGs and 2DHGs within GaAs, which are strongly confined along the growth direction. Lithographically defined gate electrodes on the sample surface also allow confinement in the transverse directions, leading to quasi-2D QDs of \u223c100 nm in diameter. The orbital parts of the wave functions play an important role for lateral QDs and have been studied in great detail in References 31, 32. Finally, semiconductor nanowires naturally provide confinement in two dimensions, due to their small diameters of \u223c10\u2013100 nm, and repulsive forces along the wire may again be added via nearby gates or additional layers of barrier material. We note that several other QD implementations exist, which, however, for space reasons we do not discuss. Prominent examples are colloidal QDs (33, 34) and QDs in carbon-based systems, like graphene (35) or carbon nanotubes (36, 37), which are highly attractive for implementing spin qubits. Any setup considered for quantum computation should fulfill a list of essential criteria, such as scalability and the ability to initialize the system in a fiducial state (38). For quantum error correction schemes to be applicable, it is important that the lifetimes are much longer than the gate operation times. A decade ago, this was considered a very serious challenge, but to a great extent, this problem has now been overcome in QDs as discussed in Section 4. Three timescales are of interest in this context, which we illustrate in terms of the electron spin qubit states |\u2191\u232a and |\u2193\u232a, assuming that these are eigenstates of the Pauli operator \u03c3 z with energy difference \u0394. First, the relaxation time T 1 describes transitions |\u2191\u232a \u2192 |\u2193\u232a due to interactions with the environment, such as the lattice, which leads to relaxation from the excited |\u2191\u232a to the ground state |\u2193\u232a. A typical measure for T 1 is \u2329\u03c3 z \u232a(t) with initial state |\u2191\u232a. Second, the decoherence time T 2 quantifies the decay of quantum mechanical superpositions and accounts for transitions of type |\u2191\u232a + |\u2193\u232a \u2192 {|\u2193\u232a, |\u2191\u232a} induced by the environment ( Figure 2 , inset). When the state is initially , an eigenstate of \u03c3 x , a typical measure for T 2 is the envelope function of \u2329\u03c3 x \u232a(t). We note that \u2329\u03c3 x \u232a(t) oscillates between \u00b11 at angular frequency \u0394/\u210f for a perfectly isolated system, but decays to 0 as the state turns into either |\u2191\u232a or |\u2193\u232a because \u2329\u2191| \u03c3 x |\u2191\u232a = \u2329\u2193| \u03c3 x |\u2193\u232a = 0. The envelope function itself may be referred to as |\u2329\u03c3 +\u232a|(t) = |\u2329\u03c3 x \u232a(t) + i\u2329\u03c3 y \u232a(t)|. Finally, in practice it is generally required to average over an ensemble, rather than to measure a single system only. The averaged |\u2329\u03c3 +\u232a|(t) often decays faster than in each individual case because the oscillation frequencies may be slightly different from system to system (i.e., small deviations in \u0394), which leads to destructive interference and additional damping. The so-called dephasing time obtained from an ensemble measurement is therefore labeled . The three timescales T 1, T 2, and are not completely unrelated. For spin qubits in QDs, where decoherence predominantly results from spin-orbit interaction [T 2 = 2T 1 (39, 40); Section 3.1.2] and hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins (T 2 \u226a T 1; Section 3.2), one finds that T 2 \u2264 2T 1 and usually and T 2 \u226a T 1 in practice. Commenting on the terminology, the relaxation (T 1), decoherence (T 2), and dephasing times are only well defined when \u2329\u03c3 z \u232a or |\u2329\u03c3 +\u232a|, respectively, decay exponentially, which is the assumed behavior in most quantum error correction schemes. Strictly speaking, one should therefore avoid these terms when the longitudinal or transverse decay is of a nonexponential form. We note, however, that the introduced nomenclature is often used to characterize any decaying behavior for convenience. Figure 2 Schematic decay of |\u2329\u03c3 +\u232a|(t) for a quantum dot electron with large Zeeman splitting, assuming that the nuclear spin bath has been prepared in a narrowed state and that echo pulses are absent. The sketch illustrates the variety of decay laws that the system proceeds through. We note that the initial quadratic decay occurs on an ultrashort timescale, while an additional quadratic shoulder appears at the transition from the power law to the exponential loss of coherence. Details can be found in References 81\u201383, 87\u201389. (Inset) Decoherence corresponds to the decay of quantum mechanical superpositions due to interaction with the environment. For the prominent example of an electron spin qubit with eigenstates |\u2191\u232a, |\u2193\u232a, decoherence refers to transitions of type \u201c|\u2191\u232a and |\u2193\u232a\u201d \u2192 \u201ceither |\u2191\u232a or |\u2193\u232a\u201d and can be quantified by the time decay of the transverse spin |\u2329\u03c3 +\u232a|(t) as described in Section 2.

Click to view Download as PowerPoint   A key criterion for building quantum computers, the one which actually justifies their name, is the presence of a universal set of quantum gates. This may fortunately be realized with one- and two-body interactions only, because any operation can be carried out as a sequence of one- and two-qubit gates. In fact, the implementation of single-qubit rotations for each element, along with only one type of entangling two-qubit gates, e.g., or CNOT, between neighboring qubits would be sufficient for universal quantum computation (38, 41). We note in passing that entanglement of spin qubits can be created in many different ways and over long distances, for instance, by extracting and separating Cooper pairs from an s-wave superconductor as proposed in Reference 42 and experimentally investigated recently in References 43\u201346. Nuclear spins and spin-orbit interaction, which present an undesired source of decoherence on the one hand, may prove useful for implementing qubit gates on the other hand, and both mechanisms are analyzed in more detail in the next section.  3.\u2002 SPIN-ORBIT INTERACTION AND NUCLEAR SPINS IN QUANTUM DOTS  3.1.\u2002  Spin-Orbit Interaction Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) couples the orbital motion of a charge to its spin. Prime examples are relativistic effects of type l \u22c5 s, which can be derived from the Dirac equation, where l and s = \u210f \u03c3/2 correspond to the orbital and spin angular momentum of the electron, respectively (47). The operator l \u22c5 s is invariant under time reversal and parity transformations (spatial inversion) and commutes with both (l + s)2 and l z + s z . As a consequence, due to Bloch functions of p- as opposed to s-type, SOI leads to interesting properties in the topmost valence band, which can be described mathematically in terms of an effective spin 3/2 (48, 49). In the presence of inversion asymmetry, additional terms that do not conserve parity arise for the envelope function of electron and hole states. Based on the type of asymmetry, two important SOI mechanisms can be distinguished here. Rashba SOI results from structural inversion asymmetry and, for electrons, is typically of the form H R \u221d E eff \u22c5 (\u03c3 \u00d7 p), where the components \u03c3 i are the Pauli matrices for spin 1/2, p is the momentum operator, and E eff is an effective electric field determined by the system structure (48, 50). Dresselhaus SOI is present in materials that lack bulk inversion symmetry, such as InAs or GaAs, and is of the form , where x\u2032, y\u2032, and z\u2032 correspond to the crystallographic directions [100], [010], and [001], respectively (48, 51). For quasi-2D systems, the Hamiltonians H R and H D can be reduced further. For strong confinement along the z direction, the Rashba term simplifies to H R = \u03b1 (p x \u03c3 y \u2212 p y \u03c3 x ) with Rashba parameter \u03b1. The resulting form of the Dresselhaus term strongly depends on the growth direction. For the z axis chosen along the confinement direction, one can substitute p z \u2192 \u2329p z \u232a = 0, , and all other terms can be neglected because of their smallness compared to terms (52). For example, for z || [100] one obtains H D = \u03b2 (p y \u03c3 y \u2212 p x \u03c3 x ), while for z || [110] the spin projection along the confinement direction is conserved, H D \u221d p x \u03c3 z . Both these Hamiltonians vary under rotations of the coordinate system about the z axis, so that their exact form is determined by the relative orientation of coordinate and crystal axes. This is different for z || [111], where the effective Dresselhaus term is H D \u221d p x \u03c3 y \u2212 p y \u03c3 x , which moreover corresponds exactly to the form of the Rashba term. Therefore, Rashba and Dresselhaus SOI can cancel in lowest order for growth along the [111] direction (53). We note that the presence of SOI results in small, but finite, anisotropic corrections to the Heisenberg exchange interaction of electron spins, thus affecting the fidelity of quantum gates based on isotropic exchange. Fortunately, strategies have been developed with which the SOI-induced gate errors can be strongly suppressed (54\u201356). In general, gate errors can be reduced from first to second (or higher) order in SOI when the coupling strength J(t) is varied symmetrically in time, followed by additional qubit rotations (54, 56). In particular, the anisotropic corrections can be cancelled completely in the CNOT gate construction of Reference 13 when the system is pulsed such that the anisotropic terms are linear in J(t) (55). Additional errors caused by dipole-dipole interactions were found to be negligible for CNOT (in typical situations) (55). 3.1.1.\u2002  Electric-dipole-induced spin resonance. A rather useful technique for electrically controlled qubit rotations is electric-dipole-induced spin resonance (EDSR). It is closely related to the well-known electron spin resonance (ESR), which we therefore review first. For this, let us consider an electron in a QD in the presence of magnetic fields. The Hamiltonian H = H 0 + H Z consists of a spin-independent part H 0 = p 2/(2m*) + V(r), where the first (second) term corresponds to the kinetic (potential) energy, and the Zeeman part H Z = g\u03bc B B \u22c5 \u03c3/2, which couples the magnetic field B to the spin. In the following, we assume that a constant magnetic field B z is applied along the z axis, while a small oscillating field B x (t) = B \u22a5 cos(\u03c9t), B \u22a5 < B z , is applied along the x axis. For any fixed orbital state |n\u232a, with H 0 |n\u232a = E n |n\u232a, the time evolution of the spin is described by the (von Neumann) master equation for the density matrix \u03c1, 1.  2.  where we defined \u210f\u03c9 z \u2261 g\u03bc B B z , \u210f\u03c9 \u22a5 \u2261 g\u03bc B B \u22a5, and the states of the matrices correspond to {|n, \u2191\u232a, |n, \u2193\u232a} \u2261 {|\u2191\u232a, |\u2193\u232a}. When \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9 z , the final term of the chosen representation of \u03c3 x cos(\u03c9t), Equation 2, can be omitted because it only superimposes a fast and negligibly small oscillation to the dynamics. Within this rotating wave approximation, the resulting set of differential equations is exactly solvable. When the spin is originally in the |\u2191\u232a state and the oscillating field is applied for t \u2265 0, the probability p\u2193 of a spin flip oscillates according to 3.  where \u03b4 \u2261 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 z is the detuning from the resonance condition \u03c9 = \u03c9 z , and is the cycle duration. We note that the resulting spin-flip probability is completely equivalent to Equation 3 when the spin is initially down. Remarkably, in the presence of SOI one finds that an oscillating electric field E(t) = E 0 cos(\u03c9t) leads to an effective magnetic field b 0 cos(\u03c9t) with, in general, nonzero components perpendicular to the static magnetic field. Hence, spin rotations can efficiently be driven by purely electrical means (EDSR). This may be achieved by applying ac voltages to nearby gates, at frequencies that are in resonance with the Zeeman splitting, as recently exploited in experiments on nanowire-based InAs and InSb QDs (57\u201360). Explicit expressions for b 0 are lengthy, and in the following we therefore comment on important properties found in an analysis for lateral QDs with growth axis z || [100] and harmonic confinement in the x-y plane (61). First, in contrast to ESR, the EDSR arises from coupling to other orbital states and therefore depends on the level spacing. This can easily be seen, because \u2329\u2191| x |\u2193\u232a, \u2329\u2191| y |\u2193\u232a, \u2329n| p x |n\u232a, and \u2329n|p y |n\u232a vanish, so that neither the dipolar term e E(t) \u22c5 r nor H R or H D couples the spin states in lowest order. A unitary Schrieffer-Wolff transformation shows that the leading term for EDSR is a combination of Zeeman coupling and SOI. More precisely, the effective magnetic field in the ground state is \u221d B 0 \u00d7 \u03a9(t), where B 0 is the static magnetic field and \u03a9(t) = \u03a9 0 cos(\u03c9t) depends linearly on the electric field components in the x-y plane and the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 (61). We note that the resulting magnetic field is fully transverse and therefore most efficient. It can be quenched if B 0 || \u03a9 0. For typical GaAs QDs, EDSR allows spin manipulation on a timescale of 10 ns with the current experimental setups (61). Numerical studies based on single electrons in 1D double quantum dots (DQDs) revealed rather unexpected spin dynamics at large driving field amplitudes, such as incomplete spin flips and surprisingly long cycle durations at resonance, pointing out possible challenges for future applications of EDSR in DQDs (62). An analysis for heavy-hole (HH) QDs can be found in Reference 63. 3.1.2.\u2002  Relaxation and decoherence. SOI and hyperfine interaction (Section 3.2) are the dominant decay channels for spin qubits. In particular, Rashba and Dresselhaus SOI lead to spin relaxation in combination with the phonon field, whereas other relaxation processes are usually negligible (39, 40, 64\u201367). For electrons in [100]-grown 2D QDs it has been calculated that this phonon-mediated mechanism results in relaxation times T 1 \u221d (\u210f\u03c9 0)4/(g\u03bc B B)5 at low temperatures, where g\u03bc B B is the Zeeman splitting induced by a magnetic field B, and \u210f\u03c9 0 is the orbital level spacing (64). For moderate magnetic fields, this dependence agrees very well with experimental results (52, 68\u201370). As the magnetic fields become very large, the wavelengths of the phonons with energy g\u03bc B B eventually become much smaller than the size of the QD; i.e., the phonon-induced effects average out when integrating over the electron wave function and T 1 increases rather than decreases (39). Maximal relaxation rates are usually observed when the phonon wavelength matches the dot size (52). In the other limit, for very small magnetic fields, the derived expression for T 1 diverges. This is because the above theory focuses on single-phonon processes, so that only phonons in resonance with the Zeeman transition can contribute. Kramers\u2019 theorem forbids SOI-induced spin relaxation in the absence of a magnetic field (52, 64), which is also the reason why EDSR requires the presence of a finite magnetic field. When two-phonon processes are included, T 1 converges to a finite value (64, 71, 72). Holes are an attractive alternative to electrons because of the suppressed contact hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins (see subsection below). Phonon-mediated spin relaxation has also been analyzed in detail for flat [100]-grown HH QDs with magnetic fields along the confinement axis (40). For low magnetic fields, one finds T 1 \u221d B \u22125 due to Dresselhaus SOI, which is the same dependence as in the electron case, while the contribution due to Rashba SOI is T 1 \u221d B \u22129. The analysis shows that the spin relaxation time for HHs can be comparable to or even longer than that for electrons when the QD is strongly 2D, illustrating that holes are very sensitive to confinement (40). For instance, T 1 > 0.2 ms has been measured for HHs in self-assembled InGaAs QDs (73\u201375). In the limit B \u2192 0, the relaxation times are determined by two-phonon processes. These have been included theoretically (72), suggesting times T 1 on the order of milliseconds, in good agreement with values observed in experiments (74, 75). Notably, the upper limit T 2 = 2T 1 is fulfilled in both the electron (39) and the hole (40) cases discussed above, in contrast to the naively expected relation T 2 \u226a T 1. Furthermore, theory predicts that electron spin relaxation is drastically suppressed for a certain magnetic field direction when |\u03b1| = |\u03b2 | in [100]-grown QDs (39). [In passing, we note that in this special limit, a new symmetry in spin space emerges giving rise to interesting spintronics effects in quasi-2D systems (76, 77).] Tuning the Rashba coefficient via electric fields, this effect should be observable in an experiment with a vector magnet. The analysis of SOI-mediated relaxation has been extended to QDs with two electrons, forming spin singlet and triplet states, where magnetic field orientations with strongly suppressed spin relaxation were found to exist for arbitrary Rashba and Dresselhaus coefficients (67). The (relative) strengths of \u03b1 and \u03b2 may be found via the singlet-triplet anticrossings for magnetic fields applied in growth direction, or by measuring the magic angles at which the singlet-triplet anticrossings and thus the corresponding singlet-triplet relaxations vanish in leading order of the SOI (67, 78). Recently, a formula has been derived for lateral DQDs, which quantifies the level splitting at the singlet-triplet anticrossing in terms of various parameters (79). This formula should allow the extraction of both the spin-orbit parameters and also the hyperfine coupling from transport or charge-sensing experiments in such DQDs (79). Effects of hyperfine interaction are discussed below. 3.2.\u2002  Nuclear Spins A QD typically consists of 104\u2013106 atoms, so that an electron or hole confined to the QD overlaps with a large number of nuclear spins. The nuclear spin bath itself reveals large lifetimes, indicated by the long dipole-dipole correlation time among nuclear spins, \u223c0.1 ms in GaAs (80, 81). (Since the dipole-dipole interaction, resulting from the finite magnetic dipole moments of the nuclei, does not conserve spin, the dipole-dipole correlation time can be interpreted as the time it takes for a nuclear spin to flip in the mean field of the surrounding ones.) Despite its long lifetimes, the nuclear spin ensemble presents the main source of electron and hole spin decoherence. This is due to the hyperfine interaction among electron and nuclear spins, for which three different mechanisms can be derived from the Dirac equation (82). The first one is the (isotropic) contact hyperfine interaction, which is the most relevant mechanism for conduction band electrons. For holes, where the Bloch functions are p- as opposed to s-type, the anisotropic hyperfine interaction and coupling to the orbital angular momentum become dominant. Below we summarize the effects and opportunities of a nuclear spin bath in more detail, beginning with a theoretical investigation in Sections 3.2.1\u20133.2.2 and ending with a brief overview on experimental achievements in Section 3.2.3. 3.2.1.\u2002  Electron spin decoherence. When we assume that the external magnetic field, if present, is oriented along the z axis, the Hamiltonian of an electron spin \u210f \u03c3/2 coupled to a bath of nuclear spins \u210f I k reads 4.  where \u03c3 = (\u03c3 x , \u03c3 y , \u03c3 z ) is the vector of spin-1/2 Pauli matrices, g is the effective electron g factor, B z is the external magnetic field, the A k (positive for In, Ga, As) are the contact hyperfine coupling coefficients, and and \u03c3 \u00b1 = \u03c3 x \u00b1 i \u03c3 y are the raising and lowering operators for nuclear and electron spin, respectively (82, 83). The effects of the nuclear spins on an electron spin in a QD can thus be described in terms of an effective magnetic field , referred to as the Overhauser field. Its component along the z axis changes the total Zeeman splitting by the Overhauser shift, while transverse components couple the spin states |\u2191\u232a and |\u2193\u232a through electron-nuclear-spin flip-flop processes (83). To avoid confusion, we mention that the term Overhauser field is often used for both the 3D effective nuclear magnetic field and its component . The largest possible value for , obtained for a fully polarized bath, is , where A is the averaged effective hyperfine coupling constant and I is the (average) quantum number for the nuclear spin. For GaAs, A \u2248 90 \u03bceV and I = 3/2, thus for the bulk g factor \u22120.44, and we note that is independent of the dot size (82, 83). Without further preparation, the N nuclear spins inside a QD are in a superposition of states with different fields , statistically distributed around a mean value , where \u22121 \u2264 p \u2264 1 is the nuclear spin polarization along the z axis. Unless |p| \u2192 1, the width of this distribution is on the order of , i.e., a few (tens of) millitesla for typical GaAs QDs of \u223c104\u2013106 nuclear spins (84\u201386). These internal fluctuations lead to dephasing and reduce the electron spin coherence time in GaAs dots to a few nanoseconds only (81\u201386). The associated decay of the transverse spin is Gaussian and the decay time scales when I = 1/2 and homogeneous coupling are assumed for simplicity (81). One possibility for prolonging the lifetimes, apart from increasing the dot size, is therefore to polarize the nuclear spins (31, 81, 84, 85), which is discussed in more detail in Section 3.2.3. However, referring to the factor obtained for I = 1/2, |p| > 0.99 is required to reduce the decoherence by a factor of ten. A second, attractive approach that has been theoretically proposed (81) for lifetime prolongation is to narrow the intrinsic distribution for |p| < 1. When the nuclear spin bath is initially in a less noisy, narrowed state, the electron spin decoherence induced by the finite width of possible is suppressed. In particular, this dephasing mechanism is overcome when the system is initially in an eigenstate to a field In this case, the decoherence time is no longer , but \u221d N, so that the coherence times can be increased by several orders of magnitude (81\u201385, 87, 88). The decay dynamics clearly differ from the Gaussian behavior that results from internal dephasing. In fact, an entire zoo of decoherence laws has been found, with a time decay that can proceed through several different stages (see Figure 2 ) (89). The reason for this feature is a rather long bath correlation time of order \u210fN/A (82\u201385). The dynamics of the isolated electron spin interacting with the nuclear bath are therefore history-dependent (non-Markovian), and a Markov approximation, for which the longitudinal and transverse spin components decay exponentially, is typically invalid. On timescales <0.1 ms, where the dipolar coupling among nuclear spins can be ignored, this non-Markovian decay has been analyzed in great detail, and we list a few key results below. Assuming that the externally induced Zeeman splitting is large, such that |g\u03bc B B z | > A for I of order unity, i.e., |B z | \u2273 3.5 T for GaAs, direct electron spin flips are energetically forbidden, which gives rise to pure dephasing of the electron spin (87). Under these conditions (perturbative approach possible), the various stages that the transverse electron spin dynamics pass through have been calculated with one unified and systematic method based on expansion of a generalized master equation (81\u201383, 87, 88). These stages include an ultrashort quadratic decay and an initial (partial) power-law decay, followed by a quadratic shoulder, a dominant exponential decay, and a long-time power-law decay. However, the exact behavior depends on various parameters, such as the QD dimensionality (83, 87). The Markovian regime, which gives rise to the exponential decay, is reached for sufficiently large B z , and analytic expressions for the decoherence time have been found (82, 87, 88, 90). This analysis was also of interest from a technical point of view, because it verified that calculations based on high-order expansions of a leading-order effective Hamiltonian can have limited validity. In particular, a notable modulation of the decay envelope found at long times cannot be obtained with an effective Hamiltonian (see Reference 87 and references therein). Observing these additional oscillations experimentally would be a desirable confirmation of the theory. At low magnetic fields, an expansion of the generalized master equation is not possible, and the spin dynamics still are not understood in detail. A list of available approaches allowing for some insight into the low-field regime can be found in References 83, 91. For instance, the system is exactly solvable in the special case when the nuclear spin bath is initially fully aligned (84, 85). Independently of B z , it turns out that both \u2329\u03c3 z \u232a(t) and |\u2329\u03c3 +\u232a|(t) first perform small oscillations owing to coherent exchange with the nuclear spin bath. After the bath correlation time of order \u210fN/A, electron spin coherence is irreversibly lost and the spin components converge to constant values, slightly below the initial values only, where the system remains until dipole-dipole interactions among the nuclear spins become relevant (84, 85). For B z = 0, assuming a Gaussian envelope wave function, this asymptotic time decay evolves according to ln\u22123/2(t\u2032) and ln\u22121(t\u2032) for 3D and 2D QDs, respectively, where t\u2032 \u221d tA/N. At large B z , this decay is \u221d (t\u2032)\u22123/2 and \u221d (t\u2032)\u22121 in 3D and 2D dots, respectively, in agreement with the systematic solutions of the generalized master equation (81, 84, 85). 3.2.2.\u2002  Hole spin decoherence. The spin dynamics have also been investigated for HHs in quasi-2D QDs (82, 92\u201394). Assuming the strong confinement along the z axis, we recall that the states can be classified according to their angular momenta (effective spins) |J, m J \u232a, where J quantifies the size and m J \u2208 {\u2212J, \u2212J + 1, \u2026, J} is the z-projection in units of \u210f. This results from the strong SOI in the valence band, coupling the electron spin to the p-type Bloch functions. HHs have |3/2, \u00b13/2\u232a, whereas light-hole (LH) states have |3/2, \u00b11/2\u232a, and the two bands are energetically well separated in 2D-like QDs. Even though the contact hyperfine term is absent, the remaining mechanisms, i.e., anisotropic hyperfine interaction and coupling to the orbital angular momentum, turn out to be rather strong\u2014in typical III-V compounds, they are only one order of magnitude weaker than the contact hyperfine interaction for electrons (92, 95\u201398). Remarkably, the coupling of the HH to the nuclear spin bath takes on a simple Ising form in leading order, , where is the coupling to the kth nucleus, denotes the z component of the kth nuclear spin in units of \u210f, and s z is the HH pseudospin operator with eigenvalues s z = \u00b11/2 for m J = \u00b13/2 (92, 94). This clearly differs from the Heisenberg-type contact hyperfine interaction (Equation 4) because transverse components are basically absent in the case of holes. As for electrons, one can distinguish between different initial configurations. In the case of an unprepared, inhomogeneously broadened nuclear spin bath, the transverse hole spin decay depends on the orientation of the external magnetic field B. For zero field or B || z, dephasing results in a Gaussian time decay, as for electrons, with timescales of typically a few tens of nanoseconds (92). However, due to the Ising-type rather than Heisenberg-type HH-nuclear-spin interaction, the situation changes drastically for an in-plane magnetic field B || x. Because the hyperfine fluctuations are now purely perpendicular to the applied field, the decay is no longer Gaussian and one finds instead that the transverse hole spin decays at long times in the limit , where E Z,x = |g x \u03bc B B| is the externally induced Zeeman splitting, g x is the in-plane HH g factor, and is the variance of the nuclear field (82, 92). For typical GaAs QDs and magnetic fields of a few Tesla, the associated decay times are long, around tens of microseconds (92). Only a few months after these calculations were published, an experiment on self-assembled InGaAs QDs with B || x confirmed that HH spins in 2D-like QDs are highly coherent, with with \u223c40% probability) reported for the setup under study (75, 99). For applications that require large Zeeman splittings, an in-plane magnetic field may be inconvenient because g x is usually much smaller than the HH g factor g z along the axis of strong confinement. Long coherence times for B || z can be achieved as well, namely by preparing the nuclear spin bath in a narrowed state (93, 94). When the nuclear spins are initially in an eigenstate of , with B || z, decoherence can only result from additional transverse terms in the HH-nuclear-spin coupling which then allow for flip-flop processes. These additional terms mainly arise from coupling to neighboring bands, i.e., the conduction band, LH band, and split-off band, and are about one to two orders of magnitude weaker than the dominant Ising term (93, 94). It turns out that the time decay of the transverse spin due to band hybridization is purely exponential and that the decoherence time T 2 can be tuned over several orders of magnitude via the applied magnetic field. In fact, decoherence due to nuclear spins can be so strongly suppressed that other mechanisms, such as the dipole-dipole interaction or the coupling to the phonon bath, may take over as the dominant sources of transverse spin decay (93, 94). Calculations on self-assembled QDs showed that the Ising-like form of the hyperfine coupling is preserved for realistic strain distributions (94). The strain considerably affects the hyperfine-induced hole spin decoherence, largely through coupling to the conduction band, allowing tuning of T 2 by an order of magnitude for fixed Zeeman splittings (94). 3.2.3.\u2002  Distribution narrowing and dynamic nuclear polarization. As summarized above, the electron and hole spin decoherence induced by nuclear spins can be strongly suppressed when the nuclear spin bath is initialized in a narrowed state. Moreover, the effective nuclear magnetic field, up to \u223c\u00b15 T for electrons in GaAs QDs, allows the realization of large magnetic field gradients among neighboring QDs (100) and tuning the resonance energies in optically active QDs over several tens of microelectronvolts (101\u2013104). Therefore, nuclear spins are more and more considered a source of opportunity rather than trouble, leading to enormous experimental efforts in this field. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) schemes are usually based on the isotropic contact hyperfine interaction among electron spin and nuclear spins. As illustrated in Section 3.2.1, Equation 4, the transverse components of the Overhauser field allow the polarization of the nuclei via electron-nuclear-spin flip-flop processes, building up a large nuclear field with maximum Overhauser shift . An example for DNP via the hole spin can be found in Reference 105. DNP has been achieved experimentally by multiple forms of optical (101\u2013112), electrical (100, 113\u2013117), and magnetic (118, 119) driving, although it is impossible to completely list the large variety of approaches. Polarizations 50%<|p|<70% have been reported so far (106\u2013108); however, achieving |p| > 90% remains a very challenging task. Interestingly, many DNP schemes feature an intrinsic feedback mechanism that drives the system toward fixed, stable nuclear field values, so that the width of the nuclear field distribution is narrowed at the same time (103\u2013105, 118, 119). Similar effects have been demonstrated using pulsed optical excitation on an ensemble of QDs (120, 121), and it has been shown that efficient feedback loops may also be included intentionally (113). Further promising approaches for the preparation of narrowed states are based on indirect measurement (122\u2013125). We note that all decay properties described earlier in this section correspond to the free-induction decay, i.e., the case where the system evolves in the absence of externally applied control sequences. The dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening can be undone to a large extent by applying spin-echo pulses, which notably increases the spin coherence times (126\u2013132). In parallel, an alternative trend is to bypass the interaction with nuclear spins completely by switching to host materials such as Ge and Si, which can be grown nuclear-spin-free. Examples for both approaches are discussed in the next section, where we review recent progress toward quantum computation with spins in QDs. Finally, we note that an alternative route to reduce the nuclear spin noise (besides narrowing and DNP) would be to polarize the nuclear spins by freezing them out, either by applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field on the order of 15 T at a few millikelvin (133) or by inducing an ordering transition of the nuclear spin system due to Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. The latter phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest in recent years, and we refer the interested reader to the literature (134\u2013137).  4.\u2002 RECENT PROGRESS IN QUANTUM DOT SYSTEMS  Since the first proposals in the 1990s, researchers worldwide have been working hard toward the ambitious goal of implementing a quantum computer. In QDs, seminal progress has been made within the past few years. In this section, we summarize and discuss some of the key results, where we distinguish between self-assembled, lateral, and nanowire-based QDs. Table 1 in this section summarizes relevant information, such as the measured lifetimes, and compares T 2 to reported operation times as commented below.

Information on established schemes for readout and initialization is provided, along with a rating on scalability. All single-qubit operation times correspond to rotations of \u03c0 (about the z and x axis, respectively) on the Bloch sphere. For a qubit with eigenstates |0\u3009 and |1\u3009, \u03c4Z refers to operations of type , whereas \u03c4X refers to rotations of type |0\u3009 \u2192 |1\u3009. Two-qubit gates are characterized by the SWAP time \u03c4SW, describing operations of type |01\u3009 \u2192 |10\u3009. The ratio T2/\u03c4op, where \u03c4op is the longest of the three operation times, gives an estimate for the number of qubit gates the system can be passed through before coherence is lost. Referring to standard error correction schemes, this value should exceed \u223c104 for fault-tolerant quantum computation to be implementable. Using the surface code, values above \u223c102 may already be sufficient. Experiments on self-assembled QDs have predominantly been carried out in (In)GaAs. Unless stated otherwise, GaAs has been the host material for gate-defined QDs in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs). The results listed for nanowire QDs have been achieved in InAs (electrons) and Ge/Si core/shell (holes) nanowires. We note that the experimental conditions, such as externally applied magnetic fields, clearly differ for some of the listed values and schemes. Finally, we wish to emphasize that further improvements might already have been achieved that we were not aware of when writing this review.

Hyperfine-induced. fWhile Reference 127 gets close, we are currently not aware of a Ramsey-type experiment where coherent rotations about the Bloch sphere z axis have explicitly been demonstrated as a function of time. Thus no value is listed. However, \u03c4Z should be short, on the order of 0.1 ns assuming a magnetic field of 1 T and g = \u22120.44 as in bulk GaAs. gFrom Reference 195. SWAP gates for S-T0 qubits have not yet been implemented. We therefore list the duration \u03c4ccpf of a charge-state conditional phase flip. hIn Reference 57, rotations about an arbitrary axis in the x-y plane of the Bloch sphere are reported instead, controlled via the phase of the applied microwave pulse. iFrom Reference 125. rf-QPC: radio-frequency quantum point contact (201, 202). jFrom Reference 199. rf-SQD: radio-frequency sensor quantum dot (194). kFrom Reference 204.

The scheme, operated in the multihole regime, distinguishes the spin triplet states from the spin singlet. pFrom Reference 126. Information about the nuclear field is required for the electronic ground state to be known. Quantum systems are sensitive, and errors inevitably occur in any realistic device. Therefore, schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computing have been developed, where errors can automatically be corrected as long as they occur with low enough probability. The latter condition can usually be quantified in terms of a threshold rate (138\u2013140). For instance, standard error correction schemes require that at least \u223c104 gate operations be carried out within the decoherence time of a qubit (138\u2013143). A few years ago, a novel scheme derived from the toric code (144) was presented, referred to as the planar code or surface code (145\u2013149). The logical qubits are encoded within several physical qubits each, all of which are arranged in a 2D lattice with nearest neighbor interactions. Logical single- and two-qubit gates are then performed via a series of projective measurements. This code is probably the most powerful quantum computing scheme presently known, with a remarkably large error threshold around 1% (145\u2013149), so that \u223c102 operations per decoherence time may already be sufficient. When errors for readout become negligible, error correction in the surface code is even possible up to a threshold rate of currently 18.5% (150). The viability of topological error correction has recently been demonstrated in a first proof-of-principle experiment (151). For further information on fault-tolerant quantum computation with the surface code we refer to References 145\u2013151. A general overview on fault-tolerance is provided in Reference 149. 4.1.\u2002  Self-Assembled Quantum Dots As opposed to gate-defined QDs, the confinement in self-assembled dots purely arises from the conduction and valence band offsets of the involved materials, leading to strong confinement on a very small scale in all three dimensions. Therefore, self-assembled QDs are typically operational at 4 K, the boiling temperature of 4He. Moreover, they are optically active and feature strong interband transitions with almost hard selection rules (30, 75, 102). Exploiting this property, self-assembled QDs are primarily studied using optical means, and heterostructures have been designed that allow precise control over the charge states (152, 153). For a qubit with basis |1\u232a and |0\u232a, the general qubit state can be written as |\u03c8\u232a = cos(\u03b8/2) |1\u232a + e i\u03d5 sin(\u03b8/2) |0\u232a, neglecting global phases, where 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0 and 0 \u2264 \u03d5 < 2\u03c0 correspond to the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively, of a point on the Bloch sphere. Prerequisites for the implementation of a quantum computer are the abilities to initialize, to control, and to read out such a qubit state. All of this has been achieved now. First, the spins of both electrons (154) and holes (74, 155) can be initialized with \u226599% fidelity. Second, ultrashort optical pulses, combined with an externally induced Zeeman splitting, have allowed for complete quantum control, i.e., arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere, with operation times on the order of only a few picoseconds. Again, this has successfully been demonstrated on both single electrons (129, 156, 157) and single holes (158\u2013160). Recently, initialization and coherent control have also been reported for two-particle qubits defined by the spin singlet and triplet states of electrons (161) and holes (159) in vertically stacked QDs. The latter, also referred to as QD molecules, form naturally during growth when a second layer of QDs is grown on top of a first layer. Even though the position of the dots in the first layer is arbitrary, the QDs in the second layer form right on top of the first ones due to strain in the tunnel barrier grown in between. Finally, several methods have been developed to read out the spin states. These include time-averaged readout via Faraday rotations (162), Kerr rotations (163), and resonance fluorescence (164). In addition, time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy has been reported (156, 165), and it has been shown that QD molecules allow measurement of the spin state of a single electron in real time via the resonance fluorescence (166). In the latter case, the presence of a second dot enables the use of different optical transitions (laser energies) for the initialization and readout steps (166, 167). Dephasing and decoherence times have been measured. For single-electron spin qubits, dephasing results in (120, 129, 156, 163, 165, 168) depending on the exact system, whereas the observed decoherence times are T 2 \u22cd 3 \u03bcs (120, 129). However, it has been verified already that can be significantly prolonged by narrowing the distribution of the nuclear field (105, 120, 121). For single holes, the reported (158\u2013160) and T 2 = 1.1 \u03bcs (158) are similar to those for electrons, hence shorter than initially expected, which is attributed to electrical noise (158, 159, 169). Measurements based on coherent population trapping, i.e., in the frequency domain as opposed to the time domain, have revealed a much longer hole-spin dephasing time of >0.1 \u03bcs (75, 99). Electrical noise is also the reason for the short (161) and (159) observed for singlet-triplet qubits from electrons and holes, respectively. When the QD molecule is operated in a regime where the singlet-triplet splitting is less sensitive to fluctuating electric fields, can be increased by several orders of magnitude, and dephasing times up to 200 ns have recently been measured for coupled electrons (170). Importantly, comparing the listed T 2 to the notably short operation times of a few (tens of) picoseconds illustrates that the threshold factor of \u223c104 for standard quantum error correction schemes has already been exceeded in both electron and hole systems. For reported spin relaxation times T 1, see Table 1 . The optical properties make self-assembled QDs highly promising candidates for applications as single-photon sources, and designs for enhanced extraction efficiencies are being developed (171). Moreover, they may present an interface between stationary and flying qubits. Recently, interference of single photons from two separate QDs was demonstrated (172, 173), which is a promising approach for generating entanglement and implementing two-qubit gates between distant spins. Because different QDs, unlike atoms, have different resonance energies, implementing such a two-qubit gate requires that the level structure of a dot be tunable so that the photon energies can be made to match. Such fine tuning may be achieved via strain (172, 174), via the Stark effect (173, 175), or by polarizing the nuclear spins up to a desired (Overhauser) nuclear magnetic field. DNP in single self-assembled QDs has been studied in detail (101\u2013112). For instance, schemes exist both for high (103) and low (104) external magnetic fields that allow for continuous, bidirectional tuning of the Overhauser field, fully controlled by the laser wavelength. Both schemes are also capable of narrowing the width of the nuclear field distribution (103, 104). As an alternative to the widely studied III-V compounds, self-assembled QDs can also be grown from group IV materials. A prominent example is self-assembled Ge QDs on Si substrates. Due to the indirect band gap of Ge and Si, these dots are not as optically active as typical III-V QDs (176). Self-assembled Ge/Si QDs are subject to great experimental efforts, and detailed knowledge about growth and their electrical and optical properties has been gained (176\u2013178). 4.2.\u2002  Lateral Quantum Dots Substantial progress has been made on implementing gate-controlled qubits within the 2DEG of a heterostructure. Experiments have predominantly been carried out on GaAs QDs within AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures, which should be considered the host material in the following discussion unless stated otherwise. Mainly, two different approaches for encoding the qubit have emerged. The first scheme follows the original proposal (13), using the spin eigenstates |\u2191\u232a and |\u2193\u232a of single electrons. The second scheme uses the singlet and triplet states of two electron spins, forming an S-T 0 qubit (179\u2013181). We summarize below the results for both approaches. S-T + qubits (182) and qubits from three-spin states (183\u2013186) are currently under investigation. 4.2.1.\u2002  Single-spin qubits. The two eigenstates of a single electron in a QD, |\u2191\u232a and |\u2193\u232a, are split by an effective Zeeman energy via coupling to external and internal (Overhauser) magnetic fields. This energy difference gives rise to coherent single-qubit rotations . Rotations about the second axis of the Bloch sphere, |\u2191\u232a \u2194 |\u2193\u232a, can be driven by means of E(D)SR, which we introduced in Section 3. Finally, two-qubit gates such as and SWAP gates can be implemented by controlling the overlap of the wave functions and, hence, the exchange energy for neighboring electrons. Thirteen years after publication of the original proposal (13), the elementary unit of an all-electrical spin-qubit processor has now been implemented for the first time, demonstrating independently controllable single-spin rotations combined with interdot spin exchange in a DQD (187). An important part of the setup in Reference 187 is a micromagnet at the sample surface, whose stray field provides a time-independent magnetic field gradient at the QDs. This gradient is useful for two reasons. First, it allows for efficient and electrically driven ESR; an oscillating electric field slightly shifts the position of the electron in the QD, so that the electron effectively feels an oscillating magnetic field of the same frequency without the need for SOI (187, 188). Second, it leads to shifted resonance frequencies in adjacent QDs via a difference in the Zeeman energies, so that neighboring qubits can be addressed individually (116, 117, 187\u2013189). When quantum information is processed with the spin states of single electrons in QDs, qubit states can be read out via so-called spin-to-charge conversion as originally proposed in Reference 13. In this scheme, the system is electrically tuned to a regime where the electron of interest, depending on its energy and, thus, its spin state, does or does not tunnel into, e.g., a neighboring ancilla dot or a reservoir. The presence or absence of an electron can be detected with a nearby quantum point contact (QPC), whose conductance de-/increases due to the electric field provided by the electron charge (190, 191). Single-shot readout of individual spins via spin-to-charge conversion has successfully been demonstrated experimentally, and furthermore this approach also allows for efficient qubit initialization when the QD is tunnel-coupled to a reservoir (52, 192, 193). Performance of the implemented spin-qubit processor (187) was tested via a time-averaged readout scheme, using a QPC to measure the average charge configuration when the system is tuned to the Pauli spin blockade regime (see also S-T 0 qubits, Section 4.2.2). A fully operational unit for quantum computation requires precise initialization and single-shot readout of the individual qubit states, which therefore still needs to be included. Latest developments are promising (52, 189, 192\u2013194), and an independent single-shot measurement of two electron spins in a DQD, with fidelities close to 90%, has recently been reported (193). In the experiments described in Reference 193, a time around 1 ms was required for spin readout and initialization to |\u2191\u232a, slightly shorter than the measured spin relaxation time of \u223c4\u20135 ms. The latter strongly depends on the regime of operation, i.e., the applied gate voltages, and can take values T 1 > 1 s (70). The decoherence times T 2 can be assumed to be much longer than a microsecond. For a single echo pulse and a magnetic field of 70 mT only, a decay time near 1 \u03bcs has been measured, and clearly longer coherence times can be expected at higher magnetic fields and more sophisticated pulse sequences (127). Comparing T 2 to the typical operation times, we find that the threshold rates of proposed (standard) error correction protocols have already come within reach, as summarized below. Two-qubit gates are fast. For instance, SWAP operations |\u2191\u2193\u232a \u2192 |\u2193\u2191\u232a require a time of order h/(2J), where h is Planck\u2019s constant and J is the exchange energy. They are routinely carried out within \u227210 ns (187, 195), and SWAP times <0.5 ns have been demonstrated (126). Furthermore, single-qubit rotations induced by the Zeeman splitting typically occur on a subnanosecond timescale. Using the bulk g factor \u22120.44 for GaAs and B z = 1 T (often chosen in-plane to avoid orbital effects) as the magnetic field that defines the quantization axis, the \u03c0-rotation requires a time of order h/|2g\u03bc B B z | \u22cd 0.1 ns. The efficiency of the universal set of qubit gates is therefore limited by the operation time \u223ch/|g\u03bc B B \u22a5| for coherently driven spin flips |\u2191\u232a \u2192 |\u2193\u232a, where B \u22a5 is the amplitude of the oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to B z (see also Section 3.1.1). Recently reported spin-flip times are on the order of several tens of nanoseconds, for both magnetically (80, 127, 196) and electrically (188, 197) driven rotations, corresponding to B \u22a5 \u2248 1\u201310 mT. The efficiency of electrically controlled rotations may, among other things, be improved by increasing the magnetic field gradient (188) or even, in a brute-force approach, by switching to host materials with stronger SOI (197) and larger g factors. Alternatively, coherent single-spin rotations about an arbitrary axis may be implemented using an auxiliary spin in a nearby QD with a different Zeeman field, which enables a purely exchange-based control without the need for SOI or oscillating fields (13, 198). Such exchange-controlled single-qubit gates have not yet been realized experimentally; theoretical results, however, are promising and point toward high fidelities, with gating times of \u223c1 ns (198). 4.2.2.\u2002  Two-spin qubits (S-T 0). In the S-T 0 approach, every qubit is formed by two electrons in two adjacent QDs, where the charge configuration and the overlap of the electron wave functions depend on the shape of the confining potential, which in turn is determined by the applied gate voltages. Within the frame of this review it is sufficient to distinguish the two charge configurations (1,1) and (0,2), which denotes that the electrons are found either in different dots or both in the right QD, respectively. Coherent rotations |S\u232a \u2194 |T 0\u232a are induced by a magnetic field gradient between the two QDs, typically achieved by dynamic polarization of the nuclear spins (100, 113, 115) or by a nearby positioned micromagnet (116, 117, 187\u2013189). When the barrier is reduced such that the wave functions strongly overlap, the finite exchange energy gives rise to coherent rotations |\u2191\u2193\u232a \u2194 |\u2193\u2191\u232a, i.e., , thus allowing for arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere (100). These single-qubit operations can be carried out within a few nanoseconds only, and even subnanosecond operation times have been achieved already (see Table 1 ) (100, 126). Two-qubit gates may be implemented by capacitive coupling, where the charge configuration in one DQD affects the exchange energy and, hence, the precession frequency in the other DQD (181, 195, 199). Charge-conditional phase flips of an S-T 0 qubit have recently been demonstrated in four-dot systems (195, 199), and it was verified experimentally that the resulting CPHASE gate between two S-T 0 qubits is entangling (199). Alternatively, as proposed theoretically in Reference 200, CNOT gates may be implemented using the exchange interaction between adjacent QDs as the only time-dependent control parameter. The proposal shows that SOI and local magnetic field gradients allow for perfect CNOT operations, which are fast (a few nanoseconds) and, moreover, protected against charge noise. For initialization, the potential energy in one of the dots is reduced such that both electrons tend to occupy the ground state of the same QD. This sets the qubit in the singlet state because the symmetric orbital part of the two-electron wave function requires an antisymmetric contribution of the spin. After operation in the (1,1) regime, the same idea also allows for a spin-to-charge conversion and therefore presents a popular basis for readout schemes. Having reduced the potential energy in one QD, the system changes to (0,2) for |S\u232a, but remains in (1,1) for |T 0\u232a due to Pauli exclusion. As described in Section 4.2.1, these charge states can be observed via nearby QPCs (126, 190, 191), which may furthermore be embedded in radio-frequency (rf) impedance matching circuits to allow for faster readout (125, 201, 202). However, the quality of the outcome (readout visibility, see also Section 4.4) strongly depends on the triplet relaxation time at the measurement point, which may be clearly reduced in the presence of large magnetic field gradients (115), and implementing schemes for fast and reliable single-shot readout therefore remains an important task. Recently, single-shot measurements with measurement times down to 100 ns have been reported, using an rf sensor QD that is much more sensitive than standard QPCs (194). As an alternative approach, dispersive readout of spin singlet and triplet states has been demonstrated with an rf resonant circuit coupled to a DQD (203). Also, readout via spin-dependent tunnel rates has been achieved for the singlet and triplet states in a single QD (52, 204, 205). Even though the random distribution of the nuclear spins leads to rapid dephasing within \u223c10 ns (113, 126, 206), two-electron spin states feature very long coherence times. A single echo pulse increases the dephasing time to a few microseconds (126, 130\u2013132), and more sophisticated pulse sequences have demonstrated coherence times on the order of 100 \u03bcs (130\u2013132), where 276 \u03bcs currently corresponds to the largest value reported so far (131). Assuming that the two-qubit gates can be operated on a similar timescale (nanoseconds) as the single-qubit gates, the threshold value of \u223c104 operations per decoherence time is reached. As summarized above (Section 4.2.1), this similarly holds for the approach where qubits are formed by the spin states of single electrons. 4.2.3.\u2002  Dynamic nuclear polarization and alternative host materials. For both qubit encoding schemes, control over the nuclear spin bath is of great benefit. Various methods for DNP have been developed and demonstrated (100, 113\u2013119), all of which may be used to generate large magnetic field gradients between neighboring QDs. Such gradients can be measured quantitatively via the cycle duration of oscillations |S\u232a \u2194 |T 0\u232a (100, 113, 115), and differences >200 mT in the Overhauser field have been induced and subsequently exploited for coherent rotations on the Bloch sphere (100). In addition, schemes exist to reduce the width of the nuclear field distribution (113, 118, 119), allowing for substantial prolongation of the dephasing times (113). Besides GaAs QDs, other promising host materials are under investigation. In particular, rapid progress has been made on Si QDs within Si/SiGe heterostructures (207\u2013212). For instance, slow electron spin relaxation T 1 > 1 s has recently been observed in this material via single-shot readout (210). Also, single-shot measurements have allowed the extraction of relaxation times T 1 \u223c 10 ms for S-T 0 qubits operated near the (1,1)-(0,2) charge state transition (211). Moreover, a hyperfine-induced dephasing time has been deduced from ensemble-averaged measurements on an S-T 0 qubit (212), which is nearly two orders of magnitude longer than the dephasing times measured in GaAs. As opposed to self-assembled QDs, gate-defined systems cannot confine electrons and holes at the same time and are therefore optically inactive (30). Currently, experiments are almost exclusively carried out on gated 2DEGs, and new experimental challenges may be encountered when 2DHGs are used instead (213). However, considering the long lifetimes predicted for HHs in QDs (40, 92, 93) and the fact that strong magnetic field gradients may be induced via micromagnets (116, 117, 187\u2013189), we think that hole spins can present a valuable alternative to electron spins. 4.3.\u2002  Quantum Dots in Nanowires Semiconducting nanowires attracted a lot of interest as promising platforms for Majorana fermions (214\u2013216), field effect transistors (217), programmable circuits (218), single-photon sources (219), lasers (220, 221), and others. QDs therein form when the confinement in the transverse directions, provided by the wire geometry, is supplemented with an additional confinement in the longitudinal direction, which can be achieved both via electric gates and via structured growth of materials with suitable band offsets. In the first case, coupling between neighboring QDs is easily controllable via the gate voltages, while the second case is highly attractive for optical processes because electrons and holes can be stored at the same time (see also self-assembled QDs). Nanowires are thus versatile and may present a valuable link between stationary and flying qubits. For instance, similar to self-assembled QDs (30, 75, 102, 153), voltage-controlled charging and spin-dependent selection rules have been demonstrated on optically active InAsP QDs embedded in InP wires (222\u2013224). Nanowires have been grown from a variety of materials, all of which feature different properties and advantages. A prominent host material is InAs, which is known for its strong SOI and large g factors. Experiments on electrons in InAs nanowire QDs revealed a spin-orbit length l SO \u22cd 130 nm, i.e., a spin-orbit energy E SO \u22cd 100 \u03bceV (78), along with g factors |g| \u22cd 7\u201310 (57\u201359, 78). These features allow for fast spin rotations via EDSR (57\u201359), and spin-flip times <10 ns have already been demonstrated on single-spin qubits (57, 59). However, the coherence time observed in Reference 57 turned out to be rather short, only 50 ns for a single echo pulse and <200 ns for several pulses, which is considered to be attributable to the large nuclear spin 9/2 of In. The relaxation times in this experiment clearly exceeded the measurement range, i.e., the microsecond timescale (57), consistent with the theoretically predicted T 1 of several microseconds to milliseconds (225). Experiments with singlet-triplet states in an InAs nanowire DQD in the multielectron regime showed that spin relaxation may be suppressed via tuning of the interdot coupling (226). Besides InAs, InSb has also recently attracted a lot of attention, where EDSR spectroscopy on the two-electron states of a gate-defined nanowire DQD revealed l SO \u22cd 200\u2013300 nm and very large g factors |g| \u2273 30 (60). A promising alternative to the III-V compounds are Ge/Si core/shell nanowires, which can be grown nuclear-spin-free. The valence band offset at the Ge/Si interface is large, \u223c0.5 eV, so that holes accumulate naturally in the Ge core without the need for dopants (227, 228). High mobilities (217) and long mean free paths (227) have been observed, along with a highly coherent charge transport seen through proximity-induced superconductivity (229). Progress has also been made on gate-controlled Ge/Si nanowire QDs, even though the single-hole regime has not quite been reached yet (230\u2013232). Experiments on such a DQD have recently revealed spin relaxation times near 1 ms (232). Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 3b , the relative thickness of the Si shell allows for varying the QD level splitting by several millielectronvolts via the static strain (233). Remarkably, Ge/Si nanowires were also found to feature strong SOI: theoretical studies of the low-energy hole states showed that direct, dipolar coupling to an electric field gives rise to a SOI of Rashba type (\u201cdirect Rashba spin-orbit interaction\u201d) which exceeds the standard Rashba SOI by one to two orders of magnitude (233). Figure 3c (top) plots the ground-state spectrum for a typical nanowire of 5 nm core radius and 2 nm shell thickness in a moderate electric field of 10 V \u03bcm\u20131 perpendicular to the wire. The corresponding spin-orbit energy is E SO > 1.5 meV, more than 15 times greater than the reported value for InAs (78). The additional magnetic field in Figure 3c (top) along the electric field axis opens a gap in the spectrum (|g| \u22cd 5 at k z = 0), illustrating sensitivity to magnetic fields, a prerequisite for efficient qubit manipulation. The hole g factors in Ge/Si nanowire QDs are tunable via both the confinement and the magnetic field orientation (231, 233). All these properties should allow for electrically controlled qubits with long lifetimes and short operation times. Furthermore, Ge/Si nanowires present an outstanding platform for helical hole states and Majorana fermions (214\u2013216, 229, 233). Finally, we mention that helical states (37, 234) and Majorana fermions (235) can alternatively be realized in armchair carbon nanotubes without the need for a magnetic field, allowing for purely electrical setups. The required field, on the order of 1 V nm\u22121 (37, 234, 235), is stronger than in the case of Ge/Si wires, but still below experimentally achievable limits. Figure 3 Calculated low-energy properties of hole states in Ge/Si core/shell nanowires, following Reference 233. (a) Holes accumulate in the Ge core of radius R, surrounded by a Si shell of thickness R s \u2212 R leading to static strain. When the nanowire is supplemented with confinement along the wire axis z, a quantum dot of radius R and (effective) length L forms. (b) Energy gap between the two lowest Kramers doublets in a longitudinal Ge quantum dot of R = 5 nm and different lengths L as a function of relative shell thickness \u03b3 = (R s \u2212 R)/R. The Si shell allows changing of the level splitting by several millielectronvolts, which is particularly useful for implementing spin qubits. (c, top) Hole spectrum as a function of longitudinal wave number k z for a typical Ge/Si wire of R = 5 nm and R s = 7 nm in the presence of an electric field E x = 10 V \u03bcm\u20131 and a magnetic field B x = 1.8 T along x (see panel a), illustrating strong spin-orbit interaction and sensitivity to magnetic fields, which are prerequisites for efficient qubit manipulation. The spin-orbit energy E SO > 1.5 meV, resulting from direct, dipolar coupling to E x , is more than 15 times greater than the reported value for InAs (78). At k z = 0, B x opens a Zeeman gap of 0.5 meV, corresponding to |g| \u223c 5. (c, bottom) Expectation value of the effective hole spin components J x , J y , and J z for the ground state plotted above. When the Fermi level is set within the gap at k z = 0, the wire transports opposite spins in opposite directions, the characteristic feature of a helical mode. Therefore, Ge/Si nanowires also provide a promising basis for spin filters and Majorana fermions (214\u2013216, 229, 233).

We would like to point out that, even though we studied the literature carefully, the provided summary is not intended to be complete, as further improvements might already have been achieved that we were not aware of when completing this review. The table also lists established initialization and readout schemes for each system, along with a ratio of the observed decoherence and gating times. The latter illustrates that decoherence no longer presents a massive stumbling block. Typical values for characterizing readout schemes are the measurement fidelities F and the visibilities V. We note that these are not exactly equivalent. When e 0\u21921 denotes the error probability that the qubit state |0\u232a is incorrectly read as |1\u232a, the measurement fidelity for state |0\u232a is F 0 = 1 \u2212 e 0\u21921 (125, 192, 204). Analogously, the measurement fidelity for the qubit state |1\u232a is F 1 = 1 \u2212 e 1\u21920. One may define the readout fidelity for a particular experiment as F = p 0 F 0 + p 1 F 1 = 1 \u2212 p 0 e 0\u21921 \u2212 p 1 e 1\u21920, where p 0 (p 1) is the probability that the system is initially in |0\u232a (|1\u232a) (166). Weighting |0\u232a and |1\u232a equally, this results in F = 1 \u2212 (e 0\u21921 + e 1\u21920)/2 (52, 205). A more general quantity is the visibility V = 1 \u2212 e 0\u21921 \u2212 e 1\u21920, which is independent of p 0 and p 1 and presents a lower bound for the readout fidelity in a system (52, 125, 192, 204). We note that readout may also be characterized by the measurement efficiency defined in Reference 236, where various readout schemes have been analyzed theoretically.  5.\u2002 PROPOSALS FOR LONG-DISTANCE SPIN-SPIN COUPLING  Recently, pairwise control of the exchange interaction via electric gates has been demonstrated in a triple quantum dot (185, 186). Such control is an essential requirement for most quantum computer architectures (see Figure 1b ), so the experiments of Reference 185 present an important proof of scalability. Large-scale quantum computers, however, must be capable of reaching a system size of several thousands of qubits. This poses serious architectural challenges to the exchange-based QD scheme from Reference 13 (see Figure 1 ) because the large amount of wires and metallic gates needs to be installed and operated on a very small scale. A promising strategy to meet this challenge has recently been proposed (237); long-distance spin-spin coupling can be achieved capacitively via floating gates, allowing the (D)QDs to be moved far apart. The effective qubit-qubit coupling J\u2032 via floating gates can take remarkably large values J\u2032 \u223c 1\u2013100 \u03bceV (237). These are comparable to the achievable exchange energies J \u223c 10\u2013100 \u03bceV in typical GaAs DQDs (13, 52, 237), where we note that J close to 10 \u03bceV has already been realized (126). The floating gates may be positioned on top of the sample, as sketched in Figure 4a , or may even be defined within the 2DEG. Qubit-qubit coupling can be switched on and off by changing the relative positions of the QDs (charges) with respect to the gates, allowing for all-electrical control (237). Proposed, scalable architectures for a quantum computer with floating gates are shown in Figure 4b,c . A key feature of the architectures suggested in Reference 237 is that they all consist of a 2D lattice of spin qubits with nearest neighbor qubit-qubit interactions. Therefore, they all allow for the implementation of the surface code with its strikingly large error threshold around 1% (see also Section 4 and References 145\u2013151 for further information). Figure 4 Long-distance qubit-qubit coupling via floating gates, allowing individual qubits to be separated by large distances (237). (a) Schematic setup for two spins in separated double quantum dots coupled capacitively via a floating gate (here: simple, symmetric \u201cdog bone\u201d geometry). In the presence of a magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, the electrostatic interaction of the charges results in an effective spin-spin coupling. Depending on the actual system and the gate geometry, remarkably strong qubit-qubit interactions of 1\u2013100 \u03bceV can be reached (237). (b) Scalable quantum computer architecture using metallic floating gates on top of a 2D electron gas. (c) An alternative architecture with qubits (black dots) implemented in nanowires (vertical black lines). In both b and c, qubit-qubit interactions can be switched on (off) via gates by moving the qubits close to (away from) the corresponding metal discs. The architectures provide a platform for the powerful surface code (145\u2013151).

The original idea goes back to a proposal from 1999, which suggests that laser-induced Raman transitions can be used to couple the electron spin states of distant QDs when embedded in an optical cavity (14). A few years later, as an alternative to the standard cavity QED, 1D superconducting transmission line resonators, which operate as on-chip microwave cavities, have been introduced and have launched the field of circuit QED (238, 239). Since then, several proposals for long-range spin-spin coupling via circuit QED have been made (225, 240\u2013244). The direct coupling of a single spin to the magnetic component of the cavity electromagnetic field, however, is weak, and achieving strong interactions between a spin qubit and a cavity thus requires other mechanisms, resulting in a variety of suggested approaches. These, for instance, are based on Raman-type transitions among single-electron states in DQDs (240), on S-T 0 qubits in QD molecules with (nuclear) magnetic field gradients (241, 242), or on the single-electron states in DQDs contacted to ferromagnetic insulators (243). Relatively recently, using electron spins in InAs nanowire QDs was proposed (225). InAs nanowire QDs feature a strong SOI and, thus, enable efficient coupling between the qubits and the electric component of the cavity field. Investigated architectures are shown in Figure 5 , where nanowires with strong longitudinal (transverse) QD confinement are placed parallel (perpendicular) to the transmission line in panel a (b). Rotations of individual qubits can be driven through EDSR (57\u201361), and two-qubit interactions can be turned on and off by changing the QD confinements with nearby gates, allowing for all-electrical control (225). For the setup shown in Figure 5b , an operation time around 20 ns was estimated for swapping two spins coherently, and further optimization seems clearly possible. Recent experiments (59) following Reference 225 have led to very encouraging results. They demonstrate that spin-cavity coupling strengths on the order of 1 MHz (several nanoelectronvolts) are experimentally feasible, exceeding the coupling of the spin to the magnetic component of the cavity field by several orders of magnitude and anticipating that the strong coupling regime for spin qubits can be reached (59). Notably, it has been shown theoretically that circuit QED also allows for long-range coupling between certain types of molecular magnets (245). A discussion of relaxation and decoherence in those systems can be found in Reference 246. Figure 5 Architectures for long-range qubit-qubit coupling via microwave cavities as studied in Reference 225. The superconducting transmission line resonator is sketched in blue, assuming that the center conductor of length L is separated from the neighboring ground planes by a distance d. Electron spin states (thick green arrows) in InAs nanowire quantum dots (QDs) serve as qubits. The QD confinement, illustrated by brown discs within the nanowires (pink cylinders), can be realized with a suitable barrier material, such as InP, or with electric gates. (a) A large-diameter nanowire is oriented parallel to the transmission line and hosts QDs with strong longitudinal confinement. (b) Small-diameter nanowires, each hosting a QD with strong transverse confinement, are placed perpendicular to the transmission line. An insulating material separates the wires from the superconducting resonator to prevent a current flow. In both setups, the spin-orbit interaction enables all-electrical operation along with strong long-range interactions mediated by the photon field of the cavity (225). For the system in b, the time to coherently swap two spins was estimated to be around 20 ns, and further improvement seems clearly possible. The pictures were taken from Reference 225 and are property of the American Physical Society ( http://www.aps.org ).

Gate-controlled QDs within 2DEGs were limited to around 30 or more confined electrons each, and techniques for single-qubit manipulation and readout were not available (247). Furthermore, decoherence from interactions with the environment was considered an almost insurmountable obstacle. Within the past decade, the situation has changed dramatically, owing to continuous experimental and theoretical progress. QDs are now routinely controlled down to the last electron (hole), owing to a clever gate design based on plunger gates (52, 247, 248), and various schemes have been applied for both qubit initialization and readout. Reducing the occupation number of QDs to the minimum is desirable for high-fidelity quantum computation (249); however, larger fillings with a well-defined spin-1/2 ground state are also useful (23). In addition, efficient single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, allowing for universal quantum computing when combined. The achieved gating times are much shorter than measured lifetimes, and it seems that one will soon be able to overcome decoherence to the required extent. This is a major step toward the realization of a quantum computer. While the field is very advanced for the workhorse systems such as lateral GaAs QDs or self-assembled (In)GaAs QDs, rapid progress is also being made in the quest for alternative systems with further optimized performance. First, this includes switching to different host materials. For instance, Ge and Si can be grown nuclear-spin-free, and required gradients in the Zeeman field may be induced via micromagnets. Second, both electron- and hole-spin qubits are under investigation, exploiting the different properties of conduction and valence bands, respectively. Finally, promising results are obtained from new system geometries, particularly nanowire QDs. Future tasks can probably be divided into three categories. The first one consists of studying new quantum computing protocols (such as the surface code), which put very low requirements on the physical qubits. The second category refers to further optimization of the individual components listed in Table 1 . For instance, longer lifetimes are certainly desired, as are high-quality qubit gates with even shorter operation times. However, as decoherence no longer seems to present the limiting issue, particular focus should also be put on implementing schemes for highly reliable, fast, and scalable qubit readout (initialization) in each of the systems. Finally, because the results in Table 1 are usually based on different experimental conditions, the third category consists of merging all required elements into one scalable device, without the need for excellent performance. Such a complete spin-qubit processor should combine individual single-qubit rotations about arbitrary axes, a controlled (entangling) two-qubit operation, initialization into a precisely known state, and single-shot readout of each qubit. While Reference 187 presents an important step toward this unit, prototypes of a complete spin-qubit processor could present the basis for continuous optimization. In summary, considering the impressive progress achieved within the past decade, one may be cautiously optimistic that a large-scale quantum computer can indeed be realized.  SUMMARY POINTS   1.  The experimental situation has dramatically changed since 1998, when the original proposal for quantum computation with quantum dots (13) was published. Quantum dots are now precisely controlled down to the last spin. Single-qubit rotations around different axes, two-qubit operations, and various initialization and readout schemes have successfully been demonstrated ( Table 1 ). 2.  Overcoming decoherence to the required extent should soon be possible, which is a big step toward the implementation of a quantum computer. 3.  Nuclear spins and spin-orbit interaction, on the one hand, present a source of decoherence and relaxation. On the other hand, they can generate large Overhauser fields and are useful for realizing quantum gates. Schemes exist to narrow the width of the nuclear field distribution. 4.  Several quantum dot systems are currently under investigation, including host materials with or without nuclear spins, operation in the conduction or valence band, and different geometries. Holes in Ge/Si-nanowire-based quantum dots are promising examples (230\u2013233). 5.  Electrically pulsed, pairwise control of the exchange interaction has been demonstrated in a triple quantum dot (185); i.e., the scalability of exchange-based schemes for quantum computing (13) has now been verified experimentally. 6.  Long-distance spin-spin coupling via floating gates may be used to overcome architectural challenges of a large-scale quantum computer, and several 2D architectures have been proposed (237). Alternatively, distant spins may be coupled via the photon field of a cavity (14, 59, 225, 240\u2013245). 7.  Recent development toward quantum computation with quantum dots has been very positive, and one can be curious about the progress to be made in the next few years.  FUTURE ISSUES   1.  The surface code is a powerful protocol for fault-tolerant quantum computing (144\u2013151). Can the requirements on the physical qubits be reduced further? 2.  Can longer lifetimes and more efficient qubit gates be reported? In particular, can schemes for fast and highly reliable single-shot readout and initialization be implemented in each of the discussed systems? 3.  Schemes for exchange-controlled single-spin rotations (about arbitrary axes) have been proposed as an efficient alternative to rotations driven by oscillating fields (13, 198). Can this be realized experimentally? 4.  Electrically controlled single-qubit and two-qubit operations were demonstrated in the setup of Reference 187. Can a complete spin-qubit processor be reported soon?   disclosure statement  The authors are not aware of any affiliations, memberships, funding, or financial holdings that might be perceived as affecting the objectivity of this review.

It wasn\u2019t until\n1994, when Peter Shor surprised the world\nby describing a polynomial time quan-\ntum algorithm for factoring integers [Shor\n1994; 1997], that the \ufb01eld of quantum\ncomputing came into its own. This discov-\nery prompted a \ufb02urry of activity among\nexperimentalists trying to build quan-\ntum computers and theoreticians try-\ning to \ufb01nd other quantum algorithms.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000, pp. 300\u2013335.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n301\nAdditional interest in the subject has been\ncreated by the invention of quantum key\ndistribution and, more recently, popular\npress accounts of experimental successes\nin quantum teleportation and the demon-\nstration of a 3-bit quantum computer.\nThe aim of this paper is to guide com-\nputer scientists and other nonphysicists\nthrough the conceptual and notational\nbarriers that separate quantum comput-\ning from conventional computing and to\nacquaint them with this new and excit-\ning \ufb01eld. It is important for the computer\nscience community to understand these\nnew developments since they may radi-\ncally change the way we have to think\nabout computation, programming, and\ncomplexity.\nClassically, the time it takes to do cer-\ntain computations can be decreased by\nusing parallel processors. To achieve an\nexponential decrease in time requires an\nexponential increase in the number of\nprocessors, and hence an exponential in-\ncrease in the amount of physical space\nneeded. However, in quantum systems the\namount of parallelism increases exponen-\ntially with the size of the system. Thus,\nan exponential increase in parallelism re-\nquires only a linear increase in the amount\nof physical space needed. This effect is\ncalled quantum parallelism [Deutsch and\nJozsa 1992].\nThere is a catch, and a big catch at\nthat. While a quantum system can per-\nform massive parallel computation, access\nto the results of the computation is re-\nstricted. Accessing the results is equiva-\nlent to making a measurement, which dis-\nturbs the quantum state. This problem\nmakes the situation, on the face of it, seem\neven worse than the classical situation; we\ncan only read the result of one parallel\nthread, and because measurement is prob-\nabilistic, we cannot even choose which one\nwe get.\nBut in the past few years, various peo-\nple have found clever ways of \ufb01nessing\nthe measurement problem to exploit the\npower of quantum parallelism. This sort\nof manipulation has no classical analog\nand requires nontraditional programming\ntechniques. One technique manipulates\nthe quantum state so that a common\nproperty of all of the output values such\nas the symmetry or period of a function\ncan be read off. This technique is used\nin Shor\u2019s factorization algorithm. Another\ntechnique transforms the quantum state\nto increase the likelihood that output of\ninterest will be read. Grover\u2019s search algo-\nrithm makes use of such an ampli\ufb01cation\ntechnique. This paper describes quantum\nparallelism in detail, and the techniques\ncurrently known for harnessing its power.\nSection 2, following this introduction,\nexplains of the basic concepts of quan-\ntum mechanics that are important for\nquantum computation. This section can-\nnot give a comprehensive view of quan-\ntum mechanics. Our aim is to provide the\nreader with tools in the form of mathemat-\nics and notation with which to work with\nthe quantum mechanics involved in quan-\ntum computation. We hope that this paper\nwill equip readers well enough that they\ncan freely explore the theoretical realm of\nquantum computing.\nSection 3 de\ufb01nes the quantum bit, or\nqubit. Unlike classical bits, a quantum bit\ncan be put in a superposition state that en-\ncodes both 0 and 1. There is no good classi-\ncal explanation of superpositions: a quan-\ntum bit representing 0 and 1 can neither\nbe viewed as \u201cbetween\u201d 0 and 1 nor can\nit be viewed as a hidden unknown state\nthat represents either 0 or 1 with a certain\nprobability. Even single quantum bits en-\nable interesting applications. We describe\nthe use of a single quantum bit for secure\nkey distribution.\nBut the real power of quantum compu-\ntation derives from the exponential state\nspaces of multiple quantum bits: just as a\nsingle qubit can be in a superposition of\n0 and 1, a register of n qubits can be in\na superposition of all 2n possible values.\nThe \u201cextra\u201d states that have no classical\nanalog and lead to the exponential size of\nthe quantum state space are the entangled\nstates, like the state leading to the famous\nEPR1 paradox (see Section 3.4).\nWe discuss the two types of opera-\ntions a quantum system can undergo:\n1 EPR = Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\n302\nE. Rieffel and W. Polak\nmeasurement and quantum state trans-\nformations. Most quantum algorithms in-\nvolve a sequence of quantum state trans-\nformations followed by a measurement.\nFor classical computers there are sets\nof gates that are universal in the sense\nthat any classical computation can be per-\nformed using a sequence of these gates.\nSimilarly, there are sets of primitive quan-\ntum state transformations, called quan-\ntum gates, that are universal for quantum\ncomputation. Given enough quantum bits,\nit is possible to construct a universal quan-\ntum Turing machine.\nQuantum physics puts restrictions on\nthe types of transformations that can be\ndone. In particular, all quantum state\ntransformations, and therefore all quan-\ntum gates and all quantum computations,\nmust be reversible. Yet all classical algo-\nrithms can be made reversible and can\nbe computed on a quantum computer in\ncomparable time. Some common quantum\ngates are de\ufb01ned in Section 4.\nTwo applications combining quantum\ngates and entangled states are described\nin Section 4.2: teleportation and dense\ncoding. Teleportation is the transfer of a\nquantum state from one place to another\nthrough classical channels. That telepor-\ntation is possible is surprising, since quan-\ntum mechanics tells us that it is not pos-\nsible to clone quantum states or even\nmeasure them without disturbing the\nstate. Thus, it is not obvious what informa-\ntion could be sent through classical chan-\nnels that could possibly enable the recon-\nstruction of an unknown quantum state\nat the other end. Dense coding, a dual to\nteleportation, uses a single quantum bit to\ntransmit two bits of classical information.\nBoth teleportation and dense coding rely\non the entangled states described in the\nEPR experiment.\nIt is only in Section 5 that we see\nwhere an exponential speed-up over clas-\nsical computers might come from. The in-\nput to a quantum computation can be put\nin a superposition state that encodes all\npossible input values. Performing the com-\nputation on this initial state will result in\nsuperposition of all of the corresponding\noutput values. Thus, in the same time it\ntakes to compute the output for a single in-\nput state on a classical computer, a quan-\ntum computer can compute the values for\nall input states. This process is known as\nquantum parallelism. However, measur-\ning the output states will randomly yield\nonly one of the values in the superposition,\nand at the same time destroy all of the\nother results of the computation. Section 5\ndescribes this situation in detail. Sections\n6 and 7 describe techniques for taking ad-\nvantage of quantum parallelism inspite of\nthe severe constraints imposed by quan-\ntum mechanics on what can be measured.\nSection 6 describes the details of Shor\u2019s\npolynomial time factoring algorithm. The\nfastest known classical factoring algo-\nrithm requires exponential time, and it is\ngenerally believed that there is no classi-\ncal polynomial time factoring algorithm.\nShor\u2019s is a beautiful algorithm that takes\nadvantage of quantum parallelism by us-\ning a quantum analog of the Fourier trans-\nform.\nLov Grover developed a technique for\nsearching an unstructured list of n items\nin O(\u221an) steps on a quantum computer.\nClassical computers can do no better than\nO(n), so unstructured search on a quan-\ntum computer is provably more ef\ufb01cient\nthan search on a classical computer. How-\never, the speed-up is only polynomial, not\nexponential, and it has been shown that\nGrover\u2019s algorithm is optimal for quan-\ntum computers. It seems likely that search\nalgorithms that could take advantage of\nsome problem structure could do better.\nTad Hogg, among others, has explored\nsuch possibilities. We describe various\nquantum search techniques in Section 7.\nIt is as yet unknown whether the power\nof quantum parallelism can be harnessed\nfor a wide variety of applications. One tan-\ntalizing open question is whether quan-\ntum computers can solve NP-complete\nproblems in polynomial time.\nPerhaps the biggest open question is\nwhether useful quantum computers can\nbe built. There are a number of propos-\nals for building quantum computers us-\ning ion traps, nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR), and optical and solid-state tech-\nniques. All of the current proposals have\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n303\nscaling problems, so a breakthrough will\nbe needed to go beyond tens of qubits\nto hundreds of qubits. While both optical\nand solid-state techniques show promise,\nNMR and ion trap technologies are the\nmost advanced so far.\nIn an ion trap quantum computer [Circ\nand Zoller 1995; Steane 1996] a linear se-\nquence of ions representing the qubits are\ncon\ufb01ned by electric \ufb01elds. Lasers are di-\nrected at individual ions to perform single-\nbit quantum gates. Two-bit operations are\nrealized by using a laser on one qubit to\ncreate an impulse that ripples through a\nchain of ions to the second qubit, where\nanother laser pulse stops the rippling\nand performs the 2-bit operation. The ap-\nproach requires that the ions be kept in\nextreme vacuum and at extremely low\ntemperatures.\nThe NMR approach has the advantage\nthat it will work at room temperature and\nthat NMR technology in general is already\nfairly advanced. The idea is to use macro-\nscopic amounts of matter and encode a\nquantum bit in the average spin state of\na large number of nuclei. The spin states\ncan be manipulated by magnetic \ufb01elds,\nand the average spin state can be mea-\nsured with NMR techniques. The main\nproblem with the technique is that it\ndoesn\u2019t scale well; the measured signal\nscales as 1/2n with the number of qubits\nn. However, a recent proposal [Schulman\nand Vazirani 1998] has been made that\nmay overcome this problem. NMR com-\nputers with three qubits have been built\nsuccessfully [Cory et al. 1998; Gershenfeld\nand Chuang 1997; La\ufb02amme et al. 1997;\nVandersypen et al. 1999]. This paper will\nnot discuss further the physical and en-\ngineering problems of building quantum\ncomputers.\nThe greatest problem for building quan-\ntum computers is decoherence, the distor-\ntion of the quantum state due to interac-\ntion with the environment. For some time\nit was feared that quantum computers\ncould not be built because it would be im-\npossible to isolate them suf\ufb01ciently from\nthe external environment. The break-\nthrough came from the algorithmic rather\nthan the physical side, through the in-\nvention of quantum error correction tech-\nniques. Initially people thought quantum\nerror correction might be impossible be-\ncause of the impossibility of reliably copy-\ning unknown quantum states, but it turns\nout that it is possible to design quantum\nerror correcting codes that detect certain\nkinds of errors and enable the reconstruc-\ntion of the exact error-free quantum state.\nQuantum error correction is discussed in\nSection 8.\nAppendices provide background infor-\nmation on tensor products and continued\nfractions.\n2. QUANTUM MECHANICS\nQuantum mechanical phenomena are dif-\n\ufb01cult to understand, since most of our\neveryday experiences are not applicable.\nThis paper cannot provide a deep un-\nderstanding of quantum mechanics (see\nFeynman et al. [1965], Liboff [1997], and\nGreenstein and Zajonc [1997] for expo-\nsitions of quantum mechanics). Instead,\nwe will give some feeling as to the na-\nture of quantum mechanics and some of\nthe mathematical formalisms needed to\nwork with quantum mechanics to the ex-\ntent needed for quantum computing.\nQuantum mechanics is a theory in the\nmathematical sense: it is governed by a set\nof axioms. The consequences of the axioms\ndescribe the behavior of quantum systems.\nThe axioms lead to several apparent para-\ndoxes: in the Compton effect it appears as\nif an action precedes its cause; the EPR\nexperiment makes it appear as if action\nover a distance faster than the speed of\nlight is possible. We will discuss the EPR\nexperiment in detail in Section 3.4. Ver-\ni\ufb01cation of most predictions is indirect,\nand requires careful experimental design\nand specialized equipment. We will begin,\nhowever, with an experiment that requires\nonly readily available equipment and that\nwill illustrate some of the key aspects of\nquantum mechanics needed for quantum\ncomputation.\n2.1. Photon Polarization\nPhotons are the only particles that we\ncan observe directly. The following simple\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\n304\nE. Rieffel and W. Polak\nexperiment can be performed with mini-\nmal equipment: a strong light source, such\nas a laser pointer, and three polaroids\n(polarization \ufb01lters), which can be picked\nup at any camera supply store. The ex-\nperiment demonstrates some of the prin-\nciples of quantum mechanics through pho-\ntons and their polarization.\n2.1.1 The\nExperiment. A\nbeam\nof\nlight\nshines on a projection screen. Filters A,\nB, and C are polarized horizontally, at\n45\u25e6, and vertically, respectively, and can be\nplaced so as to intersect the beam of light.\nFirst, insert \ufb01lter A. Assuming the in-\ncoming light is randomly polarized, the\nintensity of the output will have half of\nthe intensity of the incoming light. The\noutgoing photons are now all horizontally\npolarized.\nThe function of \ufb01lter A cannot be ex-\nplained as a \u201csieve\u201d that only lets those\nphotons pass that happen to be already\nhorizontally polarized. If that were the\ncase, few of the randomly polarized incom-\ning electrons would be horizontally polar-\nized, so we would expect a much larger at-\ntenuation of the light as it passes through\nthe \ufb01lter.\nNext, when \ufb01lter C is inserted, the in-\ntensity of the output drops to zero. None\nof the horizontally polarized photons can\npass through the vertical \ufb01lter. A sieve\nmodel could explain this behavior.\nFinally, after \ufb01lter B is inserted between\nA and C, a small amount of light will be\nvisible on the screen, exactly one eighth of\nthe original amount of light.\nHere we have a nonintuitive effect. Classi-\ncal experience suggests that adding a \ufb01lter\nshould only be able to decrease the num-\nber of photons getting through. How can it\nincrease it?\n2.1.2 The Explanation. A photon\u2019s polariza-\ntion state can be modeled by a unit vector\npointing in the appropriate direction. Any\narbitrary polarization can be expressed\nas a linear combination a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2192\u27e9 of the\ntwo basis vectors2 |\u2192\u27e9 (horizontal polar-\nization) and |\u2191\u27e9 (vertical polarization).\nSince we are only interested in the di-\nrection of the polarization (the notion of\n\u201cmagnitude\u201d is not meaningful), the state\nvector will be a unit vector (i.e., |a|2+|b|2 =\n1). In general, the polarization of a pho-\nton can be expressed as a|\u2191\u27e9+b|\u2192\u27e9 where\na and b are complex numbers3 such that\n|a|2 + |b|2 = 1. Note, the choice of basis\nfor this representation is completely arbi-\ntrary: any two orthogonal unit vectors will\ndo (e.g., {|\u2196\u27e9, |\u2197\u27e9}).\nThe measurement postulate of quantum\nmechanics states that any device measur-\ning a two-dimensional system has an as-\nsociated orthonormal basis with respect to\nwhich the quantum measurement takes\nplace. Measurement of a state transforms\nthe state into one of the measuring de-\nvice\u2019s associated basis vectors. The prob-\nability that the state is measured as ba-\nsis vector |u\u27e9 is the square of the norm\nof the amplitude of the component of the\noriginal state in the direction of the ba-\nsis vector |u\u27e9. For example, given a device\n2 The notation |\u2192\u27e9 is explained in Section 2.2.\n3 Imaginary\ncoef\ufb01cients\ncorrespond\nto\ncircular\npolarization.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n305\nFig. 1.\nMeasurement is a projection onto\nthe basis.\nfor measuring the polarization of photons\nwith associated basis {|\u2191\u27e9, |\u2192\u27e9}, the state\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2192\u27e9 is measured as |\u2191\u27e9 with\nprobability |a|2 and as |\u2192\u27e9 with probabil-\nity |b|2 (see Figure 1). Note that different\nmeasuring devices will have different as-\nsociated bases, and measurements using\nthese devices will have different outcomes.\nAs measurements are always made with\nrespect to an orthonormal basis, through-\nout the rest of this paper all bases will be\nassumed to be orthonormal.\nFurthermore,\nmeasurement\nof\nthe\nquantum state will change the state to\nthe result of the measurement. That is, if\nmeasurement of |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u2191\u27e9 + b|\u2192\u27e9 results\nin |\u2191\u27e9, then the state \u03c8 changes to |\u2191\u27e9\nand a second measurement with respect\nto the same basis will return |\u2191\u27e9 with\nprobability 1. Thus, unless the original\nstate happened to be one of the basis\nvectors, measurement will change that\nstate, and it is not possible to determine\nwhat the original state was.\nQuantum mechanics can explain the po-\nlarization experiment as follows. A po-\nlaroid measures the quantum state of pho-\ntons with respect to the basis consisting\nof the vector corresponding to its polar-\nization together with a vector orthogonal\nto its polarization. The photons that, after\nbeing measured by the \ufb01lter, match the \ufb01l-\nter\u2019s polarization are let through. The oth-\ners are re\ufb02ected and now have a polariza-\ntion perpendicular to that of the \ufb01lter. For\nexample, \ufb01lter A measures the photon po-\nlarization with respect to the basis vector\n|\u2192\u27e9, corresponding to its polarization. The\nphotons that pass through \ufb01lter A all have\npolarization |\u2192\u27e9. Those that are re\ufb02ected\nby the \ufb01lter all have polarization |\u2191\u27e9.\nAssuming that the light source produces\nphotons with random polarization, \ufb01lter\nA will measure 50% of all photons as\nhorizontally polarized. These photons will\npass through the \ufb01lter and their state will\nbe |\u2192\u27e9. Filter C will measure these pho-\ntons with respect to |\u2191\u27e9. But the state\n|\u2192\u27e9 = 0|\u2191\u27e9 + 1|\u2192\u27e9 will be projected onto\n|\u2191\u27e9 with probability 0, and no photons will\npass \ufb01lter C.\nFinally, \ufb01lter B measures the quantum\nstate with respect to the basis\n\u00bd 1\n\u221a\n2\n(|\u2191\u27e9 + |\u2192\u27e9), 1\n\u221a\n2\n(|\u2191\u27e9 \u2212 |\u2192\u27e9)\n\u00be\nwhich we write as {|\u2197\u27e9, |\u2196\u27e9}. Note that\n|\u2192\u27e9 =\n1\n\u221a\n2(|\u2197\u27e9 \u2212 |\u2196\u27e9) and |\u2191\u27e9 =\n1\n\u221a\n2(|\u2197\u27e9 +\n|\u2196\u27e9). Those photons that are measured as\n|\u2197\u27e9 pass through the \ufb01lter. Photons pass-\ning through A with state |\u2192\u27e9 will be mea-\nsured by B as |\u2197\u27e9 with probability 1/2,\nand so 50% of the photons passing through\nA will pass through B and be in state |\u2197\u27e9.\nAs before, these photons will be measured\nby \ufb01lter C as |\u2191\u27e9 with probability 1/2. Thus\nonly one eighth of the original photons\nmanage to pass through the sequence of\n\ufb01lters A, B, and C.\n2.2. State Spaces and Bra/Ket Notation\nThe state space of a quantum system, con-\nsisting of the positions, momentums, po-\nlarizations, spins, and so on of the vari-\nous particles, is modeled by a Hilbert space\nof wave functions. We will not look at the\ndetails of these wave functions. For quan-\ntum computing we need only deal with \ufb01-\nnite quantum systems and it suf\ufb01ces to\nconsider \ufb01nite dimensional complex vec-\ntor spaces with an inner product that are\nspanned by abstract wave functions such\nas |\u2192\u27e9.\nQuantum state spaces and the tranfor-\nmations acting on them can be described\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\n306\nE. Rieffel and W. Polak\nin terms of vectors and matrices or in\nthe more compact bra/ket notation in-\nvented by Dirac [1958]. Kets like |x\u27e9 de-\nnote column vectors and are typically used\nto describe quantum states. The match-\ning bra, \u27e8x|, denotes the conjugate trans-\npose of |x\u27e9. For example, the orthonor-\nmal basis {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9} can be expressed as\n{(1, 0)T, (0, 1)T}. Any complex linear com-\nbination of |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9, a|0\u27e9 + b|1\u27e9, can be\nwritten (a, b)T. Note that the choice of the\norder of the basis vectors is arbitrary. For\nexample, representing |0\u27e9 as (0, 1)T and |1\u27e9\nas (1, 0)T would be \ufb01ne as long as this is\ndone consistently.\nCombining \u27e8x| and | y\u27e9 as in \u27e8x|| y\u27e9, also\nwritten as \u27e8x| y\u27e9, denotes the inner prod-\nuct of the two vectors. For instance, since\n|0\u27e9 is a unit vector we have \u27e80|0\u27e9 = 1 and\nsince |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 are orthogonal we have\n\u27e80|1\u27e9 = 0.\nThe notation |x\u27e9\u27e8 y| is the outer product\nof |x\u27e9 and \u27e8 y|. For example, |0\u27e9\u27e81| is the\ntransformation that maps |1\u27e9 to |0\u27e9 and |0\u27e9\nto (0, 0)T, since\n|0\u27e9\u27e81||1\u27e9 = |0\u27e9\u27e81|1\u27e9 = |0\u27e9\n|0\u27e9\u27e81||0\u27e9 = |0\u27e9\u27e81|0\u27e9 = 0|0\u27e9 =\n\u00b5\n0\n0\n\u00b6\n.\nEquivalently, |0\u27e9\u27e81| can be written in ma-\ntrix form, where |0\u27e9 = (1, 0)T, \u27e80| = (1, 0),\n|1\u27e9 = (0, 1)T, and \u27e81| = (0, 1). Then\n|0\u27e9\u27e81| =\n\u00b5\n1\n0\n\u00b6\n(0, 1) =\n\u00b5\n0 1\n0 0\n\u00b6\n.\nThis notation gives us a convenient way\nof specifying transformations on quantum\nstates in terms of what happens to the ba-\nsis vectors (see Section 4). For example,\nthe transformation that exchanges |0\u27e9 and\n|1\u27e9 is given by the matrix\nX = |0\u27e9\u27e81| + |1\u27e9\u27e80|.\nIn this paper we prefer the slightly more\nintuitive notation\nX : |0\u27e9 \u2192 |1\u27e9\n|1\u27e9 \u2192 |0\u27e9,\nwhich explicitly speci\ufb01es the result of a\ntransformation on the basis vectors.\n3. QUANTUM BITS\nA quantum bit, or qubit, is a unit vector\nin a two-dimensional complex vector space\nfor which a particular basis, denoted by\n{|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9}, has been \ufb01xed. The orthonormal\nbasis |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 may correspond to the |\u2191\u27e9\nand |\u2192\u27e9 polarizations of a photon respec-\ntively, or to the polarizations |\u2197\u27e9 and |\u2196\u27e9.\nOr |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 could correspond to the spin-\nup and spin-down states of an electron.\nWhen talking about qubits, and quantum\ncomputations in general, a \ufb01xed basis with\nrespect to which all statements are made\nhas been chosen in advance. In particular,\nunless otherwise speci\ufb01ed, all measure-\nments will be made with respect to the\nstandard basis for quantum computation,\n{|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9}.\nFor the purposes of quantum computa-\ntion, the basis states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 are taken\nto represent the classical bit values 0 and 1\nrespectively. Unlike classical bits however,\nqubits can be in a superposition of |0\u27e9 and\n|1\u27e9 such as a|0\u27e9 + b|1\u27e9, where a and b are\ncomplex numbers such that |a|2 +|b|2 = 1.\nJust as in the photon polarization case, if\nsuch a superposition is measured with re-\nspect to the basis {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9}, the probability\nthat the measured value is |0\u27e9 is |a|2 and\nthe probability that the measured value is\n|1\u27e9 is |b|2.\nEven though a quantum bit can be put\nin in\ufb01nitely many superposition states, it\nis only possible to extract a single classi-\ncal bit\u2019s worth of information from a sin-\ngle quantum bit. The reason that no more\ninformation can be gained from a qubit\nthan in a classical bit is that informa-\ntion can only be obtained by measurement.\nWhen a qubit is measured, the measure-\nment changes the state to one of the basis\nstates in the way seen in the photon po-\nlarization experiment. As every measure-\nment can result in only one of two states,\none of the basis vectors associated to the\ngiven measuring device, so, just as in the\nclassical case, there are only two possi-\nble results. As measurement changes the\nstate, one cannot measure the state of a\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n307\nqubit in two different bases. Furthermore,\nas we shall see in Section 4.1.2, quantum\nstates cannot be cloned, so it is not possible\nto measure a qubit in two ways, even indi-\nrectly by, say, copying the qubit and mea-\nsuring the copy in a different basis from\nthe original.\n3.1. Quantum Key Distribution\nSequences of single qubits can be used to\ntransmit private keys on insecure chan-\nnels. In 1984 Bennett and Brassard de-\nscribed the \ufb01rst quantum key distribu-\ntion scheme [Bennett and Brassard 1987;\nBennett et al. 1992]. Classically, public key\nencryption techniques (e.g., RSA) are used\nfor key distribution.\nConsider the situation in which Alice\nand Bob want to agree on a secret key\nso that they can communicate privately.\nThey are connected by an ordinary bidirec-\ntional open channel and a unidirectional\nquantum channel, both of which can be ob-\nserved by Eve, who wishes to eavesdrop on\ntheir conversation. This situation is illus-\ntrated in the \ufb01gure that follows. The quan-\ntum channel allows Alice to send individ-\nual particles (e.g., photons) to Bob who can\nmeasure their quantum state. Eve can at-\ntempt to measure the state of these parti-\ncles and can resend the particles to Bob.\nTo begin the process of establishing a\nsecret key, Alice sends a sequence of bits to\nBob by encoding each bit in the quantum\nstate of a photon as follows. For each bit,\nAlice randomly uses one of the following\ntwo bases for encoding each bit:\n0 \u2192 |\u2191\u27e9\n1 \u2192 |\u2192\u27e9\nor\n0 \u2192 |\u2196\u27e9\n1 \u2192 |\u2197\u27e9.\nBob measures the state of the photons he\nreceives by randomly picking either ba-\nsis. After the bits have been transmitted,\nBob and Alice communicate the basis they\nused for encoding and decoding of each bit\nover the open channel. With this informa-\ntion both can determine which bits have\nbeen transmitted correctly, by identifying\nthose bits for which the sending and re-\nceiving bases agree. They will use these\nbits as the key and discard all the others.\nOn average, Alice and Bob will agree on\n50% of all bits transmitted.\nSuppose that Eve measures the state\nof the photons transmitted by Alice and\nre-sends new photons with the measured\nstate. In this process she will use the\nwrong basis approximately 50% of the\ntime, in which case she will re-send the bit\nwith the wrong basis. So when Bob mea-\nsures a re-sent qubit with the correct ba-\nsis, there will be a 25% probability that\nhe measures the wrong value. Thus any\neavesdropper on the quantum channel is\nbound to introduce a high error rate that\nAlice and Bob can detect by communicat-\ning a suf\ufb01cient number of parity bits of\ntheir keys over the open channel. So, not\nonly is it likely that Eve\u2019s version of the\nkey is 25% incorrect, but the fact that\nsomeone is eavesdropping will be appar-\nent to Alice and Bob.\nOther techniques for exploiting quan-\ntum effects for key distribution have been\nproposed. See, for example, Ekert et al.\n[1992], Bennett [1992], and Lo and Chau\n[1999]. But none of the quantum key dis-\ntribution techniques are substitutes for\npublic key encryption schemes. Attacks\nby eavesdroppers other than the one de-\nscribed here are possible. Security against\nall such schemes is discussed in both\nMayers [1998] and Lo and Chau [1999].\nQuantum key distribution has been re-\nalized over a distance of 24 km using\nstandard \ufb01ber optical cables [Hughes et al.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\n308\nE. Rieffel and W. Polak\n1997] and over 0.5 km through the atmo-\nsphere [Hughes et al. 1999].\n3.2. Multiple Qubits\nImagine a macroscopic physical object\nbreaking apart and multiple pieces \ufb02ying\noff in different directions. The state of this\nsystem can be described completely by de-\nscribing the state of each of its compo-\nnent pieces separately. A surprising and\nunintuitive aspect of the state space of\nan n-particle quantum system is that the\nstate of the system cannot always be de-\nscribed in terms of the state of its compo-\nnent pieces. It is when examining systems\nof more than one qubit that one \ufb01rst gets a\nglimpse of where the computational power\nof quantum computers could come from.\nAs\nwe\nsaw,\nthe\nstate\nof\na\nqubit\ncan be represented by a vector in the\ntwo-dimensional\ncomplex\nvector\nspace\nspanned by |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. In classical physics,\nthe possible states of a system of n par-\nticles, whose individual states can be de-\nscribed by a vector in a two-dimensional\nvector space, form a vector space of 2n di-\nmensions. However, in a quantum system\nthe resulting state space is much larger; a\nsystem of n qubits has a state space of 2n\ndimensions.4 It is this exponential growth\nof the state space with the number of par-\nticles that suggests a possible exponential\nspeed-up of computation on quantum com-\nputers over classical computers.\nIndividual state spaces of n particles\ncombine classically through the cartesian\nproduct. Quantum states, however, com-\nbine through the tensor product. Details\non properties of tensor products and their\nexpression in terms of vectors and matri-\nces are given in Appendix A. Let us look\nbrie\ufb02y at distinctions between the carte-\nsian product and the tensor product that\nwill be crucial to understanding quantum\ncomputation.\nLet V and W be 2 two-dimensional com-\nplex vector spaces with bases {v1, v2} and\n4 Actually, as we shall see, the state space is the set\nof normalized vectors in this 2n dimensional space,\njust as the state a|0\u27e9 + b|1\u27e9 of a qubit is normalized\nso that |a|2 + |b|2 = 1.\n{w1, w2} respectively. The cartesian prod-\nuct of these two spaces can take as its\nbasis the union of the bases of its com-\nponent spaces {v1, v2, w1, w2}. Note that\nthe order of the basis was chosen arbi-\ntrarily. In particular, the dimension of the\nstate space of multiple classical particles\ngrows linearly with the number of parti-\ncles, since dim(X \u00d7Y ) = dim(X )+dim(Y ).\nThe tensor product of V and W has ba-\nsis {v1 \u2297 w1, v1 \u2297 w2, v2 \u2297 w1, v2 \u2297 w2}.\nNote that the order of the basis, again,\nis arbitrary.5 So the state space for two\nqubits, each with basis {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9}, has ba-\nsis {|0\u27e9 \u2297 |0\u27e9, |0\u27e9 \u2297 |1\u27e9, |1\u27e9 \u2297 |0\u27e9, |1\u27e9 \u2297 |1\u27e9},\nwhich can be written more compactly as\n{|00\u27e9, |01\u27e9, |10\u27e9, |11\u27e9}. More generally, we\nwrite |x\u27e9 to mean |bnbn\u22121 . . . b0\u27e9 where bi\nare the binary digits of the number x.\nA basis for a 3-qubit system is\n{|000\u27e9, |001\u27e9, |010\u27e9, |011\u27e9,\n|100\u27e9, |101\u27e9, |110\u27e9, |111\u27e9}\nand in general an n-qubit system has 2n\nbasis vectors. We can now see the expo-\nnential growth of the state space with the\nnumber of quantum particles. The tensor\nproduct X \u2297 Y has dimension dim(X ) \u00d7\ndim(Y ).\nThe state |00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9 is an example of a\nquantum state that cannot be described in\nterms of the state of each of its components\n(qubits) separately. In other words, we\ncannot \ufb01nd a1, a2, b1, b2 such that (a1|0\u27e9 +\nb1|1\u27e9) \u2297 (a2|0\u27e9 + b2|1\u27e9) = |00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9, since\n(a1|0\u27e9 + b1|1\u27e9) \u2297 (a2|0\u27e9 + b2|1\u27e9) = a1a2|00\u27e9\n+ a1b2|01\u27e9 + b1a2|10\u27e9 + b1b2|11\u27e9\nand a1b2 = 0 implies that either a1a2 = 0\nor b1b2 = 0. States that cannot be decom-\nposed in this way are called entangled\nstates. These states represent situations\nthat have no classical counterpart and for\nwhich we have no intuition. These are also\nthe states that provide the exponential\ngrowth of quantum state spaces with the\nnumber of particles.\n5 It is only when we use matrix notation to describe\nstate transformations that the order of basis vectors\nbecomes relevant.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n309\nNote that it would require vast re-\nsources to simulate even a small quan-\ntum system on traditional computers. The\nevolution of quantum systems is exponen-\ntially faster than their classical simula-\ntions. The reason for the potential power\nof quantum computers is the possibility of\nexploiting the quantum state evolution as\na computational mechanism.\n3.3. Measurement\nThe experiment in Section 2.1.2 illus-\ntrates how measurement of a single qubit\nprojects the quantum state on to one of the\nbasis states associated with the measur-\ning device. The result of a measurement is\nprobabilistic and the process of measure-\nment changes the state to that measured.\nLet us look at an example of measure-\nment in a two-qubit system. Any two-qubit\nstate can be expressed as a|00\u27e9 + b|01\u27e9 +\nc|10\u27e9+d|11\u27e9, where a, b, c, and d are com-\nplex numbers such that |a|2 + |b|2 + |c|2 +\n|d|2 = 1. Suppose we wish to measure\nthe \ufb01rst qubit with respect to the stan-\ndard basis {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9}. For convenience we\nwill rewrite the state as follows:\na|00\u27e9 + b|01\u27e9 + c|10\u27e9 + d|11\u27e9\n= |0\u27e9 \u2297 (a|0\u27e9 + b|1\u27e9) + |1\u27e9 \u2297 (c|0\u27e9 + d|1\u27e9)\n= u|0\u27e9 \u2297 (a/u|0\u27e9 + b/u|1\u27e9) + v|1\u27e9\n\u2297 (c/v|0\u27e9 + d/v|1\u27e9).\nFor u =\np\n|a|2 + |b|2 and v =\np\n|c|2 + |d|2\nthe vectors a/u|0\u27e9 + b/u|1\u27e9 and c/v|0\u27e9 +\nd/v|1\u27e9 are of unit length. Once the state\nhas been rewritten as above, as a tensor\nproduct of the bit being measured and a\nsecond vector of unit length, the probabal-\nistic result of a measurement is easy to\nread off. Measurement of the \ufb01rst bit will\nwith probability u2 = |a|2 + |b|2 return\n|0\u27e9, projecting the state to |0\u27e9 \u2297 (a/u|0\u27e9 +\nb/u|1\u27e9), or with probability v = |c|2 + |d|2\nyield |1\u27e9, projecting the state to |1\u27e9 \u2297\n(c/v|0\u27e9 + d/v|1\u27e9). As |0\u27e9 \u2297 (a/u|0\u27e9 + b/u|1\u27e9)\nand |1\u27e9 \u2297 (c/v|0\u27e9 + d/v|1\u27e9) are both unit\nvectors, no scaling is necessary. Measur-\ning the second bit works similarly.\nFor the purposes of quantum computa-\ntion, multibit measurement can be treated\nas a series of single-bit measurements in\nthe standard basis. Other sorts of mea-\nsurements are possible, such as measur-\ning whether two qubits have the same\nvalue without learning the actual value\nof the two qubits. But such measurements\nare equivalent to unitary transformations\nfollowed by a standard measurement of in-\ndividual qubits, and so it suf\ufb01ces to look\nonly at standard measurements.\nIn the two-qubit example, the state\nspace is a cartesian product of the sub-\nspace consisting of all states whose \ufb01rst\nqubit is in the state |0\u27e9 and the orthog-\nonal subspace of states whose \ufb01rst qubit\nis in the state |1\u27e9. Any quantum state\ncan be written as the sum of two vectors,\none in each of the subspaces. A measure-\nment of k qubits in the standard basis\nhas 2k possible outcomes mi. Any device\nmeasuring k qubits of an n-qubit system\nsplits of the 2n-dimensional state space H\ninto a cartesian product of orthogonal sub-\nspaces S1, . . . , S2k with H = S1 \u00d7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00d7 S2k,\nsuch that the value of the k qubits be-\ning measured is mi and the state after\nmeasurement is in space the space Si for\nsome i. The device randomly chooses one\nof the Si\u2019s, with probability the square of\nthe amplitude of the component of \u03c8 in\nSi, and projects the state into that com-\nponent, scaling to give length 1. Equiva-\nlently, the probability that the result of the\nmeasurement is a given value is the sum\nof the squares of the the absolute values\nof the amplitudes of all basis vectors com-\npatible with that value of the measure-\nment.\nMeasurement gives another way of\nthinking about entangled particles. Par-\nticles are not entangled if the measure-\nment of one has no effect on the other.\nFor instance, the state\n1\n\u221a\n2(|00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9) is\nentangled, since the probability that the\n\ufb01rst bit is measured to be |0\u27e9 is 1/2 if the\nsecond bit has not been measured. How-\never, if the second bit had been measured,\nthe probability that the \ufb01rst bit is mea-\nsured as |0\u27e9 is either 1 or 0, depending on\nwhether the second bit was measured as\n|0\u27e9 or |1\u27e9 respectively. Thus the probable\nresult of measuring the \ufb01rst bit is changed\nby a measurement of the second bit. On\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\n310\nE. Rieffel and W. Polak\nthe other hand, the state\n1\n\u221a\n2(|00\u27e9 + |01\u27e9)\nis not entangled: since\n1\n\u221a\n2(|00\u27e9 + |01\u27e9) =\n|0\u27e9\u2297 1\n\u221a\n2(|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9), any measurement of the\n\ufb01rst bit will yield |0\u27e9 regardless of whether\nthe second bit was measured. Similarly,\nthe second bit has a \ufb01fty-\ufb01fty chance of be-\ning measured as |0\u27e9 regardless of whether\nthe \ufb01rst bit was measured or not. Note\nthat entanglement, in the sense that mea-\nsurement of one particle has an effect\non measurements of another particle, is\nequivalent to our previous de\ufb01nition of en-\ntangled states as states that cannot be\nwritten as a tensor product of individual\nstates.\n3.4. The EPR Paradox\nEinstein, Podolsky, and Rosen proposed a\ngedanken experiment that uses entangled\nparticles in a manner that seemed to vi-\nolate fundamental principles of relativity.\nImagine a source that generates two maxi-\nmally entangled particles\n1\n\u221a\n2|00\u27e9+ 1\n\u221a\n2|11\u27e9,\ncalled an EPR pair, and sends one each\nto Alice and Bob.\nAlice and Bob can be arbitrarily far\napart. Suppose that Alice measures her\nparticle and observes state |0\u27e9. This means\nthat the combined state will now be |00\u27e9,\nand if now Bob measures his particle he\nwill also observe |0\u27e9. Similarly, if Alice\nmeasures |1\u27e9, so will Bob. Note that the\nchange of the combined quantum state oc-\ncurs instantaneously even though the two\nparticles may be arbitrarily far apart. It\nappears that this would enable Alice and\nBob to communicate faster than the speed\nof light. Further analysis, as we shall see,\nshows that even though there is a coupling\nbetween the two particles, there is no way\nfor Alice or Bob to use this mechanism to\ncommunicate.\nThere are two standard ways that peo-\nple use to describe entangled states and\ntheir measurement. Both have their posi-\ntive aspects, but both are incorrect and can\nlead to misunderstandings. Let us exam-\nine both in turn.\nEinstein, Podolsky, and Rosen proposed\nthat each particle has some internal state\nthat completely determines what the re-\nsult of any given measurement will be.\nThis state is, for the moment, hidden from\nus, and therefore the best we can currently\ndo is to give probabilistic predictions. Such\na theory is known as a local hidden vari-\nable theory. The simplest hidden variable\ntheory for an EPR pair is that the par-\nticles are either both in state |0\u27e9 or both\nin state |1\u27e9, we just don\u2019t happen to know\nwhich. In such a theory no communication\nbetween possibly distant particles is nec-\nessary to explain the correlated measure-\nments. However, this point of view can-\nnot explain the results of measurements\nwith respect to a different basis. In fact,\nBell showed that any local hidden vari-\nable theory predicts that certain measure-\nments will satisfy an inequality, known as\nBell\u2019s inequality. However, the result of ac-\ntual experiments performing these mea-\nsurements show that Bell\u2019s inequality is\nviolated. Thus quantum mechanics cannot\nbe explained by any local hidden variable\ntheory. See Greenstein and Zajonc [1997]\nfor a highly readable account of Bell\u2019s the-\norem and related experiments.\nThe second standard description is in\nterms of cause and effect. For example,\nwe said earlier that a measurement per-\nformed by Alice affects a measurement\nperformed by Bob. However, this view is\nincorrect also, and results, as Einstein,\nPodolsky, and Rosen recognized, in deep\ninconsistencies when combined with rela-\ntivity theory. It is possible to set up the\nEPR scenario so that one observer sees\nAlice measure \ufb01rst, then Bob, while an-\nother observer sees Bob measure \ufb01rst,\nthen Alice. According to relativity, physics\nmust equally well explain the observa-\ntions of the \ufb01rst observer as the second.\nWhile our terminology of cause and ef-\nfect cannot be compatible with both ob-\nservers, the actual experimental values\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n311\nare invariant under change of observer.\nThe experimental results can be explained\nequally well by Bob\u2019s measuring \ufb01rst and\ncausing a change in the state of Alice\u2019s par-\nticle, as the other way around. This sym-\nmetry shows that Alice and Bob cannot, in\nfact, use their EPR pair to communicate\nfaster than the speed of light, and thus re-\nsolves the apparent paradox. All that can\nbe said is that Alice and Bob will observe\nthe same random behavior.\nAs we will see in the section on dense\ncoding and teleportation, EPR pairs can\nbe used to aid communication, albeit\ncommunication slower than the speed of\nlight.\n4. QUANTUM GATES\nSo far we have looked at static quantum\nsystems, which change only when mea-\nsured. The dynamics of a quantum system,\nwhen not being measured, are governed\nby Schr\u00a8odinger\u2019s equation; the dynamics\nmust take states to states in a way that\npreserves orthogonality. For a complex\nvector space, linear transformations that\npreserve orthogonality are unitary trans-\nformations, de\ufb01ned as follows. Any linear\ntransformation on a complex vector space\ncan be described by a matrix. Let M \u2217 de-\nnote the conjugate transpose of the ma-\ntrix M. A matrix M is unitary (describes\na unitary transformation) if M M \u2217 = I.\nAny unitary transformation of a quan-\ntum state space is a legitimate quan-\ntum transformation, and vice versa.

See Feynman\u2019s Lectures on Com-\nputation [Feynman 1996] for an account\nof reversible computation and its rela-\ntion to the energy of computation and\ninformation.\n4.1. Simple Quantum Gates\nThe following are some examples of use-\nful single-qubit quantum state transfor-\nmations. Because of linearity, the transfor-\nmations are fully speci\ufb01ed by their effect\non the basis vectors. The associated ma-\ntrix, with {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9} as the preferred ordered\nbasis, is also shown.\nI : |0\u27e9 \u2192 |0\u27e9\n|1\u27e9 \u2192 |1\u27e9\n\u00b5\n1 0\n0 1\n\u00b6\nX : |0\u27e9 \u2192 |1\u27e9\n|1\u27e9 \u2192 |0\u27e9\n\u00b5\n0 1\n1 0\n\u00b6\nY : |0\u27e9 \u2192 \u2212|1\u27e9\n|1\u27e9 \u2192 |0\u27e9\n\u00b5\n0\n1\n\u22121 0\n\u00b6\nZ : |0\u27e9 \u2192 |0\u27e9\n|1\u27e9 \u2192 \u2212|1\u27e9\n\u00b5\n1\n0\n0 \u22121\n\u00b6\nThe names of these transformations are\nconventional. I is the identity transforma-\ntion, X is negation, Z is a phase shift op-\neration, and Y = Z X is a combination of\nboth. The X transformation was discussed\npreviously in Section 2.2. It can be readily\nveri\ufb01ed that these gates are unitary. For\nexample\nY Y \u2217 =\n\u00b5\n0 \u22121\n1\n0\n\u00b6\u00b5\n0\n1\n\u22121 0\n\u00b6\n= I.\nThe controlled-NOT gate, Cnot, operates\non two qubits as follows: it changes the\nsecond bit if the \ufb01rst bit is 1 and leaves\nthis bit unchanged otherwise. The vec-\ntors |00\u27e9, |01\u27e9, |10\u27e9, and |11\u27e9 form an or-\nthonormal basis for the state space of\na two-qubit system, a four-dimensional\ncomplex vector space. In order to repre-\nsent transformations of this space in ma-\ntrix notation we need to choose an isomor-\nphism between this space and the space\nof complex 4-tuples. There is no reason,\nother than convention, to pick one iso-\nmorphism over another. The one we use\nhere associates |00\u27e9, |01\u27e9, |10\u27e9, and |11\u27e9\nto the standard 4-tuple basis (1, 0, 0, 0)T,\n(0, 1, 0, 0)T, (0, 0, 1, 0)T, and (0, 0, 0, 1)T,\nin that order. The Cnot transformation has\nrepresentations\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\n312\nE. Rieffel and W.

The Cnot gate\ncannot be decomposed into a tensor prod-\nuct of two single-bit transformations.\nIt is useful to have graphical represen-\ntations of quantum state transformations,\nespecially when several transformations\nare combined. The controlled-NOT gate Cnot\nis typically represented by a circuit of the\nform\nThe open circle indicates the control bit,\nand the \u00d7 indicates the conditional nega-\ntion of the subject bit. In general there can\nbe multiple control bits. Some authors use\na solid circle to indicate negative control,\nin which the subject bit is toggled when\nthe control bit is 0.\nSimilarly, the controlled-controlled-NOT,\nwhich negates the last bit of three if and\nonly if the \ufb01rst two are both 1, has the\nfollowing graphical representation.\nSingle bit operations are graphically\nrepresented\nby\nappropriately\nlabeled\nboxes as shown.\n4.1.1 The\nWalsh\u2013Hadamard\nTransformation.\nAnother important single-bit transfor-\nmation is the Hadamard transformation,\nde\ufb01ned by\nH : |0\u27e9 \u2192\n1\n\u221a\n2(|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9)\n|1\u27e9 \u2192\n1\n\u221a\n2(|0\u27e9 \u2212 |1\u27e9).\nThe transformation H has a number\nof important applications. When applied\nto |0\u27e9, H creates a superposition state\n1\n\u221a\n2(|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9). Applied to n bits individu-\nally, H generates a superposition of all 2n\npossible states, which can be viewed as\nthe binary representation of the numbers\nfrom 0 to 2n \u2212 1.\n(H \u2297 H \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 H)|00 . . . 0\u27e9\n=\n1\n\u221a\n2n ((|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9) \u2297 (|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9)\n\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 (|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9))\n=\n1\n\u221a\n2n\n2n\u22121\nX\nx=0\n|x\u27e9.\nThe transformation that applies H to\nn bits is called the Walsh, or Walsh\u2013\nHadamard, transformation W.

The no cloning proof given\nhere, originally due to Wootters and Zurek\n[1982], is a simple application of the lin-\nearity of unitary transformations.\nAssume that U is a unitary transforma-\ntion that clones, in that U(|a0\u27e9) = |aa\u27e9\nfor all quantum states |a\u27e9. Let |a\u27e9 and |b\u27e9\nbe two orthogonal quantum states. Say\nU(|a0\u27e9) = |aa\u27e9 and U(|b0\u27e9) = |bb\u27e9. Con-\nsider |c\u27e9 = (1/\n\u221a\n2)(|a\u27e9 + |b\u27e9). By linearity,\nU(|c0\u27e9) =\n1\n\u221a\n2\n(U(|a0\u27e9) + U(|b0\u27e9))\n=\n1\n\u221a\n2\n(|aa\u27e9 + |bb\u27e9).\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n313\nBut if U is a cloning transformation then\nU(|c0\u27e9) = |cc\u27e9 = 1/2(|aa\u27e9 + |ab\u27e9\n+ |ba\u27e9 + |bb\u27e9),\nwhich is not equal to (1/\n\u221a\n2)(|aa\u27e9 + |bb\u27e9).\nThus there is no unitary operation that\ncan reliably clone unknown quantum\nstates. It is clear that cloning is not possi-\nble by using measurement, since measure-\nment is both probabalistic and destructive\nof states not in the measuring device\u2019s as-\nsociated subspaces.\nIt is important to understand what sort\nof cloning is and isn\u2019t allowed. It is pos-\nsible to clone a known quantum state.\nWhat the no cloning principle tells us\nis that it is impossible to reliably clone\nan unknown quantum state. Also, it is\npossible to obtain n particles in an en-\ntangled state a|00 . . . 0\u27e9 + b|11 . . . 1\u27e9 from\nan unknown state a|0\u27e9 + b|1\u27e9. Each of\nthese particles will behave in exactly the\nsame way when measured with respect to\nthe standard basis for quantum compu-\ntation {|00 . . . 0\u27e9, |00 . . . 01\u27e9, . . . , |11 . . . 1\u27e9},\nbut not when measured with respect to\nother bases. It is not possible to create the\nn-particle state (a|0\u27e9 + b|1\u27e9) \u2297 . . . \u2297 (a|0\u27e9 +\nb|1\u27e9) from an unknown state a|0\u27e9 + b|1\u27e9.\n4.2. Examples\nThe use of simple quantum gates can be\nstudied with two simple examples: dense\ncoding and teleportation.\nDense coding uses one quantum bit to-\ngether with an EPR pair to encode and\ntransmit two classical bits. Since EPR\npairs can be distributed ahead of time,\nonly one qubit (particle) needs to be physi-\ncally transmitted to communicate two bits\nof information. This result is surprising\nsince, as was discussed in Section 3, only\none classical bit\u2019s worth of information can\nbe extracted from a qubit. Teleportation\nis the opposite of dense coding, in that it\nuses two classical bits to transmit a single\nqubit. Teleportation is surprising in light\nof the no cloning principle of quantum me-\nchanics, in that it enables the transmis-\nsion of an unknown quantum state.\nThe key to both dense coding and tele-\nportation is the use of entangled particles.\nThe initial set up is the same for both pro-\ncesses. Alice and Bob wish to communi-\ncate. Each is sent one of the entangled par-\nticles making up an EPR pair,\n\u03c80 =\n1\n\u221a\n2\n(|00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9).\nSay Alice is sent the \ufb01rst particle, and\nBob the second. Until a particle is trans-\nmitted, only Alice can perform transfor-\nmations on her particle, and only Bob can\nperform transformations on his.\n4.2.1 Dense\nCoding.\nAlice. Alice\nreceives\ntwo classical bits, encoding the num-\nbers 0 through 3. Depending on this\nnumber Alice performs one of the trans-\nformations {I, X, Y, Z} on her qubit of the\nentangled pair \u03c80. Transforming just one\nbit of an entangled pair means performing\nthe identity transformation on the other\nbit. The resulting state is shown in the\ntable.\nValue Transformation\nNew state\n0\n\u03c80 = (I \u2297 I)\u03c80\n1\n\u221a\n2(|00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9)\n1\n\u03c81 = (X \u2297 I)\u03c80\n1\n\u221a\n2(|10\u27e9 + |01\u27e9)\n2\n\u03c82 = (Y \u2297 I)\u03c80\n1\n\u221a\n2(\u2212|10\u27e9 + |01\u27e9)\n3\n\u03c83 = (Z \u2297 I)\u03c80\n1\n\u221a\n2(|00\u27e9 \u2212 |11\u27e9)\nAlice then sends her qubit to Bob.\nBob.

QUANTUM COMPUTERS\nThis section discusses how quantum me-\nchanics can be used to perform compu-\ntations and how these computations are\nqualitatively different from those per-\nformed by a conventional computer. Re-\ncall from Section 4 that all quantum state\ntransformations have to be reversible.\nWhile the classical NOT gate is reversible,\nAND,\nOR, and\nNAND gates are not. Thus\nit is not obvious that quantum trans-\nformations can carry out all classical\ncomputations. The \ufb01rst subsection de-\nscribes complete sets of reversible gates\nthat can perform any classical computa-\ntion on a quantum computer. Further-\nmore, it describes sets of gates with which\nall quantum computations can be done.\nThe second subsection discusses quantum\nparallelism.\n5.1. Quantum Gate Arrays\nThe bra/ket notation is useful in de\ufb01ning\ncomplex unitary operations. For two arbi-\ntrary unitary transformations U1 and U2,\nthe \u201cconditional\u201d transformation |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u2297\nU1 + |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u2297 U2 is also unitary. The\ncontrolled-NOT gate can be de\ufb01ned by\nCnot = |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u2297 I + |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u2297 X.\nThe three-bit controlled-controlled-NOT\ngate or Toffoli gate of Section 4 is also an\ninstance of this conditional de\ufb01nition:\nT = |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u2297 I \u2297 I + |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u2297 Cnot.\nThe Toffoli gate T can be used to construct\ncomplete set of boolean connectives, as can\nbe seen from the fact that it can be used to\nconstruct the AND and NOT operators in the\nfollowing way:\nT|1, 1, x\u27e9 = |1, 1, \u00acx\u27e9\nT|x, y, 0\u27e9 = |x, y, x \u2227 y\u27e9\nThe T gate is suf\ufb01cient to construct arbi-\ntrary combinatorial circuits.\nThe following quantum circuit, for ex-\nample, implements a 1 bit full adder using\nToffoli and controlled-NOT gates:\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\n316\nE. Rieffel and W. Polak\nwhere x and y are the data bits, s is their\nsum (modulo 2), c is the incoming carry\nbit, and c\u2032 is the new carry bit. Vedral,\nBarenco, and Ekert [1996] de\ufb01ne more\ncomplex circuits that include in-place ad-\ndition and modular addition.\nThe Fredkin gate is a \u201ccontrolled swap\u201d\nand can be de\ufb01ned as\nF = |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u2297 I \u2297 I + |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u2297 S\nwhere S is the swap operation\nS = |00\u27e9\u27e800|+|01\u27e9\u27e810|+|10\u27e9\u27e801|+|11\u27e9\u27e811|.\nThe reader can verify that F, like T, is\ncomplete for combinatorial circuits.\nDeutsch has shown [1985] that it is\npossible to construct reversible quantum\ngates for any classically computable func-\ntion. In fact, it is possible to conceive\nof a universal quantum Turing machine\n[Bernstein and Vazirani 1997]. In this con-\nstruction we must assume a suf\ufb01cient sup-\nply of bits that correspond to the tape of a\nTuring machine.\nKnowing that an arbitrary classical\nfunction f with m input and k output\nbits can be implemented on quantum\ncomputer, we assume the existence of a\nquantum gate array U f that implements\nf . U f is a m+k\u2013bit transformation of the\nform U f : |x, y\u27e9 \u2192 |x, y \u2295 f (x)\u27e9, where \u2295\ndenotes the bitwise exclusive-OR.6 Quan-\ntum gate arrays U f , de\ufb01ned in this way,\nare unitary for any function f . To compute\nf (x) we apply U f to |x\u27e9 tensored with\nk zeros |x, 0\u27e9. Since f (x) \u2295 f (x) = 0 we\nhave U f U f = I. Graphically the trans-\nformation U f : |x, y\u27e9 \u2192 |x, y \u2295 f (x)\u27e9 is\ndepicted as\n6 \u2295 is not the direct sum of vectors.\nWhile the T and F gates are complete\nfor combinatorial circuits, they cannot\nachieve arbitrary quantum state trans-\nformations. In order to realize arbitrary\nunitary transformations,7 single-bit rota-\ntions need to be included. Barenco et al.\n[1995] show that Cnot together with all\n1-bit quantum gates is a universal gate\nset. It suf\ufb01ces to include the following 1-bit\ntransformations\n\u00b5 cos \u03b1\nsin \u03b1\n\u2212 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1\n\u00b6\n,\n\u00b5\nei\u03b1\n0\n0\ne\u2212i\u03b1\n\u00b6\nfor all 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03c0 together with the Cnot to\nobtain a universal set of gates. As we shall\nsee, such nonclassical transformations are\ncrucial for exploiting the power of quan-\ntum computers.\n5.2. Quantum Parallelism\nWhat happens if U f is applied to input\nthat is in a superposition? The answer\nis easy but powerful: since U f is a lin-\near transformation, it is applied to all ba-\nsis vectors in the superposition simulta-\nneously and will generate a superposition\nof the results. In this way, it is possible to\ncompute f (x) for n values of x in a sin-\ngle application of U f . This effect is called\nquantum parallelism.\nThe\npower\nof\nquantum\nalgorithms\ncomes from taking advantage of quan-\ntum parallelism and entanglement. So\nmost quantum algorithms begin by com-\nputing a function of interest on a super-\nposition of all values as follows. Start\nwith an n-qubit state |00 . . . 0\u27e9.

Note\nthat since n qubits enable working simul-\ntaneously with 2n states, quantum paral-\nlelism circumvents the time/space trade-\noff of classical parallelism through its\nability to provide an exponential amount\nof computational space in a linear amount\nof physical space.\nConsider\nthe\ntrivial\nexample\nof\na\ncontrolled-controlled-NOT (Toffoli) gate, T,\nthat computes the conjunction of two val-\nues:\nNow take as input a superposition of all\npossible bit combinations of x and y to-\ngether with the necessary 0:\nH|0\u27e9 \u2297 H|0\u27e9 \u2297 |0\u27e9\n=\n1\n\u221a\n2\n(|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9) \u2297 1\n\u221a\n2\n(|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9) \u2297 |0\u27e9\n= 1\n2(|000\u27e9 + |010\u27e9 + |100\u27e9 + |110\u27e9).\nApply T to the superposition of inputs to\nget a superposition of the results, namely\nT(H|0\u27e9 \u2297 H|0\u27e9 \u2297 |0\u27e9) = 1\n2(|000\u27e9 + |010\u27e9\n+ |100\u27e9 + |111\u27e9).\nThe resulting superposition can be viewed\nas a truth table for the conjunction, or\nmore generally as the graph of a function.\nIn the output the values of x, y, and x \u2227 y\nare entangled in such a way that measur-\ning the result will give one line of the truth\ntable, or more generally one point of graph\nof the function. Note that the bits can be\nmeasured in any order: measuring the re-\nsult will project the state to a superposi-\ntion of the set of all input values for which\nf produces this result, and measuring the\ninput will project the result to the corre-\nsponding function value.\nMeasuring at this point gives no ad-\nvantage over classical parallelism because\nonly one result is obtained, and worse still\none cannot even choose which result one\ngets. The heart of any quantum algorithm\nis the way in which it manipulates quan-\ntum parallelism so that desired results\nwill be measured with high probability.\nThis sort of manipulation has no classical\nanalog and requires nontraditional pro-\ngramming techniques. We list a couple of\nthe techniques currently known.\nr Amplify output values of interest. The\ngeneral idea is to transform the state in\nsuch a way that values of interest have\na larger amplitude and therefore have\na higher probability of being measured.\nExamples of this approach will be de-\nscribed in Section 7.\nr Find common properties of all the val-\nues of f (x). This idea is exploited in\nShor\u2019s algorithm, which uses a quantum\nFourier transformation to obtain the pe-\nriod of f .\n6. SHOR\u2019S ALGORITHM\nIn 1994, inspired by work of Daniel Si-\nmon (later published in Simon [1997]),\nPeter Shor found a bounded probabil-\nity polynomial time algorithm for fac-\ntoring n-digit numbers on a quantum\ncomputer. Since the 1970s people have\nsearched for ef\ufb01cient algorithms for factor-\ning integers. The most ef\ufb01cient classical\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\n318\nE. Rieffel and W. Polak\nalgorithm known today is that of Lenstra\nand Lenstra [1993], which is exponential\nin the size of the input. The input is the list\nof digits of M, which has size n \u223c log M.\nPeople were con\ufb01dent enough that no ef\ufb01-\ncient algorithm existed, that the security\nof cryptographic systems, like the widely\nused RSA algorithm, depend on the dif-\n\ufb01culty of this problem. Shor\u2019s result sur-\nprised the community at large, prompting\nwidespread interest in quantum comput-\ning.\nMost factoring algorithms, including\nShor\u2019s, use a standard reduction of the\nfactoring problem to the problem of \ufb01nd-\ning the period of a function. Shor uses\nquantum parallelism in the standard way\nto obtain a superposition of all the values\nof the function in one step. He then com-\nputes the quantum Fourier transform of\nthe function, which, like classical Fourier\ntransforms, puts all the amplitude of the\nfunction into multiples of the reciprocal of\nthe period. With high probability, measur-\ning the state yields the period, which in\nturn is used to factor the integer M.\nThis description captures the essence\nof the quantum algorithm but is some-\nthing of an oversimpli\ufb01cation. The biggest\ncomplication is that the quantum Fourier\ntransform is based on the fast Fourier\ntransform and thus gives only approxi-\nmate results in most cases. Thus extract-\ning the period is trickier than outlined\nhere, but the techniques for extracting the\nperiod are classical.\nWe will \ufb01rst describe the quantum\nFourier transform and then give a detailed\noutline of Shor\u2019s algorithm.\n6.1. The Quantum Fourier Transform\nFourier transforms in general map from\nthe time domain to the frequency domain.\nSo Fourier transforms map functions of pe-\nriod r to functions that have nonzero val-\nues only at multiples of the frequency 2\u03c0\nr .\nThe discrete Fourier transform (DFT) op-\nerates on N equally spaced samples in the\ninterval [0, 2\u03c0) for some N and outputs a\nfunction whose domain is the integers be-\ntween 0 and N \u2212 1. The discrete Fourier\ntransform of a (sampled) function of period\nr is a function concentrated near multi-\nples of N\nr . If the period r divides N evenly,\nthe result is a function that has nonzero\nvalues only at multiples of N\nr . Otherwise,\nthe result will approximate this behavior,\nand there will be nonzero terms at integers\nclose to multiples of N\nr .\nThe Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a\nversion of DFT where N is a power of 2.\nThe quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is\na variant of the discrete Fourier trans-\nform, which, like FFT, uses powers of 2.\nThe quantum Fourier transform operates\non the amplitude of the quantum state, by\nsending\nX\nx\ng(x)|x\u27e9 \u2192\nX\nc\nG(c)|c\u27e9,\nwhere G(c) is the discrete Fourier trans-\nform of g(x), and x and c both range over\nthe binary representations for the integers\nbetween 0 and N \u2212 1. If the state were\nmeasured after the Fourier transform was\nperformed, the probability that the result\nwas |c\u27e9 would be |G(c)|2. Note that the\nquantum Fourier transform does not out-\nput a function the way the U f transforma-\ntion does; no output appears in an extra\nregister.\nApplying the quantum Fourier trans-\nform to a periodic function g(x) with pe-\nriod r, we would expect to end up with\nP\nc G(c)|c\u27e9, where G(c) is zero except at\nmultiples of\nN\nr . Thus, when the state is\nmeasured, the result would be a multiple\nof N\nr , say j N\nr . But as described above, the\nquantum Fourier transform only gives ap-\nproximate results for periods that are not\na power of two (i.e., do not divide N). How-\never the larger the power of two used as a\nbase for the transform, the better the ap-\nproximation. The quantum Fourier trans-\nform UQFT with base N = 2m is de\ufb01ned\nby\nUQFT : |x\u27e9 \u2192\n1\n\u221a\n2m\n2m\u22121\nX\nc=0\nexp\n\u00b52\u03c0icx\n2m\n\u00b6\n|c\u27e9.\nIn order for Shor\u2019s algorithm to be\na polynomial algorithm, the quantum\nFourier transform must be ef\ufb01ciently\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n319\ncomputable. Shor shows that the quan-\ntum Fourier transform with base 2m can be\nconstructed using only m(m+1)\n2\ngates. The\nconstruction makes use of two types of\ngates. One is a gate to perform the famil-\niar Hadamard transformation H. We will\ndenote by Hj the Hadamard transforma-\ntion applied to the jth bit. The other type\nof gate performs 2-bit transformations of\nthe form\nS j,k =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n1 0 0\n0\n0 1 0\n0\n0 0 1\n0\n0 0 0 ei\u03b8k\u2212 j\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8 ,\nwhere \u03b8k\u2212 j = \u03c0/2k\u2212 j. This transformation\nacts on the kth and jth bits of a larger\nregister. The quantum Fourier transform\nis given by\nH0S0,1 . . . S0,m\u22121H1 . . . Hm\u22123\nSm\u22123,m\u22122Sm\u22123,m\u22121Hm\u22122Sm\u22122,m\u22121Hm\u22121\nfollowed by a bit reversal transformation.\nIf FFT is followed by measurement, as in\nShor\u2019s algorithm, the bit reversal can be\nperformed classically. See Shor [1997] for\nmore details.\n6.2. A Detailed Outline of Shor\u2019s algorithm\nThe detailed steps of Shor\u2019s algorithm are\nillustrated with a running example where\nwe factor M = 21.\nStep 1. Quantum parallelism. Choose an\ninteger a arbitrarily. If a is not relatively\nprime to M, we have found a factor of M.\nOtherwise apply the rest of the algorithm.\nLet m be such that M 2 \u2264 2m < 2M 2.\n[This choice is made so that the approxi-\nmation used in Step 3 for functions whose\nperiod is not a power of 2 will be good\nenough for the rest of the algorithm to\nwork.] Use quantum parallelism as de-\nscribed in Section 5.2 to compute f (x) =\nax mod M for all integers from 0 to 2m \u2212 1.\nThe function is thus encoded in the quan-\ntum state\n1\n\u221a\n2m\n2m\u22121\nX\nx=0\n|x, f (x)\u27e9.\n(1)\nExample. Suppose a\n=\n11 were ran-\ndomly chosen. Since M 2 = 441 \u2264 29 <\n882 = 2M 2, we \ufb01nd m = 9. Thus, a total\nof 14 quantum bits, 9 for x and 5 for f (x),\nare required to compute the superposition\nof equation 1.\nStep 2. A state whose amplitude has the same\nperiod as f . The quantum Fourier trans-\nform acts on the amplitude function as-\nsociated with the input state. In order to\nuse the quantum Fourier transform to ob-\ntain the period of f , a state is constructed\nwhose amplitude function has the same\nperiod as f .\nTo construct such a state, measure the\nlast \u2308log2 M \u2309 qubits of the state of Eq. 1\nthat encode f (x). A random value u is ob-\ntained. The value u is not of interest in it-\nself; only the effect the measurement has\non our set of superpositions is of inter-\nest. This measurement projects the state\nspace onto the subspace compatible with\nthe measured value, so the state after\nmeasurement is\nC\nX\nx\ng(x)|x, u\u27e9,\nfor some scale factor C where\ng(x) =\n\u00bd1 if f (x) = u\n0 otherwise.\nNote that the x\u2019s that actually appear in\nthe sum, those with g(x) \u0338= 0, differ from\neach other by multiples of the period; thus\ng(x) is the function we are looking for. If\nwe could measure two successive x\u2019s in the\nsum, we would have the period. Unfortu-\nnately the laws of quantum physics permit\nonly one measurement.\nExample. Suppose that random mea-\nsurement\nof\nthe\nsuperposition\nof\nEq. 1 produces 8. The state after this\nmeasurement8 (Figure 2) clearly shows\nthe periodicity of f .\nStep 3.

Ap-\nply the quantum Fourier transform to the\nstate obtained in Step 2.\nUQ F T : P\nx g(x)|x\u27e9 \u2192 P\nc G(c)|c\u27e9\nStandard Fourier analysis tells us that\nwhen the period r of the function g(x)\nde\ufb01ned in Step 2 is a power of 2, the re-\nsult of the quantum Fourier transform is\nX\nj\nc j\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af j 2m\nr\n\u00c0\n,\nwhere the amplitude is 0 except at multi-\nples of 2m/r. When the period r does not\ndivide 2m, the transform approximates the\nexact case, so most of the amplitude is at-\ntached to integers close to multiples of 2m\nr .\nExample. Figure\n3 shows the result of\napplying the quantum Fourier transform\nto the state obtained in Step 2. Note\nthat Figure 3 is the graph of the fast\nFourier transform of the function shown\nin Figure 2. In this particular example the\nperiod of f does not divide 2m.\nStep 4. Extracting the period. Measure the\nstate in the standard basis for quantum\ncomputation, and call the result v. In the\ncase where the period happens to be a\npower of 2, so that the quantum Fourier\ntransform gives exactly multiples of 2m/r,\nthe period is easy to extract. In this case,\nv = j 2m\nr for some j. Most of the time j and\nr will be relatively prime, in which case\nreducing the fraction\nv\n2m (= j\nr ) to its lowest\nterms will yield a fraction whose denom-\ninator q is the period r. The fact that\nin general the quantum Fourier trans-\nform only approximately gives multiples\nof the scaled frequency complicates the\nextraction of the period from the measure-\nment. When the period is not a power\nof 2, a good guess for the period can be\nobtained using the continued fraction\nexpansion of\nv\n2m . This classical technique\nis described in Appendix B.\nExample. Say that measurement of the\nstate returns v = 427. Since v and 2m\nare relatively prime, the period r will\nmost likely not divide 2m and the contin-\nued fraction expansion described in Ap-\npendix B needs to be applied. The follow-\ning is a trace of the algorithm described in\nAppendix B:\ni ai\npi\nqi\n\u03f5i\n0 0\n0\n1\n0.8339844\n1 1\n1\n1\n0.1990632\n2 5\n5\n6\n0.02352941\n3 42 211 253\n0.5\nwhich terminates with 6 = q2 < M \u2264 q3.\nThus, q = 6 is likely to be the period of f .\nStep 5. Finding a factor of M. When our\nguess for the period, q, is even, use the\nEuclidean algorithm to ef\ufb01ciently check\nwhether either aq/2 + 1 or aq/2 \u2212 1 has a\nnontrivial common factor with M.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n321\nFig. 3.\nProbability distribution of the quantum state after Fourier transfor-\nmation.\nThe reason why aq/2 + 1 or aq/2 \u2212 1 is\nlikely to have a nontrivial common fac-\ntor with M is as follows. If q is indeed\nthe period of\nf (x)\n=\nax mod M, then\naq = 1 mod M, since aqax = ax mod M for\nall x. If q is even, we can write\n(aq/2 + 1)(aq/2 \u2212 1) = 0 mod M.\nThus, as long as neither aq/2+1 nor aq/2\u22121\nis a multiple of M, either aq/2+1 or aq/2\u22121\nhas a nontrivial common factor with M.\nExample. Since 6 is even either a6/2\u22121 =\n113 \u2212 1 = 1330 or a6/2 + 1 = 113 + 1 =\n1332 will have a common factor with M. In\nthis particular example we \ufb01nd two factors\ngcd(21, 1330) = 7 and gcd(21, 1332) = 3.\nStep 6. Repeating the algorithm, if necessary.\nVarious things could have gone wrong so\nthat this process does not yield a factor of\nM:\n1. The value v was not close enough to a\nmultiple of 2m\nr .\n2. The period r and the multiplier j could\nhave had a common factor so that the\ndenominator q was actually a factor of\nthe period, not the period itself.\n3. Step 5 yields M as M\u2019s factor.\n4. The period of f (x) = ax mod M is odd.\nShor shows that few repetitions of this al-\ngorithm yields a factor of M with high\nprobability.\n6.2.1 A Comment on Step 2 of Shor\u2019s Algorithm.\nThe measurement in Step 2 can be skipped\nentirely. More generally Bernstein and\nVazirani [1997] show that measurements\nin the middle of an algorithm can always\nbe avoided. If the measurement in Step 2\nis omitted, the state consists of a superpo-\nsitions of several periodic functions all of\nwhich have the same period. By the linear-\nity of quantum algorithms, applying the\nquantum Fourier transformation leads to\na superposition of the Fourier transforms\nof these functions, each of which is entan-\ngled with the corresponding u and there-\nfore do not interfere with each other. Mea-\nsurement gives a value from one of these\nFourier transforms. Seeing how this argu-\nment can be formalized illustrates some\nof the subtleties of working with quan-\ntum superpostions.

SEARCH PROBLEMS\nA large class of problems can be speci-\n\ufb01ed as search problems of the form \u201c\ufb01nd\nsome x in a set of possible solutions such\nthat statement P(x) is true.\u201d Such prob-\nlems range from database search to sort-\ning to graph coloring. For example, the\ngraph coloring problem can be viewed as a\nsearch for an assignment of colors to ver-\ntices so that the statement \u201call adjacent\nvertices have different colors\u201d is true. Sim-\nilarly, a sorting problem can be viewed as\na search for a permutation for which the\nstatement \u201cthe permutation x takes the\ninitial state to the desired sorted state\u201d is\ntrue.\nAn unstructured search problem is one\nwhere nothing is know (or no assumption\nare used) about the structure of the solu-\ntion space and the statement P. For exam-\nple, determining P(x0) provides no infor-\nmation about the possible value of P(x1)\nfor x0 \u0338= x1. A structured search problem\nis one where information about the search\nspace and statement P can be exploited.\nFor instance, searching an alphabet-\nized list is a structured search problem\nand the structure can be exploited to\nconstruct ef\ufb01cient algorithms. In other\ncases, like constraint satisfaction prob-\nlems such as 3-SAT or graph colorabil-\nity, the problem structure can be exploited\nfor heuristic algorithms that yield ef\ufb01-\ncient solution for some problem instances.\nBut in the general case of an unstruc-\ntured problem, randomly testing the truth\nof statements P(xi) one by one is the\nbest that can be done classically. For a\nsearch space of size N, the general un-\nstructured search problem requires O(N)\nevaluations of P. On a quantum computer,\nhowever, Grover showed that the unstruc-\ntured search problem can be solved with\nbounded probability within O(\n\u221a\nN) eval-\nuations of P. Thus Grover\u2019s search algo-\nrithm [Grover 1996] is provably more ef-\n\ufb01cient than any algorithm that could run\non a classical computer.\nWhile Grover\u2019s algorithm is optimal\n[Bennett et al. 1997; Boyer et al. 1996;\nZalka 1997] for completely unstructured\nsearches, most search problems involve\nsearching a structured solution space.\nJust as there are classical heuristic al-\ngorithms that exploit problem structure,\none would expect that there are more\nef\ufb01cient\nquantum\nalgorithms\nfor\ncer-\ntain structured problem instances. Cerf\net al. [1998] use Grover\u2019s search al-\ngorithm in place of classical searches\nwithin a heuristic algorithm to show that\na quadratic speed-up is possible over\na particularly simple classical heuristic\nfor solving NP-hard problems. Brassard\net al. [1998], using the techniques of\nGrover\u2019s search algorithm in a less obvious\nway, show that general heuristic searches\nhave quantum analogs with quadratic\nspeed-up.\nThere is hope that for certain struc-\ntured problems a speed-up greater than\nquadratic is possible. Such algorithms will\nlikely require new approaches that are not\nmerely quantum implementations of clas-\nsical algorithms. Shor\u2019s algorithm, when\nviewed as a search for factors, is an ex-\nample of an algorithm that achieves expo-\nnential speed-up by using problem struc-\nture (number theory) in new ways unique\nto quantum computation.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n323\nTad Hogg has developed heuristic quan-\ntum search algorithms that exploit prob-\nlem structure. His approach is distincly\nnonclassical and uses unique properties of\nquantum computation. One problem with\nthis approach is that, like most heuristic\nalgorithms, the use of problem structure\nis complicated enough that it is hard to\ndetermine the probability that a single\nexecution of an algorithm will give a cor-\nrect answer. Therefore, it is unknown how\nef\ufb01cient Hogg\u2019s algorithms are. Classi-\ncally the ef\ufb01ciency of heuristic algorithms\nis estimated by empirically testing the\nalgorithm. But as there is an exponential\nslowdown when simulating a quantum\ncomputer on a classical one, empirical test-\ning of quantum algorithms is currently in-\nfeasible except in small cases. Small cases\nindicate that Hogg\u2019s algorithms are more\nef\ufb01cient than Grover\u2019s algorithm applied\nto structured search problems, but that\nthe speed-up is likely to be only polyno-\nmial. While less interesting theoretically,\neven a small polynomial speed-up on av-\nerage for these computationally dif\ufb01cult\nproblems is of signi\ufb01cant practical inter-\nest. Until suf\ufb01ciently large quantum com-\nputers are built, or better techniques for\nanalyzing such algorithms are found, the\nef\ufb01ciency cannot be determined for sure.\n7.1. Grover\u2019s Search Algorithm\nGrover\u2019s algorithm searches an unstruc-\ntured list of size N for an x that makes a\nstatement true.

The trick is to change the quan-\ntum state in Eq. 2 so as to greatly increase\nthe amplitude of vectors |x0, 1\u27e9 for which\nP is true and decrease the amplitude of\nvectors |x, 0\u27e9 for which P is false.\nOnce such a transformation of the quan-\ntum state has been performed, one can\nsimply measure the last qubit of the quan-\ntum state which represents P(x). Because\nof the amplitude change, there is a high\nprobability that the result will be 1. If\nthis is the case, the measurement has pro-\njected the state of Eq. 2 onto the subspace\n1\n\u221a\nk 6k\ni=1|xi, 1\u27e9 where k is the number of so-\nlutions. Further measurement of the re-\nmaining bits will provide one of these so-\nlutions. If the measurement of qubit P(x)\nyields 0, then the whole process is started\nover and the superposition of Eq. 2 must\nbe computed again.\nGrover\u2019s algorithm then consists of the\nfollowing steps:\n1. Prepare a register containing a super-\nposition of all possible values xi\n\u2208\n[0 . . . 2n \u2212 1].\n2. Compute P(xi) on this register.\n3.

They prove that Grover\u2019s algo-\nrithm is optimal up to a constant factor;\nno quantum algorithm can perform an un-\nstructured search faster. They also show\nthat if there is only a single x0 such that\nP(x0) is true, then after \u03c0\n8\n\u221a\n2n iterations\nof steps 2 through 4 the failure rate is 0.5.\nAfter iterating \u03c0\n4\n\u221a\n2n times the failure rate\ndrops to 2\u2212n. Interestingly, additional it-\nerations will increase the failure rate. For\nexample, after \u03c0\n2\n\u221a\n2n iterations the failure\nrate is close to 1.\nThere are many classical algorithms\nin which a procedure is repeated over\nand over again for ever better results.\nRepeating quantum procedures may im-\nprove results for a while, but after a\nsuf\ufb01cient number of repetitions the re-\nsults will get worse again. Quantum proce-\ndures are unitary transformations, which\nare rotations of complex space, and thus\nwhile a repeated applications of a quan-\ntum transform may rotate the state closer\nand closer to the desired state for a while,\neventually it will rotate past the desired\nstate to get farther and farther from the\ndesired state. Thus to obtain useful re-\nsults from a repeated application of a\nquantum transformation, one must know\nwhen to stop. Brassard et al. [1998] de-\nscribe an extension of Grover\u2019s algorithm\nthat uses Fourier transforms to determine\nthe number of solutions and the optimal\nnumber of iterations. The extension does\nnot increase the overall complexity of the\nalgorithm.\nGrover has extended his algorithm to\nachieve quadratic speed-up for other non-\nsearch problems such as computing the\nmean and median of a function [Grover\n1998]. Using similar techniques Grover\nhas also shown that certain search prob-\nlems that classically run in O(log N) can\nbe solved in O(1) on a quantum computer.\nGrover\u2019s search can used as a subrou-\ntine in other quantum computations, since\nBiron et al. [1998] show how the technique\ncan be used with arbitrary initial ampli-\ntude distributions while still maintaining\nO(\n\u221a\nN) complexity.\n7.1.1 Inversion about the Average. To perform\ninversion about the average on a quantum\ncomputer the inversion must be a unitary\ntransformation. Furthermore, in order for\nthe algorithm as a whole to solve the prob-\nlem in O(\n\u221a\nN) time, the inversion must be\nable to be performed ef\ufb01ciently. As will be\nshown shortly, the inversion can be accom-\nplished with O(n) = O(log(N)) quantum\ngates.\nIt is easy to see that the transformation\nN\u22121\nX\ni=0\nai|xi\u27e9 \u2192\nN\u22121\nX\ni=0\n(2A \u2212 ai)|xi\u27e9,\nwhere A denotes the average of the ai\u2019s, is\nperformed by the N \u00d7 N matrix\nD =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n2\nN \u2212 1\n2\nN\n. . .\n2\nN\n2\nN\n2\nN \u2212 1\n. . .\n2\nN\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n2\nN\n2\nN\n. . .\n2\nN \u2212 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8 .\nSince DD\u2217 = I, D is unitary and is\ntherefore a possible quantum state trans-\nformation.\nWe now turn to the question of how ef-\n\ufb01ciently the transformation can be per-\nformed, and show that it can be decom-\nposed into O(n) = O(log(N)) elementary\nquantum gates.

A con-\nstraint satisfaction problem (CSP) has n\nvariables V = {v1, . . . , vn} which can take\nm different values X = {x1, . . . , xm} sub-\nject to certain constraints C1, . . . , Cl. So-\nlutions to a constraint satisfaction prob-\nlem lie in the space of assignments of xi\u2019s\nto vj\u2019s, V \u00d7 X . There is a natural lattice\nstructure on this space given by set con-\ntainment. Figure 4 shows the assignment\nspace and its lattice structure for n = 2,\nm = 2, x1 = 0, and x2 = 1. Note that\nthe lattice includes both incomplete and\ninconsistent assignments.\nUsing the standard correspondence be-\ntween sets of enumerated elements and bi-\nnary sequences, in which a 1 in the nth\nplace corresponds to inclusion of the nth\nelement and a 0 corresponds to exclusion,\nstandard basis vectors for a quantum state\nspace can be put in one to one correspon-\ndence with the sets. For example, Figure 5\nshows the lattice of Figure 4 rewritten in\nket notation, where the elements v1 = 0,\nv1 = 1, v2 = 0 and v2 = 1 have been enu-\nmerated in that order.\nIf a state violates a constraint, then so\ndo all states above it in the lattice. The\napproach Hogg takes in designing quan-\ntum algorithms for constraint satisfaction\nproblems is to begin with all the amplitude\nconcentrated in the |0 . . . 0\u27e9 state and to\niteratively move amplitude up the lattice\nfrom sets to supersets and away from sets\nthat violate the constraints. Note that this\nalgorithm begins differently than Shor\u2019s\nalgorithm and Grover\u2019s algorithm, which\nboth begin by computing a function on a\nsuperposition of all the input values at\nonce.\nHogg gives two ways [Hogg 1996; 1998]\nof\nconstructing\na\nunitary\nmatrix\nfor\nmoving amplitude up the lattice.

There is\nan obvious transformation that moves\namplitude from sets to supersets. Any\namplitude associated to the empty set is\nevenly distributed among all sets with\na single element. Any amplitude associ-\nated to a set with a single element is\nevenly distributed among all two-element\nsets that contain that element and so\non.

Hogg [1996] uses the fact that\nthe closest (in a suitable metric) unitary\nmatrix UM to an arbitrary matrix M can\nbe found using M\u2019s singular value decom-\nposition M = U DV T, where D is a diago-\nnal matrix and U and V are unitary ma-\ntrices. The product UM = UV T gives the\nclosest unitary matrix to M. Provided that\nUM is suf\ufb01ciently close to M, UM will be-\nhave in a similar way to M and will there-\nfore do a reasonably job of moving ampli-\ntude from sets to their supersets.\nMoving amplitude up: Method 2. The sec-\nond approach [Hogg 1998] uses the Walsh\u2013\nHadamard transformation. Hogg assumes\nthat the desired matrix has form W DW,\nwhere W is the Walsh\u2013Hadamard trans-\nformation and D is a diagonal matrix\nwhose entries depend only on the size of\nthe sets.

To\neffect moving amplitude away from sets\nthat violate the constraints, Hogg suggests\nadjusting the phases of the sets, depend-\ning on the extent to which they violate the\nconstraints, in such a way that the am-\nplitude distributed to sets that have bad\nsubsets cancels, whereas the amplitude\ndistributed to sets from all good subsets\nadds. Different choices here will work\nmore or less effectively depending on the\nparticular problem. One choice he sug-\ngests is inverting the phase of all bad\nsets which will result in some cancela-\ntion in the amplitude of supersets be-\ntween the amplitude coming from good\nsubsets and bad subsets. This phase in-\nversion can be done as in Grover\u2019s al-\ngorithm (Section 7.1.2) with a P that\ntests whether a given state satis\ufb01es all\nof the constraints or not. Another sug-\ngestion is to give random phases to the\nbad sets so that on average the contribu-\ntion to the amplitude of a superset from\nbad subsets is zero. Other choices are\npossible.\nBecause the canceling resulting from\nthe phase changes varies from problem\nto problem, the probability of obtaining\na solution is dif\ufb01cult to analyze. A few\nsmall experiments have been done, and\nthe guess is that the cost of the search\nstill grows exponentially, but consider-\nably more slowly than in the unstructured\ncase. But until suf\ufb01ciently large quantum\ncomputers are built or better techniques\nfor analyzing such algorithms are found,\nthe ef\ufb01ciency cannot be determined for\nsure.\n8. QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION\nOne fundamental problem in building\nquantum computers is the need to isolate\nthe quantum state. An interaction of parti-\ncles representing qubits with the external\nenvironment disturbs the quantum state\nand causes it to decohere, or transform\nin an unintended and often nonunitary\nfashion.\nSteane [1998] estimates that the deco-\nherence of any system likely to be built\nis 107 times too large to be able to run\nShor\u2019s algorithm as it stands on a 130-digit\nnumber. However, adding error correction\nalgorithms to Shor\u2019s algorithm mitigates\nthe effect of decoherence, making it again\nlook possible that a system could be built\non which Shor\u2019s algorithm could be run for\nlarge numbers.\nOn the surface, quantum error correc-\ntion is similar to classical error correct-\ning codes in that redundant bits are used\nto detect and correct errors, but the sit-\nuation for quantum error correction is\nsomewhat more complicated than in the\nclassical case, since we are not deal-\ning with binary data but with quantum\nstates.\nQuantum error correction must recon-\nstruct the exact encoded quantum state.\nGiven the impossibility of cloning or copy-\ning the quantum state, this reconstruction\nappears harder than in the classical case.\nHowever, it turns out that classical tech-\nniques can be modi\ufb01ed to work for quan-\ntum systems.\n8.1. Characterization of Errors\nIn the following it is assumed that all er-\nrors are the result of quantum interaction\nbetween a set of qubits and the environ-\nment. The possible errors for each single\nqubit considered are linear combinations\nof no errors (I), bit \ufb02ip errors (X ), phase\nerrors (Z), and bit \ufb02ip phase errors (Y ).\nA general single bit error is thus a trans-\nformation e1I + e2X + e3Y + e4Z. Interac-\ntion with the environment transforms sin-\ngle qubits according to\n|\u03c8\u27e9 \u2192 (e1I + e2X + e3Y + e4Z)|\u03c8\u27e9\n=\nX\ni\neiEi|\u03c8\u27e9.\nFor the general case of quantum regis-\nters, possible errors are expressed as lin-\near combinations of unitary error opera-\ntors Ei. These could be combinations of\nsingle-bit errors, such as tensor products\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n329\nof the single-bit error transformations\n{I, X, Y, Z}, or more general multibit\ntransformations. In any case, an error can\nbe written as 6ieiEi for some error opera-\ntors Ei and coef\ufb01cients ei.\n8.2. Recovery of Quantum State\nAn error correcting code for a set of er-\nrors Ei consists of a mapping C that em-\nbeds n data bits in n+k code bits together\nwith a syndrome extraction operator SC\nthat maps n + k code bits to the set of\nindices of correctable errors Ei such that\ni = SC(Ei(C(x))). If y = E j(C(x)) for some\nunknown but correctable error, then er-\nror SC( y) can be used to recover a prop-\nerly encoded value C(x) (i.e., E\u22121\nSC( y)( y) =\nC(x)).\nNow consider the case of a quantum reg-\nister. First, the state of the register can\nbe in a superposition of basis vectors. Fur-\nthermore, the error can be a combination\nof correctable error operators Ei. It turns\nout that it is still possible to recover the\nencoded quantum state.\nGiven an error correcting code C with\nsyndrome\nextraction\noperator\nSC,\nan\nn-bit quantum state |\u03c8\u27e9 is encoded in\na n + k\u2013bit quantum state |\u03c6\u27e9 = C|\u03c8\u27e9.\nAssume that decoherence leads to an\nerror state 6ieiEi|\u03c6\u27e9 for some combina-\ntion of correctable errors Ei. The origi-\nnal encoded state |\u03c6\u27e9 can be recovered as\nfollows:\n1. Apply the syndrome extraction opera-\ntor SC to the quantum state padded\nwith suf\ufb01cient |0\u27e9 bits:\nSC\n\u00c3 X\ni\neiEi|\u03c6\u27e9\n!\n\u2297 |0\u27e9\n=\nX\ni\nei(Ei|\u03c6\u27e9 \u2297 |i\u27e9).\nQuantum parallelism gives a superpo-\nsition of different errors each associated\nwith their respective error index i.\n2. Measure the |i\u27e9 component of the result.\nThis yields some (random) value i0 and\nprojects the state to\nEi0|\u03c6, i0\u27e9\n3.

CONCLUSIONS\nQuantum computing is a new, emerging\n\ufb01eld that has the potential to dramatically\nchange the way we think about computa-\ntion, programming, and complexity. The\nchallenge for computer scientists and oth-\ners is to develop new programming tech-\nniques appropriate for quantum comput-\ners. Quantum entanglement and phase\ncancellation introduce a new dimension to\ncomputation. Programming no longer con-\nsists of merely formulating step-by-step\nalgorithms but requires new techniques of\nadjusting phases and mixing and diffusing\namplitudes to extract useful output.\nWe have tried to give an accurate\naccount of the state-of-the-art of quan-\ntum computing for computer scientists\nand other nonphysicists. We have de-\nscribed some of the quantum mechani-\ncal effects, such as the exponential state\nspace, the entangled states, and the lin-\nearity of quantum state transformations,\nthat make quantum parallelism possi-\nble. Even though quantum computations\nmust be linear and reversible, any clas-\nsical algorithm can be implemented on a\nquantum computer. But the real power of\nthese new machines, the exponential par-\nallelism, can only be exploited using new,\ninnovative programming techniques. Peo-\nple have only recently begun to research\nsuch techniques.\nWe have described Shor\u2019s polynomial-\ntime factorization algorithm, which stim-\nulated the \ufb01eld of quantum computing.\nGiven a practical quantum computer,\nShor\u2019s\nalgorithm\nwould\nmake\nmany\npresent cryptographic methods obsolete.\nGrover\u2019s search algorithm, while only pro-\nviding a polynomial speed-up, proves that\nquantum computers are strictly more pow-\nerful than classical ones. Even though\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\nIntroduction to Quantum Computing\n331\nGrover\u2019s algorithm has been shown to be\noptimal, there is hope that faster algo-\nrithms can be found by exploiting prop-\nerties of the problem structure. We have\ndescribed one such approach taken by\nHogg.\nThere are a few other known quantum\nalgorithms that we did not discuss. Jones\nand Mosca [1998] describe the implemen-\ntation on a 2-bit quantum computer of\na constant time algorithm [Deutsch and\nJozsa 1992] that can distinguish whether\na function is balanced or constant. Grover\n[1998] describes an ef\ufb01cient algorithm for\nestimating the median of a set of values\nand both Grover [1998] and Terhal and\nSmolin [1997], using different methods,\ncan solve the coin weighing problem in a\nsingle step.\nBeyond these algorithms not much more\nis known about what could be done with\na practical quantum computer. It is an\nopen question whether or not we can\n\ufb01nd quantum algorithms that provide ex-\nponential speed-up for problems other\nthan factoring. There is some speculation\namong physicists that quantum transfor-\nmations might be slightly nonlinear. So\nfar all experiments that have been done\nare consistent with the standard linear\nquantum mechanics, but a slight nonlin-\nearity is still possible. Abrams and Lloyd\n[1998] show that even a very slight nonlin-\nearity could be exploited to solve all NP-\nhard problems on a quantum computer in\npolynomial time. This result further high-\nlights the fact that computation is funda-\nmentally a physical process, and that what\ncan be computed ef\ufb01ciently may depend on\nsubtle issues in physics.\nThe unique properties of quantum com-\nputers give rise to new kinds of complex-\nity classes. For instance, BQP is the set\nof all languages accepted by a quantum\nTuring machine in polynomial time with\nbounded probability of error. Details of\nthe extensive research done in the \ufb01eld\nof quantum complexity theory is beyond\nthe scope of this paper. The interested\nreader may start by consulting Bennett\net al. [1997] and Watrous [1998] respec-\ntively for analyses of time and space com-\nplexity of quantum computation. Williams\nand Clearwater [1998] contains an in-\ntroduction to early results in quantum\ncomplexity.\nOf course, there are daunting physical\nproblems that must be overcome if any-\none is ever to build a useful quantum\ncomputer. Decoherence, the distortion of\nthe quantum state due to interaction with\nthe environment, is a key problem. A big\nbreakthrough for dealing with decoher-\nence came from the algorithmic, rather\nthan the physical, side of the \ufb01eld with the\ndevelopment of quantum error correction\ntechniques. We have described some of the\nprinciples involved. Further advances in\nquantum error correction and the devel-\nopment of robust algorithms will be as im-\nportant for the development of practical\nquantum computers as advances in the\nhardware side.\n9.1. Further Reading\nAndrew Steane\u2019s survey article \u201cQuan-\ntum Computing\u201d [Steane 1998] is aimed at\nphysicists. We recommend reading his pa-\nper for his viewpoint on this subject, par-\nticularly for his description of connections\nbetween information theory and quantum\ncomputing and for his discussion of er-\nror correction, of which he was one of the\nmain developers. He also has an overview\nof the physics involved in actually build-\ning quantum computers and a survey of\nwhat had been done up to July 1997. His\narticle contains a more detailed history\nof the ideas related to quantum comput-\ning than the present paper, and has more\nreferences as well. Another shorter and\nvery readable tutorial can be found in\nBerthiaume [1997].\nRichard Feynman\u2019s Lectures on Compu-\ntation [Feynman 1996] contains a reprint\nof the lecture \u201cQuantum Mechanical Com-\nputers\u201d [Feynman 1985], which began the\nwhole \ufb01eld. It also discusses the thermo-\ndynamics of computations, which is closely\ntied with reversible computing and infor-\nmation theory.\nColin Williams and Scott Clearwater\u2019s\nbook Explorations in Quantum Comput-\ning [Williams and Clearwater 1998] comes\nwith software, in the form of Mathematica\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 32, No. 3, September 2000.\n332\nE.

TENSOR PRODUCTS\nThe tensor product (\u2297) of a n-dimensional\nand a k-dimensional vector is a nk-\ndimensional vector. Similarly, if A and\nB are transformations on n-dimensional\nand k-dimensional vectors respectively,\nthen A \u2297 B9 is a transformation on nk-\ndimensional vectors.\nThe exact mathematical details of ten-\nsor products are beyond the scope of this\npaper (see Hungerford [1974] for a com-\nprehensive treatment). For our purposes\nthe following algebraic rules are suf\ufb01cient\nto calculate with tensor products. For ma-\ntrices A, B, C, D, U, vectors u, x, y, and\nscalars a, b, the following hold:\n(A \u2297 B)(C \u2297 D) = AC \u2297 BD\n(A \u2297 B)(x \u2297 y) = Ax \u2297 By\n(x + y) \u2297 u = x \u2297 u + y \u2297 u\nu \u2297 (x + y) = u \u2297 x + u \u2297 y\nax \u2297 by = ab(x \u2297 y)\n\u00b5\nA B\nC D\n\u00b6\n\u2297 U =\n\u00b5\nA \u2297 U B \u2297 U\nC \u2297 U D \u2297 U\n\u00b6\n,\nwhich is specialized for scalars a, b, c, d to\n\u00b5\na b\nc d\n\u00b6\n\u2297 U =\n\u00b5\naU bU\ncU dU\n\u00b6\n.\n9 Technically, this is a right Kronecker product.\nThe\nconjugate\ntranspose\ndistributes\nover tensor products; that is,\n(A \u2297 B)\u2217 = A\u2217 \u2297 B\u2217.\nA matrix U is unitary if its conjugate\ntranspose is its inverse: U \u2217U = I.\nThe tensor product of several matrices\nis unitary if and only if each one of the\nmatrices is unitary up to a constant.

CONTINUED FRACTIONS AND\nEXTRACTING THE PERIOD FROM THE\nMEASUREMENT IN SHOR\u2019S ALGORITHM\nIn the general case where the period r does\nnot divide 2m; the value v measured in\nStep 4 of Shor\u2019s algorithm will be, with\nhigh probability, close to some multiple of\n2m\nr , say j 2m\nr .\nThe aim is to extract the period r from\nthe measured value v. Shor shows that,\nwith high probability, v is within 1\n2 of some\nj 2m\nr .

In the high-probability case that v is\nwithin 1\n2 of j 2m\nr , this fraction will be j\nr .\nThe unique fraction with denominator\nless than M that is within\n1\nM 2 of\nv\n2m can\nbe obtained ef\ufb01ciently from the continued\nfraction expansion of\nv\n2m as follows.

We take the denominator q of the ob-\ntained fraction as our guess for the period,\nwhich will work when j and r are rela-\ntively prime.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Tad Hogg and\nCarlos Mochon for many enjoyable conversations\nabout quantum computing and for their feedback\non an earlier draft of this paper.

This is achieved by making use of an environment induced quantum Zeno effect that confines the dynamics effectively to a decoherence-free subspace.

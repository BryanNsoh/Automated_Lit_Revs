<instructions> <overview> The search queries provided can be overly restrictive. You are requested to return these queries exactly as they are, and also include two additional variants for each. These variants should be closely related to the original query, fitting well within the context of surrounding points, and align with the overarching theme of the review on real-time autonomous systems for irrigation scheduling and management. To broaden the search, consider the following techniques: 1) Include alternative terms or synonyms connected by "OR" operators; 2) Relax or remove proximity requirements; 3) Remove specific examples enclosed in parentheses; 4) Use more general or higher-level concepts that subsume the original, narrower terms.
Additionally, selectively reduce the number of AND operators to further broaden the search, especially between terms that have many alternative expressions or represent independent facets of the topic. However, be cautious not to overdo it, as removing too many ANDs can reduce precision and introduce noise. Keep the ANDs that enforce essential conceptual relationships.

<requirements> <requirement> Provide the original search queries verbatim. </requirement> <requirement> Add two less restrictive variants for each query that remain highly relevant to the specific point and the broader topic, using the techniques mentioned in the overview to broaden the search scope. </requirement>
You must return your answer in a single JSON codeblock. The JSON format must strictly follow the format provided in the context. The additional queries should be added as query5, query6, and so on, depending on the total number of queries. Any deviation from the provided nomenclature or JSON format will cause everything to collapse.

<context> The aim is to refine search strategies for a review on real-time autonomous systems for irrigation scheduling and management. Given the specificity of the topic, adjustments to the search queries are necessary to maintain relevance while seeking broader results due to the initial restrictive nature leading to no hits. </context> </instructions>

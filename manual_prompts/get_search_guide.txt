   <description>Generate a highly comprehensive and well-organized guide that provides rigorous detail on how to write effective advanced searches on Scopus for scientific literature. The guide should avoid redundancy and cover the following:</description>
   <requirements>
     <item>Valid and invalid syntax rules for Scopus advanced searches</item>
     <item>Characteristics of an ideal Scopus advanced search query</item>
     <item>Systematically explain all relevant search fields, operators, and techniques mentioned across different Scopus documentation in a coherent way</item>
     <item>Present 10 highly diverse model examples showcasing different modes, techniques and combinations for constructing advanced Scopus searches</item>
   </requirements>
 </task>
 
 <topic_focus>
   <description>The examples should feature plausible advanced search queries grounded in real scientific topics relating to precision agriculture, precision irrigation, real-time systems, internet of things, and machine learning. Combine these topics creatively and interestingly. Other valid but less obvious topics can also be included.</description>

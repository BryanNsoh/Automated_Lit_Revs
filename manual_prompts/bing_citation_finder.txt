From the provided exerpt, extract in json format (in a single json codeblock) all the various points that were made (or context) along with the research papers that have been quoted inline to support it. i want all points being made and their supporting inline citations. every single one. Your json should have 4 keys: index, full_context, in-line-citation. Make sure that every unique inline citation has its own independent entry:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

split this json block into individual json codeblocks each with a maximum of 6 elements within it:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for your request. You have been provided a list of references and the corresponding quotes they support. Please look up these references to determine whether they actually support the associated quote. Present your answer in a tabular format.

For every entry, search for each paper and read its contents. Provide a json containing your evaluation of the relatedness of the current paper to the current point (if it could be found).

Structure the json as follows:

- index
- full_context
- current_paper_inline_citation
- Current_Paper_Analysis (based on what you could find about the current paper)
- Current_Paper_Adequately_Supports_Point (and the context is right) (Yes/No)
- Current_paper_doi_or_link_full_url (spell out the full url please)
- Current_paper_title
Begin your answer with: "Sure Bryan, there were [number of papers] present. I searched for each of these papers and read their contents. Here is a json containing my evaluation of the relatedness of each paper to its matching point (if it could be found). I have also maintained the original indices in the json so we can ensure it matches [number of papers]"

Reference list:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the points where the current paper was deemed inadequate in the above answer (i.e  where "Current_Paper_Adequately_Supports_Point":"No"), please find a research paper or document that most strongly represents the given point. Present your answer in a json format, adding to the same json from the previous prompt. Only concern yourself with points where "Current_Paper_Adequately_Supports_Point":"No"
Structure the table as follows:

- index
- full_context
- current_paper_inline_citation
- Current_Paper_Adequately_Supports_Point (and the context is right) (Yes/No)
- Current_paper_doi_or_link_full_url (spell out the full url please)
- Current_paper_title
- Alternate_Paper_Analysis (based on an alternate paper you searched for and found, and why you think it might fit the point better. Make sure the paper is highly related to the context)
- Alternate_Paper_Title
- Alternate_paper_inline_citation
- Alternate_Paper_doi_or_link_full_url (spell out the full url please)

Begin your answer with: "For the points where where "Current_Paper_Adequately_Supports_Point":"No", I searched for alternative papers that might provide very strong, targeted, and relevant support. I searched different research databases and tried to find a unique paper for each point. Here is the updated json with alternate papers that best support each point and why I think they are better."

<instructions> you are provided with a section of a research manuscript in <text> and with a list of all in-line citations and their analysis in <reference_analysis>. Do the following:
<task> In the relevant section of the text replace all in-line citations  for which the value of the key "Current_Paper_Adequately_Supports_Point" is "No" with the alternate paper provided for that specific context/point. If no alternative paper is provided for a point where the current paper does not support it, simply remove the current paper's inline citation. If the value of the key "Current_Paper_Adequately_Supports_Point" is "Yes" leave the in-line citation where it is as is  </task>

<task>If the provided in-line citation for the current text is not properly formatted please format it properly in in-line citation format.</task>
<task>Keep your answer nicely organized and formatted including tables, headers etc … It is critical that all tables are well formatted.</task>
<task>Other than the mentioned edits, the text is not to be altered in anyway whatsoever and should be provided verbatim and in full.</task>
<task>Before starting state all instructions and promise to adhere to them.</task>
<quality-ckeck>You must include a *** every time you encounter an inline citation in the text. include this to indicate that you are keeping these instructions firmly in mind and will ensure that only papers which adequatly support the point or their proposed alternativel if they dont will be included as in-line citations. Any in-line citations not present in <reference_analysis> will be removed. I will take the *** as a mark of quality and will trat any in-line citation that doesnt have it as suspect  </quality-check>
<Output>The full modified text with the above changes. All sections of the text should be provided in full. Keep going until done. This whole task will be done in 1 go</Output>

make a json with only the following papers. there should be only 1 key (inline_citation) for each paper and no nestedness:

    <task>
        From the <reference_analysis> document, extract the DOI, Title, Context, and inline_citation of all research papers matching the provided target papers. Note that only inline citations that are present in <target-papers> are permitted in the JSON. There will be no paper not present under <target-papers> within the JSON!! Repeat this after me.
    </task>
    <task>
        Before beginning, state the number of target papers there are and lay out your strategy for extracting them.
    </task>
    <strategy>
        If an entry from <target-papers> is under "Alternate_paper_inline_citation" then I will extract the alternate paper information from the alternate section. Otherwise, if the entry is found under "current_paper_inline_citation" and "Current_Paper_Adequately_Supports_Point": "Yes". If neither of these is strictly true for a given <target-papers>, write "idkman" as the value of all keys for said entry except the inline citation.

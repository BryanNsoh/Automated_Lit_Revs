<item>Guidelines for constructing Scopus advanced search queries</item>

</input> <output>
<item>A new JSON structure with 7 unique and optimized Scopus advanced search queries for each point in the original research outline. The first 5 queries should be more targeted (though intelligently varied to capture all nuances of the point). The last 2 queries should be slightly broader, relying less on AND or "", but still very specific to the point. These broader queries should be constructed using the following techniques:

Include alternative terms or synonyms connected by "OR" operators;
Relax or remove proximity requirements;
Remove specific examples enclosed in parentheses;
Use more general or higher-level concepts that subsume the original, narrower terms;
Selectively reduce the number of AND operators, especially between terms that have many alternative expressions or represent independent facets of the topic. However, be cautious not to overdo it, as removing too many ANDs can reduce precision and introduce noise. Keep the ANDs that enforce essential conceptual relationships. </item>
</output> </task> <requirements>
<item>The output JSON must have valid JSON syntax</item>

<item>Queries for different points must have minimal overlap to avoid retrieving the same papers multiple times</item>

<item>The first 5 queries per point should be optimized within the context of the full literature review</item>

<!-- Guidelines for constructing Scopus advanced search queries -->
Syntax and Operators
--------------------

Valid syntax for advanced search queries includes:

*   Field codes (e.g. TITLE, ABS, KEY, AUTH, AFFIL) to restrict searches to specific parts of documents
*   Boolean operators (AND, OR, AND NOT) to combine search terms
*   Proximity operators (W/n, PRE/n) to find words within a specified distance
*   Quotation marks for loose/approximate phrase searches
*   Braces {} for exact phrase searches
*   Wildcards (* and ?) for partial word matches

Invalid syntax includes:

*   Mixing different proximity operators (e.g. W/n and PRE/n) in the same expression
*   Using wildcards or proximity operators with exact phrase searches
*   Placing AND NOT before other Boolean operators
*   Using wildcards on their own without any search terms

Ideal Search Structure
----------------------

An ideal advanced search query should:

*   Use field codes to focus the search on the most relevant parts of documents
*   Combine related concepts using AND and OR
*   Exclude irrelevant terms with AND NOT at the end
*   Use proximity operators to find phrases and related words near each other
*   Employ quotation marks and braces appropriately for phrase searching
*   Include wildcards to capture variations of key terms
*   Follow the proper order of precedence for operators

Complex searches should be built up systematically, with parentheses to group related expressions as needed. The information from the provided documents on syntax rules and operators should be applied rigorously.

Example Advanced Searches
-------------------------

1.  TITLE-ABS-KEY("precision agriculture" AND ("machine learning" OR "artificial intelligence") AND water PRE/5 management AND NOT livestock)
   
2.  TITLE(({internet of things} OR iot) PRE/10 (irrigation OR watering) AND sensor*)
   
3.  TITLE-ABS(("precision farming" OR "precision agriculture") AND ("deep learning" OR "neural network*") AND (water W/15 conservation))
   
4.  TITLE-ABS-KEY((crop* PRE/3 monitor*) AND "remote sensing" AND real-time AND (irrigation OR water*))
   
5.  AFFIL("agricultural engineering") AND TITLE-ABS(("precision agriculture" OR "smart farming") AND soil W/5 moist*) AND PUBYEAR > 2015
   
6.  TITLE(({precision irrigation} OR {variable rate irrigation}) AND "machine learning" AND ("decision support system" OR dss))
   
7.  TITLE-ABS-KEY(("precision agriculture" OR "precision farming") AND (autonom* PRE/3 robot*) AND (irrigat* OR water*) AND plant*)
   
8.  ALL(("internet of things" OR iot) AND (real-time OR realtime) AND (soil W/5 (monitor* OR sens*)) AND ("crop yield" OR productivity))
   
9.  TITLE-ABS(("digital agriculture" OR "smart agriculture") AND "big data" AND (irrigation PRE/5 schedul*) AND "crop water")
   
10.  AFFIL("precision agriculture" OR "agricultural engineering") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY(("machine learning" OR "artificial intelligence") AND (water PRE/10 (productivity OR efficiency OR sav*)) AND ("sustainable agriculture" OR sustainability))

These example searches demonstrate different ways to effectively combine key concepts related to precision agriculture, irrigation, real-time monitoring, IoT, machine learning and related topics using advanced search operators. They make use of field codes, Boolean and proximity operators, phrase searching, and wildcards to construct targeted, comprehensive searches to surface the most relevant research. The topic focus is achieved through carefully chosen search terms covering the desired themes.

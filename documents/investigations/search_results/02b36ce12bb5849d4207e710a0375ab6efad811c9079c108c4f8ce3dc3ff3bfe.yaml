    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Cognitive radio networks have been introduced to
    increase the utilization efficiency of limited radio frequency resources [1].
    In cognitive radio networks, among frequency channels originally allocated to
    primary users, channels not used by primary users are found and used by secondary
    users. A secondary user using a channel should sense for possible transmission
    initiations by primary users in the channel used by itself. If primary users start
    transmission, the secondary user should stop its transmission [3]. There are mainly
    two types of spectrum sensing methods, i.e., energy sensing and signal-characteristics-based
    sensing. Spectrum sensing methods based on energy sensing are simple to implement
    and produce sensing results in short time, but they require an exact measurement
    of noise and show poor performance at low signal-to-noise (SNR) environments [4],
    [5]. One of the spectrum sensing methods based on signal characteristics is cyclostationary
    sensing, which is complex and takes long time to produce sensing results but is
    robust with noise [6]. There have been standardization efforts in IEEE 802.22
    based on the cognitive radio concept [2]. IEEE 802.22 defines requirements for
    spectrum sensing performances such that transmitting secondary user should stop
    its transmission within 2 seconds after the start of primary user transmission
    with false alarm probability less than 0.1 and detection probability higher than
    0.9. For spectrum sensing, quiet period is used which is placed within secondary
    user transmission duration. During the quiet period, secondary users suspend their
    transmission and sense for primary signal and resume transmission if no primary
    signal is detected. With the longer spectrum sensing time, the sensing accuracy
    increases but secondary user''s throughput decreases. There have been some results
    on optimal quiet period length considering this tradeoff relationship [5]. Decision
    theory was adopted to increase spectrum sensing accuracy [7]. Regarding spectrum
    sensing accuracy, studies on cooperative spectrum sensing by multiple secondary
    users have been done [4], [8]. With cooperative sensing, the sensing time of a
    secondary user is reduced. However, the energy consumption of secondary users
    would increase and control overhead of the cooperation is induced. When a false
    alarm occurs in the spectrum sensing, the secondary user should find another unused
    channel and carry out handoff to it. There have been a few researches on spectrum
    handoff [11], [12]. Although there was a research on the effect of false alarm
    on sensing time [13], there was no research regarding the effect of unnecessary
    spectrum handoff due to false alarm in the spectrum sensing. In this paper, we
    take this perspective and formulate an optimization problem which considers the
    spectrum handoff due to false alarm in spectrum sensing in minimizing the spectrum
    sensing time of the secondary user. This paper is organized as follows. Section
    II gives a system description. In section III, the proposed optimization problem
    is explained. Section IV explains the numerical results of the proposed problem.
    SECTION II. System Description In a spectrum sensing period, received signal at
    secondary user is represented by using two-fold hypothesis as follows: H 0 :primary
    user is idle, not transmitting, θ H 1 :primary user is active, transmitting, θ
    = θ 0 = θ 1 . (1) (2) View Source Decision threshold is determined according to
    required false alarm and miss-detection probabilities. False alarm probability
    is P (choosing H 1 | H 0 true) and the required value is denoted by α . Miss-detection
    probability is P (choosing H 0 | H 1 true) and the required value is denoted by
    β . In this study, we assume a spectrum sensing method based on energy detection.
    Sensing metric using energy detector is given by X= 1 N ∑ n=1 N |y(n) | 2 { ≥η⇒
    H 1 <η⇒ H 0 (3) View Source where N is the number of samples. In state H 0 ,y(n)
    is additive noise u(n) . In state H 1 ,y(n) is the addition of primary signal
    s(n) and noise u(n) . The sample number N is determined as N=τ f s where f s is
    a sampling frequency and τ is sensing time. The probability density functions
    of X in cases of H 0 and H 1 were derived in detail for several cases in [5].
    We follow the approach of [5] in this study. It is assumed that u(n) is real Gaussian
    noise with (0, σ 2 u ) and s(n) is real Gaussian with (0, σ 2 s ) [5]. In state
    H 0 , pdf of X is a chi-square distribution with N degrees of freedom. When N
    is sufficiently large, this distribution can be approximated as a Gaussian distribution
    by central-limit theorem. Therefore, in state H 0 , mean and variance of X are
    θ 0 = σ 2 u and σ 2 0 =[E|u(n) | 4 − σ 4 u ]/N respectively. In state H 1 , mean
    and variance are θ 1 =(γ+1) σ 2 u and σ 2 1 =2(γ+1 ) 2 σ 4 u /(τ f s ) where γ
    is primary signal SNR. Miss detection probability is given by P md (τ)=Φ( η− θ
    1 σ 1 ) (4) View Source where Φ(⋅) is the standard normal distribution function
    and η is a decision threshold. To satisfy the required miss detection probability,
    the decision threshold is determined as η= θ 1 − Φ −1 (1−β) σ 1 . (5) View Source
    Using the above threshold, false alarm probability with given spectrum sensing
    time is obtained as [5] P fa (τ) =1−Φ( η− θ 0 σ 0 ) =1−Φ( θ 1 − θ 0 − Φ −1 (1−β)
    σ 1 σ 0 ). (6) View Source Fig. 1 shows the spectrum sensing process considered
    in this study. We denote the channel initially used by a secondary user as CH
    0. There are other G number of channels. The sensing time in CH 0 is denoted as
    τ s . The secondary user transmitting data in CH 0 should periodically stop transmission
    and perform spectrum sensing to find out whether any primary signal exists in
    CH 0. Channels from CH 1 to CH G may be used by primary users. We denote the probability
    of CH i used by primary users as p i . We assume that p i is the same in every
    channel. On no detection of primary signal, the secondary user resumes data transmission.
    If an alarm of primary signal detection occurs, the secondary user stops transmission
    in CH 0 and senses for a new unused channel sequentially from CH 1 through CH
    G until it finds one. τ h specifies the spectrum sensing time in each channel.
    T oh is the overhead time necessary to prepare for the spectrum sensing. When
    sensing in a new channel produces a primary signal detection, search in another
    channel is performed. This search for an unused channel would continue in maximum
    G number of channels until the search succeeds. When a free channel is found,
    further spectrum sensing is not necessary and the secondary user switches to the
    new channel and resumes data transmission. Fig. 1. Spectrum sensing on several
    channels in cognitive radio networks. Show All SECTION III. Problem Formulation
    It is necessary to minimize spectrum sensing time while satisfying the required
    sensing error probabilities. To minimize spectrum sensing time means that energy
    consumption necessary for the spectrum sensing is minimized and data transmission
    rate is maximized. Based on this criterion, we define a new optimization problem
    as min τ s , τ h s.t. f( τ s , τ h ) P md ( τ s )= P md ( τ h )=β P fa ( τ s ,
    τ h )≤α τ s , τ h >0. (7) View Source The objective function represents an average
    total spectrum sensing time resulting from a certain period of spectrum sensing
    on CH 0 and is given by f( τ s , τ h )= τ s + P fa ( τ s ) g ¯ ( τ h + T oh )
    (8) View Source where g ¯ is the average number of channels searched due to primary
    signal alarm in the initially used channel CH 0 and obtained as g ¯ =1+ P n,1
    ( τ h )+⋯+ ∏ i=1 G−1 P n,i ( τ h ). (9) View Source P n,i (.) is the probability
    that sensing in CH i produces a primary signal alarm and expressed as P n,i =
    p i +(1− p i ) P fa ( τ h ) (10) View Source where for simplicity miss detection
    of primary signal is omitted. The rationale for the constraints is as follows.
    Spectrum sensing during transmission should satisfy the required miss detection
    probability. The overall false alarm probability is the product of false alarm
    probability of each spectrum sensing. It is given by P fa ( τ s , τ h )= P fa
    ( τ s ) P fa G ( τ h ) (11) View Source which should be less than a required value.
    The optimization problem is not a convex optimization problem. We derive the optimal
    values using penalty method and numerical enumeration [10]. SECTION IV. Numerical
    Results The values of parameters for numerical results are as follows. Based on
    IEEE 802.22, α and β are set to 0.1. The values of sampling frequency and primary
    signal SNR are adopted from [5] with sampling frequency of 6MHz and primary signal
    SNR of −20dB. T oh is set to 0.01 sec. Noise spectral density is −174dBm/Hz. Below
    are numerical results. Fig. 2 shows that as p i increases, the optimal τ s increases
    and the optimal τ h decreases. When p i becomes larger, g ¯ , the number of channels
    searched due to a false alarm increases. To minimize the objective function, τ
    h should decrease as g ¯ increases. This makes the false alarm probability due
    to τ h increase. Therefore, τ s should be increased to satisfy the overall false
    alarm probability requirement. This reduced value of τ s helps minimizing the
    objective function value. Fig. 2. (a) Optimal values of τ s and τ h and (b) Mean
    number of channels searched when a false alarm occurs, both with respect to p
    i , when G , the number of channels is 10. Show All Fig. 3 shows that as the number
    of channels increases, the optimal τ s increases and the optimal τ h has a minimum
    value. Fig. 4 shows the values of g ¯ and P fa ( τ s ) g ¯ . In Fig. 3 and 4,
    it is seen that the optimal value of τ h depends closely on P fa ( τ s ) g ¯ ,
    the mean number of channels searched multiplied with the false alarm probability
    of the initial channel. When P fa ( τ s ) g ¯ is large, the corresponding value
    of τ h is low and vice versa. It is to make the objective function value small.
    The optimal τ s has a tendency to increase with G especially when p i is large.
    With larger G, g ¯ increases. Therefore, τ s should be increased to satisfy the
    overall false alarm probability requirement and to make the objective function
    value small. This effect is more dominant when p i is large. Fig. 3. Optimal values
    of τ s and τ h with respect to G , the number of channels and p i . Show All Fig.

    Footnotes Abstract: This article outlines the fundamental modeling issues of opportunistic
    spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. In particular, we identify the effects
    of connection-based channel usage on the QoS performance of spectrum management
    techniques. During the transmission period of a secondary user''s connection,
    the phenomenon of multiple spectrum handoffs due to interruptions of primary users
    arises quite often. In addition to multiple interruptions, the connection-based
    channel usage behaviors are also affected by spectrum sensing time, switching
    between different channels, generally distributed service time, and channel contention
    between multiple secondary users. An analytical framework based on the preemptive
    resumption priority M/G/1 queueing theory is introduced to characterize the effects
    of the above factors simultaneously. The proposed generalized analytical framework
    can incorporate various system parameters into the design of very broad spectrum
    management techniques, including spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum
    sharing, and spectrum mobility. The applications of this analytical framework
    on spectrum decision as well as spectrum mobility are discussed, and some open
    issues using this framework are suggested in this article. Published in: IEEE

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction The authors outline the fundamental modeling issues
    of opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. They identify the
    effects of connection-based channel usage on the QoS performance of spectrum management
    techniques. Cognitive radio (CR) allows low-priority secondary users to temporarily
    utilize the unused licensed channel of high-priority primary users, thereby significantly
    improving overall spectrum efficiency [1]. However, the secondary users need to
    vacate the occupied channel when the primary users appear. In order to return
    the occupied channel to the primary user and discover a suitable target channel
    to resume the unfinished transmission, spectrum handoff procedures are initiated
    for the secondary users.1 Basically, according to the principle of selecting the
    target channel for spectrum handoff, the operating modes of the secondary networks
    can be categorized as nonhopping and hopping. In the non-hopping mode, the secondary
    user always stays on its current operating channel when it is interrupted, which
    is the basic mode of IEEE 802.22 systems [3]. In the hopping mode, the interrupted
    secondary user can stay on its current operating channel or change to another
    channel according to traffic statistics. An example of the hopping mode is the
    phase-shifting hopping method used in IEEE 802.22 systems [3]. Secondary users''
    connections may execute multiple handoffs during its transmission period due to
    interruptions from primary users [4]. Clearly, these handoffs will degrade the
    quality of service (QoS) performance of the secondary users in providing sensitive
    traffic. In order to overcome the performance degradation due to multiple spectrum
    handoffs in the non-hopping or hopping mode, various spectrum management techniques
    are re-examined from the perspective of link connection quality for the secondary
    users. The spectrum management techniques include: Spectrum sensing (detecting
    an unused channel in the sensing phase) Spectrum decision (selecting the best
    initial channel in the analysis phase) Spectrum sharing (avoiding collision in
    the access phase) Spectrum mobility (switching to a suitable channel when a licensed
    primary user appears) Referring to [5], the relationships of these four spectrum
    management functionalities are shown in Fig. 1. In the figure, the secondary users
    first request channels from the CR network. With the spectrum decision functionality,
    they can determine their initial operating channels from all M candidate channels
    based on the spectrum sensing outcomes. The spectrum sharing functionality must
    be implemented to alleviative channel contention when multiple secondary users
    access the same channel. Furthermore, if a primary user appears on the occupied
    channel, the spectrum handoff procedures in the spectrum mobility functionality
    must be initiated. Figure 1. Relationships between spectrum sensing, spectrum
    decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility functionalities. Show All In
    this article, in order to evaluate the QoS performance of spectrum management
    techniques in the hopping mode, an analytical framework based on the preemptive
    resumption priority (PRP) M/G/1 queueing theory is developed. The proposed analytical
    framework can provide important insights into the design of the system parameters
    of spectrum management techniques for various traffic arrival rates and service
    time distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed analytical framework is
    illustrated by some examples. Specifically, we investigate how to design a load
    balancing spectrum decision scheme and evaluate the latency performance of various
    spectrum handoff schemes based on the proposed analytical framework. In conclusion,
    the transmission latency of secondary users can be improved significantly if they
    can adaptively adopt the optimal system parameters according to traffic conditions.
    Finally, we suggest some open issues on top of the proposed analytical model.
    Design Features and Current Solutions Design Features An important issue for a
    CR network is to develop an analytical framework to characterize the behaviors
    of the connection-based channel usage, including: Multiple interruptions and handoffs
    Spectrum sensing time Various operating channels Generally distributed service
    time Channel waiting time due to multiple secondary users Many analytical models
    have been proposed to characterize these features [6]–[9]. However, these five
    key design features have not been considered simultaneously. Current Solutions
    As shown in Table 1, the current modeling techniques of channel usage behaviors
    in CR networks can be classified into three categories: the partially observable
    Markov decision process (POMDP), the two-dimensional Markov chain, and the PRP
    M/G/1 queueing model. In [6], the evolution of the channel usage of the primary
    network is characterized by a discrete-time Markov chain that has two occupancy
    states (busy and idle). The framework of POMDP was developed to preselect the
    best action (target channel) to maximize the immediate reward (expected per-slot
    throughput) of the decision maker (secondary user) at the next time slot [6].
    In addition to the effects of the traffic loads of the primary network, the effects
    of the traffic loads of both the primary and secondary users on the statistics
    of channel occupancy were considered in [7], where a two-dimensional Markov chain
    is used to represent the total numbers of primary and secondary users in a CR
    network, respectively. When the secondary users are interrupted, it is assumed
    that they can immediately find an idle channel if at least one idle channel exists.
    As a result, the spectrum sensing time is neglected in this model. Furthermore,
    the Markov chain model is more suitable for exponentially distributed service
    time. It is unclear how to extend this kind of model to the case with generally
    distributed service time. Some researchers have used the PRP M/G/1 queueing model
    to characterize the spectrum usage behaviors of each channel. Based on this model,
    the effects of multi-user contention and multiple interruptions on the latency
    performance of secondary users'' connections were studied in [8], [9]. However,
    this PRP M/G/1 queueing model considered the non-hopping mode; thus, there is
    only one candidate channel for spectrum handoff. Note that the sensing time issue
    is not addressed in this model. Challenges Compared to the traditional PRP M/G/1
    queueing model, the proposed PRP M/G/1 queueing network model resolves two new
    challenging conditions: Various operating channels in the hopping model Spectrum
    sensing time Table 1. Comparison of various analytical models for CR networks,
    where the signs “O” and “x” indicate that the proposed model “does” and “does
    not” consider the corresponding feature, respectively. First, it is challenging
    to find a unifying model to characterize the channel switching behaviors for various
    target channel selection methods. We provide a systematic approach based on the
    proposed PRP M/G/1 queueing network model to catch the randomness property of
    the target channel selection, and evaluate its effects on the system performance
    metrics of transmission latency and channel utilization. Second, in the hopping
    mode secondary users may need to perform spectrum sensing to search for idle channels.
    The suggested PRP M/G/1 queueing network can also easily incorporate the sensing
    time into performance analysis. Transmission Processes with Multiple Handoffs
    for the Secondary Users'' Connections Figure 2 illustrates the transmission processes
    of a secondary connection in a two-channel CR network. The procedures consist
    of the following steps: In Fig. 2a, a secondary user plans to establish a new
    connection flow SC A to its intended receiver. Next, in Fig. 2b, the transmitter
    and receiver decide on their initial operating channel for SC A . In this example,
    they can select channel Ch1 or Ch2. In Fig. 2c, SC A is established at Ch1. During
    the transmission period of SC A , a request from a primary connection may arrive
    at Ch1. Next, in Fig. 2d, SC A detects the appearance of a primary user.2 Then
    the spectrum handoff procedures are initiated to vacate Ch1 and discover a suitable
    target channel to resume the unfinished transmission. In Fig. 2e, the target channel
    of SC A is decided for spectrum handoff. If the non-hopping mode is adopted, the
    operating channel of SC A cannot be changed; thus, SC A must select Ch1 to be
    its target channel. However, SC A can select Ch1 or Ch2 for its target channel
    when the hopping mode is adopted. There are many methods of selecting the target
    channel. For example, the target channel can be searched for by instantaneous
    spectrum sensing at this moment of interruption. In this case, the effect of spectrum
    sensing time τ on the latency performance of SC A must be considered. Finally,
    if SC A chooses to stay on Ch1, its remaining transmission will be resumed after
    all traffic loads of the primary users at Ch1 have been served, as shown in Fig.
    2f. On the other hand, if the decision is to change to Ch2, there are two possible
    situations. If Ch2 is idle, SC A can transmit remaining data immediately as shown
    in Fig. 2g. Otherwise, SC A must wait at the queue until all secondary users in
    the present queue of Ch2 are served, as shown in Fig. 2h. Note that similar spectrum
    handoff behaviors may be executed many times because a secondary user''s connection
    may experience multiple interruptions from primary users during its transmission
    period. Hence, the procedures from Figs. 2c–2h will be executed repeatedly. In
    this article, a set of target channels, called the target channel sequence, will
    be selected sequentially. Queueing-Theoretical Framework for Spectrum Management
    Overview of PRP M/G/1 Queueing Network Model Now we propose a preemptive resume
    priority (PRP) M/G/1 queueing network model to characterize the connection-based
    spectrum usage behaviors in CR networks. This model is very general and can easily
    be adjusted to evaluate the performance of various spectrum management techniques
    under different traffic conditions. Furthermore, it can also be applied to general
    CR network architectures, including ad hoc and centralized CR networks. Key features
    of the proposed queueing network model are listed below: Each server (channel)
    has two types of customers (connections). Before transmitting data, the traffic
    of the primary and secondary users enter the high-priority and low-priority queues,3
    respectively. According to the traffic arrival time at queues, the primary and
    secondary connections can be established without any collisions. The first come
    first served (FCFS) scheduling discipline is adopted to arrange the transmission
    order for these connections with the same priority.4 Figure 2. Illustration of
    transmission procedures in a two-channel system. The medium green areas indicate
    that the channels are occupied by existing primary users'' connections (PCs) or
    other secondary users'' connections (SCs): a) the transmitter of the secondary
    connection S C A plans to establish a connection flow to the intend receiver;
    b) the transmitter and receiver of S C A can select channel Ch1 or Ch2 as the
    initial operating channel; c) during the transmission period of S C A a primary
    connection arrives at Ch1; d) the transmission of S C A is stopped; e) the target
    channel of S C A is decided for spectrum handoff, they can either stay on Ch1
    or change to Ch2; f) S C A vacates Ch1 and then resumes the unfinished transmission
    when Ch1 becomes idle; g) S C A vacates Ch1 and changes its operating channel
    to the idle channel, Ch2; h) S C A vacates Ch1 and changes its operating channel
    to the busy channel, Ch2. Show All Primary users have the preemptive priority
    to interrupt the transmissions of secondary users. Interrupted secondary users
    can resume the unfinished transmission on the selected target channel instead
    of all the data. A secondary connection may experience multiple interruptions
    from primary users during its transmission period. Note that this model can be
    also extended to characterize the effects of heterogeneous channel bandwidth [11].
    Some assumptions are adopted for ease of analysis. The arrival processes of the
    primary and secondary connections are Poisson. Only one user can transmit on each
    channel at any time instant. The secondary transmitter can notify its corresponding
    receiver with the interruption event according to spectrum handoff protocols [12].
    Figure 3 shows an example of the PRP M/G/1 queueing network model with three channels.
    Let λ s be the arrival rate of the secondary connections in a CR network. When
    a secondary connection arrives at the CR network, it can select its initial operating
    channel. Let p (k) be the probability of selecting channel k . Thus, the effective
    arrival rate of the secondary connection at channel k is λ s (k) = p (k) λ s .
    Note that various spectrum decision algorithms will result in different values
    of p (k) . Figure 3. The PRP M/G/1 queueing network model with three channels.
    λ (k) p , λ (k) s . and ω (k) n are the arrival rates of the primary connections,
    the secondary connections, and the type-n secondary connections (n≥1) at channel
    k Note that ω (k) 0 = λ (k) s . Furthermore, f (k) p (x) and f (k) 1 (ϕ) are the
    PDFs of x (k) p and Φ (k) 1 , respectively. Show All When a newly arriving secondary
    user''s data is connected to the low-priority queue of its idle initial operating
    channel, it can be transmitted immediately. If a primary connection appears at
    channel k , a secondary connection using channel k will be interrupted. In this
    case, the secondary connection can decide to stay on the current operating channel
    or change to another channel through different feedback paths, depending on the
    operating mode and the adopted spectrum handoff scheme. If choosing to stay on
    its current operating channel, the interrupted secondary connection places the
    remaining data and wait at the head of the low-priority queue of the current operating
    channel. If it decides to change its operating channel, its remaining data will
    be connected to the tail of the low-priority queue of another channel. Note that
    ⊕ indicates that the traffic loads of the interrupted secondary connections are
    merged. When the interrupted secondary connection transmits its remaining data
    on the selected target channel, it might be interrupted again. Hence, the proposed
    model can describe the effects of multiple handoffs. In Fig. 3, S represents the
    channel selection point, where the newly arriving secondary connection must select
    its initial operating channel, or the interrupted secondary connection must select
    its target channel for spectrum handoff. There are many methods to select these
    channels. For example, the secondary connection can decide its initial operating
    channel or target channel according to the predetermined probability or the outcomes
    from instantaneous spectrum sensing. If the spectrum sensing is executed to search
    the idle channels, S can be regarded as a tapped delay line or a server with constant
    service time, which is related to sensing time. Hence, the effects of spectrum
    sensing time on the latency performance of secondary connections can be characterized.
    Modeling of Connection-Based Channel Usage Behaviors Now, we explain why the proposed
    model can characterize the connection-based channel usage behaviors of a CR network.
    In order to accurately characterize the transmission processes of a secondary
    connection, we must take the seven events discussed earlier into account. Secondary
    connection arrival event (Fig. 2a): We assume that the arrival process of the
    secondary connections is Poisson. Let X s and f s (x) be the service time of the
    secondary connections and its probability density function (PDF), respectively.
    Initial channel selection event of the secondary connections (Fig. 2b): We use
    p (k) to represent the probability that the secondary connection selects channel
    k for its initial operating channel. Furthermore, if spectrum sensing is executed
    to decide the initial operating channel, the effect of sensing time can be modeled
    by S. Primary connection arrival event (Fig. 2c): We assume that the arrival process
    of the primary connection is Poisson. Denoteby λ (k) p the arrival rate of the
    primary connections with default channel k . Furthermore, let X (k) p and f (k)
    p (x) be the service time of the primary connection at channel k and its corresponding
    PDF. Interruption event (Fig. 2d): In the PRP M/G/1 queueing network model, the
    primary users have the preemptive priority and can interrupt the secondary user''s
    transmission. In other words, the secondary users must vacate the occupied channel
    when the primary users appear. Target channel selection event (Fig. 2e): An interrupted
    secondary connection can stay on its current channel or change to another channel.
    To this end, its remaining transmission must be connected to the low-priority
    queue of the current channel or another channel through different feedback paths.
    Furthermore, if the spectrum sensing is executed to search the target channel,
    the effects of sensing time can be modeled by. Resumption event (Figs. 2f–h):
    The interrupted secondary connection can resume its unfinished transmission on
    the target channel instead of retransmitting all of the data. Multiple handoff
    events: Two auxiliary parameters ( ω (k) i and Φ (k) i ) are suggested to characterize
    the traffic flows of interrupted secondary connections. Two Auxiliary Parameters:
    ω (k) i and Φ (k) i In Fig. 3, we use two auxiliary parameters to characterize
    the traffic flows of the interrupted secondary connections. Type i secondary connections
    represent secondary connections that have experienced i interruptions. Denote
    ω i (k) as the arrival rate of traffic flows redirected from the type- (i−1) secondary
    connections at channel k . That is, ω (k) i is the arrival rate of the type i
    secondary connections at channel k . Note that ω 0 (k) = λ s (k) . Furthermore,
    let Φ (k) i be the transmission duration of a secondary connection between the
    ith and the (i+1 ) th interruptions at channel k and f (k) i (Φ) be the PDF of
    Φ (k) i . That is, Φ (k) i is the effective service time of the type i secondary
    connections at channel k . When the interrupted secondary connection transmits
    its remaining data on the selected target channel, it is possible to be interrupted
    again. Hence, the proposed model can describe the effects of multiple handoffs.
    Figure 4 illustrates the physical meaning of random variable Φ (k) i . Recall
    that X s is the service time of the secondary connections. We generate X s five
    times in Fig. 4, where the five realizations are divided into many segments due
    to multiple primary users'' interruptions. For example, the first secondary connection
    (realization) is divided into four segments because it experiences three interruptions
    at channels 1, 1, 1, and 2, respectively. Thus, this secondary connection''s initial
    operating channel is Ch1, and its target channel sequence is (Ch1, Ch1, Ch2).
    In Fig. 4, random variable Φ (1) 2 is one of the darker regions, representing
    the transmission duration of a secondary connection between the second and third
    interruptions at Ch1. That is, Φ (1) 2 is one of the third segments of the first,
    third, and fourth secondary connections in Fig. 4. Note that the fifth secondary
    connection in Fig. 4 does not have a third segment because it is interrupted only
    once. Figure 4. Illustration of the physical meaning of random variable Φ (k)
    i . For example, Φ (1) 2 is one of the third segments (darker areas) of the first,
    third, and fourth secondary connections. Show All In the hopping mode, it is quite
    complex to find the PDF of the effective service time of each segment because
    the effective service time is dependent on the traffic statistics of the primary
    and other secondary users of each channel, and the operating channels for these
    segments can be different. Based on the proposed analytical framework, we provide
    a systematic approach to evaluate the impacts of various system parameters on
    the effective service time and can help derive the closed-form expression for
    the PDF of the effective service time of each segment. Constraints An interesting
    open problem is to determine which spectrum handoff scheme can result in the shortest
    extended data delivery time under various traffic parameters and sensing time.
    Finally, we denote ρ (k) as the busy probability of channel k . In an M -channel
    network, the following constraint shall be satisfied: ρ (k) ≜ λ (k) p E[ X (k)
    p ]+ ∑ i=0 ∞ ω (k) i E[ Φ (k) i ]<1, (1) View Source where ρ (k) can be also interpreted
    as the utilization factor of channel k . In the following, we provide two examples
    to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical framework. Specifically,
    we focus on designing the load balancing spectrum decision scheme and the evaluation
    of latency performance for various spectrum handoff schemes. Qos Issues in Spectrum
    Decision Spectrum decision helps the secondary user select the best initial channel
    to transmit data. In order to evenly distribute the traffic loads of secondary
    users to candidate channels, an effective spectrum decision scheme should take
    into account not only the traffic statistics of the primary and secondary users,
    but also interruptions from the primary users. Here, we focus on the probability-based
    channel selection scheme, where the secondary user selects its initial operating
    channel from M candidate channels based on the predetermined distribution probability
    vector (denoted bY p=( p (1) , p (2) , ∘ – , p (M) )) . Obviously, this scheme
    must consider the load balancing issues and prevent the secondary connections
    from selecting a busy channel. Hence, it is important to determine the optimal
    channel selection probability to minimize the transmission latency of the secondary
    connections. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem to find the optimal
    distribution probability vector (denoted by p ∗ ) to minimize the average overall
    system time of the secondary connections (denoted by E[S] ), which is defined
    as the duration from the instant data arrive at the system until the instant the
    whole transmission is finished. Specifically, p ∗ = argmin ∀ p E[S(p)]. (2) View
    Source The closed-form expression for E[S] was derived in [11] based on the proposed
    model. Hence, p ∗ can be determined easily. Qos Issues in Spectrum Mobility Target
    channel selection in spectrum mobility functionality is an important problem.
    Unlike the traditional PRP M/G/1 queueing model considering only the non-hopping
    mode, we further consider the hopping mode in our proposed PRP M/G/1 queueing
    network model. According to the decision timing for selecting target channels,
    handoff mechanisms in the hopping mode can be categorized into proactive and reactive
    handoff schemes [13], [14]. The proactive handoff scheme proactively determines
    the target channel sequence before data transmission. In this case, it is necessary
    to resolve the issue of channel obsolescence because the preselected target channel
    may not be available when the handoff is requested. Because the channel obsolescence
    issue will increase the extended data delivery time, the key challenge is to predetermine
    the optimal target channels to minimize the extended data delivery time, especially
    in the case of multiple handoffs. Here, the extended data delivery time of a secondary
    connection is defined as the duration from the instant of transmitting data until
    the instant of finishing the whole transmission. On the other hand, for the reactive
    handoff scheme, the target channel is searched for by reactively spectrum sensing
    after handoff request is initiated. Then the secondary users can resume the unfinished
    transmission on one of the idle channels. Hence, the target channel sequence is
    a random sequence depending on the traffic statistics and sensing outcomes. In
    this case, spectrum sensing time is a key dominant factor for the extended data
    delivery time. Both proactive and reactive handoff schemes have their own advantages
    and disadvantages. The reactive handoff scheme can reduce its extended data delivery
    time by avoiding selecting a busy channel, but at the cost of relying on fast
    spectrum sensing techniques. The proactive handoff can save the time of scanning
    the whole spectrum to determine the target channel, but the predetermined target
    channel may not be available when it is requested by the secondary user. Thus,
    an interesting open problem is to determine which spectrum handoff scheme can
    result in the shortest extended data delivery time under various traffic parameters
    and sensing times [13], [14]. Figure 5 compares the extended data delivery time
    for the proactive and reactive handoff schemes. Here, we consider a two-channel
    system with the following traffic parameters: λ (1) s = λ (2) s =0.01,E[ X (1)
    p ]=E[ X (2) p ]=10 , and λ (2) p = λ (2) p = λ p . From this figure, we have
    the following important observations. First, the extended data delivery time of
    the reactive handoff has a singular point at λ p =0.043 . This is because the
    two different predetermined target channel sequences are adopted in the cases
    of λ p <0.043 and λ p >0.0443 . Based on the proposed model, the traffic-adaptive
    proactive handoff scheme can be designed to appropriately change to a better target
    channel sequence according to traffic conditions. Next, we focus on the reactive
    handoff scheme. In the ideal case where spectrum sensing time (denoted by τ )
    is 0, the extended data delivery time can be shortened around 7~20 percent compared
    to the proactive handoff scheme over various arrival rates of the primary connections.
    This is because the reactive handoff scheme can perform spectrum sensing to find
    the idle channels immediately. When τ=5 , the reactive handoff scheme is not always
    better than the proactive handoff scheme. Specifically, when λ p <0.037 , the
    proactive handoff scheme can result in shorter extended data delivery time. Hence,
    we can conclude that the proactive handoff scheme yields shorter extended data
    delivery time than the reactive handoff scheme when the traffic loads of the primary
    users are light, whereas the reactive scheme performs better with heavy traffic
    loads. Finally, the reactive handoff scheme will result in the longest extended
    data delivery time when τ = 10. Based on the proposed model, a principle to determine
    which handoff scheme should be adopted in CR networks can be designed for various
    sensing times and traffic parameters. Figure 5. Comparison of the average extended
    data delivery time for different spectrum handoff schemes, where E[ X s ]=10 .
    Show All Open Issues The proposed queueing network model provides a systematic
    method to help the design of spectrum management technologies. It can catch the
    five general behaviors for connection-based channel usage. More applications have
    been discussed in [11], [13]–[15]. Some interesting research issues that can be
    extended from the proposed model include the following: An important research
    direction of spectrum sensing is to consider the effects of missed detection and
    false alarm on the latency performance of primary and secondary users. These two
    kinds of sensing errors lead to the extension of the overall system time of primary
    and secondary connections. Preliminary results using the pro-posed analytical
    model with imperfect sensing can be found in [11]. From the viewpoint of spectrum
    decision, it is worthwhile to determine the optimal distribution probability vector
    for the probability-based spectrum decision method when secondary connections
    may have different opinions on the observed traffic statistics λ (k) p , λ s ,
    f (k) p (x) , and f s (x) · An interesting spectrum sharing issue is toincorporate
    the distributed channel contention behaviors into the proposed model. In the proposed
    model, we assume that the FCFS scheduling policy is adopted. For a distributed
    medium access control (MAC) protocol such as carrier sense multiple access (CSMA),
    the channel contention time and retransmission in the MAC layer should be taken
    into account when calculating the latency performance of secondary users. Furthermore,
    the proposed queueing network model can facilitate the design of an interference-avoiding
    admission control mechanism, discussed briefly in [15]. The proposed model assumes
    that the spectrum mobility functionality can help an interrupted secondary user
    resume its unfinished data transmission on a suitable channel. This resumption
    policy can be characterized by the preemptive resumption priority queueing network.
    However, in other scenarios, an interrupted secondary user may need to retransmit
    the whole connection rather than resuming the unfinished transmission. In this
    situation, a CR network should be modeled by the preemptive repeat priority queueing
    network. It is also worthwhile to investigate the latency performance results
    from different transmission policies. Conclusions In this article, the preemptive
    resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queueing network model has been proposed to evaluate
    the QoS performance of various spectrum management techniques in the non-hopping
    and hopping modes. This analytical framework can characterize the general behavior
    of connection-based channel usage and help evaluate QoS performance in various
    traffic conditions. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this model, we
    present two examples to explain how to design system parameters for the probability-based
    spectrum decision schemes and evaluate the latency performance of different spectrum
    handoff schemes. There are still many open problems for spectrum management techniques.
    On top of the proposed analytical framework, it is expected that better traffic-adaptive
    solutions can be provided to solve these open issues from a systematic viewpoint.

    radio technology, which aims to detect and utilize the temporally unused spectrum
    bands by sensing its radio environment in order to enhance spectrum utilization.
    However, these objectives bring significant challenges and required functionalities
    such as spectrum sensing, sharing, management and mobility for the realization
    of cognitive radio networks (CRN). In particular, efficient spectrum sharing problem
    in cognitive radio communication is one of the most important problem which must
    be addressed in order to enhance the overall spectrum utilization in dynamic spectrum
    access environments. In this paper, we introduce a new BIOlogically-inspired spectrum
    sharing (BIOSS) algorithm which is based on the adaptive task allocation model
    in insect colonies. Without need for any coordination among the unlicensed users,
    BIOSS enables each unlicensed user to distributively determine the appropriate
    channel(s) over which it can communicate. Performance evaluations clearly reveal
    that BIOSS achieves efficient dynamic spectrum sharing with high spectrum utilization
    and without any coordination among the users and hence yielding no spectrum handoff
    latency overhead due to coordination. Published in: 2007 IEEE Wireless Communications

    The spectrum access of the wireless networks is generally regulated by governments
    via a fixed spectrum assignment policy. Thus far, the policies have satisfactorily
    met the spectrum needs of the wireless networks. However, in the recent years,
    the dramatic increase in the spectrum access of the pervasive wireless technologies
    has caused scarcity in the available spectrum bands. Therefore, the limited available
    spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage necessitate a new communication
    paradigm to exploit the entire existing wireless spectrum opportunistically [1].
    This new networking paradigm is referred to as NeXt Generation (xG) Networks as
    well as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) [1].
    Cognitive radio has the ability to capture or sense the information from its radio
    environment. Based on interaction with the environment, cognitive radio enables
    the users to communicate over the most appropriate spectrum bands which may be
    licensed or unlicensed. Since the most of the spectrum is already assigned to
    the licensed users (primary user) by the governmental policies, cognitive radio
    mainly strives for the communication over the licensed spectrum band. In the licensed
    spectrum bands, cognitive radio exploits the temporally unused spectrum which
    is defined as the spectrum hole or white space [2]. If cognitive radio encounters
    the licensed user at the licensed spectrum band, it moves to another spectrum
    hole or stays in the same band without interfering with the licensed user by adapting
    its communication parameters such as transmission power or modulation scheme.
    As for the unlicensed spectrum bands in which the licensed users cannot exist,
    all users have the same priority to access the existing unlicensed spectrum bands.
    The cognitive radio technology enables the users to opportunistically access the
    available licensed or unlicensed spectrum bands through four main functionalities
    required: (i) spectrum sensing, (ii) spectrum managing, (iii) spectrum mobility
    and (iv) spectrum sharing [1]. Among these, spectrum sharing is one of the most
    important function in cognitive radio, which allows cognitive radio to fairly
    share the available spectrum bands among the coexisting cognitive radios. There
    exist some research efforts on the problem of spectrum sharing in cognitive radio.
    In some of these studies, the conventional approaches based on the centralized
    control [3], [4] are introduced. However, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic
    nature of cognitive radio, centralized approaches are not practical. Instead,
    in some studies, the distributed approaches which do not need any central controller
    are suggested [5], [6]. In [5], a distributed coordination which does not need
    any central controller is proposed. In [6], Asynchronous Distributed Pricing (ADP)
    scheme is proposed, based on the signal exchange via coordination between users
    to compensate the ascendant interference level. Due to their distributed approaches,
    these studies provide better adaptation capability to cognitive radio in the dynamically
    changing heterogeneous environment. However, the coordination among cognitive
    radios results in significant amount of coordination delay. Since cognitive radio
    should experience minimum delay to provide seamless communication capability during
    the spectrum handoff, the distributed spectrum sharing must provide minimum delay.
    In [7], decentralized cognitive medium access control protocols are proposed which
    enable secondary users to share the available spectrum according to their partial
    observations. However, the protocols do not consider the fairness of the spectrum
    sharing. In [8], a device-centric spectrum management scheme with low communication
    costs is proposed. According to this scheme, users observe their local interference
    patterns and select the appropriate spectrum and communication parameters. This
    scheme enables cognitive radio to non-cooperatively and fairly share the available
    spectrum. However, it does not consider the spectrum sharing for the multiple
    spectrum sharing case. In this paper, we introduce BIOlogically-inspired Spectrum
    Sharing (BIOSS) algorithm which is based on the adaptive task allocation model
    of an insect colony. Without need for any coordination among the unlicensed users,
    BIOSS enables each cognitive radio in the same environment to distributively share
    the available licensed or unlicensed spectrum bands over which it can effectively
    communicate. Furthermore, BIOSS enables cognitive radios to distributively decide
    the multiple spectrum bands over which it can simultaneously communicate without
    any coordination among cognitive radios. The rest of the paper is organized as
    follows. In Section II, we discuss some relation between biological task allocation
    and spectrum sharing in cognitive radio. In Section III, we introduce the BIOSS
    protocol algorithm and its detailed operation principles. Performance evaluation
    results and discussions are provided in Section IV, which is followed by Section
    V with concluding remarks. SECTION II. Insect Colony and Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive
    Radio Networks As a result of its ability to interact with its environment, cognitive
    radio enables the users to communicate over the most appropriate spectrum bands
    which may be licensed or unlicensed. Furthermore, cognitive radio can use multiple
    spectrum bands simultaneously. Moreover, the selected spectrum bands are not necessary
    to be contiguous [1]. This provides less performance degradation during spectrum
    handoff to cognitive radio [1]. This is mainly because, when cognitive radio vacates
    a spectrum band (spectrum handoff) due to any reason such as appearing licensed
    user, cognitive radio communication is not interrupted since cognitive radio continues
    the communication over the rest of spectrum bands. Although the multi-spectrum
    transmission promises for cognitive radio applications, a spectrum sharing model
    which can effectively share the all available spectrum bands is a challenging
    issue. Similar to cognitive radio, in insect colonies, individuals sense the environment
    to detect the tasks and then, the detected tasks are performed simultaneously
    by individuals which are better equipped for the task. Here, we adopt this natural
    mechanism to introduce an effective spectrum sharing model for CRN. A. Task Allocation
    Model of Insect Colony In the ant colonies, each ant has relatively little intelligence,
    while the collaborative behavior of the colony provides a great deal of global
    intelligence which is capable of optimizing certain tasks. In social insect colonies,
    different activities are often performed simultaneously by individuals which are
    better equipped for the task. This phenomenon is called division of labor [9].
    Here, for task allocation problem in insect colony, every individual has a response
    threshold for every task [9]. Response threshold refers to the likelihood of reacting
    to a task-associated stimuli. Task-associated stimuli s , is defined as the intensity
    of an activator associated with a particular task and it can be a number of encounters
    such as a chemical concentration, or any cue sensed by individuals. For example,
    if the task is larval feeding, the task-associated-stimuli s , may be larval demand
    expressed through the emission of the pheromone, i.e., a chemical substance deposited
    by real life ants [9]. Individuals perform the task when the level of the task-associated
    stimuli s , exceeds their threshold. Therefore, a response threshold θ determines
    the tendency of an individual to respond to the stimuli s , and perform the associated
    task. Thus, based on the above definitions, the probability of performing task
    as a function of stimuli intensity s , and response threshold θ , is given by
    T θ (s)= s n s n + θ n , (1) View Source where n>1 determines the steepness of
    the threshold. As observed in (1), for s<<θ , the probability of performing the
    task is close to zero and for s>>θ , this probability is close to 1. Therefore,
    performing the task is likely for s>>θ and unlikely for s<<θ . In the following,
    we apply the task allocation model of insect colony to establish an effective
    dynamic spectrum sharing model for CRN. B. Biological Task Allocation Based Spectrum
    Sharing Model for Cognitive Radio Networks Spectrum sharing in cognitive radio
    has great similarities with task allocation in insect colony. For example, cognitive
    radio senses the environment for the available spectrum bands and then, simultaneously
    transmits its packets to available spectrum bands. Similarly, in an insect colony,
    individuals sense the environment through the pheromone for available tasks and,
    then available tasks are accomplished by individuals better equipped for the tasks.
    In biological model, each task is shared to individuals better equipped for this
    task through the task performing probability given in (1). Similarly, in CRN,
    the available spectrum bands should be fairly shared to cognitive radios by the
    effective spectrum sharing model. According to this analogy, we adopt the task
    performing probability given in (1) to introduce the channel selection probability
    which enables cognitive radios to effectively share the best available spectrum
    bands. To this end, we map the task allocation model given in Section II-A to
    spectrum sharing in CRN as follows: We consider an insect in a colony as a cognitive
    radio. We consider a task as an available channel. We consider the task associated
    stimuli (s) as the estimated permissible power [10] to channel j( P j ) , where
    j denotes channel j . We consider the response threshold of an insect (θ) as the
    required transmission power ( p ij ) for cognitive radio i to channel j . Cognitive
    radio i determines p ij as the power which can meet the user requirements. To
    summarize this mapping between CRN and insect colony, it is also outlined in Table
    I. TABLE I Mapping Between CRN and Insect Colony Insect Colony Cognitive Radio
    Networks Insect Cognitive radio Task Available channel Task associated stimuli
    (s) Permissible power to channel ( P j ) Response threshold (θ) Required transmission
    power p ij ) According to the mapping discussed above and following (1), we introduce
    the channel selection probability T csp as T csp ij = P n j P n j +α p n ij +β
    L n ij , (2) View Source where n>1 determines the steepness of the channel selection
    probability T csp ij and α and β are the positive constants for respective influences
    of L ij and p ij . L ij is a learning factor which enables cognitive radio i to
    learn or forget the channel j . If channel j provides the QoS requirement of cognitive
    radio i , channel j is learned by cognitive radio i and L ij is updated as L ij
    − ξ 0 . If channel j cannot provide the QoS requirement of cognitive radio i ,
    channel j is forgotten by cognitive radio i and L ij is updated as L ij + ξ 1
    . ξ 0 and ξ 1 are the learning and forgetting coefficients, respectively. For
    sharing the available spectrum bands, each cognitive radio computes the channel
    selection probability for every available channel ( T csp ij ,∀j) . Then, the
    channel selection probabilities ( T csp ij ,∀i,j) are used by the cognitive radios
    to effectively capture the available spectrum band in the following way: When
    the estimated permissible power to channel j( P j ) is immensely larger than the
    required transmission power of cognitive radio i( P j >> p ij ) , T csp is close
    to one and it is most probable that cognitive radio i transmits to channel j .
    When the estimated permissible power to channel j( P j ) is much less than the
    required transmission power of cognitive radio i( P j << p ij ) , T csp is close
    to zero and it is almost impossible that cognitive radio i transmits to channel
    j . For a constant p ij , as the permissible power to channel j( P j ) increases,
    the probability that cognitive radio i transmits to channel j increases. For a
    constant P j , as the required transmission power of cognitive radio i( p ij )
    increases, the probability that cognitive radio i transmits to channel j decreases.
    If channel j has the small P j , it is highly likely that channel j is allocated
    by the cognitive radios having the small required transmission power ( p ij )
    . This provides that the channels having less permissible power are allocated
    by cognitive radios having less user demand. If channel j has the large P j ,
    channel j may be allocated by the cognitive radios having the small or big required
    transmission power ( p ij ) . This provides that the channels having more permissible
    power are allocated by cognitive radios having less or more user demand. If the
    spectrum handoff is triggered by the appearance of licensed user or any location
    change, (2) becomes zero for channel j due to P j =0 for all cognitive radios
    (∀i) until channel j is again available. Furthermore, in this case, for channel
    j , all learning coefficients ( L ij ,∀i) are set to initial values. (2) is computed
    by each cognitive radio when there is any change in the time-varying environment
    or user requirements. Thus, (2) enables cognitive radio to easily adapt to the
    instantaneous changes in the environment or user requirement, such as small holding
    time, user mobility, appearing the licensed user and hence to distributively share
    the available spectrum bands without any central controller and any coordination.
    SECTION III. BIO-inspired Spectrum Sharing Protocol (BIOSS) According to the model
    given in Section II-B, the detailed operation of BIOSS protocol algorithm is outlined
    here. In order to distributively conduct spectrum sharing by following the steps
    below, each cognitive radio i : determines the available spectrum bands by means
    of the appropriate spectrum sensing algorithms. estimates the permissible powers
    ( P j ) to the all available channels ( P j ,∀j) . sets the learning factor for
    every available channel ( L ij ,∀j) as the same initial values and sets the learning
    coefficients ξ 0 , ξ 1 to appropriate values (e.g., ξ 0 = ξ 1 =10 assumed for
    simulation experiments in Section IV to have equal learn and forget rates). computes
    the channel selection probability T csp for all available channels ( T csp ij
    ,∀j) selects the channel having maximum T csp ij to transmit its packets. Similarly,
    to use the multiple spectrum bands, cognitive radio selects the channels having
    larger T csp ij . If the number of channels is not adequate to meet the QoS requirements,
    cognitive radio increases the number of channels to transmit its packets. If the
    selected channel meets the QoS requirements, cognitive radio using this channel
    learns this channel by updating learning factor ( L ij = L ij − ξ 0 ) . If the
    selected channel can not meet the QoS requirements, cognitive radio using this
    channel forgets this channel by updating learning factor ( L ij = L ij + ξ 1 )
    . When the spectrum handoff is triggered by the licensed user appearance or any
    location change, the permissible power to vacated channel is set to zero ( P j
    =0) and all learning factors for this channel ( L ij ,∀i) is set to initial values.
    Apart from the spectrum handoff, when any change occurs at the environment, all
    channel selection probabilities ( T csp ij ,∀i,j) is distributively computed by
    all cognitive radios. Thus, BIOSS enables cognitive radios to distributively share
    the available spectrum bands without any coordination. This provides the better
    adaptation capability to instantaneous changes in the dynamically changing radio
    environment. It also provides cognitive radio the seamless communication capability.
    Furthermore, the learning capabilities of BIOSS enables cognitive radio to learn
    the slowly changing radio environment. According to BIOSS, while the interference
    increase, the permissible power to channel decrease. Therefore, the channel having
    small permissible power due to the interference can be preferred by the cognitive
    radio which needs the small power. This enables the cognitive radios to control
    the interference in the channels such that the channel having more interference
    can be preferred by the cognitive radio which needs the less transmission power.
    BIOSS has the spectrum efficiency such that according to the biologically inspired
    channel selection probability, while the cognitive radio which needs the more
    transmission power for its Qos demands prefers the channel which permits the more
    transmission power, the cognitive radio which needs the less transmission power
    prefers the channel which permits the less transmission power. Consequently, BIOSS
    allows cognitive radio to effectively share the available spectrum bands and provides
    the seamless communication capability. SECTION IV. Performance Evaluations In
    this section, we present the simulation results on the performance of BIOSS protocol.
    In order to evaluate the performance, we develop a simulation environment using
    MATLAB. Firstly, we give some assumptions for the simulation environment and then,
    we present the results on the performance of BIOSS. Our first results are related
    to the case that each cognitive radio uses only single channel among the available
    channels. The second set of results are for the case that each cognitive radio
    uses multiple channel simultaneously. A. Simulation Environment We assume that
    the randomly deployed licensed and unlicensed users with cognitive radio coexist
    in the environment. The number of users changes from 5 to 50 while the number
    of channel changes from 5 to 25. Each unlicensed user can access all available
    channel while the licensed users can access any channel to transmit with a fixed
    probability. We also assume that licensed users give only the instantaneous interrupt
    to the channels. B. Spectrum Sharing with Single Channel Selection In this section,
    we give the performance evaluations of BIOSS when each cognitive radio selects
    and communicates over one channel. We give simulation parameter in Table II. TABLE
    II Simulation Parameters Number of channels 5–25 Number of cognitive radios 5–50
    Initial permissible power interval ( P j ) 0–400mW Transmission power interval
    ( p ij ) 10–40mW Initial learning factors interval ( L ij ) 10–40 Learning coefficient
    ( ξ 0 ) 10 Forgetting coefficient ξ 1 10 α 10 β 5 Firstly, we conduct the simulation
    to observe that how the used power at the channels changes according to time.
    In Fig. 1, it is observed that 0<t<25 seconds, the used power at the channels
    oscillates because of the available channels are being captured by cognitive radios.
    However, after t=25s , since each cognitive radio learns its appropriate channel,
    the channel shows stationary behavior although the channels are interrupted by
    licensed user. BIOSS enables the cognitive radio to eventually learn the appropriate
    spectrum band. This provides the convergence to appropriate spectrum band. However,
    since the system is dynamically interrupted by the licensed user, it is not possible
    to completely converge the proposed algorithm. In Fig. 2, similar to Fig. 1 we
    show that the used power at the channels without the interruption of the licensed
    user. As observed, after t=25s , each cognitive radio finds and learns its appropriate
    channel, that is, the channel allocation process converges. Fig. 1. The changes
    in the used power at the four channels according to the time in the single selection
    case with the licensed user interruption. Show All The overall spectrum utilization
    as a function of the number of channels is shown in Fig. 3. The number of channels
    is set to be in between 5 and 25. Here, the number of cognitive radios is fixed
    at 10. As shown in Fig. 3, the overall spectrum utilization is slightly above
    50% regardless of the number of channels used. Therefore, the utilization is not
    affected by the number of channels. For this, the main reason is that BIOSS enables
    cognitive radios to learn their best spectrum which keeps utilization per user
    even the number of channel increases. We note that the main aim of the spectrum
    utilization part in the performance analysis is to show that BIOSS provides the
    great spectrum utilization while providing the seamless communication to cognitive
    radio. Fig. 2. The changes in the used power at four channels according to the
    time in the single selection case without the licensed user interruption. Show
    All Fig. 3. The channel utilization according to the different number of channels
    in single channel selection. Show All C. Spectrum Sharing with Multiple Channel
    Selection In this section, we give the performance evaluations of BIOSS when each
    cognitive radio selects and communicates over multiple channel. According to the
    same simulation parameters given in Table II, we assume that each cognitive radio
    selects three channels to communicate and transmits the same amount of power to
    the selected channels. Again, we conduct the simulation to observe that how the
    used power at the channels changes according to time. In Fig. 4, it is shown that
    in 0<t<15 seconds, the used powers at the channels oscillates because of a lot
    of spectrum handoff which result from sharing of available spectrum bands. However,
    after t=15s , since each cognitive radio allocates the available channels, the
    used power at the channels shows nearly static behavior although the channels
    are interrupted by the licensed users. In the multiple channel selection, the
    licensed user interrupts slightly affect the channel usages of unlicensed users
    with respect to the spectrum sharing with single channel selection. Moreover,
    while in single spectrum case channel allocation process converges after t=25s
    , in multiple case, channel allocation process converges faster (e.g., after t=15s
    ). This is mainly because that in the multiple spectrum selection, the power load
    of all unlicensed users is shared to the available channels. Fig. 4. The changes
    in the used power at the four channels according to the time in the multiple selection
    case. Show All The overall spectrum utilization as a function of the number of
    users is shown in Fig. 5 for both single spectrum and multi-spectrum cases. As
    observed in Fig. 5, while the number of unlicensed users increases from 0 to 30,
    the channel utilization increases for both cases from 0 to 95 percent. However,
    there is a slightly higher increase in the utilization of multi-spectrum case,
    which is mainly due to the fact that it intrinsically enables better utilization
    of the overall spectrum. Note also that as the number of users further increases,
    the improvement achieved by the multi-spectrum case over single-spectrum is also
    amplified due to the same reason. On the other hand, in Fig. 6, we observe the
    expected handoff delay due to coordination with different number of unlicensed
    users in a single channel selection case. Here, recall that BIOSS does not require
    any coordination among unlicensed users. Therefore, the objective of this experiment
    is to show that how much BIOSS saves in terms of potential spectrum handoff delay
    compared to the existing spectrum sharing techniques which achieve distributed
    spectrum sharing with a cost of coordination incurred handoff delay. Here, we
    assume that every spectrum handoff attempt incurs 1 unit of additional coordination
    related latency. Therefore, as observed from Fig. 6, as the number of users increases,
    the latency overhead of coordination based methods increases as well. Consequently,
    BIOSS outperforms the existing methods in terms of seamless spectrum mobility
    support by avoiding additional spectrum handoff delay. Fig. 5. The channel utilization
    according to the different number of unlicensed users in the single and multiple
    channel selection. Show All Fig. 6. Expected spectrum handoff delay due to coordination
    for varying number of unlicensed users in single channel selection. Show All SECTION
    V. Conclusion Efficient spectrum sharing is an important and challenging problem
    in cognitive radio networks which must be addressed in order to enhance the overall
    spectrum utilization. In this paper, we introduced a new BIOlogically-inspired
    Spectrum Sharing (BIOSS) algorithm which is based on the adaptive task allocation
    model in insect colonies. BIOSS does not need any coordination among the unlicensed
    users and achieves distributively determination of the appropriate channel(s).
    Simulation experiments show that BIOSS realizes efficient dynamic spectrum sharing
    with high spectrum utilization and without any coordination among the users and
    hence yielding no spectrum handoff latency overhead due to coordination. Authors

    Accesses 12 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract Spectrum handoff has an undesirable
    effect in utilizing the space for Secondary user (SU) in the spectrum, which causes
    a handoff delay in cognitive radio network. The SU frequently faces the problem
    of handoff process which is likely to interrupt the service and substantial delay
    over the quality of service during the transmission. It struggles towards identifying
    the channel during the handoff by occupying a major role in today’s era. Based
    on this research, an effectual spectrum handoff scheme is anticipated using Spectrum
    Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (SpecBPSO) algorithm and M/G/1 queuing model.
    Towards improving the efficiency of SU and reducing the congestion over channel,
    Cluster Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CBCSS) is used. The cluster head is
    selected dynamically based on the sensing signal of the SU. The cluster head is
    associated with the SU base station to report the active and inactive channel
    in the spectrum and later decision report is generated by the fusion center. In
    this proposed method, SpecBPSO uses the Boolean variable to reduce the total service
    time for handoff to find the optimal global value using bitwise and mutation operator
    format. This study work also presents an outline to observe the outcome of primary
    user’s activity and the delay performance of spectrum handoff with the possible
    interruptions in a CR network. The simulation setup of the proposed work is compared
    with spectrum particle swarm optimization (SpecPSO), binary particle swarm optimization
    (BPSO) and ant colony optimization that provide a better tradeoff over the delay
    achievement, maximize the SNR with the three benchmark functions and optimal handoff.

    Machine learning for coverage optimization in wireless sensor networks: a comprehensive
    review Article 05 November 2023 1 Introduction The wireless networking technology
    has increased the demand of spectrum bandwidth in the recent years. To complete
    the transmission without any intervention, the secondary user has to buy the energy
    either from the neighboring primary user or from the RF energy source [1]. The
    SU frequently searches for free channel in order to make a smooth transmission
    and checks for arrival of the licensed user [2]. The actions of the PU are supervised
    by the secondary user (SU) to avoid interference and collision appropriate to
    enhance the bandwidth of the spectrum effectively [3]. The secondary user (SU)
    is selected based on the reinforcement learning process and by sensing the signal
    of resources [4]. The behavior of the environment in the intelligent network is
    learnt through knowledge and decision is finalized for the review process to progress
    the act of cognitive radio [5]. Spectrum sensing is established into two stage
    cooperative spectrum sensing by detecting the free space channel from the fusion
    Center (FC) and repeatedly it has been made to check the idle space in order to
    develop the energy growth in searching the unoccupied channel by using particle
    swarm optimization (PSO) [6]. The optimal values of the fitness function is applied
    by the PSO–Instant overbooking framework for CRN to find the minimum compensation
    cost for using PU bandwidth. Based on this the requesting SU, which is active
    is noticed [7]. Apart from sensing the primary activity, white space, interference
    of PU and handoff, the sensing error is noticed by the fusion center, when the
    report of the active PU is issued by the SU [8]. The cooperative spectrum sensing
    (CSS) collects a numerous amount of reports from the SU due to which lack of power
    consumption and channel traffic will occur. To overcome the direct communication
    to the FC, cluster based sequential CSS is used [9]. The performance of channel
    sensing is detected through the ON and OFF status of PU in multiple antenna adaptive
    based energy detectors by decreasing the total error rate at a very low SNR [10].
    Figure 1 represents the licensed actor as PU and unlicensed actor as SU to receive
    the signal from their corresponding base station and the entire free bandwidth
    channels are accumulated and collected in the Fusion Center (FC) in search of
    an optimistic channel. Fig. 1 Cognitive radio network architecture Full size image
    The handover decision is utilized efficiently without the loss of connection during
    the mobility process and to provide the maximum spectrum exploitation in the cognitive
    radio network (CRN) by using queuing model and machine learning concept [11, 12].
    The hybrid spectrum handoff detects the unoccupied channel intelligently but,
    handoff results in unfortunate handoff time. The pure proactive spectrum handoff
    predicts the PU arrival rate in the fast manner and provides quick response even
    for a large number of channel whereas it results in poor handoff due to PU traffic
    delay [13, 14]. The PUTPOSH approach is prepared to sense the arrival of PU as
    well as it will decide whether SU needs any handoff requirement based on overall
    service time in order to avoid unnecessary handoff [15]. The M/G/1 queuing model
    focuses on both handoff delay and service time delay and checks whether it is
    essential for SU. The queue resembles with entire secondary user to process their
    unfinished task. The interrupted SU will join in the rear end of the queue to
    finish the task once the idle channel is noticed [16]. The main advantages associated
    with the proposed work is it can overcome the problem of spectrum scarcity for
    the SU and avoid the interference among PU and SU. It improves the Quality of
    Service (QoS) during the transmission of SU. The cons of cognitive radio network
    provides unnecessary handoff delay without any channel interruption. This may
    occur due to channel failure, without the intimation of PU arrival and signal
    problem. The proposed research work mainly investigates on sensing the feasible
    channel for SU; avoiding the unnecessary handover by cluster based CSS with Spectrum
    Binary Particle Swarm optimization (SpecBPSO) approach; selecting a best channel
    during the SU handoff from the queue using M/G/1 queuing model. The limitation
    of the proposed work is to improve the efficiency of the spectrum bandwidth for
    performing the secondary user transmission effectively without any delay. A few
    assumptions made here are no interference among the PU and SU but SUs can seamlessly
    synchronize with PUs. The quality of service should be enhanced in such a way
    to provide high throughput and avoid unnecessary handover. The rest of article
    is structured as follows: Sect. 2 shows certain background ideas related to the
    existing techniques. Section 3 introduces cluster based CSS, SpecPSO, ACO, BPSO
    and SpecBPSO based channel allocation and M/G/1 queuing model for spectrum handoff
    is detailed. Section 4 shows the numerical results associated for the proposed
    method. 2 Related works Hurmat Ali Shah et al., anticipated machine learning based
    effectual spectrum sharing approach. This anticipated strategy learns from spectral
    environment by considering the current status of primary user. Sensing details
    are retained in suitable classes and then present sensing status is partitioned
    into one such class. By the classification outcome, primary user is acknowledged
    either as absent or present. Confined choices are merged at FC to process the
    final solution by using novel decision strategy that considers the reliability
    of cognitive radio users [17]. A.M. Koushik et al., in [18] demonstrate the spectrum
    decision with the rate less code, machine learning algorithm called as Transfer
    Actor Critic Learning (TACT). Also, QoS is preserved by using this technique.
    It develops the convention of spectrum and affords the determined throughput by
    adapting the SU with proper channel. Marco Di Felice et al., have proposed a work
    in machine learning for cognitive radio mesh network by using reinforcement learning.
    It is used to sense the channel for transmitting the data towards mesh cluster.
    To improve its accuracy, all the information about the MRs are collected and compared
    for delivering a relatively fast process. The PU protection has not been enhanced
    in this work [19]. Koushik A.M et al., explores whether the channel is idle or
    not with the datagram error rate by developing a learning based spectrum handoff.
    The reinforcement learning consumes more time for sensing the channel whereas
    the transfer learning checks on behalf of expert node from the Q table to perform
    handoff [20]. Abdulraqeb Alhammadi et al., have investigated the spectrum handoff
    strategies such as proactive, reactive and hybrid with PSO to reduce service time
    in minimizing handoff delay [21]. Goli Sai Sumith et.al., proposed a decision
    making scheme to progress the optimal channel for handoff which is compared with
    Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods and produces better performance
    than the existing method. This algorithm provides high outcome when PU power is
    larger while using plot against standard deviation. It selects a similar channel
    during the consideration of both the algorithm [22]. Meiqin Tang et al., investigates
    about the problem of energy efficiency in CR network. Here, the space consumption
    is increased by reducing the energy productivity. ACO is used to resolve the problematic
    non-convex solution. The Gbest optimal value is found based on the chaos theory.
    The co-evolution chaotic PSO is implemented to produce more energy with less no
    of iteration [23]. D. Ruby et al., in [24] the research is mainly focused on the
    tasks such as spectrum sharing and relay selection. Most probably, the interference
    problem occurs for both PU and SU. An intelligent method has been incorporated
    to increase the throughput and take full advantage on the signal to noise ratio
    (SNR) for spectrum allocation and relay selection. To find the optimal solution,
    a forward based random relay selection scheme is used to link with the PSO technique
    for identifying the free space and establish an effective SU communication. Zahra
    Beheshti., have discussed about the S shaped transfer function for BPSO, which
    is used to solve the local and global exploitation problem. This algorithm enhances
    the efficiency of both throughput and convergence speed. [25]. Aiman H. El-Maleh
    et al., in [26] have demonstrated that, the BPSO provides a better effectiveness
    in state assignment problem for finite state machine. This is used to minimize
    its target area in sequential circuit by the optimization techniques. S.P. Rajamohana
    and K. Umamaheswari, have influenced the hybrid approach on iBPSO concept to promote
    their product based on their high demand review. This process is developed to
    provide an optimistic feature subset. The fake reviews are identified and the
    accuracy of the classification found to be improved. [27]. Sha-sha Guo, et. al.,
    have presented that the binary search space has some problem regarding the local
    and global optima in-terms of 0′s and 1′s. So in order to avoid those problem
    Z shaped transfer function for BPSO has been implemented and tested with many
    benchmarks. The impact of such transfer function improves their accuracy and speed
    by showing the better result [28]. Shanidul Hoque et al., have presented M/G/1
    queuing system to decrease the total service time (TST) for the cognitive user
    and provide the cumulative handoff delay (CHD) during the transmission of SU.
    It is proposed with non-switching, switching and random spectrum handoff. The
    PU activity and buffer size based on delay are examined [29]. 3 The proposed system
    model The proposed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme senses the inactive PU
    for leveraging smooth transmission by SU. This is achieved by using a cluster
    based cooperative spectrum sensing, which improves the recognizing knowledge.
    Various numbers of SUs are clustered into few groups and among that a preferred
    SU is selected for broadcasting the information in the cluster head. The correct
    decision is made by FC through the collection of information from cluster head.
    SpecBPSO is more similar to BPSO, where the mutation operation is performed for
    finding the best optimal and global channel. The spectrum handoff is performed
    based on the M/G/1 queuing model to reduce the total service time. 3.1 Cooperative
    spectrum sensing (CSS) Cooperative sensing remains in organizing the best solution
    and increase the detection performance of PU. Through which the SU work together
    and intellects the spectrum by finding the spectrum holes. Once after the process
    of identification, it has to concentrate on sensing to detect whether the primary
    user is active or inactive [30]. The CSS is also used to decrease the sequence
    process of steps in detecting the availability of PU. The SU can share the 1-bit
    decision based on value of. \(H_{0} = 0\) and \(H_{1}=1\). \(H_{0}\): Primary
    User is inactive. \(H_{1}\): Primary User is active. There are 2 hypotheses for
    sensing the free space signal in the primary user, which is formulated in Eqs.
    1 and 2 $$H_{0} :Su\left( t \right) = no\left( t \right)$$ (1) $$H_{1} :Su\left(
    t \right) = Pu\left( t \right) + bw\left( t \right)$$ (2) where \(Su\left( t \right)\) = represent
    the signal for secondary user arrival. \(no\left( t \right)\) = identify the ratio
    of the noise. \(Pu\left( t \right)\) = arrival signal of the primary user. \(bw\left(
    t \right)\) = AWGN channel. \(t = 1 \ldots M\) = discrete time signal for the
    primary user. \(M\) = samples of the signals. The cooperative spectrum sensing
    is organized by the cluster head. The cluster head will collect the overall details
    from the entire secondary user to individually initiate the channel sensing [31].
    3.2 Cluster based cooperative spectrum sensing In CRN, cooperative spectrum sensing
    consumes more time for sensing and reporting when more number of SUs are present
    in the spectrum. Sensing performance can be enhanced by using the cluster based
    CSS concept. The cluster based CSS contains all the free bandwidth of the primary
    user in the cluster head. When, SU is made to accomplish the handover, the best
    idle channel is advised by the FC for performing smooth transmission as represented
    in Fig. 2. Individual decision is made by each and every user and then sent to
    the cluster head. The cluster head sorts a conclusion by particularly sensing
    the reliable channel in order to reduce the reporting error. This tends to improve
    the sensing performance with the cluster based cooperative sensing and sends the
    details to the SU base station or fusion center [32]. In this proposed method,
    active or inactive licensed channel is noticed from the primary user signal. If
    the primary user is utilizing the bandwidth, it is considered as active if not
    it will be considered as inactive. Based on the high frequency availability, the
    target decision is selected from the licensed signal with the fusion center and
    broadcasts it to the cluster head. To find the optimal fusion rule, OR rule is
    applied [33]. Fig. 2 Cluster based cooperative spectrum sensing Architecture Full
    size image The cluster based cooperative spectrum sensing is followed by sequence
    of steps: The cognitive radio \(t\) in cluster \(i\) collects the energy \(E_{i,t}\)
    and sends the details to the cluster head, \(CL_{i,t}\). Here i = 1,2,…..k, t = 1,2,3,….S,
    k is number of clusters, \(S_{i}\) refers to number of secondary user in ith cluster.
    The cluster head receives all the details from the PU base station in a single
    cluster and makes a final decision \({D}_{i}\) for choosing the channel from the
    fusion center as in Eq. (3) $$D_{i} = \delta \left( {CL_{i,1} , CL_{i,2.} \ldots
    .,CL_{{i,S_{i} .}} } \right)$$ (3) All the cluster decision are stated in the
    common cluster and the final decision for idle channel identification is made
    by the fusion decision as in Eq. (4) $$FD = \emptyset \left( {\widehat{{D_{1}
    , }}\widehat{{D_{2} , }} \ldots \ldots ..\widehat{{D_{k} }}} \right)$$ (4) \(\widehat{{D_{1}
    , }}\widehat{{D_{2} , }} \ldots \ldots ..\widehat{{D_{k} }}\) stores the signal
    (0,1) in the common receiver. The OR rule is formulated to identify whether the
    PU channel is active (busy) or Inactive (idle) by the Eq. (5) $$\emptyset : FD
    = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {1, \quad \mathop \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{k} \widehat{{D_{k}
    }} \ge 1} \\ {0, \quad otherwise} \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (5) The false alarm
    is measured to check whether the busy PU channel is selected for SU and whereas
    missing detection is also measured to check the free PU channel is not accessed
    by the SU in Eqs. 6 and 7. $$PC_{fa} = 1 - \mathop \prod \limits_{i = 1}^{k} \left[
    {\left( {1 - PC_{fa,i} } \right)\left( {1 - PC_{er,i} } \right) + PC_{fa,i} PC_{er,i}
    } \right]$$ (6) $$PC_{md} = \mathop \prod \limits_{i = 1}^{k} \left[ {PC_{md,i}
    \left( {1 - PC_{er,i} } \right) + \left( {1 - PC_{md,i} } \right)PC_{er,i} } \right]$$
    (7) The probability of error is calculated for noise ratio as in Eq. (8) $$PC_{er,i}
    = \mathop \sum \limits_{j = 0}^{{S_{i} - 1}} \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {S_{i}
    - 1} \\ j \\ \end{array} } \right)\left( { - 1} \right)^{{S_{i} - j - 1}} \frac{{S_{i}
    }}{{2\left( {S_{i} - j} \right)}}\left( {1 - \sqrt {\frac{{\overline{{snr_{i}
    }} }}{{S_{i} - j + \overline{{snr_{i} }} }}} } \right)$$ (8) \(\overline{{snr_{i}
    }}\) is SNR in cluster head i  which is circulated with similar mean value. If
    channel selected by secondary user and fusion center are seamless, false alarm,
    detection and missing detection are evaluated as in Eqs. 4, 5, 6 and 7 respectively.
    Let PCd,i-Probability of detection, PCfa,i-Probability of false alarm, PCer,i-Probability
    of error based on the cluster decision Dk and PCmd,i-Probability of missing detection   are
    as follows: $$Prob_{d,i} = Prob {(}CL_{i} > {\mu |}H_{1} )$$ (9) $$Prob_{fa,i}
    = Prob {(}CL_{i} > {\mu |}H_{0} )$$ (10) $$Prob_{md,i} = 1 - Prob_{d,i}$$ (11)
    $$CL_{i} = \mathop \sum \limits_{t = 1}^{{S_{i} }} E_{i,t}$$ (12) In Eq. (9),
    the free PU channel is identified whereas the Eq. (10) is used to checks whether
    busy channel is considered for SU. If the PU channel is idle but it is not considered
    for the SU due to fault is verified in Eq. (11). In Eq. (12), the overall idle
    channel is grouped into the fusion center. Here µ = 0.5 represents threshold value
    which is assumed to be as a primary signal. The efficiency of energy is compared
    with the fixed threshold value and the decision is processed to choose the optimal
    channel for the SU during the handover based on OR rule is in Eqs. 13, 14 and
    15 respectively. $$PC_{fa} = 1 - \mathop \prod \limits_{i = 1}^{n} (1 - Prob_{fa,i}
    )$$ (13) $$PC_{d} = 1 - \mathop \prod \limits_{i = 1}^{n} (1 - Prob_{d,i} )$$
    (14) $$PC_{md} = \mathop \prod \limits_{i = 1}^{n} Prob_{md,i}$$ (15) By  evaluating
    the Eqs. 13, 15 and 8, the outcome of the channel is obtained in the fusion center.
    From Eqs. 6 and  7, it is well known that PCfa is enclosed with the error probability
    report and PCmd  is diminished with fault channel report The free sensed channel
    are represented by using Eq. (16) $$M = \frac{1}{{SNR^{2} }}\left( {G^{ - 1} \left(
    {Prob_{fa,i} } \right) - G^{ - 1} \left( {Prob_{d,i} } \right)\sqrt {2SNR + 1}
    } \right)^{2}$$ (16) Here, \(G^{ - 1}\) is Gaussian’s complementary distribution
    functions. When PU is inactive, no false alarm is attained in Eq. (17) and When
    PU is active, idle channel cannot be detected by SU hence the possible throughput
    is in Eq. (18). $$T_{p0} = \frac{{D_{f} - D_{s} }}{{D_{f} }}\left( {1 - Prob_{fa,i}
    } \right)T_{s0}$$ (17) $$T_{p1} = \frac{{D_{f} - D_{s} }}{{D_{f} }}\left( {1 -
    Prob_{d,i} } \right)T_{s1}$$ (18) Here, \(D_{s} = M* T_{sen}\),\(T_{sen}\) refers
    to sensing time. The average throughput \(T_{put}\) for the successful transmission
    without any delay by the SU is expressed in Eq. (19) $$T_{put} = Prob\left( {H_{0}
    } \right)T_{p0} + Prob\left( {H_{1} } \right)T_{p1}$$ (19) Here, \(D_{f}\).—frame
    duration, \(D_{s}\)—sensing duration,\(T_{p0} \& T_{p1}\)- absence and presence
    of PU, \(T_{s0}\)&\(T_{s1}\)—throughput for secondary user. To maximize the throughput
    with no interference of PU  maxthr  is measured in Eq. (20). TarProbd,iis target
    probability for identifying the inactive PU.  $$max_{thr} = \left\{ {\max Prob\left(
    {H_{0} } \right)T_{p0} Prob_{d,i} \ge TarProb_{d,i} } \right\}$$ (20) 3.3 Spectrum
    particle swarm optimization (SpecPSO) The initial velocity and position in search
    space at time \(\left( {T + 1} \right)\) are expressed as $$VL_{i,d} \left( {T
    + 1} \right) = \omega \left( T \right)VL_{i,d} \left( T \right) + {\text{ PB}}\left(
    {\text{T}} \right)\left( {pbest_{i,d} - { }NP_{i,d} \left( T \right)} \right)
    + {\text{GB}}\left( {\text{T}} \right)\left( {gbest_{d} - { }NP_{i,d} \left( T
    \right)} \right)$$ (21) $$NP_{i,d} \left( T \right) = NP_{i,d} \left( T \right)
    + VL_{i,d} \left( {T + 1} \right)$$ (22) From Eq. (21), \(\omega \left( T \right)\).
    is the inertia weight which traces the velocity of all particles is under the
    signal area and inhibits from the change of direction. It updates the Home Network
    (HN). PB(T) is the present best gains information of the particles through experience.
    GB(T) is the global best determines the optimal particles from its neighbor and
    updates Foreign Network (FN). PB(T) and GB(T) is specified by the social factor
    \({c}_{1}and{c}_{2}\), d represents the dimensions and to update the new position
    is in Eq. (22). The SpecPSO consist of two equations are formulated as, $$VL_{i}
    \left( {T + 1} \right) = \omega \left( T \right)VL_{i} \left( T \right) + { }c_{1}
    rand_{{1{ }}} \left( {pbest_{i} - { }NP_{i} \left( T \right)} \right) + { }c_{2}
    rand_{{2{ }}} \left( {gbest - { }NP_{i} \left( T \right)} \right)$$ (23) $$NP_{i}
    (T + 1) = Np_{i} (T) + VL_{i} (T + 1)$$ (24) In Eqs. 23 and 24\(VL_{i} \left(
    {T + 1} \right)\) and \(NP_{i} \left( {T + 1} \right)\) are new updated velocity
    and position of swarm particle \(\mathrm{i}\) at time \(\left( {T + 1} \right).
    c_{1} \& c_{2}\) are social constant, \({rand}_{1 }\&{rand}_{2}\) are random variables
    belongs {0,1}.The \({pbest}_{i}\) is the local best solution for swarm particle
    \(\mathrm{i}\) until time \(\left( {T + 1} \right)\) whereas \(gbest\) is global
    best solution for swarm particles \({\text{i}}\) at time \(\left( {T + 1} \right)\).
    Here, \(pbest_{i}\) is the exploitation and \(gbest\) is the search of the solution
    in space. \(\omega\) is a inertia weight that provides a minimum cost to the previous
    velocity during the iteration era. The upper bound and lower bound are \(V_{max}
    ,V_{min}\) on velocity which prefers large value for SpecPSO and small value for
    Binary PSO [34, 35].  3.4 Ant colony optimization (ACO) In the path search process
    of ACO, the ants pass heuristic information between the nodes according to the
    number and distance of pheromones on the path. At time t, the state transition
    probability of ant K from node i to node j is calculated. In addition, in order
    to avoid excessive pheromone residuals leading to heuristic information flooding,
    each ant should update the remaining information after completing one step or
    traversing all n elements. Therefore, the amount of information on the path (i,
    j) at time \(\left( {t + n} \right)\) can be adjusted according to the following
    rules, and the update rules are shown in Eqs. 25 and 26. $$\tau_{ij} \left( {t
    + n} \right) = \left( {1 - \rho } \right) \cdot \tau_{ij} + \Delta \tau_{ij} \left(
    t \right)$$ (25) $$\Delta \tau_{ij} \left( t \right) = \sum_{k = 1}^{m} \Delta
    \tau_{ij}^{k} \left( t \right)$$ (26) Since the updating strategies of pheromone
    are the difference, when the value of the urban scale is in an appropriate scope,
    the global search can obtain better solutions. Therefore, the global pheromone
    updating strategy is adopted, which is expressed in Eq. (27). $$\tau _{{ij}}^{k}
    \left( t \right) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{ll} {\frac{Q}{{L_{K} }}}, & {If{\mkern
    1mu} the{\mkern 1mu} K^{{th}} {\mkern 1mu} ant\;,passes{\mkern 1mu} \left( {i,j}
    \right){\mkern 1mu} in{\mkern 1mu} this{\mkern 1mu} cycle} \\ 0, & {otherwise}
    \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (27) In the above Eq. (27), Q represents the amount
    of pheromone secreted by ants in one cycle, which affects the convergence speed
    of the algorithm to a certain extent; \(L_{K}\) represents the length of the lines
    that ant K has passed in this cycle. At each stage, the ant chooses to move from
    one city to another according to some rules: It must visit each city exactly once;
    A distant city has less chance of being chosen (the visibility); The more intense
    the pheromone trail laid out on an edge between two cities, the greater the probability
    that that edge will be chosen; Having completed its journey, the ant deposits
    more pheromones on all edges it traversed, if the journey is short; After each
    iteration, trails of pheromones evaporate. 3.5 Binary particle swarm optimization
    (BPSO) The PSO contains sequence of continuous value whereas the BPSO contains
    discrete value. The key difference between PSO and the BPSO is that the velocity
    of the each particle comprises the probability of \(NP_{ij} = 1\). Even after
    updating the velocity over iteration the value remains unchanged [38]. The decision
    making of particle swarm optimization is done by the discrete binary value in
    the form of “0” and “1” respectively [39]. In BPSO, the pbest and gbest are upgraded
    simultaneously and the velocities of the particles are converted into bits. Binary
    Particle Swarm optimization (BPSO) is an improved form of PSO which deal with
    position, velocity and optimally best position of particles, to resolve binary
    oriented problems. In this technique, search space is restricted to [0, 1] and
    rules for determining global best of particles (primary/secondary users) is to
    establish communication between them using probability, therefore velocity is
    expressed as probability of mobility of users from binary ‘0′ to binary ‘1′[40,
    41]. Each swarm particle velocity are updated using Eq. (28).The continuous velocity
    using sigmoid function is limit to range of {0, 1} as in Eq. (29). $$VL_{ij} \left(
    {T + 1} \right) = \omega \left( T \right)VL_{ij} \left( T \right) + { }c_{1} rand_{{1{
    }}} \left( {pbest_{ij} - { }NP_{ij} \left( T \right)} \right) + { }c_{2} rand_{{2{
    }}} \left( {gbest_{j} - { }NP_{ij} \left( T \right)} \right)$$ (28) $$VL^{\prime}_{ij}
    \left( {T + 1} \right) = sigmoid \left( {VL_{ij} \left( {T + 1} \right)} \right)
    = \frac{1}{{1 + e^{{ - VL_{ij} \left( {T + 1} \right)}} }}$$ (29) Here \(i,j\)
    are swarm particle \(i\) and particle bit \(j\) of that velocity. To update the
    new position is formulated in Eq. (30): $$NP_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1} \right) = {\text{
    }}\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {1,if\;rand_{{ij}} {\text{ < sigmoid}}\left(
    {{\text{VL}}_{{{\text{ij}}}} \left( {{\text{T + 1}}} \right)} \right)} \hfill
    \\ {{\text{0}},{\text{Otherwise}}} \hfill \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (30) where
    \(rand_{ij}\) is a uniform random number in the range [0, 1].The process of this
    approach, Assume that the velocity is in range [− 4, 4] with \(V_{max} = 4\) and
    \(V_{min} = -\)\(4\). In this case, the particle bit should change its bit value.
    The value obtained using Eq. (29) for  \(sigmoid \left( 4 \right) = 0.9856\) and
    hence new position is updated with bit value of \(NP_{ij} = 1\). Similarly, when
    \(\left( { - 4} \right) = 0.016\), the bit value of \(NP_{ij} = 0\). Lastly, for
    \(NP_{ij} = 0\) the value of \(sigmoid \left( {VL_{ij} } \right) = 0.5\) which
    occur a randomness problem and the bit value \(NP_{ij}\) can be changed either
    to ‘1′  or ‘0’. Here BPSO plays a vital role for minimizing the function of pbest
    and gbest which are simplified and shown in Eq. (31) and Eq. (32). $$pbest_{{ij}}
    \left( {T + 1} \right) = {\text{ }}\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {NP_{{ij}} \left(
    {T + 1} \right),if\;Fit\left( {NP_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1} \right)} \right){\text{
    < Fit}}\left( {{\text{pbest}}_{{{\text{ij}}}} \left( {\text{T}} \right)} \right)}
    \hfill \\ {{\text{pbest}}_{{{\text{ij}}}} \left( {\text{T}} \right),{\text{Otherwise}}}
    \hfill \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (31) $$gbest_{j} \left( {T + 1} \right) = {\text{
    }}\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {pbest_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1} \right),if\;Fit\left(
    {pbest_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1} \right)} \right){\text{ < }}Fit\left( {gbest_{j}
    \left( T \right)} \right)} \hfill \\ {gbest_{j} \left( T \right),Otherwise} \hfill
    \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (32) Compare each particles with its updated position
    to identify the optimal solution using fitness function are formulated in Eqs.
    (33), (34), (35) and (36) respectively. If \(Fit_{ij} \left( {NP_{ij} } \right)
    < Fit_{ij} \left( {pbest_{ij} } \right)\). then $$Fit_{ij} \left( {pbest_{ij}
    } \right) = Fit_{ij} \left( {NP_{ij} } \right)$$ (33) else $$Fit_{ij} \left( {pbest_{ij}
    } \right) = Fit_{ij} \left( {pbest_{ij} } \right)$$ (34) \(Fit_{j} \left( {gbest_{j}
    } \right) = minimum\left\{ {Fit_{ij} \left( {pbest_{ij} } \right)} \right\}\).
    If \(Fit_{j} \left( {gbest_{j} } \right) < Fit_{ij} \left( {pbest_{ij} } \right)\).
    then $$Fit_{j} \left( {gbest_{j} } \right) = Fit_{j} \left( {gbest_{j} } \right)$$
    (35) else $$Fit_{j} \left( {gbest_{j} } \right) = Fit_{ij} \left( {pbest_{ij}
    } \right)$$ (36) Here Fit is the fitness function and n is the number of iteration.
    If \(pbest_{ij} = gbest_{j} = 1\) and \(NP_{ij} = 0\) then Eq. (28) will rise
    the velocity of the particle \(NP_{ij} = 1\) similarly, \(pbest_{ij} = gbest_{j}
    = 0\) and \(NP_{ij} = 1\). then Eq. (28) will reduce the velocity of the particle
    \(NP_{ij} = 0.\) Further, this process works well by increasing and decreasing
    the velocity of the swarm particles. The constraint of this BPSO algorithm is
    that when the updated bit is same as the present and current value \((NP_{ij}
    = pbest_{ij} = gbest_{j} )\), it increases \((pbest_{ij} = gbest_{j} = 1)\) or
    decreases \((pbest_{ij} = gbest_{j} = 0)\) the velocity bit value. If it is different
    \((pbest_{ij} \ne gbest_{j} )\), \((NP_{ij} = pbest_{ij} )\) or \((NP_{ij} = gbest_{j}
    )\), the velocity observes either the previous value or the current value. But
    quality of the result does not rise when the local and global best remains same
    or different. There occurs a local minima and randomness problem. To overcome,
    SpecBPSO a new algorithm is proposed. 3.6 Spectrum Handoff for Handoff delay In
    this proposed work, the handoff delay is based on the transmission rate from waiting
    time till recommencing the transmission of SU. Two possible cases are followed
    during the handoff strategy. First case: channel is idle in the spectrum for transmission
    of data with the secondary user. Second case: if channel is busy, then it has
    to wait till the next channel is vacant for transmission. In Fig. 3a PU channel
    in Ch2 contains free bandwidth, which is used for transmission in the SU from
    SU1 to SU4. Figure 3b At present, PU reaches Ch1 for transmission which states
    that SU has to vacate the channel and identify the next free channel for transmission
    without any delay as shown in Fig. 3c. In Ch2, a free channel is noticed and handoff
    takes place by the SU as represented in Fig. 3d. Again PU arrives in Ch2, so SU
    is made to wait and it has been observed that PU in Ch1 which arrived in earlier
    bandwidth is allowed for SU transmission as shown in Fig. 3e and f [42]. Fig.
    3 Design of spectrum mobiliy management mechanism Full size image 3.7 M/G/1 Queueing
    priority network model The M/G/1 queueing model is generally used to store the
    SU in queue for transmission. The queue is served in First Come First Serve (FCFS)
    scheduling method, where uninterrupted SU also resides in the queue. Higher priority
    is given to interrupted SU eventhough the uninterrupted SU is located in the first
    position. This is achieved in order to reduce the handoff delay and increase the
    total service time for the secondary user to complete its transmission without
    any delay. This concentrates on two cases: Continue case and Moving case. The
    Continue case is processed when there is no interruption by PU whereas the moving
    case is done when an interruption occurs. [43]. Assume that the poisson distribution
    for the arrival of PU and SU with rates such as φ(P)pu and φ(P)su respectively.
    The exponential distribution for PU and SU to recognize its average service time
    are e(tpu) and e(tsu) with the rate of αpu and αsu. \(e\left( {t_{pu } } \right)
    = \frac{1}{{\alpha_{pu} }}\), \(e\left( {t_{su } } \right) = \frac{1}{{\alpha_{su}
    }}\). The total service time is expressed in Eq. (37) & Eq. (38) $$e\left( {T^{\left(
    p \right)} } \right) = e\left( {t_{su}^{\left( p \right)} } \right) + e\left(
    n \right)e\left( {d^{\left( p \right)} } \right)$$ (37) \(e\left( d \right)\) = Avg
    number of SU handoff delay. \(e\left( n \right)\) = Avg number  of disruption
    / interruption $$e\left( n \right) = \varphi_{pu} e\left( {t_{su} } \right)$$
    (38) During the period of continue case, the active stage of PU is calculated
    using Eq. (39) & Eq. (40). $$e\left( {T_{continue} } \right) = e\left( {t_{su}
    } \right) + e\left( n \right) A_{pu}$$ (39) $$where A_{pu} = \frac{{e\left( {t_{pu
    } } \right)}}{{1 - \varphi_{pu} e\left( {t_{pu } } \right)}}$$ (40) During the
    period of moving case, the moving time and the waiting time is calculated using
    Eq. (41) & Eq. (42). $$e\left( {T_{moving} } \right) = e\left( {t_{su} } \right)
    + e\left( n \right)\left( {mt_{su} + wt_{su} } \right)$$ (41) $$wt_{su} = \left[
    {\frac{{0.5\varphi_{pu} e\left( {t_{pu } } \right)^{2} + \frac{{\varphi_{su} }}{{\left(
    {\varphi_{pu} + \varphi_{su} } \right)\alpha_{su} }} + \frac{{\varphi_{{pu^{2}
    }} e\left( {t_{pu } } \right)^{2} }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho_{pu} } \right)}}e\left(
    {t_{pu } } \right)}}{{1 - \rho_{pu} - \rho_{su} }}} \right]$$ (42) Based on Eqs.
    43, 44, and 45 when the PU is less active, the SU continues to transmit in the
    same channel whereas PU is more active, the SU need to eject the channel and waits
    for other idle channel. $$e\left( T \right) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {e\left(
    {T_{continue} } \right), A_{pu} \le mt_{su} + wt_{su} } \\ {e\left( {T_{moving}
    } \right), A_{pu} \ge mt_{su} + wt_{su} } \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (43) $$wt_{reactive}
    = \left[ {\frac{{\varphi_{pu} (pro_{t} \alpha_{su} + \varphi_{pu} \alpha_{su}
    e\left( {t_{pu } } \right)^{2} + \left( {\varphi_{su} - \varphi_{pu} pro_{t} \alpha_{su}
    } \right)e\left( {t_{pu } } \right) }}{{\alpha_{su}^{2} \left( {1 - \varphi_{pu}
    e\left( {t_{pu } } \right)} \right)}}} \right]$$ (44) $$wt_{proactive} = min\left\{
    {e\left( {T_{continue} } \right), e\left( {T_{moving} } \right)} \right\}$$ (45)
    where prot is processing time which is total sum of channel switching time. The
    channel is comprised of two queues illustrated in Fig. 4. One queue is organized
    for PU and next for SU. The free channels are allocated in the queue 1 which can
    be used by the SU during handover. Before fixing the channel, it calculates the
    service time of the channel availability. This mechanism is mainly implemented
    in order to avoid unnecessary handoff and no delay transmission. Fig. 4 M/G/1
    queuing model with two channels Full size image 3.8 The proposed spectrum binary
    particle swarm optimization (SpecBPSO) with cluster based cooperative spectrum
    sensing The local minima and converge problem occurs in BPSO based on the binary
    bit of “1” is sigmoid(VLij (T+1)) whereas binary bit “0” is 1-sigmoid(VLij (T+1)).
    This happens during the occurrence of randomness over the period of iterations
    which means the particle bits gets interchanged. So that for larger velocity there
    creates a lower exploration and for smaller velocity it provides stronger exploration
    [44].These problems are resolved by proposed method Spectrum Binary Particle Swarm
    Optimization (SpecBPSO). In this proposed algorithm, local minima and convergence
    rate gets reduced by applying V-shaped transfer function [45, 46]. The Eq. (46)
    avoids the convergence when the velocity value is 1, then it is set as 1 whereas
    when velocity is 0, then it is fixed to 0.The Eq. (47) is observed to update the
    value of position based on the velocity. $$Tran\left( {VL_{ij} \left( {T + 1}
    \right)} \right) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {1 - \frac{2}{{1 + e^{{ - VL_{ij}
    \left( {T + 1} \right)}} }} if VL_{ij} \left( {T + 1} \right) \le 0 } \\ {\frac{2}{{1

    > 0 } \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (46) $$NP_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1} \right) = {\text{
    }}\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {0\;if\;rand_{{ij}} \le Tran\left( {VL_{{ij}}
    \left( {T + 1} \right)} \right)and\;VL_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1} \right) \le 0{\text{
    }}} \hfill \\ {1\;if\;rand_{{ij}} \le Tran\left( {VL_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1} \right)}

    {T + 1} \right)} \right)} \hfill \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (47) Based on Eq.
    (47), when the velocity grows near to 0, the particle position is made to reside
    in the current position. During the positive and larger value of velocity, the
    binary bit is set to 1 and when it is negative and smaller value, the bit is set
    to 0 respectively. Hence particles are stored in memory which plays a major role
    in this case. When iteration increases the randomness problem (bits interchanging)
    gets avoided. There is an enhancement in convergence speed while the new position
    gets updated. The local minima are not still determined properly even after the
    modification of new updated position. So this might affect to explore the global
    best solution. Hence mutation operation is suggested to preserve the large no
    of particles. \(Srate_{mut}\) is defined as spectrum mutation rate that decides
    to change with the opposite bit for the corresponding binary value(s), which in
    terms specifies when the binary bit 1 it is changed to 0 and from 0 to 1(vice
    versa). The mutation operation is given in Eq. (48). $$NP_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1}
    \right) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {1 - NP_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1} \right),if\;rand_{{ij}}
    {\text{ < }}Srate_{{mut}} } \hfill \\ {NP_{{ij}} \left( {T + 1} \right),Otherwise}
    \hfill \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (48) To achieve an optimal performance inertia
    weight [47, 48]is utilized in Eq. (49). $$\omega = \omega_{mx} - \left( {\omega_{mx}
    - \omega_{mn} } \right)\frac{T}{{T_{mx} }}$$ (49) \(T_{mx}\) is maximum no of
    iteration. The fitness function is calculated and expressed in Eq. (50) as follows:
    $$Fit\left( {NP_{ij} \left( {T + 1} \right)} \right) = \gamma \frac{{\left| {G_{tran}
    } \right|}}{{\left| {E_{con} } \right|}} + 1 - \gamma \left( {Err} \right)$$ (50)
    Therefore γ denotes weight factors, which contains the value from 0 to 1, Econ
    refers to energy consumption and Gtran refers to transmission gain are represented
    in Eq. (51) and Eq. (52). The error Err  is expressed in Eq. (53). $$E_{con} =
    kEng_{sen} + kEng_{rep} + \left( {1 - prob\left( {H_{0} } \right)prob_{fa,i} -
    prob\left( {H_{1} } \right)prob_{d,i} } \right)Eng_{tran}$$ (51) whereas, k is
    number of secondary user available in the spectrum. For each SU, the sensing energy,
    reporting energy and transmission energy is termed as \(Eng_{sen} = P_{Sen } *
    T_{Sen }\), \(Eng_{rep} = P_{tran } * T_{rep }\) and \(Eng_{tran} = T_{tran} *
    P_{tran }\) respectively. \(T_{tran}\) is transmission time and \(P_{tran }\)
    is power transmission. The transmission gain is calculated to identify the PU
    status of the channel in the spectrum. When no false alarm occurs it refers to
    channel is in idle state else it is in busy state. $$G_{tran} = \log_{2} \left(
    {1 + SNR} \right)T_{tran} prob\left( {H_{0} } \right)\left( {1 - prob_{fa,i} }
    \right)$$ (52) \(SNR\) is signal to noise ratio calculated during the SU transmission.
    $$Err = \frac{{{\text{Number of bits in error }}\left( {\text{at receiver}} \right)}}{{{\text{Total
    number of bits }}\left( {{\text{transmitted}}} \right)}}$$ (53) The optimal solution
    are formulated by the number of swarm particle and number of reports gathered
    from the secondary user which is kept in common receiver are in Eq. (54) $$NP_{ij}
    \left( {T + 1} \right) = CL_{ij} \left( {T + 1} \right) + VL_{ij} \left( {T +
    1} \right)$$ (54) Spectrum Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (SpecBPSO) is a
    swarm based optimization technique where it is enhanced to learn and gain knowledge
    process is presented in Fig. 5. In search space, the starting idea (primary user)
    is mapped to pbest (HN) and ending idea (secondary user) is mapped to gbest (FN).
    The cluster based spectrum sensing allocates the entire idle licensed PU channel
    in a cluster and the swarm intelligence SpecBPSO identifies the optimal channel
    from the cluster. The sensed optimal channel is placed in the queue which is retrieved
    for the SU during the handover process. Fig. 5 Proposed diagram for SpecBPSO Architecture
    Full size image Fig. 6 Flow process of SpecBPSO algorithm Full size image Figure
    6 shows the flow structure of SpecBPSO algorithm implementation. All SU’s are
    grouped in a cluster and each cluster contains cluster head. The cluster head
    works on sensing the free channel of the PU which is active. When cluster gets
    full, another cluster is formed with new cluster head. All the cluster head sends
    the overall report to the FC. The FC checks all the idle channels and the proposed
    algorithm SpecBPSO is used to identify the optimal channel. The identified channels
    are stored in the queue with the queuing algorithm and while the arrival of PU,
    SU handoff is enhanced. Hence the appropriate channel is picked from the queue
    to resumes the incomplete transmission of SU. 3.8.1 Workflow of SpecBPSO channel
    allocation The Boolean variables can be assigned for the allocation of channel
    in the search space (i.e., particle swarm). The SpecBPSO used for allocation are
    in the matrix form with example is represented in Fig. 7. An efficient channel
    allocation of SpecBPSO was proposed using Boolean variable in bitwise operator
    format is in Table1 [49, 50]. Fig. 7 Schematic Representation of SpecBPSO algorithm
    Full size image Table 1 Representation of various operators Full size table $$VL_{ij}
    \left( {T + 1} \right) = W_{1} \wedge \left( {pbest_{ij} \oplus NP_{ij} \left(
    T \right)} \right) \vee W_{2} \wedge (gbest_{j} \oplus NP_{ij} \left( T \right)$$
    (55) $$NP_{ij} \left( {T + 1} \right) = CL_{ij} \left( {T + 1} \right) \oplus
    VL_{ij} \left( {T + 1} \right)$$ (56) From Eq. (55) , \(W_{1} and W_{2}\) are
    two random binary numbers which is uniformly distributed in the range [0, 1] respectively.
    The global best optimal solution is represented  in Eq. (56). 4 Numerical and
    experimental setup The parameters used for present and global best are PB(T) = 0.9
    and GB(T) = 0.4 respectively, Now inertia weight [> 0.5 to < 1.5]are initialized
    as \(w_{mx} = 0.9 and w_{mn} = 0.4\), learning factors[> 1.5 to < 2.5] are \(C_{1}
    ,C_{2}\) is 2.0, size of the population is 100 and iteration (\(T_{mx} )\) is
    500, swarm size = 5, mutation rate = 0.02, dimension d = 2, range of velocity
    [− 6,6].When the iteration reaches to its maximum level, it checks the particles
    with similar velocity or location for the next iteration then it is equivalent
    to 0. It prefers full bandwidth of spectrum usage with least handoff. The numerical
    results have been implemented by using MATLAB 2018a environment that has been
    running 2 GB of RAM for the effectiveness of spectrum sensing and spectrum handoff
    in cognitive radio networks. 4.1 Benchmark functions The performance, evaluation
    and comparison tests are considered for three non-linear benchmark functions [51].
    The details of the functions are formulated in Table 2. Table 2 Optimization test

    algorithm sets the parameter, which plays a vital role in terms of efficiency,
    accuracy and result. These values are allotted for the proposed method to find
    the optimal values. The parameter description and the values for Spec BPSO are
    also provided in the Table 3. Table 3 Parameter setup for SpecBPSO Full size table
    The 20 bits binary values are assigned for the real numbers and n represents the
    dimension space. The hyper-parameter is determined manually for the proposed optimization
    techniques that are detailed in Table 4. Different values set for n are 3, 7 and10
    and it has been compared with the proposed SpecBPSO, SpecPSO, BPSO, and ACO as
    shown in Tables 5, 6 and 7 respectively. After comparison, it has been observed
    that, the results are fairly better than the other optimization techniques. Table

    Table 8 shows the comparison between SpecBPSO, BPSO, SpecPSO, ACO with mutation
    respectively. The mutation operation is implemented in order to reduce the local
    optima so that, the bit changes from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1 respectively. It was analysed
    that mutation operation had a gradual enhancement of performance in the proposed
    work. From the comparison of the result, it can be seen that the SpecBPSO provides
    32.15% better performance and is superior to the other optimization techniques.
    Table 8 Comparison with mutation operation Full size table 4.3 Result and analysis
    The handoff techniques are measured and compared with conventional PSO. The comparisons
    are made using SNR, throughput, ROC and total service time. Figure 8 shows the
    complementary receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of sensing under AWGN with
    SNR = 15 dB. The ROC curve is inferred that the SNR increases with less missed
    detection and hence the probability of detection increases. It is also observed
    that AWGN channel is achieved for lower SNR values. The performance of SNR value
    in SpecBPSO is 50.6% maximized than the existing method of ACO, BPSO, SpecPSO
    which is represented. Figure 9 illustrates the mean function for Rosenbrock with
    n = 3 which provides comparatively better result than ACO, SpecPSO and BPSO. The
    Rosenbrock function is an optimization problem which sounds to be difficult in
    finding the optimal channel. This function does not provide any information regarding
    the local minima. In order to decrease the local minima, few multimodel functions
    such as Griewank, Rastrigrin were implemented. Fig. 8 ROC curve of sensing under
    AWGN for SpecBPSO techniques Full size image Fig. 9 Comparison of SNR with proposed
    and existing method when Rosenbrock n = 3 Full size image For sensing the channel,
    the detection probability and the SNR must be improved. In Fig. 10, the performance
    of the SpecBPSO is significantly better than ACO, SpecPSO and BPSO with Rosenbrock
    with n = 7. From Fig. 11, it is found that SpecBPSO is evidently performs better
    than other existing algorithm such as SpecPSO, ACO and BPSO at n = 10. Fig. 10

    size image Fig. 11 Comparison of SNR with proposed and existing method when Rosenbrock
    n = 10 Full size image The multimodal function Rastrigin at n = 3 shows the increased
    value of SNR with better channel detection. When n = 3, it shows the enriched
    result of SpecBPSO when compared to the other existing optimization techniques
    like ACO, SpecPSO and BPSO in Fig. 12. Fig. 12 Comparison of SNR with proposed
    and existing method when Rastrigin n = 3 Full size image Figure 13 represents
    the better mean value of Rastrigin, when it is compared with ACO, SpecPSO and
    BPSO. It seems that BPSO provides a better result than ACO and SpecPSO at n = 7.
    Hence the proposed optimization algorithm is better than the other exisiting method
    at n = 10 when compared to n = 3 and n = 7 while sensing the channel which is
    shown in Fig. 14. Fig. 13 Comparison of SNR with proposed and existing method
    when Rastrigin n = 7 Full size image Fig. 14 Comparison of SNR with proposed and
    existing method when Rastrigin n = 10 Full size image In Fig. 15, the performance
    of SNR values in Griewark benchmark function is increased to remain higher than
    Rosenbrock and Rastrigin. The compartive result shows the evident result when
    compared to other techniques such as ACO, SpecPSO and BPSO. It has been observed
    that, BPSO is better than the ACO and SpecPSO but less than SpecBPSO. Fig. 15
    Comparison of SNR with the proposed and existing method when Griewark n = 3 Full
    size image The comparative result of the proposed work provides an improved result
    for enhancing the channel identification in the search space, when Griewark at
    n = 7 is represented in Fig. 16. The convergence speed of the proposed algorithm
    is significantly higher than ACO, SpecPSO and BPSO at n = 10, when it is compared
    with n = 7 and n = 3. This improves the channel detection by reducing local minima
    problem shown in Fig. 17. Fig. 16 Comparison of SNR with proposed and existing
    method when Griewark n = 7 Full size image Fig. 17 Comparison of SNR with proposed
    and existing method, when Griewark n = 10 Full size image The process of mutation
    operations represents a change in bit value to provide a less sensing time in
    finding the optimal channel. This represents that the proposed algorithm SpecBPSO
    delivers a better result when compared with ACO, BPSO and SpecPSO is shown in
    Fig. 18. The secondary user transmission takes place smoothly when there is no
    occurrence of licensed user (PU). The handoff delay takes place until a new free
    channel is identified and handed over to the SU for transmission. Also, unnecessary
    handover creates this delay to become increased. In such cases, the arrival rate
    of PU is determined in order to reduce the handoff delay is signified in Fig.
    19. In Figs. 20 and 21 shows the effect of various buffer rate of k = 1, 2, 3,
    and 4 respectively. It is observed that the blocking probability of SU increases
    when the arrival rate of PU increases and when arrival rate is small, the blocking
    of SU resembles small delay. When, k value increases the waiting time of PU and
    IU gets increased in buffer. Therefore, increasing the k value reduces the blocking
    of PU’s and IU’s and more free space is utilized by the SU. Figure 22 shows the
    end to end delay versus capacity of SU. When end to end delay increases then gradually
    the network capacity also gets increased. Due to the frequent arrival of PU, it
    degrades the performance of the SU transmission. When there is a decrease in arrival
    rate of PU’s, then number of SU’s can perform effectively without any end to end
    delay. Fig. 18 Comparison with mutation operation Full size image Fig. 19 Primary

    comparison with secondary user Full size image 5 Conclusion In this work, a best
    channel is selected for the secondary user by using spectrum binary particle swarm
    optimization (SpecBPSO) and queuing model. This proposed technique has presented
    the improved throughput over the allocation of channel for the SU from the queue
    during the handovers. Cluster based CSS with OR rule overcomes the increased response
    time and the reporting error, when the requirement for SU is vast. Thus, the sensed
    channel is effectively used by the interrupted SU during the spectrum handoff.
    This approach is used to identify the free hole from the spectrum, which can be
    effectively utilized for the SU during the occurrence of handoff. So this concept
    mainly focuses on reducing the unnecessary handoff delay and also to increase
    the total service time during the arrival of PU. Discovery of secondary user transmission
    by the proposed algorithm, the optimized results proves up to 92.21% improvement.
    Therefore, the devised simulation technique is robust than the SpecPSO, ACO, BPSO
    and other optimization approaches. Hence, the future research work will be more
    focused on applying some of the metaheuristic algorithm with machine learning
    concepts to construct an efficient transmission of SU in the cognitive radio network.

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction IN COGNITIVE radio networks, several studies
    have been conducted for the analysis of spectrum handoff. In [1] and [2], a preemptive
    resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queuing model is used to evaluate the total service
    time of multiple spectrum handoffs. In [3] and [4], multi-dimensional discrete-time
    Markov chains are used to characterize the spectrum handoff. In these studies,
    the spectrum handoff delay is not considered and it is assumed that the handoff
    is executed immediately when necessary. However, the spectrum handoff delay should
    be included for more realistic modeling. In [5], the effect of fixed spectrum
    handoff delay on spectrum sensing time is studied, but the handoff delay is not
    derived analytically but set arbitrarily. Spectrum sensing could be executed several
    times until handoff success due to sensing errors or the existence of primary
    user (PU) signal. Thus the handoff delay depends on the factors such as spectrum
    sensing time, data transmission time, and the state transition rates of PU signals.
    However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been done regarding this
    point. Fig. 1. Spectrum handoff model. Show All In this letter, the analysis of
    the spectrum handoff delay is given in which spectrum sensing time, data transmission
    time, and PU signal dynamics are included. The channel availability of a secondary
    user (SU) is obtained based on the spectrum handoff delay. For comparison, an
    analysis of no spectrum handoff case is also provided. Numerical results show
    that executing spectrum handoff has higher channel availability than waiting in
    the current channel without handoff. This benefit of spectrum handoff decreases
    as the data transmission time or the state transition rates of PU signals increase.
    SECTION II. System Model Fig. 1 shows the considered spectrum handoff model. A
    frame consists of spectrum sensing time τ and data transmission time T . There
    are K frequency channels. Spectrum sensings on all the channels are executed simultaneously.
    The state that a PU signal exists in a frequency channel is denoted by H 1 and
    the state that no PU signal exists is H 0 . Spectrum sensing decision D 1 means
    that a PU signal is detected and D 0 means that no PU signal is detected. Miss
    detection probability, P md , is P( D 0 | H 1 ) and false alarm probability, P
    fa , is P( D 1 | H 0 ) . If the sensing decision of an SU on a channel is D 1
    , the SU stops using its current channel and performs spectrum sensing on another
    channel. If the decision in the new channel is D 1 , another new channel is tried.
    This procedure is repeated until D 0 is met. When all the channels are searched
    and the sensing decision is still D 1 , the search sequence could be repeated.
    For ease of analysis, it is assumed that PU signal characteristics are equal in
    all the channels. The received signal at an SU at t , y(t) , is represented as
    H 0 :y(t)= H 1 :y(t)= u(t), r(t)+u(t) (1) (2) View Source where it is assumed
    that noise u(t) is a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian, independent and identically
    distributed (iid) random process with zero mean and the received PU signal r(t)
    is modulated by complex PSK and an iid random process with zero mean. When energy
    based spectrum sensing is used, the relation between P md and P fa is obtained
    as P fa =Q( N − − √ γ+ Q −1 (1− P md ) 1+2γ − − − − − √ ) (3) View Source where
    Q(.) is the complementary distribution function of the standard Gaussian, γ is
    the SNR of the PU signal at the SU, N is the number of spectrum sensing samples
    given by N=τ f s where f s is the sampling frequency [6]. PU signals are modeled
    as a two-state Markov chain that consists of H 0 and H 1 states. The transition
    rate from H 0 to H 1 is α and the transition rate from H 1 to H 0 is β . The probability
    that a channel is occupied by a PU signal is given by P( H 1 )=α/(α+β) and the
    probability that there is no PU signal is P( H 0 )=β/(α+β) . The probability of
    two consecutive states of a PU signal in a channel can be derived by Chapman-Kolmogorov
    equation [7]. The probability that no PU signal exists at the n -th and the (
    n +1)-th sensing instants in channel i , P( H [n+1] i,0 | H [n] i,0 ) , is given
    by P( H [n+1] i,0 | H [n] i,0 )= β α+β + α α+β e −(α+β) T ′ (4) View Source where
    T ′ =T+τ . The probability that a PU signal exists at the n -th sensing instant
    and does not exist at the ( n +1)-th sensing instant in channel i , P( H [n+1]
    i,0 | H [n] i,1 ) , is obtained as P( H [n+1] i,0 | H [n] i,1 )= β α+β − β α+β
    e −(α+β) T ′ . (5) View Source Normally τ is much smaller than T . Thus it is
    assumed that the PU signal state does not change during the spectrum sensing.
    SECTION III. Analysis In this section, steady-state analyses of spectrum handoff
    and no spectrum handoff cases are derived. Under the steady-state assumption,
    the expected numbers of successive D 0 and D 1 decisions are derived to obtain
    the spectrum handoff delay which is used in deriving the channel availability
    of an SU. A. Spectrum Handoff Case It is assumed that KT is so large that the
    correlation between consecutive sensings on a channel is negligible and the spectrum
    handoff performance is not affected by number of frequency channels. If the sensing
    decision on the currently used channel i is D 0 , spectrum handoff does not occur
    and channel i is sensed again. Then, the probability that the next sensing decision
    on channel i is D 0 , P( D [n+1] i,0 | D [n] i,0 ) , is P( D [n+1] i,0 | D [n]

    H [n] i,0 ). (14) View Source By Bayes'' theorem, the probability that no PU signal
    exists given the sensing decision of D 0 , P( H [n] i,0 | D [n] i,0 ) , is P(

    P( D [n] i,0 ) can be represented by the previous sensing decisions. Thus by the
    law of total probabilities, we have P( D [n] i,0 )=P( D [n] i,0 | D [n−1] i,0

    occurred. The probability that the sensing decision after the spectrum handoff

    between different channels. In steady-state situations, we have P( D [n] i,0 )=P(
    D [n−1] i,0 ). (18) View Source Since PU signal characteristics are assumed to
    be equal in different channels, steady-state probabilities of different channels
    are equal as follows: P( D [n−1] i,0 )=P( D [n−1] k,0 ),i≠k. (19) View Source

    1−P( D [n] i,0 | D [n−1] i,0 )+P( D [n] i,0 | D [n−1] k,1 ) . (20) View Source
    Similarly, P( H [n] i,0 ) is obtained as P( H [n] i,0 )=P( H [n] i,0 | D [n−1]
    i,0 )P( D [n−1] i,0 ) +P( H [n] i,0 | D [n−1] k,1 )P( D [n−1] k,1 ),i≠k.(21) View
    Source If the sensing decision is D 1 , spectrum handoff occurs. Then, the probability
    that no PU signal exists in the new channel, P( H [n] i,0 | D [n−1] k,1 ) , is

    Results Parameter values in the numerical results were as follows [6]. The required
    value of P md was 0.1. The SNR of PU signals was − 20 dB. The sampling frequency
    f s was 6 MHz. The noise spectral density was − 174 dBm/Hz. The default T was
    500 ms. The default transition rates of PU signals, α and β , were 1 s −1 . A
    simulation program was developed with MATLAB for the system model with K of 10.
    Fig. 2 shows that the probability of the sensing decision of D 0 given the previous
    decision of D 1 . Analytical results show a good match with the simulation results.
    In the handoff case, if a decision is D 1 , another channel is sensed and the
    decision in the new channel is independent of the previous decision of D 1 due
    to the independency between different channels. In the no handoff case, the same
    channel is sensed. Since time correlation exists between sensing decisions on
    the same channel, the probability that the next decision is also D 1 given the
    previous decision of D 1 is larger in the no handoff case. Thus P( D [n] i,0 |
    D [n−1] k,1 ) of the handoff case is larger than P( D [n] i,0 | D [n−1] i,1 )
    of the no handoff case. Figs. 3 –5 show the channel availability ratio R . Generally
    the handoff case shows higher R than the no handoff case. With larger spectrum
    sensing time τ , sensing error decreases and thus R increases. When τ is too large,
    R decreases as in (30). Thus there is a tradeoff relation between τ and R as in
    Fig. 3. The benefit of the spectrum handoff decreases as the data transmission
    time T or the state transition rates of PU signals increase, because time correlation
    bwteen sensings in a channel decreases. Thus R of the no handoff case becomes
    close to the handoff case as in Figs. 4 and 5. Fig. 4. Channel availability ratio

    spectrum usage in wireless networks may reduce energy efficiency, requiring cognitive
    radio networks to be more efficient than conventional ones. Due to increased data
    transmission demand, cognitive radio networks arose from a lack of spectrum bandwidth.
    Spectrum sensing and handoff decision are two cognitive radio network strategies
    that help avoid interference, channel access, and cohabitation between primary
    and secondary users. Current research focuses on handoff decision and cooperative
    spectrum sensing to improve sensing efficiency and system throughput while neglecting
    energy efficiency and handoff latency. Spectrum mobility and sensing are essential
    for energy-efficient cognitive radio networks. This study provides a second priority
    user transmission system using cooperative spectrum sensing to sense available
    channels. An energy detection technique optimizes the sensing process''s energy
    usage, leading to energy efficiency. A primary user traffic pattern-based threshold
    approach is presented for spectrum mobility management. A threshold approach is
    utilized to calculate probabilistic stay-and-wait and QoS handoff values. The
    transmission channel is selected using a hybrid handoff strategy based on dynamic
    spectrum aggregation. Moreover, a cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm is described
    and simulated to identify the optimum channel with the greatest throughput and
    minimum energy consumption. The proposed approach increases energy efficiency
    and throughput while maintaining handoff delay and avoids miss-detection and false
    alarm. This technique improves energy efficiency, sensing performance, throughput,
    and handoff time. miss-detection. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    wireless applications frequently increases requests for higher information rates,
    putting the spectrum''s fixed properties and allocation policies to the test.
    To effectively improve static spectrum usage policies, the advantageous attribute
    of Cognitive Radio (CR) has been established based on the dynamic spectrum. Cognitive
    radio is one of the promising techniques that prominently resolve the spectrum
    scarcity issue by optimizing the spectrum. A cognitive radio observes the spectrum
    and its surroundings while properly utilizing its radio parameters [1]. Cognitive
    radio is formally defined as “a smart system that varies according to the existing
    environment of the spectrum, defines the spectrum hole, and communicates opportunistically
    over the spectrum hole with negligible interference to FPUs” [2]. While utilizing
    the existing Quality of Service (QoS) requirements on the same spectrum where
    the First Priority User (FPU) is working, the licensed user of a primary network
    that has the ownership of a specific radio spectrum is known as the FPU. The Second
    Priority User (SPU) faced several new challenges. A Cognitive Radio User (CRU)
    or SPU has no licensed access to a specific channel, and it rather opportunistically
    accesses the temporally free channel of an FPU in order to perform its communication.
    The communication of an SPU can be interrupted by an FPU. New Spectrum Management
    (SM) challenges such as interference avoidance, QoS demands, and seamless communication
    is critical parameters for Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs). Spectrum sensing,
    spectrum management/decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility/sharing
    entirely depend on the CRN. Spectrum Sensing (SS) and Spectrum Decisions (SD)
    are key enabling functionalities for FPUs based on sensing results due to channel
    utilization and channel vacating decisions. The FPU and SPU in SS are constantly
    monitoring the spectrum, and it also monitors and identifies spectrum openings
    available for SPU communication. The SS is classified into three types: cooperative
    detection, non-cooperative detection, and interference detection [3]. In Cooperative
    Spectrum Sensing (CSS), many SPUs decided to sense the idle channels by sharing
    information about the available channels among all SPUs for better performance
    of the FPUs while also minimizing the probability values [4]. A large number of
    studies have been conducted on CSS in order to improve sensing in the field of
    communication. Although it provided better sensing performance, it consumed more
    energy by increasing sensing time. While using CSS to improve sensing time and
    maximize CRN overall performance, energy efficiency equality is required. This
    paper presents an SPU transmission model in CRN by using the CSS approach. The
    model has three steps: sensing and transmission, mobility management, and handoff
    decision. Spectrum handoff is the licensed spectrum captured by the CRUs or SPUs
    for a short time. Hence, if FPU attempts to use that spectrum, CRU transmission
    must resume in the next empty channel. The CSS is used in the sensing and transmission
    process to improve sensing routines by considering all SPUs'' propagated sensing
    choices. Although the CSS is complex, it produces precise results by improving
    the sensing process. An energy detection technique is used in CSS to optimize
    the energy consumption in the sensing process, resulting in energy efficiency.
    SPUs continuously monitor their surroundings and detect available channels via
    an energy detection scheme. Spectrum mobility management is used for handoff decisions
    and managing SPU transmission on available channels based on FPU arrival patterns
    and transmission requirements. It aids in achieving coordination and avoiding
    collisions on the selected channels. Spectrum sharing eliminates interference
    between FPUs and SPUs by allocating channels and energy. To select the appropriate
    channel for transmission, a hybrid handoff approach based on Dynamic Spectrum
    Aggregation (DSA) is used. The use of spectrum and FPU interference is determined
    by the miss-detection and false alarm probability values. The primary goal of
    these functions is to reduce false alarms and miss-detection. An algorithm is
    also proposed that uses components from each step of the model. The model is implemented
    in Java as a proof of concept by following the steps described in the algorithm
    and using the synthetic dataset. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    The related work is presented in section 2. Section 3 designates the SPU transmission
    model, which begins with an architectural view of the CRN. The framework is then
    described in detail, followed by a model overview. The framework is divided into
    three parts: sensing and transmission, mobility management, and handoff decision.
    An algorithm is comprehensively described at the end of this section. Section
    4 discusses experiments and their outcomes. Finally, section 5 contains the conclusion
    and future work. 2. Literature review Generally, three methods are commonly used
    for primary transmitter detection: Energy Detection Method (ED), Cyclostationary
    Detection Method (CD), and Matched Filter Detection Method (MFD) [3], [5]. Due
    to multipath fading, shadowing, and noise uncertainty, the execution of SS is
    limited because these are the basic attributes of wireless channels. In experiences
    of fading by obstacles, the power of FPUs signal received at SPUs will be profound
    and too weak to identify. The core purpose of cooperative sensing is to upgrade
    the sensing performance by combining the sensing results of all SPUs. Furthermore,
    to decide based on these results is more precise than the single user decision.
    Non-cooperative methods are based on detecting signals transmitted from the main
    system. The non-cooperative techniques are often based on the hypothesis that
    the primary transmission area is known to the sensory devices. Therefore, the
    SPU should rely solely on detecting weak primary transmission signals and use
    only local detections to perform SS. The sensing device does not have complete
    spectrum retention information in its coverage area. As a result, it is impossible
    to avoid detrimental interference with the FPU altogether. Three methods are commonly
    used for primary transmitter detection: According to the authors in [6], [7],
    CSS has presented a precise solution for improving sensing achievements. Cognitive
    radio spectrum assignment is categorized into two schemes: centralized and distributed.
    In a centralized scheme, the spectrum is sensed by a sensing controller (Base
    station), and the result is shared with all other neighbor nodes. In distributed,
    the SPUs sense the spectrum and avail the spectrum opportunity, SPUs can take
    the decision either (non-cooperative sensing) or on the bases of other SPUs sensing
    (distributed sensing). In several kinds of research [8], [9], [10], [11], centralized
    spectrum assignment is measured and has attained the following: (i) the sensing
    controller can view the spectrum globally, (ii) the throughput of the network
    is increased, and (iii) the interference of the SPU’s is minimized to maximum
    level. In addition, the spectrum server can be utilized for fairness on the accessible
    spectrum and control the throughput among the greedy users who mostly occupy the
    whole spectrum band for performing their throughput and creating problems for
    other users. Hence the centralized spectrum assignment performs better for accessing
    throughput and fairness. Centralized spectrum assignment controls the interference
    of SPUs by conflict graphs. The sensing controller can sense the spectrum globally.
    Therefore, it is a crucial point for maintenance. It also supports assigning spectrum
    to SPU and sharing information about the spectrum throughput. A considerable challenge
    in the centralized spectrum assignment is how a sensing controller can share information
    with other SPUs. Moreover, if the sensing controller falls flat because of power
    or accidental failures, the network assignment is impossible. In the distributive
    spectrum assignment, the central controller cannot exchange information with all
    other SPUs in the network [12], [13], [14], [15]. In the distributive scheme,
    SPUs can select a target channel for communication and decide by coordinating
    with their neighbors based on the neighbor’s sensing results. In the distributive
    spectrum, each SPU calculates metrics and shares information with neighbors, computes
    the traffic load of nearest spectrums, and chooses a spectrum with minimum traffic
    load and minimum interference with FPUs. The centralized scheme is considered
    slower than the distributive because when the centralized scheme shares information,
    the changes need to be done on all nodes, and hence the traffic load will be increased.
    Using the distributive scheme, the decision is taken based on local nodes; thus,
    the decision is faster. However, the drawback in the distributive scheme is that
    the nodes have information of their neighbor SPUs only and not the entire network.
    Moreover, any inaccurate information can influence the results in a distributive
    scheme. For an energy detector, the sensing time affects the detector''s performance
    in terms of false alarms and undetected detection. In research [16], [17], [18],
    the sensing period affects the detector''s ability to detect and process spectrum
    possibilities with time. However, energy availability is limited. Many investigators
    have studied the functionality of CSS when reporting channels (channels from SPUs
    to Fusion Center (FC)) are an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) [19], [20],
    [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. A framework is discussed in [26] that allows combining
    the relationship between CSS and handoff techniques to improve energy efficiency
    in CRN. In CSS, when there is a weaker signal, SPU’s control effect of shadowing
    and discover spectrum access chances in removing miss-detection and false alarm
    probabilities. Sensing increasing will result in higher energy consumption; therefore,
    there is an optimal spectrum space to maximize user throughput and energy efficiency.
    In [27], [28], the energy efficiency at the physical and network layer of the
    OSI model is theoretically discussed. SPU requires massive energy utilization
    contrasted with traditional devices and for increasing complexity and modern functionalities.
    It gives a theoretical concept of how to regulate the energy consumption and also
    of energy management in CRNs. Due to the various SPU locations and channel conditions,
    the [29] indicates that interaction of all SPUs in the SS is incorrect, and complete
    detection of false alarms is only available in collaboration with a group of users
    with high SNR of the main signal detector. Numerous studies have shown that CSS
    can significantly increase the chances of being found in dying channels [5]. In
    [30], the FC scheme is used where tricky (Single bit) and soft (multiple bits)
    decisions are used for sharing information. For the final decision, FC follows
    the K-out-of-N rule in hard decisions. In the soft decision, an optimal fusion
    rule is applied, which combines all information sent by SPUs in the presence of
    reporting channel error in a given quantization scheme. Soft decision-based CSS
    performance is considered more robust than the hard decision in terms of energy
    consumption, and it needs wider bandwidth for channel control, but there is no
    resulting energy efficiency. Authors in [31], SPUs sensing at the initial stage
    is called coarse sensing and the sensing time is conceivable to deal with diminishing
    the energy consumption. The two-stage sensing is performed for the time saving
    with the one-bit decision (hard decision). Despite this fact, the two-stage sensing
    technique effectively mitigates the sensing time. It causes additional energy
    utilization in the reporting stage and is repetitive twice. Additionally, the
    impact of holding up with the first result on the reachable throughput is not
    examined, which might degrade the energy efficiency. In [32], [33], the model
    is presented for low complexity sensing and handoff with efficient energy usage
    but cannot check the effect of CSS on energy and throughput. SPUs are partitioned
    into two groups for decisions, and both groups'' sensing results are sent to FC
    for the final decision. By enhancing the SPUs in each group and the threshold
    of FC, the energy is maximized. The maximization problem is solved by using a
    particle swarm optimization algorithm. In light of results assembled from two
    unique stages, this might debase the dependability of the final decision. In [34],
    the author described rapid and high performance based on SPU power harvest, sensitivity,
    and reporting qualities. In [35], [36], two energy-saving schemes have been presented
    to reduce energy consumption. In a reduced power sensor and reporting system,
    power consumption is minimized by decreasing the sensing station and reducing
    the reporting stations in the FC. Authors described in [37], [38] that the MFD
    is an appropriate detection method. Mid-range wavelengths [39] are extracted from
    ED and can be used as reference elements for the separation and determination
    of FPU. By using MFD detection, SPU needs to be fully aligned with FPU. According
    to [40], [32], the MFD can associate a pre-identified key signal with a signal
    obtained to detect FPU presence. The benefits of MFD are that it requires a few
    available signal samples for the short term and requires to achieve acceptable
    detection function [21], [41]. The SS method based on the high selectivity of
    cyclic autocorrelation is suggested in [42], [43], [44], where the maximum and
    minimum value of cyclic autocorrelation activity is compared to determine whether
    a primary signal exists or not. Furthermore, the corresponding acquisition exceeds
    the ED in the sensitivity of the junction. The sensitivity of the ED increases
    in sequence with the reduction of the SNR, whereas the corresponding detection
    increases only in proportion. However, details regarding waveform patterns are
    a requirement for making consistent acquisitions. According to [45], [34], the
    CD is one of the most effective SS methods, which uses the cyclostationary feature
    to detect signals after a dry sound or in low SNR states. The cyclostationary
    feature detector uses the time signal strength as test statistics. It transitions
    from the time zone to the frequency factor domain, followed by performing a hypothesis
    test on a new domain. The detection of a cyclostationary element was first introduced
    in [46]. The cyclostationary feature identifier uses these randomly randomized
    statistical signals and is detected by reference to the mean and automatic signal
    detection. If the mean and autocorrelation vary from time to time, then the received
    signal is associated with the FPU; otherwise, it is noise, timeless. As a result,
    cyclostationary factor detectors may be adequate in very low SNR areas. Operating
    time estimates are considered in [47], [48] to improve the durability of the detector.
    Typical feature detection refers to the acquisition and segmentation process that
    excludes data included without cyclostationarity. All SPUs perform local spectrum
    measurements independently, use detection algorithms, and make binary decisions.
    Since energy detection is a facile and straightforward method, as discussed in
    the above literature, many studies, i.e. [49], [50], [51], have used this method
    to test local SS performance. When applied to the local SS, each SPU transmits
    the received power signal or decision results to the destination node. The reported
    research effort primarily focused on the cooperative spectrum sensing and the
    handoff decision by improving the sensing efficiency and maximizing the system
    throughput but ignores the effects of energy efficiency and handoff delay. To
    make cognitive radio networks an energy-efficient system, spectrum mobility and
    sensing are deliberated as main factors. The equality in energy efficiency is
    mandatory while using CSS to improve sensing time and maximize the overall performance
    of CRNs. In this research, an energy detection approach is used in the CSS to
    optimize energy consumption in the sensing process, leading to energy efficiency.
    Table 1 compares and contrasts the SS techniques. Handoff delay, energy efficiency,
    and throughput compare the strategies. CSS is a technique that has the advantage
    of lowering thresholds, sensitivities, and requirements while having the disadvantage
    of increasing data overhead. When the handoff delay is at its shortest, the energy
    efficiency and throughput suffer. Because energy detection is simple to implement,
    the handoff delay, energy efficiency, and throughput are average, requiring a
    long sensing time. Because the matched filter detection technique requires less
    dedication time and is more effective at detecting noise, the handoff delay can
    be minimized when the energy efficiency is lowest. Cyclization feature detection
    techniques with height computational and sensing time result in average handoff
    delay, throughput, and minimum energy efficiency. The proposed sensing technique,
    ‘Energy Efficient Spectrum Sensing Technique,’ is more efficient than existing
    handoff techniques because it improves energy efficiency and throughput and minimizes
    handoff delay. Table 1. Comparison of Some of the Existing Spectrum Sensing Techniques

    second priority user transmission model According to existing research, CSS yields
    better results for detecting FPUs in the CRN to remove interference. CSS consumes
    more energy while detecting FPUs in order to improve sensing time while also increasing
    system overhead. The researchers focused primarily on increasing spectrum throughput
    and improving sensing performance, but they ignored energy consumption and optimization
    in wireless communication [52], [53]. Energy efficiency equality is considered
    important when using CSS to improve sensing time and maximize CRN overall performance.
    Energy crises and environmental standards motivate wireless communication researchers
    to support energy efficiency [25]. This study anticipated an SPU transmission
    framework by incorporating the CSS technique to sense available channels in the
    spectrum. In the CSS, an energy detection technique is used to optimize the energy
    consumption in the sensing process, resulting in energy efficiency. In addition,
    an arrival pattern-based spectrum technique is presented for the handoff decision.
    To select the appropriate channel for SPU transmission, a hybrid handoff approach
    based on Dynamic Spectrum Aggregation (DSA) is also proposed. After describing
    the generalized CRN architecture and an overview of the proposed model, this section
    divides the framework into two sub-sections: model framework and algorithm framework
    (as the solution). Firstly, the framework is described by breaking down the CRN
    process into different steps. Secondly, as a solution domain, an algorithm for
    the components (energy detection, spectrum mobility, and hybrid handoff decision)
    is designated and described in the algorithm section. 3.1. Architecture of the
    cognitive radio network A network with opportunistic access to a specific channel
    implemented as an infrastructure network is known as CRN. The main objectives
    of improving the entire network utilization in the CRN architecture are spectrum
    consumption and energy efficiency. The users can satisfy their needs anytime and
    anywhere using CRNs. The Service Providers (SP) can deliver better services to
    (mobile) users. The SPs allocate the CRN resources efficiently to transport additional
    packets per unit bandwidth. Additionally, an SPU in CRN can sense vacant channels
    and other communication resources. A CRN comprises several users, communication
    resources, and networks and can perform as a heterogeneous system. The heterogeneity
    occurs in the following tools: wireless communication resources, networks, base
    stations, applications, and SPs. The universal architecture of the CRN is shown
    in Fig. 1 to understand the process and the components of CRN are described. Download

    System Model of the Generalized Cognitive Radio Network. 3.1.1. First priority
    network A network with special rights or ownership of a specific channel is known
    as a First Priority Network (FPN). Following are some of the examples of the FPN:
    CDMA, WiMAX, ISM, TV broadcast, and standard cellular networks. The licensed user
    of a primary network that owns a specific radio spectrum is known as FPU. The
    FPU has a primitive right, and its communication should not be interfered with
    by the communication of SPUs. FPN operates in dedicated frequency channels and
    works either in licensed or unlicensed channels. In FPN, the licensed channels
    have the highest priorities in utilizing the frequency bands by the FPUs. While
    using the licensed channel by an FPU, other users (FPU or SPU) are not allowed
    to interfere and occupy that specific channel. In FPN, the unlicensed band compatibly
    is utilized by FPUs and operates in the same frequency band by coexistence and
    considering interference to each other. 3.1.2. Second priority network A network
    with opportunistic access to a specific channel is the Second Priority Network
    (SPN). Ad-hoc networks are examples of the SPN. An SPN neither has a fixed operational
    frequency channel nor has rights to access that channel when utilized by the FPU.
    The Objects residing in this network interact dynamically by using the spectrum
    holes. An SPU has no licensed access to a dedicated channel, and it rather opportunistically
    accesses the temporarily free channel of an FPU in order to perform its communication.
    The communication currently performed by SPU can be interrupted by an FPU. 3.1.3.
    Base stations The base stations of the FPN and SPN are fixed components and have
    the capabilities of the cognitive radios. The base stations represent the groundwork
    side of the system and deliver the following services: i.e., mobility management,
    management of vacant channels, and base station security management. It provides
    a gateway to access the Internet and form a wireless network by enabling wireless
    communications between users. In the SPN, some of the base stations may act as
    repeaters when those are connected to each other. 3.2. Overview of the proposed
    model An SPU transmission model is proposed for sensing, mobility management,
    and handoff decision in CRN. The energy detection-based CSS approach is used for
    sensing the available vacant channels, and the spectrum mobility management is
    used for the handoff decision. A hybrid handoff approach based on DSA is proposed
    to select the appropriate channel for transmission. The proposed model has the
    following features: 1. The CRN is supposed to be a recurring and time-dividing
    system where every SPU prioritizes sensing and transmission. 2. The actual transmission
    of the SPU is performed when the target channel (dedicated to the FPU) is sensed
    as vacant and hired by the SPU. 3. The spectrum sensing is performed by CSS, which
    uses an energy detection technique to optimize the energy consumption, leading
    to energy efficiency. 4. The SPU continues its transmission on the vacant channel
    (dedicated to the FPU) until it is interrupted by the FPU and communication requirements
    are satisfied. 5. When the FPU resumes its transmission on its dedicated channel
    or the transmission requirements are not fulfilled, the SPU calls the mobility
    management function to decide whether to perform handoff or not. 6. The FPU arrival
    pattern-based approach is used to either wait for the current channel or perform
    a handoff decision process to hire the new available channel from the list of
    vacant channels. 7. A DSA-based hybrid handoff approach is used in the handoff
    decision process to perform sensing on the list of available channels. 8. The
    SPU selects any vacant channel for transmission from the list of vacant channels
    agreeing to the uniform distribution by DSA. 3.3. Framework or energy efficient
    framework based on cooperative spectrum sensing Fig. 2 demonstrates the proposed
    SPU framework for transmission. The planned design is divided into the following
    general steps: (i) sensing and transmission, (ii) mobility management, and (iii)
    handoff decision; and also described in detail in the following subsections. Download

    Proposed Cooperative Spectrum Sensing based Transmission Framework for the Second
    Priority User. 3.3.1. Sensing and transmission This step is divided into two processes:
    sensing and transmission. The SPU continuously senses for the vacant channels
    to perform transmission in the sensing process. The spectrum sensing process can
    be performed by using one of the currently available sensing techniques, i.e.,
    Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) [17], [13], Matched Filter Detection (MFD)
    [38], or Cyclo-Stationary Feature Detection (CFD). In this research, we have incorporated
    the Energy Detection Technique (EDT) [51], [27], [32] based CSS approach for sensing.
    The energy detection technique is used in spectrum sensing for its difficult nature
    and its lower computational properties [26], [24], [49]. The SPU performs the
    actual transmission on the currently occupied vacant channel in the transmission
    process. The occupied channel is dedicated to FPU and released when it becomes
    vacant. During transmission on the occupied channel, the movement of the FPU (owner
    of the channel) is continuously monitored by the SPU. When FPU interrupts transmission
    by occupying its dedicated channel again, the SPU, through mobility management,
    decides to either wait for the current channel or perform handoff to occupy the
    new vacant channel. Therefore, the SPU continues its transmission on the newly
    occupied channel. In the proposed model, the EDT-based CSS approach plays a vital
    role in sensing and transmission and CSS is described in detail as below. 3.3.1.1.
    Cooperative spectrum sensing CSS scheme is reliable in spectrum sensing and helpful
    in sensing vacant channels, monitoring the FPUs, sharing data (sensing choices)
    among all SPUs, and removing the intrusion, shadowing, and hidden problems. CSS
    is used in the sensing and transmission process to improve the sensing routines
    by the propagated sensing choices of all SPUs. The coordinated (agreed upon) decision
    is designated based on propagated sensing choices and is considered more precise
    than the single user decision. The local sensing information is transmitted to
    the base station (BS), known as a data Fusion Center (FC). The base station decides
    based on the data sent by the SPUs. Initially, SPU starts transmission on the
    occupied channel, and during transmission, it also monitors the FPU activities.
    When the FPU takes control of the occupied channel by SPU, the new target (vacant)
    channel is selected to continue transmission when the threshold value is not satisfactory
    for staying at the current channel. Furthermore, CSS is considered a challenging
    task; however, it gives precise results by improving the sensing process. SPUs
    (shown in Fig. 3) continuously monitors the environment and sense the available
    channels using an energy detection scheme. The energy detection scheme is described
    in detail below. Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download

    detection The energy detection technique is considered superior to other techniques,
    i.e., MFD and CFD. In the EDT approach, the energy is computed based on the signal
    established on a static bandwidth and time period. The energy signal is detected
    by associating the specified (detected) value with the threshold value set for
    the energy detector. A constant value can be considered; however, it depends on
    the FPU arrival pattern, and the value can be calculated dynamically. The apparent
    energy point is improved with the FPU arrival on its dedicated channel. As the
    value is calculated, the apparent energy point is verified several times, either
    during the existence or absence of FPU. When the energy level value calculated
    from the arrived pattern signal increases than the threshold value, the handoff
    process is executed to start the spectrum handoff. There are two types of energy
    detectors (shown in Fig. 4): analog and digital. The analog energy detector contains
    a noise pre-filter and a temporary connector (integrator). The noise pre-filter
    is compatible with a square device . The previous filter is used to control the
    noise and noise variations. The signal strength (test statistics) is received
    equal to the output generated by the integrator. The character (with the dashed
    line with a grey color) represents the analog energy detector flow. Secondly,
    the Digital energy detector is based on a low pass pre-filter and neighboring
    bandwidth signals. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) converts continuous analog
    signals into discrete digital signals. A square device is compiled by the compiler
    at the end. The character (with an arrow line in blue color) is used in to show
    the flow of the digital energy detector. For processes of energy detection (analog
    and digital detectors) are shown here. Download : Download high-res image (63KB)

    b. Digital. A threshold optimization of energy activity is described in the sub-section
    below. 3.3.1.3. Threshold optimization of energy activity Spectrum and FPU interference
    depend on the probability values of miss-miss-detection (MD) and False Alarm (FA).
    Both probability values are contingent on the sensing time and detection threshold.
    The term FA is used when SPU detects an FPU; similarly, the term MD is used when
    the SPU mistakenly detects an FPU. The primary purpose of the threshold optimization
    (of the energy activity) is to reduce the probabilistic values of the MD and FA
    situations. If an error occurs in the FA, the following strategy is used to detect
    and may reduce the possibilities of its occurrence. Let denotes the idle channel
    and denotes the busy channel. Equation (1) is used to calculate the probabilistic
    values for . (1) In Equation (3), we assume that is the mth sample of the ith
    SPU active energy detector, I={1,2,3,…,n} are the SPUs belonging to the set I
    where is the active SPU and is the noise of the active SPU. The sample-set S is
    denoted as S={1,2,3,…,n} where the active sample is denoted as m. The is calculated
    by Equation (2) below. (2) where is the channel fading coefficient used to represent
    the amplitude gain of the channel and is the primary signal. The probabilistic
    value for the error detection is calculated by Equation (3). The and are the probabilistic
    values for the idleness and business channels, respectively. Suppose the calculated
    probabilistic value for the false alarm is and for the miss-detection is . (3)
    A mechanism is required to reduce the chances of error occurrence. To do so, here
    we assume that , and an effective value is obtained by where represents the decision-making
    threshold value by assessing the following parameters: (i) probability ratio,
    (ii) the size of the conditional probability, (iii) the signal strength performance
    obtained by the hypothesis . The probabilistic value to reduce/detect error is
    calculated by Equation (4). (4) 3.3.2. Mobility management Spectrum management
    manages the SPU transmission on available channels based on FPU arrival patterns.
    It helps achieve coordination access and prevent a collision on the selected channel.
    Different SPUs can try to access spectrum for communication at a time, and overlapping
    may occur. Spectrum sharing removes interference among FPUs and SPUs by using
    the channel and power allocation. The spectrum mobility function is executed in
    the following cases: (1) when the FPUs are interrupted (reclaim the licensed spectrum)
    during the SPU transmission on the licensed channel and (2) when the QoS is not
    up to the mark as required by the SPU on the current channel. When FPU reclaims
    its dedicated channel for a shorter period of time, the SPU can stay and wait
    for the same channel to resume its transmission, and the threshold value is calculated
    based on the arrival pattern. The SPU doesn''t make the handoff decision if the
    FPU uses its dedicated channel for a shorter time period. The stay and wait of
    the SPU at the current channel depend on its transmission requirements and the
    time period. In other cases, the SPU leaves the explicit spectrum for the FPU
    and selects a new vacant channel for transmission from the list of vacant channels.
    This feature can be achieved by detecting multiple probabilistic values, i.e.,
    energy, QoS, and compared with a constant threshold value (assigned explicitly).
    The threshold value is extracted to compare the constant values associated with
    the energy, QoS, and waiting time values. 3.3.2.1. Threshold optimization A primary
    user traffic pattern-based threshold scheme is designed to perform mobility management.
    In mobility management, the SPU transmission is managed by considering the QoS,
    stay and wait, and the communication requirements. The SPU monitored QoS regularly
    during transmission on the current channel; a handoff will be performed when it
    is not satisfactory. The SPU performs handoff based on QoS only rather than FPU
    interruption. By considering the FPU traffic pattern, the scheme calculates the
    QoS threshold calculated based on current channel performance. The threshold value
    of QoS is graded as when the value is higher; the performance is considered satisfactory.
    When the calculated threshold value is below the required threshold, the handoff
    will be performed. In the stay and wait case, the presented scheme will either
    stay on the current channel or perform a handoff. It can be achieved by considering
    the waiting time calculated based on the FPU traffic pattern. The handoff will
    be performed when the waiting time is higher than the threshold value. The transmission
    requirement case is considered for the real-time application transmissions where
    the waiting at the current channel is not bearable. Therefore, as FPU interrupts
    its dedicated channel, the SPU will perform handoff without calling the stay and
    wait for function. 3.3.3. Handoff decision When FPUs or the QoS reclaim the selected
    licensed channel is not better at the currently occupied channel, in both situations,
    based on the mobility management process, the SPUs can vacate the current channel.
    The selection process for a new channel is known as spectrum handoff. The handoff
    is performed using the approach described in the [54]. The described approach
    is based on the hybrid spectrum handoff technique; both proactive and reactive
    handoff schemes are shared by taking the selection part of proactive while the
    spectrum handoff decision of reactive. SPUs sense the channel before communication,
    and spectrum handoff is performed after the event''s occurrence. The advantage
    of the hybrid handoff scheme is that during spectrum handoff, the channel sensing
    is not completed and may cause performance improvement [55], [56]. The spectrum
    handoff decision chooses a suitable handoff class between reactive and proactive
    with respect to the lowest overall service time of the SPU. The overall service
    time is based on the following times: sensing time, processing time, waiting time,
    and transmission time. The overall minimal service time is implemented for the
    spectrum handoff decision. Subsequently, the SPU can maintain its transmission
    on the recently selected channel. In the hybrid handoff approach based on dynamic
    spectrum aggregation, a threshold value is selected for the FPUs arrival pattern.
    The SPUs select a backup channel for communication using the proactive part when
    FPUs'' traffic pattern value is below the threshold, but when the arrival pattern
    value of FPUs crosses the threshold value, the reactive handoff will be used.
    The hybrid handoff approach is considered better while providing low-cost services
    and delays when streaming the live media channels on the network applications.
    3.4. Proposed algorithm of energy-efficient model The pseudocode for the SPU transmission
    process is shown by Algorithm 1. The algorithm starts by taking the list of channels
    and the list of FPUs with their arrivals patterns as input. The main driving function
    calls two sub-functions named as transmissionAndSensing() and mobilityManagement()
    for transmission and sensing, and mobility management processes. The SPU transmission
    starts when a connection is established. In step 1, the setTransmitting() function
    is set either as true or false to set for transmission. In step 2, a variable
    currentChannel is used to store the currently occupied channel by the SPU. The
    list of vacant channels is stored in the list vacantChannelList[ ] and initialized
    by the null value in step 3. In step 4, the firstVacantChannel() function selects
    the first vacant channel from the list of channels. In step 5, the while() loop
    is used to manage the transmission intervals and check by isTransmitting() function.
    The functions transmissionAndSensing() and mobilityManagement()are called in step
    6 and step 7, respectively, to perform the transmission and sensing, and the mobility
    management processes. Finally, in step 8, the while loop is closed. The transmissionAndSensing()
    function performs the actual transmission and sensing dedicated to the specific
    intervals. This function takes channelsList[ ] and currentChannel as input and
    returns list of at most four vacant channels as output. Through this function
    the transmission of specific interval is also performed. The transmission and
    sensing process interval are divided into two time slots. The first time slot
    is used for transmission only while the second time slot is used for the sensing.
    The transmissionAndSensing() function starts by checking the time slot in step
    1, if isTimeSlot1() is true then call the transmission() function for the actual
    transmission and returns the currentChannel (the occupied channel for transmission)
    in step 2. As the transmission ends, the step 4 is used to check for timeSlot2
    by isTimeSlot2() and performSensing() function is called to perform the sensing
    process in the step 5. The performSensing() function returns the list of at most
    four vacant channels. The Sensing() function is used for sensing the vacant channels
    during transmission. The 3 or 4 vacant channels are added to the vacantChannelList[
    ] as backup channels. This function takes channelsList[ ] as input and returns
    3 or 4 vacant channels in a list. The while() loop in step 1 used to check for
    the vacant channel using isDetectedVacantChannel() function. When the vacant channel
    is detected by using the vacantChannel(channelsList[ ]) function in the step 2
    and assign channel to the vacantChannel variable. In step 3, a condition is used
    to detect the energy level for the vacantChannel and compare it with the energyLevelThreshold
    and monitor the vacantChannelList[ ] for its size. If both the conditions are
    satisfied, then in step 4, the detected vacantChannel is added to the vacantChannelList[
    ]. In the step 6, the while() is ended. The mobilityManagement() function returns
    the current channel (occupied by the SPU for transmission) through the mobility
    management process when a handoff is performed. It takes a list of vacant channels
    and current channels as inputs. Step 1 checks the FPU interruption in the SPU
    transmission while occupying its channel. In step 2, the SPU will check for the
    waiting time at the current channel of the FPU through the waitingTime () function.
    The required service for the real-time application is also checked in the same
    step 2 using the isRealTimeApplicationService() function. If any of the conditions
    is true, then a handoff is performed in step 3 using the performHandoff() function,
    which returns the currentChannel. Else in step 6, the stayAndWait() is applied
    to wait for the shorter intervals and restart transmission of the same current
    channel after some intervals. Else If the current channel is not interrupted by
    the FPU, SPU will check the energy level on the current channel using energyLevel()
    function in step 9. When the energy level of the current level is not as required,
    a handoff is performed using performHandoff() at step 10. Else If the energy level
    is satisfactory, then the QoS of the current channel is detected by the function
    QoSLevel() and compared with the QoSThreshold in step 12. If the QoS of the current
    channel is not as required, then a handoff is performed by the performHandoff()
    in step 13. Algorithm 1 Input: List of channels, List of FPUs with their arrival

    Experimental results As a proof of concept, the SPU transmission model is translated
    into a tool. The model is implemented using the Java programming language and
    is based on the algorithm described in Section 3.4. The synthetic data is used
    to validate the algorithm and test various important parameters during the transmission
    process. The model was executed several times (usually around 1000 times), and
    standard values were used to plot graphs differently. SPU''s total service time
    includes waiting, a channel operating, transfer data, and Sensing time. Channel
    operating time should be 0.05 msec. We assume the packet length of SPUs and FPUs
    was 10 bytes for experiments, and Poisson processes followed arrival rates for
    FPUs and SPUs. For simplicity, the SPU arrival value was approximately 0.1 compared
    to the parameters in different values, i.e., 0.02 to 0.08 FPU concentration levels.
    Different features helped us understand SPU performance in the proposed scheme
    at various FPU integration levels. In addition, the standard service time of FPU
    and SPU was taken as 0.4 and 0.5, respectively, and FPU alignment was considered
    superior to SPU. Therefore, CRU''s total service time depends on the arrival level
    of the FPUs, and the different arrival levels of the FPU may be active throughout
    the service. The proposed hybrid handoff scheme moves strategically between effective
    and efficient strategies for completing energy use and performance time. To attain
    this goal, we need to find a certain SPU arrival level to move between proactive
    and reactive handoff schemes. The FPU arrival rate on the x-axis and service time
    on the y-axis for hybrid, proactive and reactive handoff schemes is shown in Fig.
    5. The blue-colored line shows the proactive handoff, the green-colored curve
    is used for the reactive handoff, and the red-colored line is used for the hybrid
    schemes. The threshold value is where both (reactive and proactive) handoff lines
    intersect (in Fig. 5, the threshold value is 0.05). When the FPU arrival rate
    is below the threshold value (i.e., 0.05), the total service time for reactive
    handoff is recorded as higher than the proactive handoff. Download : Download
    high-res image (84KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The Recommended
    Hybrid Handoff. If the FPU arrival rate is greater than the threshold value, the
    total service time for the proactive handoff is recorded as higher than the reactive
    handoff. But in the hybrid handoff, which uses both the reactive and proactive
    handoff schemes, the SPU will perform the actual handoff when the FPU avails its
    channel back; hence the total service time is recorded lower in either scheme.
    Therefore, the threshold to move between reactive or proactive handoff strategies
    in the recommended (hybrid) approach is 0.05. In terms of total service time,
    our recommended strategy is correlated with the other two proactive and reactive
    handoff techniques, also shown in Fig. 5. As the arrival rate crosses the threshold
    point, the hybrid handoff mode moves to the reactive handoff scheme that empowers
    it to attain superior performance over the proactive handoff scheme. The hybrid
    spectrum handoff strategy permits SPUs to move from a proactive to reactive approach
    when the arrival rate of FPU is lower than the threshold point. Hence the recommended
    hybrid spectrum handoff strategy uses the benefits of both proactive and reactive
    handoff schemes at whatever point required. The probabilistic values of false
    alarm and miss-detection are primary metrics for sensing channels and mainly affect
    the FPUs. On the one hand, when the sensing detection is weaker at a particular
    channel during the FPU access, higher miss-detection is inferred, and the SPUs
    fail to vacate the channel. As a result, stringent conditions are forced to estimate
    probabilistic value for the miss-detection. On the other hand, when the probabilistic
    value for the false alarm increases in sensing, the occupation of white spaces
    will definitely decrease. Therefore, the adjustment of probabilistic values between
    a false alarm and miss-detection is essential to observe. The failure rate for
    different numbers of SPUs by considering a false alarm and the miss-detection
    compared to the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is shown in Fig. 6 (for false alarm)
    and Fig. 7 (for miss-detection), respectively. The increased sensitivity will
    obviously increase energy consumption and result in better performance associated
    with energy efficiency. Therefore, it causes to reduce the false alarm chances
    and does not miss out on the hearing time for FPU to get back its channel. By
    considering both the factors, (i) the increase of SNR and (ii) the number of SPUs,
    it may potentially reduce the false alarm and lose access failure chances. The
    foremost reason for the assumed operating system is that the SPUs collaborate
    to create spectrum sensations. Download : Download high-res image (94KB) Download

    of False Alarm. The proposed method allows obtaining better enhancements during
    the coordination process between the miss-detection (for the acquisition of FPUs)
    and false alarm. Fig. 8 shows a comparison in the form of a hybrid handoff of
    the failure chances caused by the false alarm and miss-detection. The x-axis represents
    the probabilistic values for the false alarm, and the y-axis shows the probabilistic
    values for the miss-detection. It is apparent from both Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 that
    with the increased number of SPUs, the chances of a false alarm and miss (undetectable)
    detection are reduced sufficiently. It can be analyzed from Fig. 8 that using
    a different number of SPUs, i.e., 2, 5, and 10, and an increase in the number
    of SPUs has a similar decreasing effect on chances of failure due to the miss-detection
    and false alarms. Download : Download high-res image (96KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Probability of Miss-Detection and False Alarm using Proposed
    Approach. In this paper, the goal of using CSS and hybrid handoff approaches is
    to accomplish high accuracy during the FPU detection process while decreasing
    the energy consumption and improving the throughput. To achieve high accuracy
    during detection, both the throughput and energy consumption are associated with
    sensing. The effect of the FPUs arrival rate with respect to the overall accomplished
    throughput is shown in Fig. 9. Besides the throughput of users (FPUs and SPUs),
    the overall throughput is also shown in Fig. 10. It can be observed that the overall
    throughput is improved when the involvement of FPUs in performing activities is
    reduced on the CRN. Increasing the number of SPUs and transmission time improves
    the throughput for both (FPUs and SPUs) users. As described earlier, the FPU is
    a licensed user, and when it utilizes the channel further, the SPU transmission
    will decrease. Therefore, the SPUs will collaborate to detect FPU’s activities
    by using CSS. Due to this collaboration, the bit error rate (BER) on the spectrum
    will decrease, and the system''s throughput will increase. The overall throughput
    is the coalescing throughput of FPUs and SPUs achieved employing CSS and hybrid
    handoff schemes. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download : Download

    of Proposed Framework. Fig. 10 demonstrates the comparison of the power consumption
    pattern of the recommended strategy. The graph shows three peak values of the
    power consumption pattern at 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 3000 Hz, respectively. It shows
    that the model consumes consistent power with increased operating frequency values
    due to the use of the CSS approach. The SPUs cooperate to share information for
    sensing parameters that result in minimum energy consumption. The primary benefit
    of consuming less energy is to accomplish the stability between energy consumption
    and throughput. Hence, energy efficiency is specified as the ratio between total
    expended energy and total attainable throughput. Therefore, to avoid interference
    at the licensed FPUs, the missed detection probability is restricted by keeping
    it within the acceptable range. The above results show that the model can increase
    energy efficiency by lowering energy consumption while increasing throughput and
    sensing efficiency. The handoff scheme reduces the overall handoff delay to an
    absolute minimum. As the number of SPUs increases, false alarm and miss-detection
    probability decrease, resulting in efficient CRNs throughput. Aside from that,
    a few limitations to this research must be addressed in future research, such
    as the additional unoccupied spectrums that are available for transmission but
    are not used, resulting in extra energy consumption. Furthermore, a method for
    sharing or distributing reliable information about channels between SPUs is required.
    As described in the literature review by Table 1, the proposed scheme is thought
    to outperform existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, and
    handoff delay. The results show that the model is capable of increasing energy
    efficiency by lowering energy consumption while increasing throughput and sensing
    efficiency. The handoff scheme reduces the overall handoff delay to an absolute
    minimum. As the number of SPUs increases, the probability of false alarm and miss-detection
    decreases, resulting in efficient CRN throughput. Aside from that, there are a
    few limitations to this research that must be addressed in future research, such
    as the additional unoccupied spectrums that are available for transmission but
    are not used, resulting in extra energy consumption. Furthermore, a method for
    sharing or distributing reliable information about channels between SPUs is required.
    5. Conclusion and future work The SPU leads to a broad position in energy efficiency
    in communication technologies, where the spectrum is shared rather than diminished.
    A CSS-based SPU transmission model for CRN is presented in this paper. An energy
    detection technique has been developed to optimize energy consumption while sensing,
    resulting in energy efficiency. To select the appropriate vacant channel for transmission,
    a DSA-based hybrid handoff scheme was reprocessed. These approaches have been
    combined to improve the sensing routine and throughput while reducing energy consumption
    through the false alarm and miss-detection probabilistic values. The results show
    that the presented model is robust in increasing energy efficiency by reducing
    energy consumption while improving throughput and sensing efficiency. The handoff
    scheme keeps the overall handoff delay to a bare minimum. The false alarm and
    miss-detection probabilistic values decrease as the number of SPUs increases,
    resulting in efficient CRN throughput. The proposed scheme is consistent in terms
    of (a) optimizing energy efficiency, (b) sensing performance, (c) throughput,
    and (d) minimizing handoff delay. This research can be improved by considering
    the additional unoccupied spectrums available for transmission but are not used,
    resulting in extra energy consumption. In order to attain a high level of energy
    efficiency, it is necessary to suggest innovative ways in which users can employ
    multiple spectrums for their transmissions. In addition, a method is necessary
    to share or distribute reliable information regarding channels between SPUs. Because
    malicious users can spread incorrect information about spectrum gaps and continues
    to exploit them, the other SPUs consume energy by repeatedly detecting the occupied
    channel. 6. Data availability statement The synthetic dataset is used in this

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: This paper presents an
    intelligent spectrum mobility management scheme for cognitive radio networks.
    The spectrum mobility could involve spectrum handoff (i.e., the user switches
    to a new channel) or stay-and-wait (i.e., the user pauses the transmission for
    a while until the channel quality improves again). An optimal spectrum mobility
    management scheme needs to consider its long-term impact on the network performance,
    such as throughput and delay, instead of optimizing only the short-term performance.
    We use a machine learning scheme, called the Transfer Actor-Critic Learning (TACT),
    for the spectrum mobility management. The proposed scheme uses a comprehensive
    reward function that considers the channel utilization factor (CUF), packet error
    rate (PER), packet dropping rate (PDR), and flow throughput. Here, the CUF is
    determined by the spectrum sensing accuracy and channel holding time. The PDR
    is calculated from the non-preemptive M/G/1 queueing model, and the flow throughput
    is estimated from a link-adaptive transmission scheme, which utilizes the rateless
    (Raptor) codes. The proposed scheme achieves a higher reward, in terms of the
    mean opinion score, compared to the myopic and Q-learning based spectrum management
    schemes. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing ( Volume: 17, Issue:

    1 Introduction The spectrum mobility management is very important in cognitive
    radio networks (CRNs) [1]. Although a secondary user (SU) does not know exactly
    when the primary user (PU) will take the channel back, it wants to achieve a reliable
    spectrum usage to support its quality of service (QoS) requirements. If the quality
    of the current channel degrades, the SU can take one of the following three decisions:
    (i) Stay in the same channel waiting for it to become idle again (called stay-and-wait);
    (ii) Stay in the same channel and adjust to the varying channel conditions (called
    stay-and-adjust); (iii) Switch to another channel that meets its QoS requirement
    (called spectrum handoff). Generally, if the waiting time is longer than the channel
    switching delay plus traffic queueing delay, the SU should switch to another channel
    [2]. In this paper, we design an intelligent spectrum mobility management (iSM)
    scheme. To accurately measure the channel quality for spectrum mobility management,
    we define a channel selection metric (CSM) based on the following three important
    factors: (i) Channel Utilization Factor (CUF) determined based on the spectrum
    sensing accuracy, false alarm rate, and channel holding time (CHT) [3]; (ii) Packet
    Dropping Rate (PDR) determined by evaluating the expected waiting delay for a
    SU in the queue associated with the channel; (iii) Flow throughput which uses
    the decoding-CDF [4], along with the prioritized Raptor codes (PRC) [5]. The spectrum
    management should maximize the performance for the entire session instead of maximizing
    only the short-term performance. Motivated by this, we design an iSM scheme by
    integrating the CSM with machine learning algorithms. The spectrum handoff scheme
    based on the long-term optimization model, such as Q-learning used in our previous
    work [2], can determine the proper spectrum decision actions based on the SU state
    estimation (including PER, queueing delay, etc.). However, the SU does not have
    any prior knowledge of the CRN environment in the beginning. It starts with a
    trial-and-error process by exploring each action in every state. Therefore, the
    Q-learning could take considerable time to converge to an optimal, stable solution.
    To enhance the spectrum decision learning process, we use the transfer learning
    schemes in which a newly joined SU learns from existing SUs which have similar
    QoS requirements [6]. Unlike the Q-learning model that asks a SU to recognize
    and adapt to its own radio environment, the transfer learning models pass over
    the initial phase of building all the handoff control policies [6], [7]. The transfer
    actor-critic learning (TACT) method used in this paper is a combination of actor-only
    and critic-only models [8]. While the actor performs the actions without the need
    of optimized value function, the critic criticizes the actions taken by the actor
    and keeps updating the value function. By using TACT, a new SU need not perform
    iterative optimization algorithms from scratch. To form a complete TACT-based
    transfer learning framework, we solve the following two important issues: Selection
    of an expert SU and transfer of policy from the expert to the learner node. We
    enhance the original TACT algorithm by exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations
    in the SU’s traffic profile, and update the value and policy functions separately
    for easy knowledge transfer. A SU learns from an expert SU in the beginning; Thereafter,
    it gradually updates its model on its own. The preliminary results of this scheme
    appeared in [9]. The CSM concept as well as the big picture of our iSM model is
    shown in Fig. 1 . After the CSM is determined, the TACT model will generate CRN
    states and actions, which consist of three iSM options (spectrum handoff, stay-and-wait,
    or stay-and-adjust). Fig. 1. The big picture of iSM concept. Show All The main
    contributions of this paper are: Teaching based spectrum management is proposed
    to enhance the spectrum decision process. Previously, we proposed an apprenticeship
    learning based transfer learning scheme for CRN [6], which can be further improved
    in some areas. For example, the exact imitation of the expert node’s policy should
    be avoided since each node in the network may experience different channel conditions.
    Therefore, it is helpful to consider a TACT-based transfer learning algorithm
    which uses the learned policy from the expert SU to build its own optimized learning
    model by fine tuning the expert policy according to the channel conditions it
    experiences. More importantly, we connect the Q-learning with TACT to receive
    the learned policy from the expert node, which greatly enhances the teaching process
    without introducing much overhead to the expert node. Decoding-CDF with prioritized
    Raptor codes are used to perform the high-throughput spectrum adaptation. Due
    to mobility, the SU may experience fading and poor channel conditions. In order
    to improve the QoS performance, we introduce spectrum adaptation by using the
    decoding-CDF along with machine learning. Initially, the decoding-CDF was proposed
    for use with the Spinal codes [10], whereas we use the decoding-CDF along with
    our prioritized Raptor codes [5]. Our PRC model considers the prioritized packets
    and allocates better channels to high-priority traffic. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows. The related work is discussed in Section 2. The channel
    selection metric is described in Section 3 , followed by an overview of the Q-learning
    based iSM scheme in Section 4 . Our TACT-based iSM scheme is described in Section
    5. The performance evaluation and simulation results are provided in Section 6,
    followed by a discussion in Section 7. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section
    8. SECTION 2 Related Work In this section, we review the literature related to
    our work, which includes the three aspects: Learning-based Wireless Adaptation:
    The strategy of learning from expert SUs was proposed in our previous work, called
    the apprenticeship learning based spectrum handoff [6], which was further extended
    in [11] as the multi teacher apprenticeship learning where the node learns spectrum
    handoff strategy from multiple nodes in the network. Other related work in this
    direction includes the concept of docitive learning (DL) [7], [12], reinforced
    learning (RL) used in CRNs [13], RL-based cooperative spectrum sensing [14], and
    Q-learning based channel allocation [6], [15], [16]. DL was successfully used
    for interference management in femtocell [7]. However, it did not consider the
    concrete channel selection parameters. Also, it does not have clear definitions
    of expert selection process and node-to-node similarity calculation functions.
    A channel selection scheme was implemented on GNU radio in [4]. But the CHT and
    PDR were not used for channel selection. The same drawback exists in [15] and
    [16]. The TACT learning scheme is superior to RL since it can use both node-to-node
    teaching and self-learning to adapt to the complex CRN spectrum conditions. Channel
    Selection Metric: The concept of channel selection metric in CRN was proposed
    in [6], [17]. A SU selects an idle channel based on the channel conditions and
    queueing delay. A QoS-based channel selection scheme was proposed in [18], but
    the channel sensing accuracy and CHT were not considered. Note that the CHT determines
    the period over which a SU can occupy the channel without interruption from the
    PU. Further, authors in [19] proposed OFDM based MAC protocol for spectrum sensing
    and sharing which reduces the sharing overhead, but they did not consider the
    kind of channel that should be selected by the SU for transmission. Our spectrum
    evaluation scheme considers the channel dynamics with respect to the interference,
    fading loss, and other channel variations. Decoding-CDF based Spectrum Adaptation:
    The rateless codes have been used in wireless communications due to its property
    of recovering the original data with low error rate. The popular rateless codes
    include the Spinal codes [10], [20], Raptor codes [21] and Strider codes [22]
    , [23], [24]. The rateless codes for CRNs were proposed in [12], [25] . Authors
    in [12] proposed a feedback technique for rateless codes using multi-user MIMO
    to improve the QoS and to provide delay guarantee. Authors in [4] used decoding-CDF
    with the Spinal codes. In this paper, we use decoding-CDF along with our prioritized
    Raptor codes [5] to perform spectrum adaptation. SECTION 3 Channel Selection Metric
    In order to select a suitable channel for spectrum handoff, the SU should consider
    the time varying and spatial channel characteristics. The time-varying channel
    characteristics comprise of CHT and PDR, which are mainly observed due to PU interruption
    and SU contentions, and the spatial characteristics comprise of achievable throughput
    and PER observed due to the SU mobility. As mentioned in Section 1, the CSM comprises
    of CUF, PDR and flow throughput which are described below. 3.1 Channel Utilization
    Factor If a busy channel is detected as idle, this misinterpretation is called
    as false alarm, which is a key parameter of spectrum sensing accuracy. We use
    the spectrum sensing accuracy and CHT for evaluating the effective channel utilization.
    From [3], we know that a higher detection probability, P d , has a low false alarm
    probability, P f . Hence we express the spectrum sensing accuracy as M A = P d
    (1− P f ). (1) View Source If T denotes the total frame length and τ is the channel
    sensing time, the transmission period is T − τ . We assume that the PU arrival
    rate λ ph follows the Poisson distribution and the CHT with duration t has the
    following probability distribution, f(t)= λ ph e −( λ ph )t . (2) View Source
    Since PU’s arrival time is unpredictable, it can interfere with the SU’s transmission.
    Hence, the predictable interruption duration can be determined as [26], y(t)={
    T−τ−t,0≤t≤(T−τ) 0,t≥(T−τ). (3) View Source The SU transmits the data with an average
    collision duration [26] as,Hence, the probability that a SU experiences the interference
    from a PU within its frame transmission duration is given by P p s = y ¯ (T) (T−τ)
    =1− t (T−τ) (1− e (− (T−τ) t ) ) (4) View Source The total channel utilization
    (CUF) is determined by using CHT and probability of interference from PU as, CUF=
    M A (T−τ) T (1− P p s ). (5) View Source Substituting the results from (6) in
    (7), the CUF can be defined as follows, CUF= M A . t T (1− e (− (T−τ) t ) ). (6)
    View Source The CUF can be used to represent the spectrum evaluation results for
    the selection of an optimal channel. According to IEEE 802.22 recommendations,
    the probability of correct detection, P d =[0.9,0.99] and the probability of false
    alarm, P f =[0.01,0.1] . Therefore, the probability of spectrum sensing accuracy
    is P d (1− P f )=[0.81,0.99] . 3.2 Non-Preemptive M/G/1 Priority Queueing Model
    We use a non-preemptive M/G/1 priority queueing model where a lower priority SU
    accesses channel without interruption from higher priority SUs. We denote j =
    1 (or N ) as the highest (or lowest) priority SU. However, any SU transmissions
    can be interrupted by a PU. When the channel becomes idle, a higher priority SU
    will be served. When a SU is interrupted by a PU, it can either stay-and-wait
    in the same channel until it becomes idle again, or handoff to another suitable
    channel. Let Dela y j,i be the delay of a S U j connection due to the first (
    i−1 ) interruptions. A S U j packet will be dropped if its delay exceeds the delay
    deadline d j . In our previous work [2], we deduced the PD R (k) j,i as the probability
    of packet being dropped during the i th interruption for channnel k with packet
    arrival rate, λ , and mean service rate, μ . It equals to the probability of handoff
    delay E[ D k j,i ] being larger than d j −Dela y j,i [2] PD R (k) j,i = ρ (k)
    j,i .exp ⎛ ⎝ − ρ (k) j,i ×( d j −Dela y j,i ) E[ D (k) j,i ] ⎞ ⎠ . (7) View Source
    Here, ρ (k) j,i is the normalized load of channel k caused by type j SU. It is
    defined as follows, ρ (k) j,i = λ i μ k ≤1. (8) View Source 3.3 Throughput Determination
    in Decoding-CDF Based Rateless Transmission After we identify a high-CUF channel,
    the next step is to transmit the SU’s packets in this channel. Even a channel
    with high CUF can experience the time varying link quality due to the mobility
    of SU. Therefore, link adaptation is important to avoid frequent spectrum handoffs.
    Generally, the sender needs to adjust its data rate depending on the channel conditions
    since a poor link (lower channel SNR) can result in a higher packet loss rate.
    For example, in IEEE 802.11, the sender uses the channel SNR to select a suitable
    modulation constellation and forward error correcting (FEC) code rate from a set
    of discrete values. Such a channel adaptation cannot achieve a smooth rate adjustment
    since only a limited number of adaptation rates are available. Because channel
    condition variations can occur on very short time scales (even at the sub-packet
    level), it is challenging to adapt to the dynamic channel conditions in CRNs.
    Rateless codes have shown promising performance improvement in multimedia transmission
    over CRNs [5]. At the sender side, each group of packets is decomposed into symbols
    with certain redundancy such that the receiver can reconstruct the original packets
    as long as enough number of symbols are received. The sender does not need to
    change the modulation and encoding schemes. It simply keeps sending symbols until
    an ACK is received from the receiver, signaling that enough symbols have been
    received to reconstruct the original packets. The sender then sends out the next
    group of symbols. For a well-designed rateless code, the number of symbols for
    packets closely tracks the changes in the channel conditions. In this paper, we
    employ our unequal error protection (UEP) based prioritized Raptor codes [5].
    In PRC, more symbols are generated for the higher priority packets than the lower
    priority packets. As a result, PRC can support higher reliability requirements
    of more important packets. We describe below how we can achieve cognitive link
    adaptation through a self-learning of ACK feedback statistics (such as inter-arrival
    time gaps between two feedbacks). We also show how a SU can build a decoding-CDF
    by using the previously transmitted symbols and how it can be used for channel
    selection and link adaptation. 3.3.1 CDF-Enhanced Raptor Codes In rateless codes,
    after sending certain number of symbols, the sender pauses the transmission and
    waits for a feedback (ACK) from the receiver. No ACK is sent if the receiver cannot
    reconstruct the packets, and the sender needs to send extra symbols. Each pause
    for ACK introduces overhead in terms of the total time spent on symbol transmission
    plus ACK feedback [4]. The decoding-CDF defines the probability of decoding a
    packet successfully from the received symbols. In the CDF-enhanced rateless codes,
    the sender can use the statistical distribution to determine the number of symbols
    it should send before each pause. The CDF distribution is sensitive to the code
    parameters, channel conditions, and code block length. Surprisingly, only a small
    number of records on the relationship between n (number of symbols sent between
    two consecutive pauses) and τ (ACK feedback delay) are needed to obtain the CDF
    curve [4]. In order to speed up the CDF learning process, the Gaussian approximation
    can be used which provides a reasonable approximation at low channel SNR, and
    its maximum likelihood (ML) requires only mean ( μ ) and variance ( σ 2 ). In
    addition, we introduce the parameter α , which ranges from 0 (means no memory)
    to 1 (unlimited memory), to represent the importance of past symbols in the calculation.
    This process has two advantages: the start-up transition dies out quickly, and
    the ML estimator is well behaved for α=1 . The Algorithm 1 defines the Gaussian
    CDF learning process. Algorithm 1. Decoding CDF Estimation by Gaussian Approximation

    by using the following standard equation, F(x)= ∫ NS 0 1 σ 2π − − √ e − (NS−μ
    ) 2 2 σ 2 dx. (9) View Source Here, NS, μ and σ are the number of symbols, mean
    and variance, respectively. For the observed link SNR, we can determine the number
    of symbols that need to be transmitted in order to decode the packet successfully.
    When the channel condition degrades in-terms of PER but PDR≤PD R th , the additional
    symbols are transmitted to adapt to the current channel conditions, which avoids
    unnecessary spectrum handoff. After the number of transmitted symbols reaches
    the maximum value, (NS ) max , the SU should perform spectrum handoff to a new
    channel. This is called as link adaptation using decoding-CDF. After determining
    the number of symbols per packet (NS), which are required to successfully decode
    a packet, we can calculate the rateless throughput (TH) of channel k in a Rayleigh
    fading channel as [4], T H k = 2× f s ×(NS) t symbols/s/Hz. (10) View Source Where
    f s and t are the sampling frequency and transmission time, respectively. The
    value of NS varies over time due to the Rayleigh fading channel and number of
    symbols per packet estimated using the decoding-CDF curve. Since each node observes
    either time spreading of digital pulses or time-varying behavior of the channel
    due to mobility, Rayleigh fading channel is appropriate due to its ability to
    capture both variations (time spreading and time varying). The normalized throughput
    is (T H k ) norm = T H k (T H k ) ideal . (11) View Source Here, (T H k ) ideal
    is the ideal throughput calculated via Shannon capacity theorem. Now we can integrate
    the above three models together into a weighted channel selection metric for i
    th interruption in k th channel for the SU with priority j [15], U (k) ij = w
    1 ⋆CUF+ w 2 ⋆(1−PD R (k) ij )+ w 2 ⋆(T H k ) norm . (12) View Source Where w 1
    , w 2 and w 3 are weights representing the relative importance of the channel
    quality, PDR and throughput, respectively. Here w 1 + w 2 + w 3 =1 . Their setup
    depends on application QoS requirements. For real-time applications, the throughput
    is more important than PDR. On the other hand, PDR is the most important factor
    for the FTP applications. For video applications, CHT (part of CUF model) is more
    important. SECTION 4 Overview of Q-Learning Based Intelligent Spectrum Management
    In this paper, the Q-learning scheme is used to compare the performance of our
    proposed TACT-based learning scheme for intelligent spectrum mobility management.
    More details about Q-learning based spectrum decisions are available in [2]. The
    Q-learning uses special Markov Decision Process (MDP), which can be stated as
    a tuple (S,A,T,R) [13]. Here, S depicts the set of system states; A is the set
    of system actions at each state; T represents the transition probability, where
    T={P(s,a,s′)} , and P(.) the probability of transition from state s to s ′ when
    action a is taken; and R:S×A↦R is the reward or cost function for taking an action
    a∈A in state s∈S . In MDP, we intend to find the optimal policy π ∗ (s)∈A , i.e.,
    a series of actions { a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ,…} for state s , in order to maximize the
    total discount reward function. States: For S U i , the network state before (j+1)
    th channel assignment is depicted as s ij ={ χ (k) ij , ξ (k) ij , ρ (k) ij ,
    ϕ (k) ij } . Here k is the channel being used; χ (k) ij depicts the channel status
    (idle or busy); ξ (k) ij is the channel quality (CSM); ρ (k) ij indicates the
    traffic load of channel; and ϕ (k) ij represents the QoS priority level of S U
    i . Actions: Three actions are considered for iSM scheme - stay-and-wait, stay-and-adjust
    and spectrum handoff. We denote a ij ={ β (k) ij }∈A as the candidate of actions
    for S U i von state s ij after the assignment of (j+1) th channel, and β (k) ij
    represents the probability of choosing action a ij . The Q-learning algorithm
    aims to find an optimal action which minimizes the expected cost of the current
    policy π ∗ ( s i,j , a i,j ) for (j+1) th channel assignment to S U i . It is
    based on the value function V π (s) that determines how good it is for a given
    agent to perform a certain action under a given state. Similarly, we use the action
    value function, Q π (s,a) ; It defines which action has low cost in the long term.
    Bellman optimality equation gives the high and discounted long-term rewards [27].
    For the sake of simplicity, in further sections we consider s i,j as s , action
    a i,j as a , and state s i,j+1 as s ′ . Rewards: The reward R of an action is
    defined as the predicted reward function for data transmission, for a certain
    channel assignment. For multimedia data, we use the mean opinion score (MOS) metric.
    Based on our previous work [2], the MOS can be calculated as follows, R=MOS= a
    1 + a 2 FR+ a 3 ln(SBR) 1+ a 4 TPER+ a 5 (TPER ) 2 , (13) View Source where FR,
    SBR and TPER are the frame rate, sending bit rate, total packet error rate, respectively.
    The parameter a i , i∈{1,2,3,4,5} is estimated using the linear regression process.
    MOS varies from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). When the channel status is idle, ‘transmission’
    is an ideal action to take, which would achieve MOS close to 5. On the other hand,
    when PDR (State: traffic load) or PER (State: channel quality) is high, low MOS
    would be achieved which reflects poor performance in the acquired channel. The
    estimation of expected discounted reinforcement of taking action a in state s,
    Q ∗ (s,a) can be written as [2], Q ∗ (s,a)=E( R i,j+1 )+γ ∑ s′ P s,s′ (a) max
    a′∈A Q ∗ (s,a). (14) View Source We adopt softmaxpolicy for long-term optimization.
    π(s,a) , which determines the probability of taking action a , can be determined
    by utilizing Boltzmann distribution as [2] π(s,a)= exp( Q(s,a) τ ) ∑ a′∈A exp(
    Q(s, a ′ ) τ ) . (15) View Source Here, Q(s,a) defines the affinity to select
    action a at state s ; it is updated after every iteration. τ is the temperature.
    The Boltzman distribution is chosen to avoid jumping into exploitation phase before
    testing each action in every state. The high temperature indicates the exploration
    of the unknown state-action values, whereas the low temperature indicates the
    exploitation of known state-action pairs. If τ is close to infinity, the probability
    of selecting an action follows the uniform distribution, i.e., the probability
    of selecting any action is equal. On the other hand, when τ is close to zero,
    the probability of choosing an action associated with the highest Q-value in a
    particular state is one. Fig. 2 shows the procedure of using Q-learning for iSM.
    Here the dynamic spectrum conditions are captured by the states, which are used
    for policy search in order to maximize the reward function. The optimal policy
    determines the corresponding spectrum management action in the current round.
    Fig. 2. The Q-learning based iSM. Show All SECTION 5 TACT Based Intelligent Spectrum
    Management The Q-learning based MDP algorithm could be very slow due to two reasons:
    (1) It requires the selection of suitable initial state/parameters in the Markov
    chain; (2) It also needs proper settings of Markov transition matrix based on
    different traffic, QoS and CRN conditions. Let us consider a new SU which has
    just joined the network, and needs to build a MDP model. Instead of using trial-and-error
    to find the appropriate MDP settings, it may find a neighboring SU with similar
    traffic and QoS demands, and request it to serve as “expert” (or teacher) and
    transfer its optimal policies. Such teaching or transfer based scheme can considerably
    shorten the learning (or convergence) time. We use the TACT model for the knowledge
    transfer between SUs, which consists of three components: actor, critic and environment
    [8], [9]. For a given state, the actor selects and executes an action in a stochastic
    manner. This causes the system to transition from one state to another with a
    reward as feedback to the actor. Then the critic evaluates the action taken by
    the actor in terms of temporal difference (TD) error, and updates the value function.
    After receiving the feedback from the critic, the actor updates the policy. The
    algorithm repeats until it converges. To apply TACT in our spectrum management
    scheme, we solve the following two issues: SelectionoftheExpertSU : We consider
    a distributed network without a central coordinator. When a new SU joins the network,
    it performs the localized search broadcasting the Expert-Seek messages. The nearby
    nodes may be located in the area covered by the same PU(s), and thus have similar
    spectrum availability. The SU should select a critic SU based on its relevance
    to the application, level of expertise, and influence of an action on the environment.
    To find the expert SU, the SUs share the following three types of information
    among them, i.e., channel statistics (such as CUF), node statistics (node mobility,
    modulation modes, etc.), and application statistics (QoS, QoE, etc.). The similarity
    of the SUs can be evaluated in an actor SU by using the manifold learning [6],
    which uses the Bregman Ball concept to compare the complex objects. The Bregman
    ball comprises of a center ( μ(k) ) and a radius ( R(k) ). The data point X p
    which lies inside the ball possesses strong similarity with μ(k) . We define their
    distance as [6], B( μ k , R k )={ X t ∈X: D ϕ ( X t , μ k )≤ R k }. (16) View
    Source Here D(p,q) is known as the Bregman Divergence, which is the manifold distance
    between two signal points (the expert SU and learning SU). If the distance is
    less than a specified threshold, we conclude that p and q are similar to each
    other. All distances are visualized in Gephi (a network analysis and visualization
    software) [28], as shown in Fig. 3. The similarity calculation between any two
    SUs includes three metrics: (1) The application statistics, which mainly refer
    to the QoS parameters such as the data rates, delay, etc.; (2) The node statistics,
    which include the node modulation modes, location, mobility pattern, etc.; (3)
    The channel statistics, which include the channel parameters such as bandwidth,
    SNR, etc. The SU with the highest similarity value with the learning SU is chosen
    as the expert SU. In Fig. 3, SU3 is selected as the expert SU (i.e., the critic)
    since it has stronger similarity to the learning SU (SU1) compared to the rest
    of the SUs. Fig. 3. Gephi-simulated expert SU search. Show All TheKnowledgeTransferviaTACTModel
    : The actor-critic learning updates the value function and policy function separately,
    which makes it easier to transfer the policy knowledge compared to the other critic-only
    schemes, such as Q-learning and greedy algorithm. We implement the TACT-based
    iSM as follows: ActionSelection: When a new SU joins the network, the initial
    state is s ij in channel k . In order to optimize the performance, the SU chooses
    suitable actions to balance two explicit functions: a) searching for the new channel
    if the current channel condition degrades (exploration), and b) finding an optimal
    policy by sticking to the current channel (exploitation). This also enables the
    SU to not only explore a new channel but also to find the optimal policy based
    on its past experience. The probability of taking an action a in state s is determined,
    as mentioned in Equation (17). Reward: The MOS from Equation (16) is evaluated
    as the reward resulting out of an action a∈{A} taken in state s ∈{S} . State-ValueFunctionUpdate:
    Once the SU chooses an action in channel k , the system changes the state from
    s to s ′ with a transition probability, P( s ′ |s,a)={ 1, s ′ ∈S 0,otherwise.
    (17) View Source The total reward for the taken action would be R s.a . The temporal
    difference (TD) error can be calculated from the difference between (i) the state-value
    function, V(s) estimated in the previous state, and (ii)  R s,a +V( s ′ ) at the
    critic [29], δ(s,a) = R s,a +γ ∑ s ′ ∈S P( s ′ |s,a)V( s ′ )−V(s) = R s,a +γV(
    s ′ )−V(s). (18) View Source Subsequently, the TD error is sent back to the actor.
    By using TD error, the actor updates its state-value function as V( s ′ )=V(s)+α(
    ν 1 (s,m))δ(s,a). (19) View Source Where ν 1 (s,m) indicates the occurrence time
    of state s in these m stages. α(.) is a positive step-size parameter that affects
    the convergence rate. V( s ′ ) remains as V(s) in case of s≠ s ′ . PolicyUpdate:
    The critic would employ the TD error to evaluate the selected action by the actor,
    and the policy can be updated as [28], p(s,a)=p(s,a)−β( ν 2 (s,a,m))δ(s,a). (20)
    View Source Here ν 2 (s,a,m) denotes the occurrence time of action a at state
    s in these m stages. β(.) denotes the positive step size parameter defined by
    (m∗logm) −1 [8]. Equations (17) and (22) ensure that an action in a specific state
    can be selected with a higher probability, if we reach the highest minimum reward,
    i.e., δ(s,a)<0 . If each action is executed for infinite times in each state and
    the learning algorithm follows a greedy exploration, the value function V(s) and
    the policy function π(s,a) will ultimately converge to V ∗ (s) and π ∗ , respectively,
    with a probability of 1. FormulationofTransferActor-CriticLearning: Initially,
    the expert SU shares its optimal policy with the new SU. Let p(s,a) denote the
    likelihood of taking action a in state s . When the process eventually converges,
    the likelihood of choosing a particular action a in a particular state s is relatively
    higher than that of other actions. In other words, if the spectrum handoff is
    performed based on a learned strategy by S U i , the reward will be high in the
    long term. However, in spite of the similarities between the two SUs, they might
    have some differences, such as in the QoS parameters. This may make an actor SU
    take more aggressive action(s). To avoid these problems, the transferred policy
    should have a decreasing impact on the choice of certain actions, especially after
    the SU has taken its action and learned an updated policy. This is the basic idea
    of TACT-based knowledge transfer and self-learning. The new policy update follows
    TACT principle (see Fig. 4), in which the overall policy of selecting an action
    is divided into a nativepolicy, p n and an exoticpolicy, p e . Assume at stage
    m , the state is s and the chosen action is a . The overall policy can be updated
    as [8]: p (m+1) o (s,a) =[(1−ω( ν 2 (s,a,m)) p (m+1) n (s,a) +ω( ν 2 (s,a,m))
    p (m+1) e (s,a) ] p t − p t . (21) View Source Fig. 4. TACT based SU-to-SU teaching.
    Show All Where [x ] b a with b>a , indicates the euclidean distance of interval
    [a,b], i.e., [x ] b a =a if x<a ; [x ] b a =b if x>b and [x ] b a =x if a ≤x≤b
    . In this scenario, a = − p t and b = p t . In addition, p (m+1) 0 (s,a)= p (m)
    0 (s,a) , ∀a∈A but a≠ a ij . And p n (s,a) updates itself according to Equation
    (22). During the initial learning process, the exotic policy p e (s,a) is dominant.
    Therefore, when the SU enters a state s , the presence of p e (s,a) forces it
    to choose the action, which might be optimal based on the expert SU. Subsequently,
    the proposed policy update strategy can improve the performance. We define ω∈(0,1)
    as the transfer rate, and ω↦0 as the number of iterations goes to ∞ . Thus the
    impact of exotic policy p e (s,a) is decreased. Algorithm 2 describes our proposed
    TACT-based iSM scheme. SECTION 6 Performance Evaluation In this section, we evaluate
    the performance of our proposed scheme, including the channel selection, decoding
    CDF and enchanced TACT learning model. SECTION Algorithm 2. TACT-Based Spectrum

    (described in Section 3), including the effect of spectrum sensing accuracy (
    M A ) and CHT. We setup the parameters as shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Simulation
    Parameters We consider N = 10 PUs, each of them possessing one primary channel,
    and randomly select the probability parameters given in Table 1. Figs. 5a and
    5b represent M A and CHT, respectively. By considering both M A and CHT, the SU
    determines the CUF for each channel and ranks them in the decreasing order as
    shown in Fig. 5c . Fig. 5. The channel selection parameters. Show All Fig. 6 shows
    the normalized throughput of the system that can be achieved by our channel selection
    scheme (BIGS) for different frame rates and PU idle durations (CHT). Here, BIGS
    refers to the channel sensing using Bayesian Inference with Gibbs Sampling [3]
    . For comparison, we also show the normalized throughput achieved by a random
    channel selection (RCS) scheme. Our scheme achieves better throughput than RCS
    because it selects the channel with high sensing accuracy as well as high CHT,
    whereas RCS does not consider the CHT and is also prone to channel miss detection
    and false alarm. Fig. 6. Comparison of the proposed and random channel selection
    schemes. Here, FD represents the frame duration. Show All In Fig. 7, we compare
    the normalized throughput of our channel selection model with [16] and [17]. In
    our scheme, the SU senses the channel and ranks them based on the channel sensing
    accuracy and CHT. Similarly, authors in [17] performed the channel sensing based
    on the energy detection, and categorized the channels based on their CHT. In addition,
    they considered the directional antenna whereas we use the omni-directional antenna.
    Therefore, [17] has higher channel sensing accuracy than our scheme as the interference
    level is much lower in directional communication as compared to the omni communication.
    As a result, the throughput of [17] is higher than ours. To compare our schemne
    with [16], we consider that the channel can use one band at a time and also assume
    that the Q-learning has achieved the optimal condition. Alongside we also consider
    that SU communicates in its current channel until it is occupied by other users.
    Since the channel selection is random in [16], the SU may select a channel with
    small CHT even when a channel with longer CHT is available. Therefore, though
    its sensing accuracy is close to ours, the throughput is lower. Channel selection
    based on the channel ranking is very important to achieve smooth communication
    and to avoid frequent spectrum handoffs. Fig. 7. Comparison of the proposed channel
    selection scheme with [16] and [17]. Show All 6.2 Average Queueing Delay We assume
    that the service time of SUs follows the exponential distribution, and the number
    of channels is 10. The maximum transmission rate of each channel is 3Mbps , and
    the PER varies from 2 to 10 percent. Different priorities are assigned to the
    SUs depending on the delay constraint of their flow. The highest priority (priority
    = 1) is assigned to the interactive voice data with rate of 50Kbps and strict
    delay constraint of 50ms . Priority 2 is assigned to the interactive Skype call
    with rate of 500Kbps and delay constraint of 100ms . Priority 3 is assigned to
    the video-on-demand streaming data with rate of >1Mbps and delay constraint of
    1sec . Finally, the lowest priority (priority = 4) is assigned to the data without
    any delay constraint (e.g., file download). Fig. 8 shows that the non-preemptive
    M/G/1 priority queueing model outperforms the non-prioritized model. The idle
    channels are assigned based on the priority of the applications in priority model.
    The higher priority user(s) (such as voice data and real-time video) will get
    more channel access opportunities, which decreases their average queueing delay,
    whereas the lower priority user(s) experiences a longer average waiting time.
    In the non-prioritized model, all the applications are given the same priority,
    which leads to an increase in the average delay. Therefore, the priority based
    queueing model is suitable for SUs with different delay constraints. Fig. 8. Average
    delay for the non-preemptive M/G/1 priority queueing model and non-prioritized
    model. Show All 6.3 Decoding CDF Learning In this section, we examine the performance
    of decoding CDF with Raptor codes over a range of symbols for different SNR values.
    Fig. 9 shows the plot of decoding CDF using Algorithm 1 for the SNR values from
    −5 dB to 25 dB. For higher (lower) SNR, we require less (more) symbols to decode
    a transmitted packet. The Rayleigh fading channel is used. Fig. 9. Estimated CDF
    for different SNR levels. Show All Using the decoding CDF, we examine the throughput
    for Raptor codes in Fig. 10 . For better visualization, Fig. 11 zooms in a section
    of Fig. 10. As mentioned before, the decoding CDF enables us to find the optimal
    feedback strategy, i.e., when to pause for feedback and how many symbols should
    be transmitted before the next pause. The throughput is examined for a SU moving
    at a speed of 10 m/s over Rayleigh fading channel at 2.4GHz (channel SNR= 15dB
    ) within a time range of 100 ms with a packet aggregation cost n f =10 , which
    decides the number of packets to be aggregated to send an ACK. The throughput
    is estimated offline using Algorithm 1 with learning rate parameter, α , set to
    0.9. It can be seen from Figs. 10 and 11 that α need not to be close to 1 to obtain
    a good performance. The throughput achieved by the Raptor codes is almost half
    of the Shannon capacity [4]. The decoding CDF performance is close to that of
    the ideal learning which is determined based on receiving ACKs from the receiver.

    TACT Enhanced Spectrum Management Scheme In this section, we study the performance
    of our TACT-based spectrum mobility scheme. For 10 available channels with capacity
    of 3Mbps each, we assume there are 10 different PUs with different data rates
    for transmission which can interrupt the SU transmission. Different SUs contending
    for the channel access also have different data rates. We study the performance
    of a SU which is supporting a Skype video call at 500 Kbps and has a priority
    of 2. All SUs use the Raptor codes, and the expert SU teaches a new SU about its
    transmission strategy based on the decoding-CDF profile. We consider the following
    four cases. Case 1: The newly joined SU moves very slowly at < 5 mph; Case 2:
    The SU moves fast ( > 50 mph) and experiences different channel conditions; Case
    3: The SU moves fast but does not use the decoding CDF and pause control for transmission.
    Instead, it manually changes the symbol sending rate based on the current channel
    conditions; Case 4: The SU moves fast and uses the decoding CDF. We use the low-complexity
    MOS metric to estimate the received quality. In Fig. 12 (for Case 1), the Q-learning
    based spectrum decision scheme outperforms the myopic approach, because the former
    takes spectrum decisions to maximize the long-terms reward (i.e., MOS) whereas
    the latter considers only the immediate reward. Further, our proposed TACT-based
    scheme outperforms the Q-learning scheme since the newly joined SU can learn from
    the expert SU, and thus spends less time in estimating the channel dynamics. Without
    the expert node, the node in Q-learning scheme learns everything by itself, and
    thus needs more time to converge to a stable solution. Fig. 13 shows the result
    for fast moving SU for Case 2, which experiences channel condition variations
    with time. Our proposed TACT scheme still performs better than the Q-learning
    scheme. Fig. 12. The MOS performance for slow moving node. Show All Fig. 13. The
    MOS performance for fast moving node. Show All Fig. 14 depicts the Case 3 where
    the SU moves fast but does not use the decoding-CDF concept for Raptor codes.
    Since the SU is moving fast, it experiences different channel conditions. Once
    the SU attains the convergent state it achieves a high MOS value. But this does
    not guarantee that it will stay in the optimal state during the entire communication
    due to variations in channel conditions. Without the use of decoding-CDF, the
    SU is unable to adapt to the channel variations which results in the lower MOS
    value of around 4. In Fig. 15 (Case 4), the SU uses the CDF curve to learn the
    strategy of transmitting more symbols with lower overhead, and achieves a higher
    MOS of around 4.4. In both cases we can see that the MOS drops due to the change
    in channel condition at time slot 7. But CDF helps to quickly improve the MOS
    value to around 4.4. Fig. 14. The MOS performance comparison without the decoding-CDF.
    Show All Fig. 15. The MOS performance with the use of decoding-CDF. Show All Fig.
    16 shows the effect of transfer rate, ω on learning performance. We observe that
    the transfer rate has impact only at the beginning. Higher the transfer rate (ω=0.8)
    , faster the adaptation to the network with less MOS variations. Whereas lower
    the transfer rate (ω=0.2) , slower is the adaptation to the network and more are
    fluctuations in the MOS value. The performance converges after some iterations
    as the SU gradually builds up its own policy using the expert node. Fig. 16. The
    effect of transfer rate, ω on learning performance. Show All Fig. 17 shows that
    our TACT based spectrum decision scheme outperforms the Q (or RL) scheme [2] and
    the apprenticeship based transfer learning scheme [6]. In AL scheme, the student
    node uses the expert node’s policy for its own spectrum decision. This model works
    well if both the student and expert nodes experience the same channel and traffic
    conditions. Our TACT based model, on the other hand, can tune the expert policy
    according to its own channel conditions in a few iterations. Fig. 17. The comparison
    of our TACT model with RL [2] and AL [6]. Show All SECTION 7 Discussion Main concern
    in transfer learning approach is the overhead introduced by the expert search
    and the transfer of its knowledge (optimal policy) to the learner node. The proposed
    TACT learning-based spectrum decision requires a ‘learner node’ to communicate
    only with the closest neighbors, since only these nearby nodes are likely to have
    similar PU traffic distribution and channel conditions. This communication with
    neighbors can be easily achieved by the medium access control (MAC) protocols.
    It is also possible to piggyback this information exchange in the node discovery
    messages. Similarly, route discovery messages could also be used for this purpose.
    In this process, the learner node has more involvement and does not put much burden
    of transfer of the expert strategies on most other nodes in the network. In fact,
    a node which is new to the network needs to exchange the control messages with
    its neighbors to find an expert node only in the beginning. If there is a new
    transmission task for an existing node, it might be able to use the policy it
    has learned over the previous transmissions without the need of triggering a new
    round of expert search. More importantly, the policy π(s,a) is just an array of
    size 4 ( ≈20bytes ), which does not add much overhead to the packet size. SECTION
    8 Conclusion An intelligent spectrum management scheme was designed by using the
    TACT based learning algorithm. The primary goal of this scheme was to make an
    intelligent spectrum handoff and stay-and-wait decision for the rateless multimedia
    transmissions in dynamic CRN links. The spectrum desicion scheme requires a good
    knowledge of channel quality. For accurate channel quality evaluation of a link,
    we calculated the CUF. To adapt to the dynamic CRN channel conditions, we used
    the CDF-enhanced, UEP-based Raptor codes to achieve intelligent link adaptation.
    A good link adaptation strategy can significantly reduce the spectrum handoff
    events. The proposed cognitive learning scheme can also be useful in other CRN
    tasks, such as multimedia streaming over CRN, and dynamic route establishment.
    In future, we intend to further enhance our TACT-based model, by using the budget-limited
    teaching process, in order to efficiently transfer the important parameters from
    an expert SU to a learning SU within the given time constraints. The expert search
    model will be based on the manifold learning and non-negative matrix factorization
    (NMF) pattern extraction/recognition schemes, so that a more suitable expert SU
    can be found in the neighborhood of a learning SU. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF SUPPORT

    access of secondary users (SUs) to deal with the problem of radio spectrum scarcity
    . In this paper, we investigate the SU performance in cognitive radio networks
    with reactive-decision spectrum handoff. During transmission, a SU may get interrupted
    several times due to the arrival of primary (licensed) users. After each interruption
    in the reactive spectrum handoff, the SU performs spectrum sensing to determine
    an idle channel for retransmission. We develop two continuous-time Markov chain
    models with and without an absorbing state to study the impact of system parameters
    such as sensing time and sensing room size on several SU performance measures.
    These measures include the mean delay of a SU, the variance of the SU delay, the
    SU interruption probability, the average number of interruptions that a SU experiences,
    the probability of a SU getting discarded from the system after an interruption
    and the SU blocking probability upon arrival. Similar content being viewed by

    31 January 2018 1 Introduction In wireless communications, radio spectrum is scarce.
    Traditionally, spectrum regulators use a static spectrum allocation policy to
    assign spectrum bands to dedicated (licensed) users. The demand for spectrum is
    constantly increasing due to the increasing number of wireless devices and services,
    which leads to the fact that the radio spectrum is fully allocated in many countries
    [1]. However, it has also been shown through several spectrum occupancy measurement
    studies, see e.g., [2,3,4], that the allocated spectrum is heavily underutilized,
    which in turn leads to wasted bandwidth of wireless channels. Cognitive radio
    networks (CRNs) aim at an efficient use of the scarce spectrum resources [5, 6].
    The idea is to allow secondary (unlicensed) users to use the free spectrum gaps
    without causing any harm to primary (licensed) transmissions. For that purpose
    cognitive radios should be able to adapt their transmission parameters to the
    changing spectrum opportunities. In CRNs, two kinds of spectrum handoff for a
    secondary user (SU) are distinguished: proactive and reactive spectrum handoff
    [7]. In proactive spectrum handoff, a SU evacuates its current channel upon the
    arrival of a primary user (PU) and the interrupted SU switches to a new channel
    based on a predetermined channel hopping sequence. This sequence is obtained through
    the analysis of the traffic statistics and the interrupted SU does not perform
    any spectrum sensing. In reactive spectrum handoff, on the contrary, an interrupted
    SU is required to sense the spectrum to determine an idle channel for retransmission.
    The performance of CRNs has been extensively studied in the last years. A Markovian
    multiserver queueing model with a preemptive service discipline is presented in
    [8]. The case of r different user classes is considered where within each user
    class, customers are served according to their arrival order. The moments of the
    sojourn time distribution for lower priority customers are derived. An assumption
    of this model is that higher priority customers can interrupt lower priority customers
    only when all servers are busy. This means that higher priority customers are
    aware of the presence of lower priority customers, which does not correctly depict
    an important aspect of the CRN paradigm where PUs are completely unaware of SU
    actions. In [9], continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models with and without queueing
    are proposed to analyze the performance of SUs in a CRN. The case where multiple
    SUs can simultaneously share a spectrum band is considered. A limitation of this
    work is that it assumes that an interrupted SU should wait on the same channel
    so as to complete unfinished service when the channel becomes available again.
    In [10], a loss model for spectrum access with a finite user population is presented
    and the delay of SUs is investigated based on a CTMC. In [11], a CTMC model is
    developed to assess the maximum throughput of SUs in a heterogeneous CRN. The
    behavior of a CRN system with both PUs and SUs is modeled by a two-dimensional
    Markov chain in [12,13,14,15]. The throughput and the forced termination probability
    of SUs are derived in [12], whereas blocking probabilities for PUs and SUs are
    calculated in [13,14,15]. In [14], spectrum sensing errors are considered. None
    of the papers discussed above, however, take the sensing time into consideration.
    In [16, 17], M/G/1 queueing models (with Poisson arrivals, general service times
    and a single server) are proposed to investigate the case where each SU can transmit
    on all channels simultaneously. These papers do not take the effect of the handoff
    processing time into consideration either. Other studies, see e.g., [18, 19],
    use the on/off random process to describe the activity behavior of PUs on each
    channel, where an off period on a channel represents a spectrum opportunity for
    SUs. In [18], the spectrum utilization and the blocking time are derived, but
    the effect of the sensing time is not addressed. The influence of the sensing
    time on the data delivery time is examined in [19]. An assumption of this work
    is that at least one channel is always available for SUs, and the case where the
    system is blocked is not investigated. Some recent analytical models that include
    sensing time are proposed in [7, 20], but with different sensing time definitions.
    In [20], the authors refer to in-Band sensing where the sensing delay is the time
    from a collision moment between a PU and SU until the moment that the collision
    is detected by the SU. In [7], the sensing time is defined as the time from the
    moment a SU is interrupted by a PU until the moment an idle channel is found.
    Both these definitions do not consider the need of a SU to sense upon arrival.
    In the present paper, we analyze the performance of SUs in a CRN with reactive
    spectrum handoff. The sensing time is defined as the time used by a SU to scan
    the spectrum and detect the first idle channel. Also, each SU performs spectrum
    sensing every time it attempts to access a channel including the case when a SU
    has just arrived. Upon the arrival of a PU, the SU instantly evacuates the occupied
    channel, i.e., no collision between a SU and a PU can happen as in [21]. The contributions
    of this paper are summarized as follows: A CTMC model of a CRN with reactive-decision
    spectrum handoff is developed. This model, referred to as the “system model” in
    the sequel, describes the interactions of PUs and SUs where PUs exercise preemptive
    priority over SUs. Based on this model, a wide range of performance measures are
    evaluated including the mean SU delay, the SU interruption probability, the SU
    discard probability and the SU blocking probability. A second CTMC model is presented
    that tracks a specific (tagged) SU from the time it enters the system until it
    leaves the system. This model, referred to further as the “tagged secondary user
    model”, allows us to obtain the variance of the SU delay and the mean number of
    interruptions of a SU. It can be used to obtain higher moments of the SU delay
    as well. This paper completes the analysis of [22], where only the system model
    was studied. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sects. 2 and 3
    we describe the system model and the tagged SU model respectively, together with
    the associated SU performance measures. Next, the computation methodology is explained
    in Sect. 4. We provide some numerical examples in Sect. 5. Finally, we draw conclusions
    in Sect. 6. 2 System model 2.1 Model description We consider a radio spectrum
    divided into N frequency bands forming N identical channels, i.e., channels with
    the same radio characteristics. Each channel can be accessed by PUs and SUs. PUs
    and SUs arrive according to a Poisson process with rates \(\lambda _1\) and \(\lambda
    _2\) respectively. Upon arrival, a PU is assigned to a channel not occupied by
    another PU randomly, i.e., no default channel is allocated. The PU transmission
    time is exponentially distributed with rate \(\mu _1\). If all channels are occupied
    by PUs, a new arriving PU is blocked. Arriving SUs enter into a sensing state.
    We assume that a SU senses all channels one by one until it detects the first
    idle channel. This sensing procedure seems reasonable and has been used in [23,
    24]. Also each SU chooses its own sensing order randomly. In this setting, as
    the sensing time can be different for each SU, and in view of analytical tractability,
    we assume it is exponentially distributed with rate \(\sigma \). In case all channels
    are busy, a SU stays in the sensing state until at least one channel is detected
    idle (i.e., not occupied by any PU or other SU). After sensing, a SU enters into
    a transmission state. The SU transmission time is exponentially distributed with
    rate \(\mu _2\). A SU transmission can be interrupted by the arrival of a PU on
    the same channel, and in this case the SU is transferred into the sensing state
    again for retransmission. Thus, and different from [7], the assumptions that a
    default channel is assigned to SUs upon arrival and the interrupted SU has to
    stay on its channel if all the other channels are busy, are relaxed. As in [7,
    9], we assume that no collisions can occur between SUs trying to transmit on the
    same channel. Finally, given that SUs only have the free spectrum gaps not in
    use by PUs at their disposal for transmission, it seems reasonable to consider
    a maximum number of SUs that are allowed to sense the channels. We thus assume
    that the number of sensing SUs is limited to K SUs. The parameter K is referred
    to as the “sensing room size” in the sequel. Arriving and interrupted SUs who
    find already K sensing SUs in the system, are blocked or discarded from the system,
    respectively. In order to analyze this system, we create a CTMC where a state
    x is given as \(x =(x_1,x_2,x_3)\). Here, \(x_1\) is the number of transmitting
    PUs, \(x_2\) is the number of transmitting SUs and \(x_3\) is the number of sensing
    SUs. The finite state space S of the Markov chain contains all states such that
    $$\begin{aligned} x_1+x_2 \le N \text { and } x_3 \le K\,. \end{aligned}$$ (1)
    The row vector \(\pi \) of steady-state probabilities of the CTMC can be computed
    as the solution of the set of balance equations $$\begin{aligned} \pi Q=0\,, \end{aligned}$$
    (2) where Q is the infinitesimal generator of the CTMC, together with the normalization
    condition $$\begin{aligned} \sum \limits _{x \in S} \pi _x = 1 \,, \end{aligned}$$
    (3) where \(\pi _x\) denotes the probability that the system is in state x. In
    view of the above modeling assumptions, the transition rates \(q_{x,y}\) from
    one state x to another state y (\(x\ne y\)) are given as $$\begin{aligned} q_{x,y}
    = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \lambda _1 \frac{N-x_1-x_2}{N-x_1},&{} \text {if
    } y=(x_1+1, x_2,x_3),\\ &{} x_1< \ N,\\ \lambda _1 \frac{x_2}{N-x_1},&{} \text
    {if } y=(x_1+1, x_2-1,x_3+1),\\ &{} x_3< K,\,x_1< N,\\ \lambda _1 \frac{x_2}{N-x_1},&{}
    \text {if } y=(x_1+1, x_2-1,x_3),\\ &{} x_3 = K,\,x_1< N,\\ \lambda _2,&{}\text
    {if } y=(x_1, x_2,x_3+1),\, x_3< \ K,\\ x_1\mu _1,&{}\text {if } y=(x_1-1, x_2,x_3),\\
    x_2\mu _2,&{}\text {if } y=(x_1, x_2-1,x_3),\\ x_3\sigma ,&{}\text {if } y=(x_1,x_2+1,x_3-1),\\
    &{}(x_1+x_2) <N,\\ 0,&{}\text {otherwise}. \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$
    (4) To explain the above equation, we differentiate 8 transition cases. In case
    1, an arriving PU does not interrupt a transmitting SU. The rate \(\lambda _1
    x_2/(N-x_1)\) is the fraction of \(\lambda _1\) where a transmitting SU is interrupted
    by an arriving PU and transferred into the sensing state (case 2) or discarded
    due to lack of sensing room (case 3). An arriving SU starts to sense if there
    is a place in the sensing room (case 4). In cases 5 and 6, a PU and a SU finish
    transmission respectively. In case 7, a SU leaves the sensing state into the transmitting
    state with rate \(x_3\sigma \) if there is at least one idle channel. 2.2 Quasi-birth–death
    structure We show next that the above CTMC has a quasi-birth–death (QBD) structure.
    This allows us to use a specific methodology to efficiently compute steady-state
    probabilities as described later in the computation methodology section. In order
    to display the infinitesimal generator Q of the Markov chain in a QBD format,
    we define the QBD level as the number of sensing SUs \(x_3\), whereas the QBD
    phase corresponds to the pair \((x_1,x_2)\) of transmitting PUs and transmitting
    SUs. The possible phases are ordered lexicographically for \((x_1, x_2)\), i.e.,
    in the order (0, 0), (0, 1),\(\ldots \),(0, N), (1, 0),(1, 1), \(\cdots \),\((1,N-1)\),\(\ldots
    \), (i, 0), (i, 1), \(\ldots \), \((i,N-i)\),\(\ldots ,(N,0)\). In view of the
    transition rates of Eq. (4), the generator matrix Q has the following block structure:
    (5) where the submatrices \(\varLambda , j\varSigma , Q_{j}\) and \(Q_{K}^*\)
    are derived as follows. We let the subscripts i, m, j denote the number of PUs
    \(x_1\), transmitting SUs \(x_2\) and sensing SUs \(x_3\). In the sequel, we also
    use the concept of horizontal \((\sim )\) and vertical (|) matrix concatenation.
    Submatrix \(\varLambda \) then corresponds to transitions where the level is increased
    by 1; these are due either to the interruption of a SU by the arrival of a PU
    (case 2) or the arrival of a new SU (case 4). Matrix \(\varLambda \) is therefore
    given as (6) with as component matrices the diagonal matrix \(\varLambda _{2,i}
    =\lambda _2I\), where I is the identity matrix, and \(I_i\) defined as (7) with
    elements \(\lambda _{i,m}^* = \frac{\lambda _1 m}{N-i}\). Submatrix \(j\varSigma
    \) corresponds to transitions from level j to level \(j-1\) due to a SU moving
    from the sensing to the transmitting state after finding an idle channel (case
    7). Matrix \(\varSigma \) is therefore structured as follows: (8) where \(\varSigma
    _i = (v_1 \sim (\sigma I)) | v_2\), with \(v_1\) a column vector of zeros concatenated
    to the left side of \(\sigma I\) and \(v_2\) a row vector of zeros concatenated
    vertically below \(v_1 \sim (\sigma I)\). The non-diagonal elements in \(Q_j\)
    correspond to transitions where the level j remains unchanged. For \(j<K\), such
    transitions are due to the arrival of a PU without an interruption of a SU (case
    1), the end of a transmission of a PU (case 5) or the end of a transmission of
    a SU (case 6). Matrix \(Q_j\), for \(j<K\), and its components are hence given
    by $$\begin{aligned} Q_j= & {} \begin{bmatrix} \overline{Q_{0,j}}\,&\varLambda
    _{1,0}\, \\ M_{1,1}\,&\overline{Q_{1,j}}\,&\varLambda _{1,1}\, \\&2M_{1,2}\,&\overline{Q_{2,j}}\,&\varLambda
    _{1,2}\, \\&\cdots \,\\&NM_{1,N}\,&\overline{Q_{N,j}}\\ \end{bmatrix}, \end{aligned}$$
    (9) $$\begin{aligned} \varLambda _{1,i}= & {} \begin{bmatrix} \lambda _{i,0}^{**}
    \, \\&\lambda _{i,1}^{**}\, \\&\cdots \,\\&&\lambda _{i,(N-i-1)}^{**} \\&&0\\
    \end{bmatrix}, \end{aligned}$$ (10) $$\begin{aligned} \overline{Q_{i,j}}= & {}
    \begin{bmatrix} s_{i,0,j}\,&\\ \mu _2\,&s_{i,1,j}\, \\&2\mu _2\,&s_{i,2,j}\, \\&\cdots
    \,\\&&(N-i)\mu _2\,&s_{i,N-i,j} \\ \end{bmatrix}, \end{aligned}$$ (11) \(M_{1,i}
    = (\mu _{1}I) \sim v_3\), where a column vector \(v_3\) of zeros is concatenated
    to the right side of \(\mu _{1}I\), and \(\lambda _{i,m}^{**} = \lambda _1 (N-i-m)/(N-i)\).
    The diagonal elements \(s_{i,m,j}\) of the matrix \(\overline{Q_{i,j}}\) are such
    that the row sums in the generator matrix Q equal zero. Their values are given
    in Table 1. A description of the various component matrices is given in Table
    2. Finally, the last diagonal block of Q is defined as \(Q_{K}^* = Q_{K} +\varLambda
    \). This is due to case 3, where SUs can still be interrupted while there are
    already K sensing SUs. Table 1 Diagonal elements of \(\overline{Q_{i,j}}\) Full
    size table Table 2 Component matrices description Full size table 2.3 SU performance
    measures From this system model, we can compute various performance measures,
    which we detail below. All these measures are based on the steady-state row vector
    \(\pi \), which we solve from the set of equations \(\pi Q=0\). We describe in
    Sect. 4 how this can be done in an efficient manner. First, the expected number
    \(E\left[ U_{\text {su2}}\right] \) of transmitting SUs and the expected number
    \(E\left[ U_{\text {su3}}\right] \) of sensing SUs are respectively given by $$\begin{aligned}
    E\left[ U_{\text {su2}}\right]= & {} \sum \limits _{x_3=0}^{K} \sum \limits _{x
    \in S_{x_{3}}} x_2\pi _x \,, \end{aligned}$$ (12) $$\begin{aligned} E\left[ U_{\text
    {su3}}\right]= & {} \sum \limits _{x_3=1}^{K} \sum \limits _{x \in S_{x_{3}}}
    x_3\pi _x \,, \end{aligned}$$ (13) where \(S_{x_{3}}\) is the set of all states
    within level \(x_3\). The blocking probability \(\gamma \) of SUs, i.e., the probability
    that an arriving SU finds a full sensing room, is given as $$\begin{aligned} \gamma
    = \sum \limits _{x \in S_{K}} \pi _x\,. \end{aligned}$$ (14) With these results
    and based on Little’s law, the mean delay \(E\left[ D_{\text {su}}\right] \) of
    a SU is then calculated as $$\begin{aligned} E\left[ D_{\text {su}}\right] = \frac{
    E\left[ U_{\text {su2}}\right] + E\left[ U_{\text {su3}}\right] }{\lambda _2 (1
    - \gamma )}\,. \end{aligned}$$ (15) Next, the SU interruption probability \(\alpha
    \), i.e., the probability that a transmitting SU is interrupted upon arrival of
    a PU, is given as follows: $$\begin{aligned} \alpha = \sum \limits _{x_3=0}^{K}\sum
    \limits _{x\in S_{x_3}^{*}} \pi _x\frac{ \lambda _1 x_2/(N-x_1)}{D_1(x)} \,, \end{aligned}$$
    (16) where \(\lambda _1 x_2/(N-x_1)\) is the transition rate from state x where
    a SU gets interrupted due to a PU arrival, \(D_1(x)\) denotes the total transition
    rate from state x, which is given by $$\begin{aligned} D_1(x) ={\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
    x_1\mu _1+x_2\mu _2+ \lambda _1+\lambda _2,\\ \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \text
    {if } x_3< K,\, x_1+x_2 = N,\\ x_1\mu _1+x_2\mu _2+ \lambda _1+\lambda _2 +x_3
    \sigma ,\\ \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \text {if } x_3< K, \, x_1+x_2< N,\\
    x_1\mu _1+x_2\mu _2+\lambda _1,\\ \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \text {if } x_3
    = K, \, x_1+x_2 = N, \\ x_1\mu _1+x_2\mu _2+\lambda _1+x_3 \sigma ,\\ \quad \quad
    \quad \quad \quad \text {if } x_3 = K,\, x_1+x_2 < N, \\ \end{array}\right. }
    \end{aligned}$$ (17) and \(S_{x_3}^{*} = S_{x_3}\setminus \{(N,0,x_3)\}\) denotes
    the set of all states within level \(x_3\) except the state where \(x_1=N\). Note
    that since in the latter state all N channels are occupied by PUs, there are no
    transmitting SUs to interrupt and a new PU is always blocked. Similarly, the SU
    discard probability \(\beta \), i.e., the probability that a transmitting SU is
    interrupted and discarded upon arrival of a PU because of a full sensing room,
    is computed as $$\begin{aligned} \beta = \sum \limits _{x\in S_{K}^{*}} \pi _x\frac{
    \lambda _1 x_2/(N-x_1)}{D_2(x)} \,, \end{aligned}$$ (18) where $$\begin{aligned}
    D_2(x) ={\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} x_1\mu _1+x_2\mu _2+ \lambda _1,\\ \quad \quad
    \quad \quad \quad \text {if }x_1+x_2 = N,\\ x_1\mu _1+x_2\mu _2+ \lambda _1+x_3\sigma
    ,\\ \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \text {if } x_1+x_2 < N.\\ \end{array}\right.
    } \end{aligned}$$ (19) 3 Tagged secondary user model 3.1 Model description In
    order to further study the system, we use the tagged user approach [25, 26], where
    a typical user is analyzed while passing through a queueing system. This approach
    allows us to consider various performance measures pertaining to the expected
    life time of a single user. To wit, we construct a CTMC that tracks an arbitrary
    SU throughout its lifetime. As this SU will eventually leave the system, this
    will necessarily be an absorbing Markov chain. The absorbing state of the Markov
    chain, denoted by state o, models the exit of the tagged SU, and all the other
    states are transient. In terms of the transient states, we need to keep track
    of the number of PUs, transmitting SUs and sensing SUs as before [denoted as \((x_1,x_2,x_3)\)],
    but we also need to keep track of whether the tagged SU is transmitting or sensing.
    To this end, we introduce a new state variable \(x_4\) that takes the values 0
    or 1, indicating that the tagged SU is sensing or transmitting respectively. We
    now construct the infinitesimal generator \(Q_o\) of the absorbing Markov chain,
    which is represented as follows: $$\begin{aligned} Q_o = \begin{pmatrix} Q^* &{}
    q^* \\ \mathbf {0}&{} 0 \end{pmatrix}, \end{aligned}$$ (20) where \(Q^*\) is the
    infinitesimal subgenerator corresponding to the transient states, \(q^*\) is a
    column vector with rates of transition from transient states to the absorbing
    state and 0 is a row vector of zeros. The transition rates \(q_{x,y}\) from one
    transient state x to another transient state y (\(x\ne y\)) are then given by
    $$\begin{aligned} q_{x,y} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \lambda _1 \frac{N-x_1-x_2}{N-x_1},\quad
    \text {if } y=(x_1+1, x_2,x_3, x_4),\\ \quad \quad \quad x_1< \ N,\\ \lambda _1
    \frac{x_2-1}{N-x_1},\\ \quad \quad \quad \text {if } y=(x_1+1,x_2-1,x_3+1,x_4),\\
    \quad \quad \quad x_3< K,\, x_4=1,\, x_1< N,\\ \lambda _1 \frac{x_2-1}{N-x_1},\quad
    \text {if } y=(x_1+1,x_2-1,x_3,x_4),\\ \quad \quad \quad x_3 = K,\, x_4=1,\, x_1<
    N,\\ \lambda _1 \frac{x_2}{N-x_1},\\ \quad \quad \quad \text {if }y=(x_1+1, x_2-1,
    x_3+1,x_4),\\ \quad \quad \quad x_3< K,\,x_4=0,\,x_1< N,\\ \lambda _1 \frac{x_2}{N-x_1},\quad
    \text {if }y=(x_1+1,x_2-1,x_3,x_4),\\ \quad \quad \quad x_3 = K,\, x_4=0,\, x_1<
    N,\\ \frac{\lambda _1}{N-x_1},\\ \quad \quad \quad \text {if } y=(x_1+1,x_2-1,x_3+1,x_4-1),\\
    \quad \quad \quad x_1< N,\, x_4 =1,\, x_3< K,\\ \lambda _2,\quad \text {if } y=(x_1,
    x_2,x_3+1,x_4),\,x_3< \ K,\\ x_1\mu _1,\quad \text {if } y=(x_1-1, x_2,x_3,x_4),\\
    (x_2-1)\mu _2,\quad \text {if } y=(x_1, x_2-1,x_3,x_4),\\ \quad \quad \quad x_2>
    0,\,x_4=1,\\ x_2\mu _2,\quad \text {if } y=(x_1, x_2-1,x_3,x_4),\,x_4=0,\\ x_3\sigma
    ,\quad \text {if } y=(x_1,x_2+1,x_3-1,x_4),\\ \quad \quad \quad x_1+x_2<N,\, x_4=1,\\
    (x_3-1)\sigma ,\quad \text {if }y=(x_1,x_2+1,x_3-1,x_4),\\ \quad \quad \quad x_1+x_2<N,\,
    x_4=0,\, x_3> 0,\\ \sigma ,\quad \text {if } y=(x_1,x_2+1,x_3-1,x_4+1),\\ \quad
    \quad \quad x_1+x_2 <N,\,x_4=0,\, x_3 >0,\\ 0,\quad \text {otherwise}. \end{array}\right.
    } \end{aligned}$$ (21) This equation is used to construct the infinitesimal subgenerator
    \(Q^*\) where the transitions to the absorbing state o are left out. The latter
    transitions correspond to transmission completion of the tagged SU and the tagged
    SU getting interrupted and discarded from the system because of the arrival of
    a PU and the lack of sensing room. Therefore, the transition rate from a transient
    state x to the absorbing state o is given by $$\begin{aligned} q_{x,o} = {\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll} \mu _2, \quad \text {if } x_2 \ge 1,\, x_3 < K,\,x_4 =1,\\ \mu
    _2+ \frac{\lambda _1}{N-x_1}, \quad \text {if } x_2 \ge 1,\, x_3 = K,\, x_4=1,\\
    0, \quad \text {otherwise}. \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$ (22) The final
    ingredient of the tagged user approach is the initial distribution \(\pi ^*\)
    under which the tagged SU enters the system and the absorbing Markov chain is
    started. Due to the PASTA property [27], we have that this distribution is essentially
    the same as the steady-state distribution of the model from the previous section,
    taking into account that (1) the tagged user starts in sensing mode \(x_4=0\);
    (2) we must count the tagged user as well, hence we should increase \(x_3\) by
    one. The vector \(\pi ^*\) is obtained by first computing \(\pi \) while leaving
    room for one sensing user in the system. Then \(\pi \) is mapped into \(\pi ^*\),
    where the steady-state probabilities corresponding to the tagged SU being in the
    transmitting state equal zero. Finally, \(\pi ^*\) is shifted one level down.
    3.2 SU performance measures The fundamental matrix (see e.g., Chap. 3 of Kemeny
    and Snell’s classical book [28]) \(F=(-Q^*)^{-1}\) of the absorbing Markov chain
    is the central object from which many performance measures of interest can be
    obtained. Recall that the element \(F_{xy}\) of the fundamental matrix F denotes
    the average time before absorption that the CTMC spends in transient state y provided
    that the Markov chain starts from transient state x. Thus, the mean time that
    the tagged SU spends in the system, i.e., the mean SU delay, is given by the matrix
    expression: $$\begin{aligned} E\left[ D_{\text {su}}\right] = \pi ^* F \mathbf{1},
    \end{aligned}$$ (23) where \(\mathbf 1\) is a column vector of ones. Note that
    by Little’s law, \(E\left[ D_{\text {su}}\right] \) could also be computed from
    the system model in Sect. 2 [Eq. (15)], but if nothing else this can serve as
    a point of reference. Likewise, the variance of the SU delay is given by $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathrm {var}\left[ D_{\text {su}}\right] = 2 \pi ^* F^2 \mathbf{1} - E\left[
    D_{\text {su}}\right] ^2. \end{aligned}$$ (24) Another performance measure of
    interest is the mean number of interruptions that the tagged SU experiences. For
    this we need to find an expression for the mean number of times a particular transition
    from state x to state y is performed. Note that if the random variable \(T_x\)
    denotes the time spent in state x before absorption, the number of transitions
    from x to y is Poisson distributed with random parameter \(q_{x,y} T_x\). The
    mean number of transitions from x to y is thus \(q_{x,y} E\left[ T_x\right] =
    q_{x,y} [\pi ^* F]_x\). In order to get the mean number of interruptions, we must
    sum this expression over all transitions that cause the SU to be sent back to
    sensing mode. If we call this set of transitions \(\mathcal{I}\), the mean number
    of interruptions a SU experiences is given by $$\begin{aligned} E\left[ N_{\text
    {int}}\right] = \sum _{(x,y)\in \mathcal{I}} q_{x,y} [\pi ^* F]_x. \end{aligned}$$
    (25) It is clear (as state variables only increase or decrease by one) that this
    new CTMC also has the block-tridiagonal QBD structure which aids the efficient
    computation of performance measures (as detailed in the next section). Also, for
    the various performance measures we never need to compute the entire matrix F,
    but rather we can suffice solving systems of equations of the form \(v Q^* =\nu
    \), for some vector \(\nu \). 4 Computation methodology Here we show how to solve
    the equations \(\pi Q =0\) and \(v Q^* =\nu \) for CTMCs with QBD structure. We
    solve the first equation for the system model and the second for the tagged secondary
    user model. Note that the methods described in this section are largely existing
    techniques (this holds especially true for the first case), which we nevertheless
    include so as to keep the paper self-contained. Also, in this way we can more
    carefully describe the more rarely-encountered second case. The algorithm is essentially
    a block-structured lower upper (LU) decomposition as described in the classic
    [29], while the algorithm to compute the equilibrium probabilities (essentially
    the first case) was detailed in [30, 31]. 4.1 Case \(\pi Q =0\) To obtain the
    stationary probability vector \(\pi \) for the system model, we employ the Gaussian
    elimination technique and the concept of censored Markov chains applied to a block-structured
    tridiagonal QBD using a similar approach as in [32]. To illustrate the major steps
    of the technique, let a CTMC X(t) have the following generator matrix: $$\begin{aligned}
    Q = \begin{bmatrix} L_0&F_0 \\ B_1&L_1&F_1 \\&B_2&L_2&F_2 \\&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots
    \\&&B_{n-1}&L_{n-1}&F_{n-1} \\&&B_n&L_n \end{bmatrix}. \end{aligned}$$ (26) Let
    \(L^u_1 = L_1 - B_1 L_0\in v F_0\) be the Schur complement of \(L_0\) in Q. Let
    \(Q^{i\rightarrow n}\) denote the generator matrix of the Markov chain censored
    to the levels i to n, and let \(\pi _{i\rightarrow n}\) be the corresponding (partial)
    distribution. We apply Schur complementation level by level: first eliminating
    level 0, then level 1, etc. For example, eliminating the level 0 results in $$\begin{aligned}
    Q^{1\rightarrow n} = \begin{bmatrix} L^u_1&F_1 \\ B_2&L_2&F_2 \\&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots
    \\&B_{n-1}&L_{n-1}&F_{n-1} \\&&B_n&L_n \end{bmatrix}. \end{aligned}$$ (27) We
    keep folding up the state space in this manner: $$\begin{aligned} Q^{i\rightarrow
    n} = \begin{bmatrix} L^u_i&F_i \\ B_{i+1}&L_{i+1}&F_{i+1} \\&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots
    \\&B_{n-1}&L_{n-1}&F_{n-1} \\&&B_n&L_n \end{bmatrix}, \end{aligned}$$ (28) where
    \(L^u_i\) is recursively given as $$\begin{aligned} L^u_i = L_i - B_i {L^u_{i-1}}^{-1}
    F_{i-1}\,. \end{aligned}$$ (29) We end up with \(Q^{n\rightarrow n} = L^u_n\).
    We then find the stationary solution by proceeding in a backwards fashion. We
    have that \(\pi _n L^u_n = 0\), and recursively from the first block row of equation
    \(\pi _{i\rightarrow n} Q^{i\rightarrow n} = 0\), $$\begin{aligned} \pi _i L^u_i
    + \pi _{i+1} B_{i+1} = 0. \end{aligned}$$ (30) Finally, we normalize the obtained
    stationary probability vectors \(\pi _i\) corresponding to level i using \(\sum
    _{i=0}^n \pi _i\) 1. This leads to the steady-state vector \(\pi \): $$\begin{aligned}
    \pi = \frac{1}{\sum _{i=0}^n \pi _i \mathbf 1} \begin{bmatrix} \pi _0&\pi _1&\ldots&\pi
    _n\end{bmatrix}. \end{aligned}$$ (31) 4.2 Case \(v Q^* =\nu \) We solve this equation
    for v in the context of the tagged SU model to obtain the variance of the SU delay
    and the number of interruptions of a SU. Here \(Q^*\) is the infinitesimal subgenerator
    defined in Sect. 3. We use the same solution technique described above with the
    following modifications. Along with computing \(L^u_i\), we compute a modified
    steady-state probability vector as \(\nu ^{u}_i= \nu _i - \nu ^{u}_{i-1} {L^u_{i-1}}^{-1}
    F_{i-1}\), where \(\nu ^{u}_0 = \nu _0\). Then, for level n, we solve the following
    equation for \(v_n\): \(v_n L^u_n = \nu ^u_n\). Finally, we compute recursively
    the following equation for \(v_i\): $$\begin{aligned} v_i L^u_i + v_{i+1} B_{i+1}
    = \nu ^{u}_i. \end{aligned}$$ (32) 5 Numerical results and discussion In this
    section, we present some numerical examples in order to investigate the SU performance.
    We consider a cognitive radio system with \(N = 20\) channels. The average transmission
    time for both PUs and SUs equals \(1/\mu _1=1/\mu _2=10\) ms. The offered PU load
    \(\rho _{\text {pu}}\) and the offered SU load \(\rho _{\text {su}}\) are defined
    as \(\lambda _1/(N\mu _1)\) and \(\lambda _2/(N\mu _2)\) respectively. We consider
    the case where \(\rho _{\text {pu}}=0.3\), as CRNs are expected to operate under
    light PU load. Of particular interest is the effect of the maximum number of sensing
    SUs K and the sensing rate \(\sigma \) of SUs on the performance measures derived
    above. Fig. 1 SU blocking probability \(\gamma \) versus \(\sigma \) \((\mathrm{s}^{-1})\),
    for \(\rho _{\text {pu}} = 0.3\), \(\rho _{\text {su}} = 0.5\), \(N=20\), \(1/\mu
    _1=1/\mu _2 =10\ \)ms and various values of K Full size image Figure 1 shows the
    SU blocking probability \(\gamma \) as a function of the sensing rate \(\sigma
    \) \((\text {in }\mathrm{s}^{-1})\), for \(\rho _{\text {su}}=0.5\) and various
    values of K. We observe from this figure that the blocking probability decreases
    as K increases, which is intuitively clear since \(\rho _{\text {pu}}\) and \(\rho
    _{\text {su}}\) are fixed and for increasing K more SUs are allowed to enter the
    sensing state and hence less SUs are blocked. The probability \(\gamma \) also
    decreases as the sensing rate \(\sigma \) increases. For high K eventually almost
    no SUs are blocked, as expected. Fig. 2 SU interruption probability \(\alpha \)
    versus \(\sigma \) \((\mathrm{s}^{-1})\), for \(\rho _{\text {pu}} = 0.3\), \(\rho
    _{\text {su}} = 0.5\), \(N=20\), \(1/\mu _1=1/\mu _2 =10\ \)ms and various values
    of K Full size image In Fig. 2, the SU interruption probability \(\alpha \) is
    plotted as a function of \(\sigma \) \((\text {in }\mathrm{s}^{-1})\), for \(\rho
    _{\text {su}}=0.5\) and various values of K. For an increasing maximum number
    of sensing users K, we observe an increase of the SU interruption probability.
    This is because an increase of K will increase the number of SUs that can access
    the system, and hence (for a given \(\sigma \)) also the number of transmitting
    SUs increases, so more SUs can get interrupted by a PU. For higher \(\sigma \),
    sensing SUs enter the transmitting state at a higher rate and get interrupted
    even more likely. Also we notice that the interruption probability converges to
    the same value for different \(\sigma \) as K increases. Fig. 3 SU discard probability
    \(\beta \) versus \(\sigma \) \((\mathrm{s}^{-1})\), for \(\rho _{\text {pu}}
    = 0.3\), \(\rho _{\text {su}} = 0.5\), \(N=20\), \(1/\mu _1=1/\mu _2 =10\ \)ms
    and various values of K Full size image In Fig. 3, the SU discard probability
    \(\beta \) is shown as a function of the sensing rate \(\sigma \) \((\text {in
    }\mathrm{s}^{-1})\), again for \(\rho _{\text {su}}=0.5\) and various values of
    K. From this figure it can be seen that especially for low values of \(\sigma
    \) the SU discard probability first increases and then decreases with increasing
    K. This observation can be explained intuitively in a similar way as before. For
    low values of K, an increase of K means that more SUs can get interrupted by a
    PU, while the probability that an interrupted SU finds a full sensing room still
    remains high. For high K, however, it is more likely that an interrupted SU will
    be able to sense again instead of being discarded and therefore \(\beta \) decreases
    with increasing K until eventually no interrupted SUs are discarded. Similarly,
    it is also clear that for a given K the probability \(\beta \) increases and then
    decreases as \(\sigma \) increases. For higher values of K, this behavior is repeated
    over a smaller range of \(\sigma \) and clearly the maximum discard probability
    is not affected. Comparing Figs. 2 and 3 we see that there is convergence of \(\alpha
    \) upwards values of K and \(\sigma \) for which \(\beta \) approaches zero. Fig.
    4 Mean SU delay \(E\left[ D_{\text {su}}\right] \) (s) versus K, for \(\rho _{\text
    {pu}} = 0.3\), \(\rho _{\text {su}} = 0.5\), \(N=20\), \(1/\mu _1=1/\mu _2 =10\
    \)ms and various values of \(t=\sigma /\mu _2\) Full size image Figure 4 shows
    the mean SU delay \(E\left[ D_{\text {su}}\right] \) (in s) as a function of the
    sensing room size K, for \(\rho _{\text {su}}=0.5\) and various values of the
    sensing rate normalized to the SU average transmission rate, i.e., various values
    of \(t=\sigma /\mu _2\). For increasing K, the mean SU delay linearly increases
    until it reaches some convergence point. Afterwards, a further increase of the
    maximum number of sensing SUs will not affect the mean SU delay. This convergence
    is fully in accordance with the observations in Figs. 2 and 3. Also we notice
    the strong effect of \(\sigma \) on the mean SU delay. Increasing the mean sensing
    time \(1/\sigma \) over the given range, we see that the mean delay doubles and
    sometimes triples. Fig. 5 Variance of SU delay \(\mathrm {var}\left[ D_{\text
    {su}}\right] \) (s\(^2\)) versus K, for \(\rho _{\text {pu}} = 0.3\), \(\rho _{\text
    {su}} = 0.5\), \(N=20\), \(1/\mu _1=1/\mu _2 =10\ \)ms and various values of \(t=\sigma
    /\mu _2\) Full size image The corresponding curves for the variance \(\mathrm
    {var}\left[ D_{\text {su}}\right] \) (in s\(^2\)) of the SU delay are presented
    in Fig. 5. As expected for M/M/c like queueing systems, the variance has a similar
    behavior as the mean SU delay. Fig. 6 SU blocking probability \(\gamma \) versus
    K, for \(\rho _{\text {pu}} = 0.3\), \(N=20\), \(1/\sigma =100\) ms, \(1/\mu _1=1/\mu
    _2 =10\ \)ms and various values of \(\lambda _2\) Full size image Fig. 7 SU interruption
    probability \(\alpha \) versus K, for \(\rho _{\text {pu}} = 0.3\), \(N=20\),
    \(1/\sigma =100 \ \)ms, \(1/\mu _1=1/\mu _2 =10\ \)ms and various values of \(\lambda
    _2\) Full size image Fig. 8 SU discard probability \(\beta \) versus K, for \(\rho
    _{\text {pu}} = 0.3\), \(N=20\), \(1/\sigma =100 \ \)ms, \(1/\mu _1=1/\mu _2 =10\
    \)ms and various values of \(\lambda _2\) Full size image In Figs. 6, 7 and 8,
    the SU blocking probability \(\gamma \), the SU interruption probability \(\alpha
    \) and the SU discard probability \(\beta \), respectively, are plotted versus
    the maximum number of sensing SUs K, for \(1/\sigma =100 \ \)ms and various values
    of the SU arrival rate \(\lambda _2\). We again see that for increasing values
    of K (and given values of \(\lambda _2\) and \(\sigma \)) the probability \(\gamma
    \) decreases, the probability \(\alpha \) increases and the probability \(\beta
    \) first increases and then decreases, as explained before. Also, we see that
    the probabilities \(\gamma \), \(\alpha \) and \(\beta \) all increase as \(\lambda
    _2\) increases. Fig. 9 Mean SU delay \(E\left[ D_{\text {su}}\right] \) (s) versus
    \(\lambda _2\) \((\mathrm{s}^{-1})\), for \(K = 200\), \(\rho _{\text {pu}} =
    0.3\), \(N=20\), \(1/\mu _1=10\ \)ms and various values of \(\mu _2\) and \(\sigma
    \): (\(1/\mu _2 =1/\sigma =100\ \)ms), (\(1/\mu _2=50\ \)ms, \(1/\sigma =150\
    \)ms) Full size image Next, we consider a cognitive radio system with a fixed
    maximum number of sensing SUs \(K = 200\) and different values of the average
    SU transmission time and the average SU sensing time such that the sum of both
    times is \(200\ \)ms. As before, there are \(N=20\) channels, \(\rho _{\text {pu}}
    = 0.3\) and \(1/\mu _1=10\ \)ms. Figure 9 shows the mean SU delay (in s) as a
    function of the SU arrival rate \(\lambda _2\) \((\text {in }\mathrm{s}^{-1})\).
    This plot can be divided into two parts. In the first part, for an increasing
    SU arrival rate \(\lambda _2\) the mean SU delay increases as the number of SUs
    (sensing and transmitting) increases. In this part, no SUs are discarded from
    the system as the sensing room is not full yet. In the second part, the sensing
    room is almost full and an increase of \(\lambda _2\) increases the probability
    that a SU is discarded from the system before successful completion and consequently
    decreases the time the SU spends in the system. Fig. 10 Mean number of SU interruptions
    \(E\left[ N_{\text {int}}\right] \) versus \(\lambda _2\) \((\mathrm{s}^{-1})\),
    for \(K = 200\), \(\rho _{\text {pu}} = 0.3\), \(N=20\), \(1/\mu _1=10\ \)ms and
    various values of \(\mu _2\) and \(\sigma \): (\(1/\mu _2 =1/\sigma =100\ \)ms),
    (\(1/\mu _2=50\ \)ms, \(1/\sigma =150\ \)ms) Full size image Finally, in Fig.
    10, the mean number of interruptions \(E\left[ N_{\text {int}}\right] \) of a
    typical (tagged) SU before exiting the system is plotted versus \(\lambda _2\)
    \((\text {in }\mathrm{s}^{-1})\), for the same set of parameters as in Fig. 9.
    Likewise, this plot can be divided into two parts. In the first part, the mean
    number of SU interruptions is almost constant as it does not depend on the SU
    arrival rate when no SUs are discarded. In the second part, for higher \(\lambda
    _2\), the mean number of SU interruptions decreases as more SUs get discarded
    from the system before completion. The effect of the sensing time on the mean
    number of SU interruptions has been investigated. The results indicate that the
    sensing time has a small effect on the mean number of SU interruptions. When increasing
    the mean sensing time \(1/\sigma \) in the range between \(5\ \) and \(100\ \)ms,
    for a SU transmission time \(1/\mu _2=100\ \)ms, we observe a decrease of the
    mean number of SU interruptions of less than 10%. This decrease is due to the
    higher probability that a SU is discarded from the system. For \(1/\sigma > 100\
    \)ms, the mean number of SU interruptions decreases further but preserves the
    same behavior. Also, an increase of K between 20 and 500 seems not to affect the
    maximum value of the mean number of SU interruptions and again this measure keeps
    the same behavior. 6 Conclusions In this paper, we investigated the impact of
    different parameters on SU performance measures in a CRN using finite quasi-birth–death
    CTMCs. It has been shown that an increase of the sensing rate \(\sigma \) increases
    the SU interruption probability, but considerably reduces the mean and variance
    of the SU delay. Also, the sensing time has a small effect on the mean number
    of SU interruptions. Future work will focus on further refining the presented
    models, taking into account e.g., the dependence of the sensing time on the number
    of idle channels. References Liang, Y.-C., Chen, K.-C., Li, G. Y., & Mähönen,

    Get rights and content Abstract Spectrum handoff occurs when the primary users
    appear in the licensed spectrum temporarily occupied by the secondary users and
    aims to help the secondary users to vacate the spectrum rapidly and to resume
    transmission on new selected available channels. However, a spectrum handoff policy
    that comprehensively considers spectrum sensing, target channel selection as well
    as spectrum estimation has yet to be developed. In this paper we present a sequential
    sensing based spectrum handoff policy for multiple-user cognitive radio networks.
    First, we select the appropriate candidate channels for each secondary user, then
    their associated optimal sensing order together with the best target handoff channel
    is determined through sequential sensing based on Dynamic Programming (DP). Note
    that many spectrum handoff will occur during one secondary user transmission and
    our objective is to minimize the total number of spectrum handoff. The sequential
    sensing based spectrum handoff policy is evaluated through a comprehensive simulation
    study. The results reveal significant improvements in the system performance by
    reducing the number of spectrum handoff over conventional approaches. Moreover,
    our proposed DP method can significantly lower the computational complexity compared
    to exhaustive search and common DP (performing sequential sensing over all the
    channels in the system using Dynamic Programming). Previous article in issue Next

    radio 1. Introduction The rapid growth of wireless technologies has led to a dramatic
    increase in demand for spectrum. However, according to a report by Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC), most of the allocated spectrum is significantly under-utilized
    [1] [2] due to the inefficient fixed spectrum allocation policy. Cognitive radio
    is an emerging technique to mitigate the spectrum scarcity by allowing the secondary
    users to temporarily utilize the licensed spectrum unoccupied by the primary user
    [3] [4]. Due to the high priority of the primary user, the secondary user is required
    to vacate the occupied channel when the primary user appears and determine a new
    suitable channel to resume its unfinished transmission. This process is referred
    to as spectrum handoff. Compared with other major functionalities: spectrum sensing,
    spectrum decision and spectrum sharing, spectrum handoff is less well explored
    in the research community. In general, the spectrum handoff can be categorized
    into two types [5]: (1) Proactive spectrum handoff which decides the target channel
    before the interruption occurs according to the long term traffic statistics [6],
    [7], [8]. (2) Reactive spectrum handoff which selects the target channel when
    it is required via spectrum sensing [9], [10]. One issue related to proactive
    spectrum handoff is that the preselected channel may be no longer available at
    the moment that spectrum handoff is initiated. While for reactive spectrum handoff,
    additional time is required for spectrum sensing to search an idle channel, which
    results in an increase in handoff delay. In our paper, we propose a spectrum handoff
    mechanism which can reliably determine an idle target channel through sequential
    spectrum sensing. This mechanism can help to resolve the obsolescent channel issue
    in proactive spectrum sensing handoff where the preselected channel may no longer
    be available. On the other hand, our spectrum sensing handoff is triggered when
    the residual idle time (which is defined as the duration from the time instant
    that the channel is detected to be idle and able to be utilized by the secondary
    user until the time instant that the interrupting event occurs and a spectrum
    handoff is required) of the current utilized channel reaches a threshold. By doing
    so, spectrum sensing and spectrum analysis can be overlapped with the ongoing
    transmission. As a consequence, the high handoff delay occurring in the reactive
    spectrum handoff can be addressed. Compared with other work on spectrum handoff
    where the secondary user greedily selects the target channel which either results
    in minimum transmission latency [11], [12], [13] or has the highest probability
    of being idle [17], in our paper, we choose the target channel with maximum residual
    idle time as our overall objective to reduce the number of spectrum handoff as
    much as possible. To implement a better spectrum handoff in the event of primary
    user activity with seamless communication, wideband sensing is essential for designing
    a maximally effective cognitive network. It can detect multiple opportunities
    and enable the choice of the best available channel. However, the literature of
    wideband spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks is very limited. In [33],
    sequential sensing is introduced, in which a wideband radio channel is sensed
    using tunable narrowband bandpss filter at the RF front-end to sense one narrow
    frequency band at a time. There have also been studies on sensing different frequency
    bands simultaneously. In [34], multiband joint detection approach is proposed
    where the wideband channel is divided into K non-overlapping narrow subbands.
    In [35], an optimal algorithm is presented for wideband spectrum sensing with
    the aim of maximizing the achievable throughput of the secondary user while keeping
    the interference with the primary network bounded to a reasonably low level. One
    important issue related to wideband spectrum sensing is the optimal sensing order
    problem. Most prior work on sensing order issue [14], [15], [16] only considers
    single user or two-user scenario. In [14], the channel sensing problem is formulated
    as an optimal stopping rule problem and it is shown that the optimal sensing order
    does exist in some special scenarios for single user case. In [16], the authors
    extend the sensing order issue to two-user multi-channel case. The problem is
    still open for multiple secondary users case. In [17], [18], the authors propose
    the spectrum switching algorithm according to descending order of channel idle
    probability. When primary user appears on the current operating channel, the secondary
    user must vacate the channel immediately and resume its transmission on the channel
    which has the highest idle probability. This approach has proven that the spectrum
    switching delay can be significantly reduced. However, if multiple secondary users
    perform spectrum sensing at the same time, switching channel according to the
    descending order of channel idle probability may no longer be optimal, since these
    selections will cause collisions among secondary users. Recently, study on the
    optimization of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio network has attracted a lot
    of attention. There are two approaches that are commonly used to schedule the
    spectrum sensing [15]. The first one is periodic spectrum sensing [19], [20],
    [21], [22], in which the secondary users perform spectrum sensing at the beginning
    of each frame and transmit if the channel is detected as idle. Otherwise, the
    secondary users have to wait until the next frame. The other approach is sequential
    spectrum sensing [15], [16], [23]. In this case, spectrum is searched by sensing
    the channels one by one until an idle channel with satisfied quality is detected.
    This approach allows secondary users to explore diversity in the licensed spectrum.
    Hence, in the case that one channel is sensed to be busy, the secondary user can
    quickly continue to sense the next spectrum opportunity without waiting until
    the next frame as in the case of periodic sensing. Obviously, sequential sensing
    can have better performance than periodic sensing. Currently, the spectrum sensing
    techniques can be mainly classified into matched filter, covariance matrix based
    detection, cyclostationary feature detection and energy detection [36], each has
    its own disadvantages and advantages. Matched filter requires perfect knowledge
    of the PUs’ signaling features such as operating frequency, modulation type and
    order, which is not practised in reality. Cyclostationarity feature detection
    not only requires a priori knowledge of the signal characteristics, but also needs
    a much longer sensing duration for a channel which may be more than 20 ms [37].
    Comparing with them, energy detection is the most common way of spectrum sensing
    due to its low computational and implementation complexity and less sensing time.
    In our paper, each secondary user may sequentially perform sensing up to N channels
    in a slot. Thus, a short sensing duration is reasonable. Due to the above reasons,
    the energy detection based sequential sensing is of our concern in this paper.
    We propose a sequential sensing based spectrum handoff scheme to determine the
    optimal sensing order as well as the best target handoff channel for each secondary
    user in a multiple-user cognitive network using DP. Whenever a secondary user
    needs to switch channel, it must perform sequential sensing to discover a new
    opportunity with minimum delay so that the secondary user in the network can resume
    its communication quickly. However, one has to account for the fact that finding
    the optimal sensing order as well as the best target channel has huge computational
    complexity. To address this problem, instead of performing sequential sensing
    over all the channels in the network, we select candidate channels for each secondary
    user, which analyzes the tradeoff among the three key characteristics: (1) keep
    the probability of detecting at least one idle channel high; (2) reduce the sensing
    overhead and computational complexity as much as possible; and (3) avoid collision
    with other secondary users. Therefore, each secondary user only scans its associated
    candidate channels every time when the spectrum handoff is triggered. It is shown
    that the computational complexity is significantly reduced while the system performance
    is maintained. The contributions and significance of this paper are listed as
    follows: (1) Instead of only considering single user or two users in a network,
    we consider multiple secondary users contending the spectrum for handoff. For
    the case of single user, it is shown that sensing the channels according to the
    descending order of primary-free probability is optimal. However, when multiple
    users are investigated, some factors e.g., activities of primary users and contention
    among secondary users, will together affect the optimal sensing order. We propose
    a sequential sensing based spectrum handoff for multiple-user cognitive radio
    networks. By overlapping the spectrum sensing and spectrum analysis with the ongoing
    transmission, the high handoff delay can be reduced, while the optimal sensing
    order as well as a reliable target channel with maximal residual idle time can
    be found. (2) Although DP search can be used to find the optimal sensing order
    as well as the best target channel for each secondary user, it incurs huge complexity.
    We determine candidate channels for sequential sensing, which exploits the tradeoff
    between the spectrum opportunity and sensing overhead and computational complexity.
    It is shown that the system performance is maintained while the computational
    complexity is significantly reduced. (3) To evaluate our proposed sequential sensing
    based spectrum handoff strategy, a comparison with conventional sequential sensing
    CSS [25] is conducted. Simulation results show that our proposed strategy outperforms
    CSS due to the fact that the optimal target handoff channel is selected, which
    results in a reduction in the number of spectrum handoff. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows. The system model is introduced in Section 2. The key
    part: the detailed design of our proposed sequential sensing based spectrum handoff
    strategy is elaborated in Section 3, in which a dynamic programming method is
    proposed to determine the optimal sensing order as well as the best target handoff
    channel with maximal residual idle time for each secondary user. The effect of
    error rate is evaluated in Section 4. Simulation results and evaluation are given
    in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. 2. System model We consider
    a cognitive radio network consisting of M secondary users and N channels (primary
    users), with channel indices (1, 2, … , N). The primary users are licensed holders
    and thus have absolute priority to interrupt the transmission of secondary user.
    On the other hand, the secondary user can only utilize the channel opportunistically,
    and as soon as a primary user is detected, the secondary user is forced to vacate
    the occupied channel. Thus spectrum handoff is initiated when the primary user
    appears at its licensed channel, in this case the secondary user needs to determine
    a suitable target channel to resume its unfinished transmission. The target spectrum
    handoff channel is a key issue. Each secondary user has its own sensing order,
    i.e. (i1, i2, … , iN) for secondary user i, which is a permutation of (1, 2, …
    , N). Whenever a spectrum handoff is required, the secondary user will perform
    sequential sensing according to its sensing order to determine the best target
    channel with maximal residual idle time, then resume its unfinished transmission
    on it, as shown in Fig. 1. The residual idle time of the channel ik, denoted as
    is shown in Fig. 1. Obviously, frequent channel handoff (small ) can degrade the
    system performance. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The sequential
    spectrum sensing to determine the optimal target handoff channel with largest
    residual idle time . In our paper, following the definition in [16], the primary-free
    probability of a channel indicates that the channel is not occupied by the primary
    user, and the free probability of a channel indicates that the channel is occupied
    by neither the primary nor the secondary user. Experimental results in [22], [27],
    [28], [29] indicate that modeling the traffic of WLAN users as a continuous-time
    semi-Markov process is shown to be a good approximation. Therefore, in our paper,
    the primary user’s traffic on the channel is assumed to follow a continuous time
    Markov chain with two states: idle (OFF) and busy (ON) states. The time periods
    for ON and OFF states of primary traffic follow exponential distributions with
    expected values Ton and Toff, respectively [22] [27], [28], [29]. For each channel
    j, 1 ⩽ j ⩽ N, we model the ON period as a random process with probability density
    function . Similarly, the probability density function of OFF period is given
    as . (1) (2) For each channel, the primary user’s activity is independent of that
    in other channels, and the ON and OFF periods are independent of each other. These
    assumptions are the same as that in [14], [30], [31], [32]. The ON state and OFF
    state alternate on the channel. During the OFF state, if a primary packet arrives,
    the channel transits to the ON state, and the secondary user is required to vacate
    the channel, and perform the sequential spectrum sensing to find a new channel
    to resume its unfinished transmission. If the primary packet leaves, the channel
    transits from ON state to OFF state. Thus, there are only two possible states
    (ON/OFF) in the system and the theory of alternating renewal process [26] can
    be used to analyze the behavior of this process. Spectrum sensing is a key element
    in cognitive radio communications as it should be performed before allowing spectrum
    handoff. We assume that each secondary user performs spectrum sensing independently.
    In the following, we take the analysis of secondary user i as an example. For
    spectrum sensing, the sampled received signal on channel k can be simply modeled
    as two hypotheses: and , which indicate if the channel is occupied by the primary
    user or not, respectively. The performance of spectrum sensing is always measured
    by two parameters, false alarm probability and detection probability and they
    are given by [19], [20] (3) (4) where λ is the energy detection threshold, τ is
    the sensing time, fs is the sampling frequency, is the noise variance, and is
    the received SNR on channel k measured by secondary user i. In a real cognitive
    system, the first design purpose is to protect the primary user from interference
    by the secondary user, thus the detection probability should not be less than
    a predefined threshold, that is Pd,ik ⩾ α ⩾ 0.9, for ∀i, k. The false alarm probability
    can be rewritten as a function of α, that is (5) When the secondary user suffers
    from a fading channel, the channel gain hik varies due to the fading and the false
    alarm probability Pf,ik becomes a conditional probability dependent on the instantaneous
    SNR γik. Let denote the probability distribution function of γik, then, the average
    false alarm probability can be obtained by averaging instantaneous Pf,ik over
    the distribution function of the channel gain (6) The close form solution of Eq.
    (6) is difficult to obtain. We can only rely on numerical methods to solve Eq.
    (6) 3. The design of our proposed policy The intelligent cognitive technologies
    can allow the secondary users to temporarily utilize the unused licensed spectrum.
    In order to enhance the utilization, our proposed approach required three major
    capacities: spectrum estimation, sequential spectrum sensing and spectrum handoff.
    Spectrum estimation is to measure the residual idle time of the current transmitting
    channel and determine when to trigger a spectrum handoff; sequential spectrum
    sensing is to discover a new spectrum opportunity with largest residual idle time;
    spectrum handoff is to vacate the occupied licensed channel and resume the unfinished
    transmission on the best selected target channel. More specifically, our proposed
    sequential sensing based spectrum handoff is illustrated as follows: 1. In the
    beginning, secondary user is transmitting at its default channel, we assume that
    secondary user will continue to estimate the residual idle time of current transmitting
    channel tc, where c is the channel index especially of the channel currently being
    utilized by the secondary user, channel c is one of the handoff target channels
    c ∈ {i1, i2, … , ik, …}. 2. Furthermore, when tc is less than a predetermined
    threshold β, i.e., tc < β, it indicates that the primary user will appear at the
    current channel within β duration, then the secondary user has to prepare for
    spectrum handoff. 3. Secondary user performs sequential sensing according to its
    own sensing order to find the best target channel which has the maximum residual
    idle time. 4. Secondary user then resumes its unfinished transmission on the selected
    target channel. 5. Finally, because a secondary user may be interrupted many times
    by the primary user during its transmission period, steps (1)–(4) may be repeated.
    To find an optimal system configuration, two questions need to be answered first:
    (1) what is the optimal sensing order as well as the best target channel for each
    secondary user? and (2) what are the optimal candidate channels for each secondary
    user? The two questions are investigated as follows: we will first determine the
    candidate channels that each secondary user will search for spectrum handoff.
    Then we propose sequential sensing to choose the best target channel among the
    candidate channels by Dynamic Programming (DP). 3.1. Selection of candidate channels
    For sequential spectrum sensing, how many and which channels are selected as candidate
    channels significantly affect the system performance because our strategy is aimed
    to determine the optimal sensing order where the computational complexity exponentially
    increases as the number of sensed channel increases. Moreover, a larger number
    of candidate channels can increase the total sensing time. However, to reduce
    the number of candidate channels, the probability of finding at least one idle
    channel decreases. In addition, since all the secondary users contend for channel
    access, one channel may be selected by multiple secondary users. Thus, collision
    may happen among secondary users if they switch to the same channel. In this case,
    long handoff delay may be induced. Therefore, the number of channels and which
    channels are selected as candidate channels should be decided with caution. In
    general, the principles of selecting candidate channels should meet the three
    requirements as much as possible: (1) keep a high probability to detect at least
    one idle channel; (2) reduce the sensing overhead and computational complexity
    as much as possible; and (3) avoid collision with other secondary users. Therefore
    we propose the following steps to construct the candidate channels for each secondary
    user. Suppose the accepted channel condition thresholds for all the M secondary
    users are [Γ1, Γ2, … , ΓM], based on a secondary user selecting its own candidate
    channels. The threshold is determined by the system and can be changed according
    to the QoS requirement. At each period, the secondary user first sequentially
    measures the condition parameters of all the channels. Let ϒ = {ρij}, where ρij
    is a parameter that can capture channel j’s condition (e.g, channel gain and SNR)
    measured by secondary user i, 1 ⩽ j ⩽ N. It is a per secondary user and per-channel
    parameter. In our work, we set ρij as the SNR received by secondary user i from
    channel j. If ρij is above the threshold Γi, channel j will become one candidate
    channel of secondary user i. That is where Ci is the set of candidate channels
    for secondary user i, and ∣Ci∣ = Ni. Let Pi denote the probability that the secondary
    user i can successfully detect at least one primary free channel by sensing all
    the candidate channels in Ci. To determine Pi, we should note that a channel is
    called primary-free if this channel is not occupied by the primary user and a
    false alarm does not happen. We introduce the following events: Ai: at least one
    primary-free channel can be found after sensing all the candidate channels in
    Ci. Bi:k channels are actually primary-free among all the candidate channels.
    The probability that at least one primary-free channel is detected as idle can
    be obtained using the law of total probability, that is (7) where Λ is the set
    of channels that are actually not occupied by the primary user, ∣Λ∣ = k ⩽ Ni and
    θ(δ) is the primary-free probability of channel δ. In order to maintain a high
    utilization of channel, we will choose Pi ∈ [Pmin, Pmax]. Here Pmin is a predefined
    positive value and Pmax is the maximum value. Both are set by the system according
    to the QoS requirements. Pi should be no smaller than Pmin, such that the secondary
    user i can detect primary-free channels to resume its unfinished transmission
    with a probability of at least Pmin. On the other hand, Pi is constrained to be
    no larger than Pmax in order to keep the sensing overhead low. This is because
    when Pi reaches Pmax, the increment of Pi by adding more channels into its candidate
    channel list is trivial. However, the additional sensing overhead and computational
    complexity increase dramatically. Thus if Pi < Pmin, we reduce the SNR threshold
    Γi and reselect the candidate channels Ci; if Pi > Pmax, we remove the redundant
    channels with high overlapping probability Pover,j. Here we define Pover,j as
    (8) where mj denotes the number of secondary users who select channel j as its
    candidate channel. Since all the secondary users contend for available channels
    for transmission, the lower Pover,j is, the larger the probability that the channel
    is not occupied by other secondary user thus causing less collision. Intuitively,
    if the overlapping probability , which means that channel j either only belongs
    to one secondary user’s candidate channels or none of secondary user selects it
    as a candidate channel, i.e. no other secondary users will contend for access.
    From the view of this secondary user, the channel idle probability is the same
    as the primary-free probability, that is (9) However, if , which means that more
    than one secondary user may choose channel j as candidate channel, then channel
    j is idle for secondary user i only when there are no primary activity and no
    other secondary users activity. In the following, we will determine the probability
    that a candidate channel is available for a particular secondary user. Suppose
    channel j is selected as candidate channel by secondary users hk,1 ⩽ k ⩽ mj, then
    for secondary user h1, channel j is considered as idle if it is not occupied by
    the primary and other secondary users hk, for 2 ⩽ k ⩽ mj. For simplicity of analysis,
    we assume that the secondary user transmits over all the candidate channels with
    equal chance, then the probability that channel j is not occupied by a secondary
    user equals to the probability that the secondary user is utilizing other channels
    belonging to its candidate channels. Hence, the probability that secondary user
    h1 detects channel j as idle under the assumption that no primary user is present
    is given by (10) The probability that channel j is detected as free of both the
    primary and other secondary users can be expressed as (11) 3.2. Spectrum estimation
    While transmitting, the secondary user may decide to seek for better spectrum
    opportunity to switch. This typically happens when, for example, the secondary
    user judges that the quality of its current channel is no longer acceptable. This
    is done by continuously evaluating the quality of the current channel via some
    quality metric, such as the residual idle time. That is, when the evaluated quality
    metric drops below a threshold, spectrum handoff is triggered. Recall that we
    use to denote the residual idle time of channel ik, then according to the alternating
    renewal theory [26], has its probability density function as (12) is the primary
    idle period cumulative distribution function and is the expected value. Thus the
    expected residual idle time can be calculated as (13) Note that with a constant
    slot time, the actual residual idle time for data transmission changes with sensing
    order k. One goal of our proposed strategy is to determine whether the secondary
    user should carry out a spectrum handoff and then switch to a new channel with
    high quality. The policy that a secondary user should switch to a new channel
    is (14) where the index c denotes the current channel on which the secondary user
    is transmitting, and β is the residual idle time threshold below which the secondary
    user is required to perform sequential sensing to find the optimal target channel.
    Thus, the spectrum handoff can be initiated β duration before the arrival of the
    primary user, which results in a short handoff delay. 3.3. Sequential spectrum
    sensing In the following, we propose sequential sensing [15], [16], [23], in which
    spectrum is searched one by one until an idle channel with satisfied quality is
    detected. The question is when to stop sensing and carry out the spectrum handoff,
    and what is the optimal sensing order for each secondary user to discover a new
    transmission opportunity. In this subsection, we formulate the above sensing problem
    as a stochastic sequential decision-making problem [24]. The objective is to maximize
    the overall reward incurred over all stages for each secondary user. The sequential
    sensing process allows the problem to be terminated before the last stage as long
    as the optimal channel is detected. In the following, we briefly describe the
    basic components in the analysis of such a problem. 3.4. System state The system
    state is characterized by the knowledge of channel status xk ∈ {0, 1}, indicating
    whether the channel is idle or not and the set of channels which has been sensed
    in stage k, Ωk, i.e., sk = (xk, Ωk). We denote the index of the channel sensed
    at stage k as ik, thus Ωk = {i1, i2, … , ik}. Note that , where is a permutation
    of the elements of Ci and ∅ is an empty set. We introduce an additional state
    to denote that the process has been terminated, that is, sequential channel sensing
    has stopped. 3.5. Decision At each stage k, after observing the system state sk,
    a decision has to be made. To protect the primary user and avoid collision with
    other secondary users, spectrum handoff is not allowed when channel ik is sensed
    busy. Hence, the only decision when sk = (1, Ωk) is uk = ik+1, which means continuing
    to sense the next channel ik+1, where ik+1 is the best next sensed channel from
    the set of remaining channels ik+1 ∈ Ci⧹Ωk. However, when channel ik is sensed
    idle, the secondary user has to decide whether to give up the current channel
    and continue to sense the selected next channel, uk = ik+1 or uk = 1 (which denotes
    that the secondary user stops sensing and carries out spectrum handoff on channel
    ik). Note that once spectrum handoff starts, i.e., uk = 1, the system enters the
    termination state and remains in it, i.e., . 3.6. Cost functions If channel ik
    is sensed busy, then the secondary user proceeds to sense channel ik+1 (uk = ik+1)
    where it consumes a certain amount of time for sensing. When channel ik is sensed
    idle, the secondary user will transmit at channel ik as long as the expected reward
    of channel ik is greater than that if the secondary user proceeds to sense the
    set of remaining channels. The reward associated with this decision is , where
    ts is the switching time. Hence the expected reward function for stage k under
    decision uk can be expressed as (15) The objective of our design is to find a
    sequence of decisions uk, k = 1, 2, … , Ni mapping each state sk into a control
    policy uk = uk(sk) to maximize the reward, which is defined as (16) The sequence
    of decisions is referred to as a policy starting from the initial stage 1 to the
    terminated stage Ni, which is the sensing-handoff strategy that specifies when
    to stop sensing and carry out spectrum handoff. Denoting the reward using policy
    as , an optimal policy is then given by (17) We further define the optimal policy
    from stage k to terminated stage Ni as and its associated reward is given by .
    As defined in [16], we refer to sensing the channels according to their descending
    order of primary-free probability θi as Intuitive Sensing Order. In the following
    lemma, we will show that Intuitive Sensing Order is optimal for single user case.
    However, if multiple users are considered, Intuitive Sensing Order may not be
    optimal. Lemma 1 If the optimal sensing order is investigated for a single user
    case, the Intuitive Sensing Order is optimal. However, this optimality may not
    exist for multiple users case. Proof Suppose an optimal sensing order is , and
    there exists k < Ni such that , then we will show the new sensing order by switching
    the order of ik and ik+1, is better than ϕ. We prove this by classification.  □
    Let ij be the selected target handoff channel, when j < k or j > k + 1, from (15),
    (16), if secondary user senses channel ij as idle and stops carrying out spectrum
    handoff, we have the reward as (18) Otherwise, if the secondary user chooses to
    stop at channel ik or ik+1, we can compare the expected reward for sensing orders
    ϕ and ϕnew as (19) The last inequality holds due to the fact that the residual
    idle time is a monotonically increasing function of channel primary-free probability.
    Thus sensing the channels according to their descending order of channel primary-free
    probability is optimal for single user case. This result is also consistent with
    that in [14] if adaptive modulation is not used. However, if the optimal sensing
    order is explored for multiple secondary users, the Intuitive Sensing Order may
    no longer be optimal. We demonstrate this by examples as follows: Example 1 There
    are 2 secondary users and 4 channels with primary-free probabilities as (0.9,
    0.8, 0.7, 0.6) and the candidate channels for users 1 and 2 are (1, 2, 3) and
    (1, 3, 4), respectively. If multiple secondary users are studied, the channel
    idle probabilities should include the contention among secondary users. Thus we
    recalculate the channel idle probabilities as (0.57, 0.8, 0.37, 0.6) according
    to (11). By searching, we can obtain the optimal sensing order setting for these
    two secondary users, which are (2, 1, 3) and (4, 1, 3) respectively, which is
    not according to the descending order of primary-free probability. Example 2 If
    the primary-free probabilities for the channels are (0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.5), then
    the optimal sensing order for users 1 and 2 are (2, 1, 3) and (1, 4, 3) respectively,
    which is different from Example 1. Therefore, from Example 1, Example 2, it can
    be seen that both the primary-free probability of the channels and the degree
    of the overlapping will jointly affect the optimal sensing order for multiple
    users case. Since the objective function in (16) is a summation operation, an
    optimal policy has the property that no matter what the initial state and decision
    is, the remaining decisions are also optimal. In particular, if the sensing order
    is optimal, then for ∀k ∈ (1, Ni), is also an optimal sensing order of the remaining
    channels. Thus Dynamic Programming (DP) is applicable. Then we formulate a DP
    solution for the optimal sequential sensing order for each secondary user with
    the basic idea of DP given as follows: Stage Ni: Calculate the maximal expected
    reward value associated with the final channel in the sensing order. In the previous
    stage, a state is represented by the set of sensed channels . Thus there exist
    possible states in stage Ni. If the observed system state is , then the maximum
    reward can be calculated as (20) ⧹ The expectation value can be calculated over
    . Since the computational complexity of the calculation at a channel is O(1),
    the computational complexity at this stage is . Stage k: DP problem can be stated
    in a recursive, step-by-step form by writing down the relationship between the
    reward function in one stage and the reward function in the adjacent stage. Here
    we use backward induction. For the problem starting from stage k and , we can
    express the expected reward, for k = 1, 2, … , Ni − 1, as (21) ⧹ when channel
    ik is sensed busy and Ωk+1 = Ωk + ik+1. Otherwise, we have (22) ⧹ where is given
    by (23) ⧹ The optimal decision at stage k is given by (24) ⧹ when the channel
    is detected to be busy; and when channel ik is sensed to be idle, there are two
    possible cases for the decision. In case 1, we have (25) ⧹ In this case, the secondary
    user prefers transmitting on channel ik because it can produce maximal reward.
    Thus the secondary user will resume its unfinished transmission on the selected
    channel ik until the next spectrum handoff, uk = ik; On the other hand, in case
    2 (26) ⧹ In this case, the secondary user prefers to continue sensing the remaining
    channel . Note that the optimal sensing order strategy at stage k indicates transmission
    only occurs when the immediate reward on channel ik is larger than the expected
    reward associated with continuing the process by sensing any of the remaining
    channels. The process can be repeated until stage 1. Then the optimal value that
    can be obtained by maximizing the objective function is given by (27) Hence, at
    the beginning, we should sense from the channel index given by (28) After the
    maximal reward value is obtained at stage 1, an optimal sensing order can be traced
    back according to the recorded optimal transition at each stage. 3.7. Spectrum
    handoff Spectrum handoff is the process of secondary user changing its operating
    channel when the primary user appears on the current transmitting channel. A secondary
    user’s communication may experience multiple interruptions from primary users
    during its transmission duration. These interruptions will result in a number
    of spectrum handoff. One should note that spectrum handoff has a significant effect
    on system performance. From the viewpoint of secondary users, whenever spectrum
    handoff occurs, secondary user is required to perform sequential sensing to select
    a target channel, which consumes a lot of system resource. Moreover, spectrum
    handoff requires sensing time, switching time, handshaking time, all these will
    increase the secondary user data delivery time. Therefore spectrum handoff may
    degrade the performance of secondary user by incurring longer delay as well as
    temporary communication disruption since a new discovery of spectrum hole is required.
    From the perspective of the primary user, spectrum handoff is initiated whenever
    the appearance of primary user at the current licensed channel is detected. If
    the detection is imperfect or the secondary user cannot pause its transmission,
    collision with the primary user will happen. Therefore, how to reduce the number
    of spectrum handoff in order to improve the system performance is one of the design
    goal of this paper. As illustrated in Fig. 2, when the primary user appears in
    the current operating channel occupied by secondary user i, the transmission for
    the secondary user i will switch to the first target channel i1 and transmit with
    duration . When the residual idle time of the channel is below β, the secondary
    user will switch to channel i2 and resume its transmission with duration . This
    process will continue till the secondary user i finishes its transmission. Download

    transmission. The white areas indicate that secondary user resumes its unfinished
    transmission on the target channels. Furthermore the shaded areas indicate that
    sequential spectrum sensing is performed to determine the optimal handoff channel.
    As indicated in this figure, the target handoff channel sequence is and the number
    of spectrum handoff is Hi within the transmission duration ls of secondary user
    i. Let denote the number of spectrum handoff for secondary user i from the beginning
    of its service to the end of the service. Then (29) where ls denotes the required
    service time for the secondary user to finish its transmission. From (29), the
    number of spectrum handoff during secondary user’s transmission period is dominated
    by the selected target channel. Our objective is to minimize the number of spectrum
    handoff , which is equivalent to maximizing the residual idle time in each spectrum
    handoff. Thus, the problem can be separated into a number of subproblems with
    the aim of determining the target channel which has the maximum residual idle
    time for data transmission by sequential sensing. Then a series of target channels
    will be selected sequentially for multiple spectrum handoff. 4. The effect of
    sensing error Sensing errors such as false alarm and missed detection will degrade
    the performance of secondary user and primary user. Since we already set a target
    detection probability, the primary users will receive a satisfied protection.
    In the following, we will investigate the effect of false alarm on the actual
    residual idle time of spectrum handoff. When a false alarm occurs in the sequential
    spectrum sensing, the idle channel will be declared as busy. The only decision
    at this stage is to sense the next selected channel. Hence, for sequential spectrum
    sensing with Ni channels, let be the channels that false alarm happens, where
    1 ⩽ j1, j2, … , jk ⩽ Ni and their associated residual idle times are . Let ij
    be the selected handoff channel and its residual idle time is . If false alarm
    happens, there is a probability that the selected handoff channel is not optimal,
    while one of the false alarmed busy channel is optimal. Hence the actual transmission
    time will be reduced to if and only if false alarm occurs in channels and at least
    one of them has larger residual idle time. One should note that although false
    alarm happens on channels , only the channel with maximum residual idle time will
    affect the transmission time. Thus, the expected effect on the transmission time
    can be calculated as (30) where j∗ indicates the index of false alarm busy channel
    which has maximum residual idle time. Let be the selected target handoff channels
    sequence during the secondary user transmission and their associated residual
    idle time are , where the superscript means the handoff number. If false alarm
    happens during secondary user transmission, the optimal selected target handoff
    channel sequence will change to . Note that j1,j2, … ,jm are the indices where
    false alarm happens and Hi1, Hi2, … , Hin are the extended number of handoffs
    which represents the effect of sensing error in the spectrum handoff. Therefore,
    the total effected transmission time is given by (31) 5. Simulation In this section,
    we present the simulation results and discussions for our proposed sequential
    sensing based spectrum handoff strategy. The parameters used in this system are
    as follows: the sampling frequency is fixed and set to fs = 6 MHz, the target
    detection probability α = 0.9, the upper and lower bounds of idle probability
    are set as Pmin = 0.9 and Pmax = 0.95, respectively. We assume that there are
    M = 4 secondary users in the network, while the number of channels varies between
    2 ⩽ N ⩽ 10. 5.1. Performance comparisons There are two kinds of sequential sensing:
    conventional sequential sensing (CSS) in which the secondary user can sequentially
    and continuously sense selected channels until an idle channel is detected [25];
    and the one we use where the spectrum is searched by sensing the channels one
    by one until an idle channel with a satisfied quality is detected. Compared with
    CSS, our approach may give up the detected idle channel and keep sensing the remainding
    channels in order to find the best one. To provide a better understanding, we
    conduct the performance comparison between these two approaches. Fig. 3 depicts
    the residual idle time as a function of the number of channels in the system,
    obtained by our proposed sequential sensing based spectrum handoff strategy as
    well as the CSS in [25]. It is evident from Fig. 3 that our proposed strategy
    can achieve a much higher residual idle time than that achieved by CSS where the
    target channel is the first one detected to be idle. That is, our method makes
    better use of sequential sensing by selecting the optimal channel with maximal
    residual idle time. Moreover, it is easy to note that the residual idle time decreases
    with an increase in the sensing time. This is reasonable due to the fact that
    a larger sensing time indicates that more fraction of the time is used for sequential
    sensing, which reduces the residual idle time. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. The number of sensed channels vs. the residual idle time of the selected
    handoff channel. In Fig. 4, we plot the number of spectrum handoff for different
    number of sensed channels, obtained by our proposed sequential sensing based spectrum
    handoff strategy using DP as well as CSS [25]. Note that from the Fig. 4 our proposed
    strategy can result in a lower number of spectrum handoff than that achieved by
    CSS. It is also worth observing that the larger the number of sensed channels,
    the lower the number of spectrum handoff that is required during secondary user’s
    communication duration. This is when sequential sensing is performed to find the
    optimal channel with maximal residual idle time, the more the number of sensed
    channels, the better the selected target channel with longer residual idle time.
    Thus the residual idle time increases as the number of sensed channels increases.
    Moreover, we determine the number of spectrum handoff based on Eq. (29), from
    which, we can see that the number of spectrum handoff reduces as the residual
    idle time of the target channel increases, which in turn indicates that the number
    of spectrum handoff reduces as the number of sensed channel increases. Download

    of required handoff. 5.2. The effect of error rate In the following, to provide
    a better understanding on how our proposed sequential sensing based spectrum handoff
    scheme behaves, we evaluate the sensing performance by plotting the error rate
    as a function of the number of channels for different sensing time τ ∈ {3 ms,
    4 ms, 5 ms}. As shown in Fig. 5, it is clear that the error rate is always below
    0.1, which indicates that the error due to false alarm probability is small. As
    expected, the larger the sensing time, the lower the error rate is. This is true
    because the false alarm probability is a decreasing function of sensing time if
    both the SNR and target detection probability α are fixed. Moreover, the error
    rate increases as the number of sensed channel increases. As discussed in Section
    4, although false alarm happens on channels , only the channel with maximum residual
    idle time will affect the transmission time. Thus, as the number of sensed channels
    increases, more channels will experience false alarm. As a consequence, the maximum
    residual idle time of the false alarm channel defined by Eq. (30) representing
    the error will increase. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows error rate for our sequential
    sensing based spectrum handoff in AWGN, Rayleigh fading, and Nakagami fading.
    It is clear from Fig. 6 that both Rayleigh and Nakagami fading degrades the performance
    of sequential sensing. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The effect
    of false alarm probability on the residual idle time vs. the number of channels.

    time in AWGN, Rayleigh and Nakagami Fading channels. 5.3. Complexity evaluation
    One way to find the optimal sensing order is to exhaustively search over all the
    possible sensing orders. The complexity is calculated by counting the number times
    that the residual idle time at a specific channel is computed. Note that for each
    stage, we calculate the residual idle time once, hence, for each possible sensing
    order, the computational complexity is N. There exist N! all possible sensing
    orders, therefore, the overall computational complexity of the exhaustive search
    for all the secondary users is O(MNN!). For the approach proposed in our paper,
    we determine the optimal sensing order using DP and the computational complexity
    is analyzed as follows. At stage N, there exist states, the computational complexity
    is . At stage k, Ωk = {i1, i2, … , ik} has been sensed, thus there are states
    and each state Ωk = {i1, i2, … , ik} has N − k possible transitions to stage k
    + 1. The computation of each state is O(k), so the total computational complexity
    at stage k is . Thus the computational complexity by performing sequential sensing
    over all the N channels in the system using DP (we refer this method as common
    DP) is (32) Moreover, in order to reduce the sensing overhead and computational
    complexity, for each secondary user, the sequential sensing is performed only
    over the candidate channels, therefore, for our proposed method using DP, the
    computational complexity is further reduced to . As illustrated in Fig. 7, our
    proposed DP approach is much simpler than the exhaustive search and the common
    DP approach. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Computational complexity
    for the exhaustive search, common DP and our proposed DP method. 6. Conclusions
    In this paper, we have studied the design of sequential sensing based spectrum
    handoff strategy in multiple-user cognitive radio networks. Most of the prior
    work on sequential sensing only considers single or two-secondary user scenario.
    We propose a sequential sensing which can determine optimal sensing order for
    each secondary user as well as best target channel for spectrum handoff by Dynamic
    Programming (DP). In addition, we select candidate channels for each secondary
    user, which jointly considers the following factors: (1) maintain the idle probability
    high; (2) keep the sensing overhead and computational complexity as low as possible;
    and (3) avoid collision with other secondary users. Through the comparison between
    our proposed sequential sensing based spectrum handoff scheme and the conventional
    sequential sensing [25], it can be verified that our scheme is more effective
    in improving the system performance by increasing the residual idle time which
    in turn reduces the number of spectrum handoff. Moreover, our proposed DP method
    can significantly lower the computational complexity compared with exhaustive
    search and common DP. References [1] Federal Communications Commission, Spectrum

    Network (CRN) is a new technique that utilizes available unlicensed spectrum bands
    due to limited numbers of fixed licensed spectrum bands. It consists of four main
    functions, namely, spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing and spectrum
    mobility. We focus on the spectrum mobility (also known as spectrum handoff) which
    manages the movements of secondary users to occupy the vacant unlicensed spectrum
    without interrupting the transmission of primary users. In this paper, we introduce
    fuzzy logic based negotiation approach based for spectrum handoff in CRN. It contains
    two Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLCs), namely, price negotiation and duration negotiation.
    The proposed system provides a good solution to avoid the communication interruption
    caused by the mobility of SU. It will reduce the handoff delay by 46 ~ 62% if
    the SU correctly selects the best PU. Published in: 2016 IEEE 3rd International

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia I. Introduction Nowadays,
    cognitive radio (CR) becomes one of the most research areas that offer solution
    for lack of spectrum in wireless communication due to the increased demand of
    extra spectrum bands. Thus, IEEE 802.22 WRAN (Wireless Regional Area Networks)
    standard is standardized to allow the unlicensed users to utilize licensed spectrum
    bands while avoiding the interference with licensed users [1]. Meanwhile, there
    is a large portion of available spectrum which is not fully utilized by the licensed
    users such as some portions of TV VHF/ UHF bands, so called TV white spaces. CRNs
    have the capability of utilizing the vacant spectrum in fixed licensed bands.
    The basic concept of CR network is that the unlicensed users (also known as secondary
    users) occupy some portions of licensed spectrum band without interrupting the
    transmission of other licensed users (also called as primary users). The secondary
    users (SUs) need to be flexible in order to move from one spectrum to another
    if the licensed band occupied by the primary users (PUs) so as to avoid the interference
    [2]. The process of moving SUs from one spectrum to another is called spectrum
    handoff or spectrum mobility. The dynamic use of the spectrum requires many functions
    such as spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing and spectrum mobility
    in CR network. However, spectrum mobility in CRN still has many research issues
    that should be focused in future. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures

    Radio Network (CRN) is a new technique that utilizes available unlicensed spectrum
    bands due to limited numbers of fixed licensed spectrum bands. It consists of
    four main functions, namely, spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing
    and spectrum mobility. We focus on the spectrum mobility (also known as spectrum
    handoff) which manages the movements of secondary users to occupy the vacant unlicensed
    spectrum without interrupting the transmission of primary users. In this paper,
    we introduce spectrum handoff based on the fuzzy logic system. The proposed system
    consists of one Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLC) with three input linguistic variables,
    namely, received power, eNB load and arrival rate of PUs and one linguistic variable
    (handoff probability). The proposed system provides a good platform to avoid unwanted
    handoff in CRNs in LTE-A system. Published in: 2017 3rd International Conference

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Paris, France I. Introduction Nowadays, the
    current fixed available spectrums are not fully utilized since the spectrum demands
    are increasing. Furthermore, the growing of mobile communication systems causes
    increased the spectrum requirements [1]. To overcome this issue a cognitive radio
    technology is suggested. The cognitive radio is a smart technology allows the
    unlicensed users (secondary users) to use the licensed bands in a condition that
    no interference. There are only a certain frequency band can be used by the secondary
    users according to US Federal Communication Commission FCC''s rule and regulation.
    The cognitive radio technology consists of four main processes, namely, spectrum
    sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing. In spectrum
    sensing comes in the first process in order to sense all the available spectrums
    in the environment which plays an important role. The band selection is done by
    decision process which selects the best band for secondary users to use it with
    less interference. Once the secondary user occupied the licensed band and start
    its transmission, the primary users could be suddenly arrived to occupy its own
    band. In this case the secondary users have to make the handoff to another vacant
    spectrums. Thus, the handoff spectrum is an essential role to avoid the interfering
    the primary users which allow the dynamic use of the un-utilized spectrum [2].
    Before making handoff to another spectrum, the handoff spectrum needs to collect
    information for vacations and best spectrums and preparing for handoff process.
    One the intelligence techniques that used to improve the handoff spectrum in order
    to obtain efficient and seamless connectivity is fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic
    considers a suitable tool that used the mathematical concept to make a real time
    decision. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    • MABC with FA is proposed for reducing local minima, convergence speed and randomness.
    • The spectrum handoff delay is calculated during the arrival rate of primary
    user. • Firefly algorithm provides a better channel for spectrum handoff. Abstract
    The metaheuristic algorithm such as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Firefly Algorithm
    (FA) is a nature and biological inspired for solving the optimization problem.
    The cognitive radio network is an intellectual network which adapts its performance
    and operations to provide a perfect result towards its environment. The spectrum
    sensing and spectrum handoff plays a major role in cognitive radio network. Spectrum
    sensing is more important for identifying the underutilized spectrum during the
    spectrum handoff. While progressing the channel, there occurs a premature convergence
    and local minima problem. The Secondary User (SU) is examining for the white space
    in the spectrum to produce a smooth transmission, but the channel should not be
    utilized by the Primary User (PU). When the channel is essential for primary user,
    the secondary user has to vacate and recognize a new free channel for fast transmission
    which is referred as spectrum handoff. In this work, Modified Artificial Bee Colony
    with Firefly Algorithm (MABCFA) is proposed for cognitive radio network to overcome
    the above challenges. So this proposed work mainly focuses on sensing the best
    optimal channel for the secondary user and to moderate the delay of spectrum handoff
    in wireless network. Some of the benchmark functions are used to test the performance
    of this proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that the performance of
    MABCFA is 23.81% more robust and effective than the other metaheuristic algorithm.

    like science, management, engineering, medical are not linear to find the optimal
    solution. There are some of the metaheuristics algorithms available such as Binary
    Particle Swarm Optimization [1], Firefly algorithm [2], Artificial Bee Colony
    [3], Ants Colony Optimization [ACO] [4]. There are 4 ways of accessing the spectrum
    as follows, No spectrum sharing- Sharing the spectrum is not allowed, Primary
    – primary spectrum access – authorized user is accessing the spectrum with other
    licensed user, Secondary – primary spectrum access-authorized user is allowed
    to access the spectrum by secondary user when primary user is not accessing the
    spectrum, Open spectrum access-entirely unauthorized spectrum is accessed. Here
    the secondary –primary spectrum access is a leading way to perform for research
    [5,6]. The spectrum sensing policies is the major cause of spectrum scarcity.
    Cognitive radio network is a best technology to solve the problem in the spectrum.
    There are two different users in the cognitive radio network namely, PU is privileged
    user who can access the channel at any time and whereas SU is an unlicensed user
    can access the channel only when the primary user is not accessing the bandwidth
    of the channel [7,8]. The secondary user is given rights to access the channel
    during the absence of primary user and no interference is allowed after the arrival
    of primary user. It has to vacate the channel and can search for the next available
    free channel in the spectrum. So here the free spectrums are stored in spectrum
    pooling, it can retrieve the channel from the pooling which is processed based
    on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [9,10]. The optimization
    technique is followed to observe the best optimal solution within a short period
    of time [[11], [12], [13]]. Swarm intelligence is the collective intelligence
    used to find the shortest path in search of food for the social animals. The behaviors
    of each and every swarm are modulated into a numerical optimization [14,15]. The
    Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is the behavior of honey bee in swarm based algorithm.
    It is simple and efficient techniques which initiates a memory algorithm. The
    previous position is stored in memory and it is further reviewed to find the optimal
    solution. If it gathers the new position, then the previous position is replaced
    with the current position [16,17]. The Firefly algorithm (FA) is a tremendous
    optimizer algorithm based on swarm intelligence. The drawback of FA and ABC are
    that it falls into convergence problem and slow precision solution. First, an
    attraction model is enhanced to organize the attracted fireflies. Second, a search
    equation is used for fireflies. Third, the iteration is performed energetically
    [18,19]. To overcome a few problems that arise around the ABC and FA, a new technique
    MABCFA is proposed to resolve the convergence problem and the spectrum handoff
    technique in cognitive radio networks by comparing with some other swarm intelligence
    algorithm such as ABC and FA [20,21]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows,
    section 2 describes about meta-heuristics algorithm and spectrum handoff. The
    proposed MABCFA is discussed in section 3. The simulation results of the proposed
    algorithm are compared with other two algorithms using few benchmark functions
    in section 4. 2. Meta-heuristic algorithms and spectrum handoff To find the best
    or optimistic solutions, a metaheuristic algorithm approaches can be implemented.
    This algorithm works to find, select, produce or search the search space for the
    specific problems in order to generate a best solution [22]. 2.1. Spectrum handoff
    In cognitive radio network, the spectrum handoff or handover denotes to the transition
    of spectrum bandwidth from the primary user to the secondary user. The PU’s is
    privileged user and the secondary users are unlicensed user. The SU has to vacate
    the channel during the PU arrival in cognitive radio network. So SU has to complete
    its transmission with other idle channel which is structured in Fig. 1 [23,24].

    Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is swarm intelligence
    optimization techniques proposed in 2005 by Karaboga which is inspired by the
    performance of honey bee foraging [25]. It consist of three different bees namely,
    the first bee is employee bee are responsible to converse with other bees in exploiting
    the quality of food position. It delivers the information about the quality of
    food to the next bee in the hive. If new position is established, the old position
    is updated with the new position. The second bee is onlooker bee which makes a
    decision depending on the information provided by the employee bee. Suppose a
    new position is noticed by the employee bee, that information is sent to the onlooker
    bee to modernize and store the updated position. The third bee is scout bee observes
    the best quality of food position based on the motivation or clues suggested by
    the employee bee. They all work together to find the best optimal position in
    the search space [26,27]. In Fig. 2, the secondary user works together with SU
    base station and primary user together with its PU base station. The honey bee
    works together to find the best quality food source whereas the secondary user
    is in need of best channel with good bandwidth. The goal of this effort is to
    decrease the handoff delay and maximize in finding the target channel. Download

    is framed in Algorithm 1 and can be described as follows. (1) Initialization:
    The search space is initialized as d dimension where ith food source is expressed
    as where i = 1,2,….NB, NB is number of bees. It is generated by Eq. (1) (1) for
    j = 1,2, …d, where is the random number in range (0,1) and , are Upper and Lower
    bound of dimension j. (2) Employee phase: The ith bee exploits the updated information
    with the kth bee and current quality of food source is generated in Eq. (2) (2)
    where k is chosen randomly from 1,2,….NB and if it is chosen from 1,2…d. and is
    in range [-1,1]. The current position is compared with the previous position .
    If then update previous position by current position else place previous position
    Now set , where is the counter for unchanged iteration. (3) Onlooker Phase: The
    quality of the food source is selected based on the information provided by the
    employee bee which is expressed using probability value as in Eq. (3) and the
    fitness of each position is calculated in Eq. (4). (3) (4) If then current position
    is created by Eq. (3) and if then update previous position by current position
    else maintain previous position Now set . (4) Scout phase: If the food source
    is not improved through the iteration, then again create a new current position

    proposed work, MABCFA based spectrum handoff process is investigated. Spectrum
    handoff is analyzed and formulated with a new algorithm [29]. The throughput and
    spectrum handoff delay is measured with the capacity of secondary user as in Eq.
    (8) (8) where is the arrival rate of secondary user, is the number of secondary
    user respectively. The probability of secondary user based on the Poisson distribution
    for smooth and effective transmission of packets is computed for throughput in
    Eq. (9). The throughput of the secondary user is expressed as the proportion between
    numbers of packets arrived effectively by the receiver and entire number of slots
    in a given time. (9) for is the probability of secondary user for successful transmission
    of packets, n is number of packets occur during the estimation of each time slot.
    The spectrum handoff delay is based on switching delay and the sensing time. The
    switching delay is considered for a period of time till the free channel is identified
    to switch over by the SU whereas sensing time is the time taken for sensing the
    channel from the spectrum. is expressed as in Eq. (10) (10) Here is switching
    time where secondary user is made to transfer over new channel, is sensing time
    used to sense the idle channel for the SU and assumed to be as 0 for proactive
    spectrum handoff scheme because the prescheduled channels are exploited. The mean
    spectrum handoff delay is derived in Eq. (11) (11) and are the arrival rate of
    primary and secondary user, and are mean service time of primary user and interarrival
    time of secondary user correspondingly. The total service interval time for each
    channel is considered and calculated to obtain the values of the channel are expressed
    in Eq. (12). (12) is the service time, is capacity of primary user, is the first
    handoff process for the secondary user. The service time is derived in Eq. (13),
    where represents the usage of spectrum density. (13) The MABCFA is demonstrated
    with all the phases of ABC algorithm and FA is described in Algorithm 3 [30].
    The phase of employee bee uses the search equation by providing the best information
    solution for improvement. The onlooker bee uses 25% of employee bee for the further
    search moves and 5%of worst position are substituted in the new position for producing
    the best solution as B. The scout bee phase applies firefly algorithm to search
    a new position by replacing the position which are not updated using the distance
    procedure to find the best solution. Initialization: The initial solution is formulated
    by providing ith food source by means of search space formulated in Eq. (14) (14)
    Here , (1) Employee bee phase: is the best position to recognize the new position
    by the following expression is in Eq. (15) (15) where k is chosen randomly from

    is compared with the previous position . If then update previous position by current
    position else place previous position Now set , where is the counter for unchanged
    iteration. (2) Onlooker bee phase: In onlooker bee, the probability value is set

    MABCFA is viewed in Fig. 5 which represents arrival of the primary user. During
    handoff of secondary user, the channel is sensed by the spectrum sensing using

    optimal channel from the spectrum in cognitive radio network. Download : Download

    In cognitive radio network, a new Modified Artificial Bee Colony with Firefly
    Algorithm (MABCFA) is proposed for sensing the optimal channel in wireless communications.
    The cognitive radio network is an intelligent network with two components, the
    primary user (authorized) and the secondary user (unauthorized). The secondary
    user constantly fights for the licensed channel which is not processed by the
    primary user and once the channel is desired by the primary user, the secondary
    user need to switch over. So the optimal channel is identified by using the swarm
    based techniques. In proposed MABCFA algorithm, the employee bees and onlooker
    bees uses new search equation to replace worst positions with the new channel
    in order to produce the best channel and firefly algorithm is implemented in scout
    bees which improves unupdated positions. The MABCFA algorithm manages both spectrum
    sensing and spectrum handoff. The free channel is allocated to the interrupted
    secondary user by the proposed algorithm during the spectrum handoff process.
    The experiment results illustrates that MABCFA meets faster performance in reporting
    the best channel than ABC and FA. In future work, spectrum sensing and spectrum
    handoff may be optimized with few additional heuristics algorithm and machine
    learning concepts. Declaration of competing interest The authors do not have any

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the traditional
    notion is to terminate the secondary communication upon the return of the primary
    users. Even though the spectrum handoff technology is adopted, a long time delay
    to the cognitive communication is unavoidable. And the problem of the handoff
    delay is not to be solved without the innovation of the hardware in communication
    systems. In our paper, we aim at the real-time spectrum handoff in the view of
    the spectrum sensing. We proposed two distinguished modules, the second receiver
    and the spectrum pool, to support the real-time handoff. In the sensing selection,
    we propose the necessity of re-sensing (sensing again) to determine the sensing
    band. And the model-based prediction is also adopted in the paper. From the computer
    simulation under different SNR and different primary traffic rate, we can see
    that the proposed spectrum handoff scheme outperforms the non-realtime scheme.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chengdu I. Introduction Cognitive radio (CR)
    is a dynamic spectrum access technology, aimed to solve the crisis of spectrum
    shortage caused by the fixed spectrum allocation. A cognitive user can change
    its transmitting or receiving parameters to communicate efficiently while avoiding
    interference with licensed or unlicensed users. It can be defined as a transceiver
    that is aware of its environment and can combine this awareness with knowledge
    of its user''s priorities, needs, operational procedures, and governing regulatory
    rules [1]. One of its key technologies is spectrum sensing, which has only two
    tasks in the CRNs (cognitive radio networks). One is to discover the return of
    the primary users (also referred to as PUs) in time, and the other is to locate
    unoccupied spectrum bands as quickly and accurately as possible. Also the former
    is called in-band sensing, and the later out-band sensing [2]. They two are very
    crucial to the communications of the secondary users (also referred to as SUs).

    References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio networks bring
    spectrum access opportunities to SUs(Second Users) when primary users would not
    use this spectrum so as to enhance the resource utilization. The SUs have to change
    spectrum channel no matter when and where the PU(Primary User) appears. Much research
    has been done on spectrum switching prediction design, without considering the
    spectrum handoff caused by the randomly moving of SUs and PUs. This paper proposes
    a novel spectrum handoff management scheme based on Support Vector Machines (SVM).
    To get a better spectrum sensing result, a cooperative spectrum sensing mechanism
    is used. The SVM model is introduced to predict the handoff point, so that the
    SU can prepare to handoff before the channel is occupied. The simulations results
    show that the algorithm could forecast the handoff point and obviously reduce
    the handoff time. Published in: 2011 6th International ICST Conference on Communications

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Harbin I. Introduction In recent years, cognitive
    radio is a key technology to realize dynamic spectrum access (DSA) that enables
    the secondary users (SUs) to exploit the spectrum which is unused by primary users
    (PUs) in an opportunistic manner[1] [2]. Cognitive radio networks bring spectrum
    access opportunities to second users and enhance the spectrum utilization. However,
    the SU needs to stop the ongoing transmission, vacate the channel, and find a
    new available spectrum to continue the transmission when the PU appear, who has
    the preemptive priority to access channels. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    Surat, India I. Introduction Now days, poor utilization of licensed spectrum creates
    spectrum scarcity. For improved spectrum utilization [1], this situation cognitive
    radio, a new technology introduced in wireless communications, which has solution
    to the spectrum underutilization problem [2], [3]. Certain frequency band can
    only be occupied by the specific licensed users according to FCC''s regulation
    for the radio spectrum, who have full authority on the spectrum access to this
    frequency band [4]. In cognitive radio the spectrum sensing plays important role.
    Spectrum sensing and availability of spectrum should done by cognitive radio.
    If the licensed user uses spectrum, cognitive radio should keep silent [5]; otherwise,
    cognitive radio can access this spectrum. Minimization of the interference [6]
    to the primary radio while meeting the requirement of opportunistic spectrum utilization.
    Development of efficient algorithms to solve for the optimal solutions as well
    as computational complexity is reduced and obtained solutions for more general
    cases. The performance of spectrum sensing based on energy detections given in
    [7]. Here an estimated noise variance is used to calculate the threshold used
    in the spectrum sensing based on energy detection. They proposed a new analytical
    model to evaluate the statistical performance of the energy detection with cooperative
    spectrum sensing method. The sensing-throughput tradeoff problem discussed in
    [8] and use energy detection sensing scheme to prove Cooperative sensing using
    multiple mini-slots or multiple secondary users are also studied using the methodology
    given. In [9] a survey of spectrum sensing methodologies for cognitive radio is
    presented. Challenges associated with spectrum sensing were given and enabling
    spectrum sensing methods were reviewed. The cooperative sensing concept and its
    various forms are discussed. External sensing algorithms and other alternative
    sensing methods are discussed. Moreover, statistical modeling of network traffic
    and utilization of these models for prediction of primary user behavior was studied.
    The performances and complicated scenarios of the latest spectrum sensing schemes
    were analytically compared [10]. A macroscopic view of spectrum sensing has been
    given. Here uncertainty and inter-CRN interference were considered. A scheme called
    weighted sequential probability ratio test (WSPRT) discussed in [11]. Advanced
    Television Systems Committee digital television and generic land mobile radio
    signals given in [12], [13]. Spectrum sensing and spectrum reconstruction under
    the umbrella of cognitive radio which is the smart radio to explore and exploit
    the free spectrum. Here spectrum analyzer was used to emulate cognitive radio
    to do spectrum sensing. Quick and semi-continuous measurements and extract more
    information about the spectrum under investigation was possible in this paper.
    Total variation (TV) reconstruction method [14] was employed to rebuild the spectrum
    and find the boundary of the frequency band which was occupied. In [15] spectrum
    aware mobility management scheme is explained taken into consideration for the
    design of our model which utilizes target cell and spectrum pool for doing spectrum
    handoff mechanism. In case of performance of cognitive radio spectrum access with
    intra-and inter-handoff [16] the arrival rate of inter-handoff users are determined.
    In modeling and analysis of reactive decision Spectrum handoff in cognitive radio
    networks [17] development of Markov transition model integrating with M/G/1 queuing
    network to characterize multiple handoff delay resulting from the sensing time
    and the waiting time. Under various traffic arrival rates and service time, in
    [18]this paper latency requirement and for the design of admission control of
    secondary users determined efficiency of the proposed system. In case of handoff
    based novel geographical fingerprint scheme [19] designed an advanced active scan
    to improve its performance. Most of the challenges occurred in spectrum handoff
    mechanism are listed in [20], [21]. During the performance analysis of spectrum
    handoff for cognitive Radio ad-hoc networks without common control channel under
    homogeneous traffic [22], [23] considered retransmission of the collided packets
    using discrete-time Markov chain besides this the study of different spectrum
    selection schemes given in detail. Also along with the effect of spectrum sensing
    delay on the proposed Markov model [24], [25]. In an optimal spectrum handoff
    scheme which is designed for the Cognitive Mobile ad-hoc networks developed co-operative
    spectrum searching approach is designed. Also a geographical approach is utilized
    to deal with space handoff. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless architectures
    and dynamic spectrum access techniques. However, CR networks impose challenges
    due to the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, as well as the diverse
    QoS requirements of various applications. Spectrum management functions can address
    these challenges for the realization of this new network paradigm. To provide
    a better understanding of CR networks, this article presents recent developments
    and open research issues in spectrum management in CR networks. More specifically,
    the discussion is focused on the development of CR networks that require no modification
    of existing networks. First, a brief overview of cognitive radio and the CR network
    architecture is provided. Then four main challenges of spectrum management are
    discussed: spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum

    10.1109/MCOM.2008.4481339 Publisher: IEEE Introduction Current wireless networks
    are characterized by a static spectrum allocation policy, where governmental agencies
    assign wireless spectrum to license holders on a long-term basis for large geographical
    regions. Recently, because of the increase in spectrum demand, this policy faces
    spectrum scarcity in particular spectrum bands. In contrast, a large portion of
    the assigned spectrum is used sporadically, leading to underutilization of a significant
    amount of spectrum [1]. Hence, dynamic spectrum access techniques were recently
    proposed to solve these spectrum inefficiency problems. Sign in to Continue Reading

    radio has been regarded as a technology that guarantees a significant increase
    in spectrum utilization efficiency. Depending on this technology; spectrum management,
    spectrum sensing and spectrum handoff have emerged. In cognitive radio networks,
    how the frequency channels are to be assigned between users is at the top of the
    newsworthy topics. In addition, it is also the current topic to reduce the delay
    to the minimum in the spectrum handoff process. In the case of minimizing a value,
    optimization algorithms should be utilized. In recent times, the widely used artificial
    bee colony algorithm has an important place among all the optimization algorithms.
    In this study, firstly designed spectrum handoff model is presented and then artificial
    bee colony based spectrum handoff algorithm is developed. In the developed algorithm,
    the channel availability characteristic is examined based on the position of the
    bees in the artificial bee colony algorithm in order to optimize the spectrum
    handoff delay. With the help of the algorithm developed using the artificial bee
    colony, the spectrum handoff delay of the secondary users is significantly reduced
    and total service time is increased. Published in: 2017 25th Signal Processing

    News Home Full-text access for editors Analysis of spectrum handoff schemes for
    cognitive radio networks considering secondary user mobility by K.S. Preetha;
    S. Kalaivani International Journal of Grid and Utility Computing (IJGUC), Vol.
    11, No. 4, 2020  Abstract: Cognitive radio has been proposed as an intelligent
    wireless communication system towards the usage of dynamic spectrum access in
    next generation networks, where the primary users (PU) and secondary users (SU)
    can share the spectrum, while causing minimum interference to each other. Spectrum
    mobility is the main element for the effective execution of cognitive radio networks.
    Spectrum mobility can be achieved by means of spectrum handoff (SHO). Initially,
    SUs continuously sense the channels to identify an idle channel. Error in sensing
    channel is possible. A detection theory is put forth to analyse the spectrum-sensing
    errors with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) considering false alarm
    probability, missed detection and detection probability. Also, we meticulously
    investigate and analyse the probability of spectrum handoff (PSHO) with lognormal-3
    and Hyper-Erlang distribution models considering SU call duration and residual
    time of spectrum holes availability designed for tele-traffic analysis. Online

    (CRN) focus to enable Secondary Users (SU) to use unutilized Primary User''s (PU)
    spectrum bands and thereby resolve spectrum scarcity. Spectrum sensing and spectrum
    handoff are critical operations of CRN. Energy detection is a less complex and
    feasible spectrum sensing method. However, its performance needs to be boosted
    in low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) regions. In case of spectrum handoff, the CRN
    will have to choose the optimal network from the environment to continue transmission.
    Maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS) during and after the handoff is a challenging
    task. To jointly resolve these issues, we have proposed an adaptive threshold
    based energy detection scheme for spectrum sensing and the application of Multiple
    Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods for spectrum handoff. The numerical results
    show that the proposed adaptive threshold method provides nearly 4 times better
    performance than the conventional fixed threshold method at low SNR regions. In
    addition, the proposed MADM methods are found to be efficient for choosing the
    best network for spectrum handoff. This paper illustrates that the proposed spectrum
    sensing and handoff schemes jointly increase the performance of the CRN. Published

    future, numerous new wireless networks for voice, data and video services are
    expected to flourish. This would cause the current problem of spectrum scarcity
    to become a more serious issue. Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) have proven to
    be a feasible solution to the problem of spectrum insufficiency. Underutilization
    of the spectrum band by the licensed users gives rise to spectrum holes. CRN implement
    Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) and therefore improve spectrum utilization.
    They exploit the unutilized spectrum holes by allocating them to unlicensed users.
    When the primary user is not using its allocated spectrum, the secondary users
    occupy its spectrum bands. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: A cognitive radio (CR) is very significant technology
    to use a spectrum dynamically in wireless communication networks. However, very
    little has been done on using the spectrum usage patterns to handle with the problem
    of spectrum allocation in dynamic spectrum access. We suggest a scheme by exploiting
    spectrum usage patterns for the efficient spectrum management and reduce the communication
    cost in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). We propose the following three factors
    into account: spectrum sensing scheme with a sleep mode, spectrum decision scheme
    with a probability of spectrum access and spectrum handoff scheme with back-off
    time. All factors make use of spectrum usage patterns based on the statistical
    information. The first factor reduces the number of spectrum sensing. The second
    increases the opportunity of spectrum access and the last decreases the number
    of spectrum handoff. First of all, our proposed spectrum management scheme considers
    the analysis of the spectrum usage patterns and various factors obtained from
    the analysis is applied to lessen the communication cost in CRNs. The simulation
    results show that our proposed scheme improve the efficiency of spectrum management
    in dynamic spectrum access. Published in: 2010 24th IEEE International Conference

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India I. Introduction The radio
    spectrum is naturally limited, which is widely used as a crucial medium for bridging
    between transmitter and receiver in wireless communication. The radio spectrum
    is authorized and regulated by government or government-aided organization like
    TRAI (Telecommunication Regulatory and Authority of India) in India. These regulatory
    authorities are statically assigned the spectrum to different purpose wireless
    communication in military and civil use. The radio spectrum is a scarce resource
    and no more available band left for future wireless communication. The frequency
    allocation chart in India is released by the ministry of communication and IT
    under Government of India and it''s illustrated in Fig. 1 [4]. In this allocation,
    some of the bands are allocated to unlicensed users and it can be used freely
    by any users for developing and using some wireless technology. In this static
    allocation, the large portion of the licensed spectrum is used occasionally and
    inefficiently. At the same time, unlicensed band users are increased due to the
    role of new wireless applications [17]. To solve the inefficient use of licensed
    portion and give more usage opportunity to the unlicensed users, dynamic spectrum
    usage technology proposed in Cognitive Radio (CR) by Mitola[10]. CR definition
    adapted by FCC is “ Cognitive radio: A radio or system that senses its operational
    electromagnetic environment and can dynamically and autonomously adjust its radio
    operating parameters to modify system operation, such as maximize throughput,
    mitigate inference, facilitate interoperability, access secondary markets” [3].

    Metrics Abstract: Multimedia applications have been becoming a majority type of
    traffic over cognitive radio network (CRN). Considering the different delay requirements
    of heterogeneous multimedia applications, we classified the secondary users (SUs)
    into four priority classes. Due to delay-sensitive nature of real-time (RT) multimedia
    services, we give it high priority to access channels. Non-real-time (NRT) traffic
    is characterized as delay-insensitive. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic spectrum
    handoff scheme with finite-size buffer queues to store preempted SUs which aims
    at avoiding the dropping events even though slightly increase the blocking probability.
    The finite-size buffer queue can avoid too many RT traffics piling up. Through
    limiting the buffer size the NRT traffics can get a fair chance to use channels.
    Additionally, spectrum sensing and channel allocation are controlled by a central
    base station (CBS). Such centralized admission control mechanism can efficiently
    prevent multiple SUs from simultaneously requesting to access the same spectrum
    band, consequently, to protect the channel form SUs'' collision. A preemptive
    resume priority (PRP) M/M/c/c+k Markov model is established to analysis the performance,
    including the blocking probability, the throughput of SUs and the average completion
    time of RT traffic. The results show that the proposed scheme can meet the various
    performance requirements of heterogeneous multi-media applications. Moreover,
    the buffer mechanism can improve the channel utilization considerably. Published

    Location: Chengdu, China SECTION 1. Introduction With the enormous spread of multimedia
    applications such as peer to peer (P2P) multimedia networks, Voice over IP (VoIP)
    and wireless devices have increased the requirements of spectrum resources. Cognitive
    radio technique is a more flexible and comprehensive spectrum management scheme
    which is also covering the shortage of fixed spectrum assignment scheme [1]. In
    a cognitive radio network (CRN), secondary users (SUs) operate in an opportunistic
    manner which means they can access spectrum resources if the primary users (PUs)
    temporarily leave. Once the PUs reoccupy the channel, the SU s oblige to return
    the channel and handoff to other vacant channels to resume the unfinished transmission.
    Therefore, the cumulative delay resulting from multiple handoffs is the key factor
    to guarantee the quality-of-service (QoS) [2]. In the previous literature of the
    spectrum handoff scheme over the CRN, some researches adopted dynamical spectrum
    access (DSA) with a channel reservation scheme to guarantee the transmission continuity.
    In [3] [4], both of them adopted a channel reservation scheme to reduce the forced
    termination probability at the expense of slightly increase blocking probability.
    However, channel reservation scheme wastes some valid channels because reserved
    channels only can be used by handoff users. New arrived users have no right to
    access reserved channels even if there is no handoff user occupies them. Buffering
    mechanism as a more optimal solution is introduced in some researches. In [5],
    the authors proposed a finite buffer queue to temporarily maintain the SUs'' request
    on their arrival when all channels are occupied instead of directly blocking SUs.
    In [6] [7], the authors proposed multi-priority strategy to meet the performance
    requirements of heterogeneous SUs'' traffics. But it is highly likely that two
    or more users may simultaneously request to access the same spectrum band. Most
    of research adopted admission control to coordinate transmission such as in [5]
    [8]. Almost none of these priori researches attempt to integrate the buffer mechanism,
    admission control scheduling policy and the prioritized strategy to improve the
    performance of multi - media transmission. In this paper, we proposed a novel
    dynamic spectrum handoff scheme for SUs with different priorities and buffer mechanism.
    It is noteworthy that we designed a special preemptive resume discipline to avoid
    force terminating in spite of increasing the blocking probability slightly. Except
    for PUs own the highest priority to access channel, we assume that there are four
    priority classes of SUs. In order to avoid dropping the preempted traffics that
    can not execute handoff to available channels immediately, a finite-size buffer
    queue was introduced to store them temporally. Through this way the suspended
    traffics in the buffer queue will resume transmission once the channels become
    idle. Additionally, spectrum sensing and channel allocation are controlled by
    a central base station (CBS) which means there is no necessary to detect the spectrum
    utilization behavior by every single SU. A preemptive resume priority M/M/c/c+k
    queuing network model is employed to analyze the proposed scheme. Furthermore,
    performance metrics are developed with respect to the blocking probability, the
    throughput of SUs and the average completion time of RT multimedia service. The
    main contributions, which also indicate the major extension of the previous works,
    of this paper are as fol-lows: 1. RT and NRT traffics which represent the delay-sensitive
    and delay-insensitive traffics respectively were given different priorities to
    access channels. In addition, we have distinguished the priority between preempted
    traffics and new arrival traffics. 2. A novel preemptive resumes discipline was
    designed to protect SUs'' transmission from force terminating. 3. The average
    completion time of RT multimedia service and the throughput of NRT traffic were
    derived by Markov approach. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
    section II, we will describe the proposed dynamical spectrum handoff scheme. Section
    III we present the mathematical derivation of performance metrics. In section
    IV, the numerical results were provided; Finally we draw conclusions in Section
    V. SECTION II. Proposed Dynamical Spectrum Hand Off Scheme A. Prioritization of

    classified into two types, namely, PUs and SUs. Due to SUs adopted opportunistic
    spectrum access strategy, they are required to leave the channels once the PUs
    reoccupy the channel and handoff to other vacant channels to protect the PUs''
    transmissions. Therefore, the SUs'' transmission can be preempted at any time
    by the random access of PUs. Prior researches rarely consider the efficient spectrum
    handoff for preempted SUs; most of researches avoid dealing with preempted SUs
    and prefer taking random access channel strategy. In this paper, we treat preempted
    and new SUs as different priority classes of users. Preempted SUs have higher
    priority than new ones to access channels but preempted SUs have no preemptive
    priority to interrupt homogeneous new arrival users. From another perspective,
    the SUs also can be classified into two types: RT multimedia service and NRT traffics.
    RT traffics have preemptive priority to interrupt NRT traffics'' transmission.
    All situations considered, we assume that there are four priority classes of SUs,
    which are listed in TABEL I. When allocate channels to SUs we should firstly compare
    preemptive priority then access priority. B. Spectrum Handoff Strategy with Admission
    Control The existing conventional method of spectrum selection is chosen a channel
    from a set of target channels according to some selection criteria. The detection
    and selection process are accomplished by SUs themselves independently without
    decision-making information exchanging. In such a selection process, it is likely
    that two or more active users try to transmit data over the same channel at the
    same time which resulted in a collision. Consequently, collision leads to degenerate
    the system performance. In this paper, we adopted centralized admission control
    scheme to achieve the goal of prompt information exchange. A CBS will take the
    place of SUs to scan the entire channel utilization situation periodically and
    update the candidate set of target channels for SUs. In the proposed scheme, there
    are high-priority and low-priority buffer queue for SUs. Before the channel assignment,
    preempted/new RT/NRT users will enter the corresponding queue to waiting for the
    control information from CBS. Table I Prioritized classes of SUS C. Illustration
    of Spectrum Handoff Process In a priority-based CRN, low-priority users have to
    handoff when high-priority users appeared. The preempted user has to be temporarily
    broken transmission during the handoff process until a new available channel is
    discovered and then the unfinished traffic is successfully switched to the new
    channel. In this paper, the waiting time, includes the handoff delay and channel
    selection delay, during the handoff process is assumed too short to be neglected.
    We are more concerned about the completion time T c which refers to the period
    from the transmission start till the transmission end. The completion time is
    mainly consisted of traffic services time T s and the cumulative delay time T
    D during the transmission. A connection of low-priority user might be preempted
    several times due to the high-priority user intermittent activity on the channels.
    Fig. 1 illustrates an example of spectrum handoff process in the priority-based
    CRN. As new arrival traffic, it should enter into the corresponding priority queue
    and wait at the queue tail until all prior users are delivered out. As preempted
    traffic, it has priority to access channels than new arrival homogeneous traffic
    so that it will wait in the queue before new arrival traffic. The CBS will preferentially
    assign available channels to users in the high priority queue then satisfy the
    demand of low priority queue. In the example, the spectrum handoff process with
    multiple interrupted can be described as follows: At the beginning, a preempted
    RT traffic resumed transmission at C h2. When a PU appears at the same channel
    lead to the interruption events happened and the RT traffic was preempted again.
    According to the information from CBS, the RT traffic will decide the target channels
    (Ch1, …, Chn). The RT traffic switches its operating channel to the idle channel
    Ch1 and resumes the unfinished traffic. The second preempted occurs soon, unfortunately,
    all the channels were occupied by high-priority users so that there was no target
    channel for handoff. Due to the RT traffic can not execute handoff immedi-ately’
    it has to enter the buffer queue and waiting for the chance to resume the transmission.
    Finally, the RT traffic completes the transmission until it access channel again
    at Ch2. Fig. 1. Illustration of the priority-based CRN architecture Show All From
    this example, it shows the biggest differences between the way of always staying
    on the operating channel and the way of waiting in the buffer queue. The advantage
    of waiting in the buffer queue is SUs can get service once there are vacant channels
    in the network. However, the way of always staying means that the waiting users
    can not resume service even if the other channels were idle. SECTION III. Performance
    Evaluation A. System Assumption In the considered CRN system, we assume that a
    channel is a basic spectrum resource unit and the spectrum resource is divided
    into c independent channels. There are two types of users: PUs and SUs. Additionally,
    the SUs can be subdivided as preempted/new arrival RT/NRT traffics. A PRP M/M/c/c+k
    queuing model is proposed to characterize the spectrum utilization where c+k is
    the waiting positions in the buffer queue for preempted and new arrival SUs. The
    key features of the proposed PRP M/M/c/c+k queuing model are as follows: Each
    channel can service one user at any time. For the sake of preemptive resume priority
    (PRP) dis-cipline, the high priority class of users has the right to preempt the
    low priority class of users. The preempted users can resume unfinished transmit-ssion
    at any available channel instead of stay at the prior operating channel. The arrival
    of PUs, RT multimedia service and NRT traffics follow the Poisson process with
    mean rates of λ p and λ nrt ; and the service time is an exponentially distribution
    random variable with mean rates of μ −1 p , μ −1 rt and μ −1 nrt . B. Analytical
    Model for Spectrum Handoff with Finite Buffer This system is formulated as a PRP
    M/M/c/c+k queuing model. We assume that there are c channels provided to all users
    to transmit and c+k waiting positions for preempted users to maintain unfinished
    work and new arrival users to waiting for vacant channels. In fact the CRN system
    can load a maximum number of 2c+k users. But we just allowed c+k SUs enter into
    the buffer queue at the same time otherwise SUs will be blocked. The advantage
    of this principle is even if all the channels were occupied by PUs there is sufficient
    space to store the preempted SUs instead of force terminate the ongoing transmission.
    Let S( i p , i rt , i nrt ; j p , j rt , j nrt ) represents the system state,
    simplified as S, where i p “ i rt and i nrt represent the number of PU, RT and
    NRT traffics in the system; Similarly, j p , j rt and j nrt represent the number
    of PU, RT and NRT traffics currently on-going over channels, respectively. For
    a valid state space Ω should satisfy the following conditions: Ω={S( i p i rt
    , i nrt ; j p , j rt , j nrt )| i p ≤c; i rt + i nrt ≤c+k; j p + j rt + j nrt
    ≤c| j p = i p) j rt =minc− j p , i rt; j nrt =minc− j p − j rt , i nrt } View
    Source It is noteworthy that in the state the number of on-going services j m
    ., m=(p,rt,nrt) always can be expressed by the total number of traffics in the
    system i m , “ m=(p,rt,nrt) . Due to the preemptive nature of priority, when there
    is a high-priority customer in the system, it will be in service. In other words,
    the channel resources have to meet demand of highest priority customer firstly;
    then satisfy the closely followed priority customer. The on-going services of
    PUs will always occupy same amount of channels j p = i p ). The secondary priority
    class of RT multimedia service can access channels if there are RT in the system
    and the number of channels used by PUs is less than c so we can get the equation
    j rt =min(c− j p , i rt ) . For the same reason, j nrt =min(c− j p − j rt , i
    nrt ) Let π s be the steady state probability distribution for the state S∈Ω .
    In order to simplify the balance equation, we introduce an indicator function
    φ s be equal to one if the state S∈Ω and zero otherwise. A quick reference of
    some symbols with descriptions frequently used in this paper is given in TABLE
    II. Table II Definitions of symbols The transitions for state S( i p , i rt ,
    i nrt ; j p , j rt , j nrt ) are explained by using Fig. 2. For convenience, a
    simplified representation for system state was introduced. For example 5 ′ ( i
    p , i rt , i nrt ; j p , j rt , j nrt )⇒ S ′ ( i p , i rt , i nrt ; j ′ p , j
    ′ rt , j ′ nrt ) equally expressed as S( i p )⇒ S ′ ( i p+1 ) . The system dynamics
    are triggered by the following events: PU arrival. There are two situations for
    a PU arrival. S( i p )⇒ S ′ ( i p+1 ), τ s( i p ) s ′ ( i p +1) = φ s ′ ( i p
    +1) λ p where φ s ′ ( i p +1) indicate that the s( i p +1)∈Ω S ′ ( i p−1 )⇒S(
    i p ), T s ′ ( i p −1) s( i p ) = φ s ′ ( i p −1) λ p PU departure. There are
    two situations for PU departure. S( i p )⇒ S ′ ( i p−1 ), T s( i p ) s ′ ( i p
    −1) = φ s ′ ( i p −1) j p μ p S ′ ( i p+1 )⇒S( i p ), T s( i p +1) s( i p ) =
    φ s ′ ( i p +1) j ′ p μ p RT multimedia service arrival. There are two situations
    for a RT multimedia service arrival. S( i rt )⇒ S ′ ( i rt+1 ), T s( i rt ) s
    ′ ( i rt +1) = φ s ′ ( i rt +1) λ rt S ′ ( i rt−1 )⇒S( i rt ), T s( i rt −1) s(
    i rt ) = φ s ′ ( i rt −1) λ rt RT multimedia service completion. There are two
    situations for a RT multimedia service completion. S( i rt )⇒ S ′ ( i rt−1 ),
    τ s( i rt ) s ′ ( i rt −1) = φ s ′ ( i rt −1) j rt μ rt S ′ ( i rt+1 )⇒S( i rt
    ), T s( i rt +1) s( i rt ) = φ s ′ ( x rt +1) j ′ rt μ rt NRT traffic arrival.
    There are two situations for a NRT traffic arrival. S( i nr )⇒ S ′ ( i nr+1 ),
    τ s( i nr ) s ′ ( i nr +1) = φ s ′ ( i nr +1) λ nr S ′ ( i nr−1 )⇒S( i nr ), T
    s( i nr −1) s( i pr ) = φ s ′ ( i pr −1) λ nr NRT traffic departure. There are
    two situations for a NRT traffic arrival. S( i nr )⇒ S ′ ( i nr−1 ), T s( i nr

    analysis, we developed the global balance equation as: [ ∑ m={p,rt,nr} T s( i

    Average Completion Time of Rt Multimedia Service In this part, we will focus on
    the analysis of the completion time T c of RT multimedia service, which is a meaningful
    performance metric for delay-sensitive traffic. In an ideal case, the RT traffic
    completes transmission during a continual period without any interruption. However,
    during the transmission process may encounter multiple interruptions from PUs
    which is mainly contributed to the cumulative delay. We introduce two i.i.d random
    variables T s and T D denote the service time and the cumulative delay respectively.
    In this paper, we neglect the handoff time hence the completion time consists
    of service time and the cumulative delay. Then, the expectation of completion
    time can be expressed as: E[ T c ]=E[ T s ]+E[ T D ] (3) View Source We assume
    T s follows the exponential distribution with mean of μ −1 rt . Even if traffics
    encounter interruption, the remainder service time T R s still follows the same
    distribution because of the memoryless property. So that the expectation of service
    time can be divided into two parts: E[ T s ]=E[ X s ]+E[ T s |H=n]P(H=n) (4) View
    Source Where E[ X s ]= μ −1 rt denotes the mean service time without interruption;
    and E[ T s |H=n] denotes the mean service time of transmission surfer from n times
    interruptions. E[ T S |H=n]= ∑ n i=1 ( T R s ) (i) is erlang distribution with
    mean of n μ −1 rt .P(H=n) is the probability of service encounter n times interruptions.
    The probability of RT multimedia service encounters the interruption is given
    by: P r = ∑ {S| j p + j rt =c} 1 j rt π s ∑ {S| j rt >0} π s (5) View Source Fig.
    3. Waiting delay for preempted RT traffic Show All During the RT transmission
    period, each PU arrival events may lead to the RT preempted by the mean probability
    of P r Once the RT traffic was preempted means it has to enter into the buffer
    to suspend the service. We denote the P pre represents the probability of preempted
    events deduced as: P pre = λ p P r μ rt + λ p P r (6) View Source Then P(H=n)=
    P n pre (7) View Source Without loss of generality, we consider a preemption case
    shown in Fig. 3. A newly preemptive event arrival at T=t , at this moment there
    are m prior users in the buffer queue and all the channels are occupied. According
    to the admission control strategy, the head-of-line user can get service if any
    users complete transmission and departure the channel. We denote the minimum latency
    for the head-of-line as T min where T min =min{ T R(1) s , T R(2) s , T R(n) s
    } is submitted to minimum distribution. If T R(i) s represents the remainder service
    time of PUs or RT traffics at channel i. F i (t) represents the CDF of remainder
    service time. Then, we can get the CDF of minimum latency T min (t)=1−[1− F 1
    (t)⌉⌈1− F 2 (t)⌉⌈1− F n (t)] and the expectation of T min , E[ T min ]= ∫ ∞ 0
    td[ T min (t)] For the m+1 preempted user, the delay time T d is given by E[ T
    d ]=(m+1)E[ T min ] (8) View Source For the n th preempted users, the cumulative
    delay time is express as E[ T D ]= ∑ n=1 ∞ E[ T d |H=n]P(H=n) (9) View Source
    D. Performance Analysis In this part, we will study the performance metrics of
    different priority classes of users according to their special characteristics.
    For the system performance, the blocking probability and throughput are key measurement
    metrics. For NRT traffic, we are more concerned with the throughput capacity rather
    than the delay time. Due to the delay-sensitive feature, the average completion
    time is the most intuitive metric to evaluate the performance of RT traffic. Blocking
    probability of SUs. The blocking event will happen when the number of SUs in the
    system is equal to c+k , thus, blocking probability is given by P b = ∑ {S( i
    p , i rt , i nrt , j p , j rt , j nrt )| i rt + i nrt =c+k} π s (10) View Source
    The throughput of SUs and NRT traffic. It is defined as the average number of
    completed service for traffic per second. ρ= ∑ {S∈ω} j rt μ rt π s + ∑ {S∈ω} j

    completion time of RT multimedia service. Substituting (4)–(9) into (3), we can
    obtain the closed-form expression for the completion time: E[ T c ]= μ −1 rt +
    ∑ n=1 ∞ [n μ −1 rt +n(m+1) ∫ ∞ 0 td[ T min (t)]( λ p P r μ rt + λ p P r ) n View
    Source SECTION IV. Numerical Results In this section, the simulation and numerical
    results are presented to evaluate the performance of proposed scheme. We will
    compare three types of scheme: 1. without buffer mechanism scheme (WOB). In this
    scheme, new arrival users will be blocked directly and preempted users will be
    dropped. 2. without priority scheme (WOP). We assume that all of the SUs in this
    scheme follow First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling policy. 3. Proposed scheme
    with priority and buffer mechanism (WPB). In our simulation experiment, we use
    the following parameters: c=3 , k=2 , λ p =0.2,0.3,1.1,12.2 , λ rt =1.8 , λ nrt
    =1.5 , u (−1) p =1.8 :, μ (−1) rt =2 :, μ (−1) nrt =1.4 . The simulation time
    is 10 000s. As show in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we compare the throughput of SUs and
    NRT traffics under these three different schemes. In both figures, the throughput
    of SUs, NRT traffics as one kind of SUs, will decrease slowly with the increase
    of PUs arrive rate. This is because the more frequently the PUs access the less
    efficiency of channel utilization for the SUs. Even the PUs arrive rate remains
    the same, the proposed scheme over performance than the other two schemes. In
    other words, the WPB reach the largest throughput and the WOB has the minimum
    throughput among these three schemes. This result indicates that the buffer mechanism
    work well in the function of maintain the SUs handoff request which indirectly
    improve the throughput. Fig. 6 shows the average completion time of RT traffic.
    Because the FCFS rule cause the longer waiting time for the RT traffics, the scheme
    without priority has the longest completion time among these schemes. The proposed
    scheme with prioritized SUs can shorten completion time obviously. However, the
    blocked and preempted users will not add into the statistic samples in the scheme
    without buffer so that the completion time almost equal to the service time of
    RT traffics. Fig. 7 shows the blocking probability of SUs. We can see that the
    schemes with buffer have significant low blocking probability than the scheme
    without buffer which is intuitively understandable. Due to the prioritization,
    the proposed scheme can further reduce the blocking probability than the scheme
    without priority. Fig. 4. Throughput of NRT traffics Show All Fig. 5. Throughput

    a prioritized spectrum handoff scheme with buffer mechanism to improve the performance
    of multimedia transmission in CRN. The proposed scheme gives preference for preempted
    users and protects the SUs from force termination. A PRP M/M/c/c+k queue model
    is established to analysis the scheme. We have derived the blocking probability,
    the throughput of SUs and NRT traffic and the completion time of RT traffic. The
    analytical results have been confirmed through simulation. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This

    well known that cognitive radio (CR) techniques have great potential to deal with
    the problem of radio spectrum scarcity. Spectrum sensing technique plays a critical
    role in enabling unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to utilize spectrum holes in
    cognitive radio networks (CRNs). However, a licensed primary user (PU) can be
    appropriately protected by simultaneously performing spectrum sensing and data
    transmission i.e., by using full-duplex (FD) mode. In this paper, we have proposed
    and analyzed a strategy which includes spectrum sensing and spectrum access mechanisms
    both. We consider heterogeneous traffic of real-time and non real-time SUs based
    on their different delay tolerance characteristics. We address the issue of false
    alarm rate (FAR) associated with FD sensing. Spectrum handoff and call buffering
    strategies with p -Retry policy are employed jointly so that SUs that would otherwise
    be blocked or forcibly dropped could be buffered and possibly served later. To
    evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy, five-dimensional continuous
    time Markov chain (CTMC) model is developed and the queueing-theoretic approach
    is utilized. Numerical results demonstrate the influence of spectrum sensing errors
    on the performance of such CRNs. Results also reveal that the provision of buffers
    under retrial policy increases the overall network resource utilization while
    decreasing blocking and dropping probabilities. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION 1 Introduction The mobile traffic has
    experienced exponential growth due to the rapid increase in demand of applications
    such as video streaming and massive machine-to-machine (M2M) communication [1].
    The fifth generation (5G) of mobile communications is expected to cater for wider
    range of applications which are beyond the capability of previous generations,
    requiring radio spectrum to be efficiently utilized [2]. On the technology front,
    cognitive radios (CRs) are envisioned as a 5G enabler that helps to alleviate
    the apparent spectrum scarcity problem [3]. Authors in [4], [5] have found that
    the spectrum can be reused using CR technology from cellular or televisions (TV)
    bands. In general, CRs are equipped with computational intelligence to sense,
    learn and dynamically adapt to its radio environment. Hence, CRs allow unlicensed
    users (i.e., secondary users (SUs)) the opportunistic use of underutilized licensed
    spectrum owned by primary users (PUs) through Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) [6],
    [7]. However, opportunistic access with interference avoidance faces a multitude
    of challenges in determining the spectrum holes and detecting the presence of
    PU in a multiuser environment. Therefore, spectrum sensing is the crucial functionality
    in the operation of CR networks (CRNs), enabling to use the best spectrum opportunities
    with minimal interference on licensed user signals. The imperfect or unreliable
    spectrum sensing significantly affects the system performance, hence its impact
    cannot be ignored. We conduct our research to see the effectiveness of prominent
    sensing errors i.e., false-alarms and misdetections. The false alarm of PUs’ presence
    on the channel restricts the SUs to access the channel which results in resource
    wastage i.e., spectrum wastage. On the other hand, the misdetection enables SUs
    to establish communication simultaneous to the PU which results to data-collision/loss
    with the interference at PU. In [8], a periodical transmitting-sensing based approach
    i.e., half-duplex (HD) mode has been deployed where sensing is performed by the
    incoming SUs before transmission. However, such an approach not only sacrifices
    transmission time for spectrum sensing, but may also lead to a collision when
    PUs arrive and waste of spectrum when PUs leave owing to SUs cannot detect the
    change of PUs’ status (active or inactive) during the transmission period. In
    view of this, while focusing on the Massive-Capacity application scenario in 5G,
    with the aim to meet the network extremely high flow density requirements, we
    have used full-duplex (FD) spectrum sensing, in which SU can simultaneously perform
    spectrum sensing and data transmission [9]. It can not only reduce the probability
    of collision with PUs, but also improve the efficiency of spectrum usage by detecting
    the available spectrum holes quickly and accurately [10]. An important issue while
    performing FD sensing is the false alarm rate, which is addressed in the present
    work. The frequent occurrence of false alarms makes it challenging for SUs to
    efficiently explore and utilize the spectrum opportunities and thereby severely
    degrades their quality of service (QoS) [11]. In order to characterize false alarm
    occurrences for ongoing SUs, we consider the average number of false alarms per
    unit time, modeled by a Poisson process. The evolving 5G networks are envisioned
    to provide services that have different QoS and Quality of Experience (QoE) (e.g.,
    ultra-high definition video streaming, web browsing and tactile Internet), so
    heterogeneous traffic environment becomes a must [12]. Based on the delay tolerance
    of different traffic services, the present study facilitates heterogeneous SUs
    i.e., real-time SUs (RSUs) and non-real time SUs (NRSUs). In accordance with the
    significant impact of PU traffic on SUs’ operations, we study the interactions
    of both SUs and PUs collectively enabling the spectrum handoff capability. Different
    DSA strategies [13], [14] have been proposed in the literature. The authors in
    [15] presented the analysis of channel availability by employing spectrum handoff
    under unreliable sensing. The results depict that the execution of scheme with
    spectrum handoff results in higher channel availability than its execution without
    spectrum handoff. However, the blocking probability and the forced dropping probability
    of SUs grow rapidly with the increment in arrival rates of PU and SU. Thus, how
    to diminish probabilities of blocking and forced dropping for SUs despite higher
    user arrival rates brings up an interesting question. Motivated by these observations,
    we propose in this paper a new queue-based spectrum access strategy supporting
    heterogeneous users under imperfect spectrum sensing. The proposed scheme aims
    to enhance the performance of CRNs by providing SUs with the ability of dynamically
    seeking and exploiting opportunities without interfering with PUs. For the performance
    evaluation of the proposed scheme, five-dimensional continuous time Markov chain
    (CTMC) model is developed which considers all sensing related factors that have
    not been fully accounted in previous studies. Based on this, different performance
    metrics including blocking probability, dropping probability, forced termination
    probability, throughput and overall spectrum utilization of the system are derived
    and the queueing-theoretic approach is utilized for analysis of the considered
    system. In brief, the contributions of our work are summarized as follows: A joint
    analysis of spectrum sensing and spectrum access mechanisms is proposed. To study
    the effect of imperfect spectrum sensing, an analytical frame structure is analyzed
    for heterogeneous traffic in CRNs wherein the data transmission and sensing are
    the parallel phenomenon. Unlike existing works, the proposed strategy thoroughly
    investigates the effect of false alarm rates (FARs) on the performance of CRNs
    by taking state dependent transition rates into account. We develop a queue-based
    solution to reduce the blocking probability and the forced dropping probability
    considering two types of SUs i.e., real-time SUs (RSUs) and non real-time SUs
    (NRSUs). We introduce two buffers which are dedicated for allocation to newly
    arriving NRSUs and the interrupted NRSUs performing handoff, respectively. To
    further enhance the throughput of SUs, p -Retry policy is utilized for queueing
    in the proposed scheme. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. An
    overview of the related work is given in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe
    the system model together with the assumptions. Section 4 presents the proposed
    scheme and an extensive analytical model based on multi-dimensional CTMC. Following
    this, in Section 5, we obtain the solution for stationary distribution and derive
    relevant performance metrics of the system. In Section 6, we present and discuss
    the main numerical results and thereafter conclude the paper in Section 7. SECTION
    2 Related Work To detect the appearance of PU in CRNs, several studies have been
    proposed in recent years. In [16], the authors investigated the issues of maximizing
    the overall discovery of opportunities in the available spectrum and minimizing
    the delay in locating a vacant channel in order to minimize the interference on
    returning PUs. The authors in [17] formulate a sensing throughput trade-off problem
    to maximize the achievable throughput for the SUs under the constraint that the
    PUs are sufficiently protected. In [18], a queueing framework was developed for
    joint spectrum sensing and access by considering the effect of spectrum sensing
    errors on the performance of the SUs’ multiple channel access. Although the problem
    of interference is addressed in these works, contrary to our study, the underlying
    assumption made therein is that spectrum sensing and data transmission cannot
    be carried out simultaneously. That is, in order to perform sensing, it requires
    SU to periodically suspend its data transmission which results in the reduction
    of SUs’ throughput. In addition, the detection accuracy is also questionable in
    this technique as the sensing time duration is rather limited. To address this
    issue, the approach of full-duplex spectrum sensing has been studied in [19],
    [20], [21], [22], in which SUs can simultaneously perform spectrum sensing and
    data transmission. The authors in [23] analyzed the effect of imperfect sensing
    monitoring in high-traffic CRNs. In [24], [25] despite of considering the challenge
    of unnecessary false alarms, the authors did not analyze its impact on performance
    metrics such as throughput, blocking, termination and dropping probabilities.
    Further, in [26], [27], several types of unreliable sensing for both incoming
    and ongoing SUs were analyzed by employing a buffer for ongoing SUs. Therein,
    the authors investigated their effect on the performance of CRNs. Energy efficiency
    for cooperative spectrum sensing was studied in [28]. Owing to fading and noisy
    environment, the accuracy of individual SUs’ decisions may get compromised. Subsequently,
    the cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm was proposed in [28], where multiple
    SUs may cooperate to improve the decision making process. A proactive partial
    collision free scheme based on imperfect spectrum sensing in cognitive Ad-hoc
    radio network was developed in [29]. Recently, statistical properties of a primary
    channel under imperfect spectrum sensing were analyzed in [30], where the effect
    of the probability of error and sensing period was also investigated. However,
    in all the aforementioned work, the problem of the FAR has not been investigated
    and the work is limited to homogeneous traffic of SUs. To reflect the realistic
    situation of delayed network access and to reduce the blocking and forced termination
    probabilities, designing effective queueing disciplines in CRNs also has gained
    importance [31]. Due to the preempted priority of PUs, the transmission of a SU
    is possible to get interrupted by a newly arriving PU. Once interrupted, the SU
    can either leave the system or wait in a buffer so that its connection is terminated
    or suspended, respectively. Some existing works assumed the forced termination
    of interrupted SUs’ connection which results in the higher termination rate of
    the SUs [32], [33]. On the other hand, some existing studies consider that instead
    of direct leaving, an interrupted SU is suspended to wait for future transmission
    in a buffer [34], [35]. However, this kind of definite suspension for retrial
    transmission (i.e., with probability 1), may cause a greater delay for the SU.
    It follows that the delay of SUs can be reduced to some extent by considering
    the suspension to wait in buffer with some retrial probability [36]. In addition,
    CRNs are required to support users having several traffic services with different
    QoS requirements. A spectrum sharing scheme with buffering for new as well as
    interrupted SUs supporting heterogeneous traffic has been proposed in [37]. The
    authors in [38] analyzed the queueing delay in CRN with heterogeneous services
    and channels, wherein the incoming heterogeneous traffic of SUs are inserted into
    the same queue in the arrival order. Later on, in [39], a queueing framework with
    channel assembling strategy was developed by introducing two separate queues for
    heterogeneous traffic of SUs. Further, to mitigate the effects of secondary call
    interruption in CRNs with heterogeneous traffic, different resource management
    mechanisms were evaluated and compared [40]. However, all of them assumed the
    spectrum sensing to be reliable. The main limitation of the available literature
    is that all the realistic elements and key factors are not modeled in a single
    work, which may affect the accuracy of the results. In the following section,
    we describe the analytical model in detail. SECTION 3 Network Scenario and Assumptions
    We consider a centralized multi-channel CRN architecture which contains a base
    station (BS) and multiple PUs and SUs. Spectrum allocation and management are
    coordinated by the BS which functions as the central controller in the network.
    To do so, the BS needs to collect information about the spectrum usage of both
    PUs and SUs as well as information about the transmission requirements of the
    SUs. Based on this information, a decision on dynamic channel access is made by
    the BS. The licensed spectrum band in the CRN consists of N∈ Z + number of frequency
    channels for PUs, where Z + denotes the set of positive integers. These channels
    are shared among PUs and SUs, with PUs having higher priority of accessing all
    the channels. The SUs are allowed to access the channels opportunistically when
    it is free from PU communication. The SUs perform spectrum sensing simultaneously
    along with data transmission as shown in Fig. 1. A newly arriving SU senses the
    whole PU channel with a bandwidth B for T s units of time. In accordance, if an
    initiating SU finds an idle channel, it makes use of the channel and starts its
    data transmission over a bandwidth of B− B G − B S . To reduce SU''s self-interference
    effect, a sufficient guard band subchannel is used i.e., B G . To determine the
    presence of a returning PU, the SU while transmitting monitors the PU channel,
    utilizing the bandwidth B S and makes sensing decision every T d units of time.
    As a PU re-accesses the channel (if correctly detected by the SU), the SU ceases
    its data transmission and leaves the channel. Fig. 1. Simultaneous sensing and
    data transmission. Show All The prominent errors associated with the spectrum
    sensing process are the false-alarms and mis-detections. Owing to unreliable sensing,
    each incoming SU correctly determines the presence of PU with probability P D1
    and falsely classifies an idle channel as busy with probability P FA1 . Likewise,
    each ongoing SU correctly determines the presence of an arriving PU with probability
    P D2 and falsely classifies an idle channel as busy with probability P FA2 . The
    corresponding mis-detection probabilities for incoming and ongoing SUs are P M1
    =1− P D1 and P M2 =1− P D2 , respectively. At each spectrum sensing decision epoch
    T d , a false alarm occurs with probability P FA2 and does not occur with probability
    1− P FA2 , independent of the decision outcome of the last sensing period. The
    FAR parameter, λ FAR is the product of the decision rate and the false alarm probability.
    It follows that, λ FAR is given by P FA2 / T d . Moreover, in order to avoid the
    occurrence of too many false alarms for successful SU operation, we assume that
    the sensing period T d is small i.e., the decision rate given by 1/ T d is large,
    and that the false alarm probability P FA2 is small. In consequence, as a limit
    of a shrinking Bernoulli process, the arrival process of false alarms can be approximated
    by a Poisson process with parameter λ FAR [41]. 3.1 Primary User Model We assume
    that PU services arrive at the network according to a Poisson process with rates
    λ 1 . The service times of PU services are exponentially distributed, with corresponding
    service rates per channel μ 1 . On the arrival of a new PU service, the PU occupies
    one of the available free channels, if it exists. In the case, where all channels
    are occupied while at least one channel is occupied by a SU, then one of those
    SUs is preempted and that channel is re-allocated to the newly arriving PU. However,
    if the arriving PU finds all the channels occupied by other PUs, then it gets
    blocked. Moreover, it is assumed that in case of a mis-detection, both PU and
    SU drop the channel due to the collision event because of the large “noise” incurred
    [33], [42]. 3.2 Secondary User Model In our analysis, we consider two types of
    SUs, i.e., real-time SUs (RSUs) and non real-time SUs (NRSUs). For presentation
    convenience, the term SU commonly represents both SUs. The arrivals of both RSU
    and NRSU services follow Poisson processes with rates λ 2 and λ 3 , respectively.
    Moreover, the service times for RSU and NRSU services are assumed to be exponentially
    distributed, with corresponding service rates per channel μ 2 and μ 3 , respectively.
    To deal with heterogeneous traffic, we have deployed two separate queues. The
    queue named as NQ (new buffer) is utilized for new NRSU arrivals with maximum
    size Q n while the queue named as PQ (handoff buffer) is used for interrupted
    NRSU services with maximum size Q h . When all the channels are found to be occupied
    by SUs or sensed (correctly or incorrectly) as PU occupied, a newly arriving NRSU
    will occupy a waiting position in NQ whereas a new RSU service will get blocked.
    In case of PU appearance, the SU should vacate its occupied channel and leave
    it to PU. Further, to resume its communication, the interrupted SU performs spectrum
    handoff to one of the other idle channels. However, if all the channels are found
    occupied, the interrupted RSU services will get drop whereas the interrupted NRSU
    services will either be suspended to the buffer PQ with probability p ( 0<p<1
    ) for later retrial transmission, or will leave the system with probability (1−p)
    and gives up its transmission. Accordingly, if the interrupted NRSU services can
    be queued for later retrial transmission, the forced dropping probability of NRSU
    services can be reduced, however, at a cost of longer queueing delay. Therefore,
    for delay-sensitive applications like real-time traffic, it is better not to feed
    the interrupted RSU services. In addition, we assume that the waiting interrupted
    NRSU services will receive higher priority than the waiting new NRSU services.
    The channels which become idle are allocated to the awaiting NRSUs in PQ and NQ
    buffer. The probability of selection of an NRSU service from NQ buffer is α (
    0<α<1 ), then the probability of its selection from PQ buffer is (1- α ), in a
    way giving higher priority to interrupted NRSU services i.e., α<0.5 . The BS detects
    the activity of PUs on the channels as well as when each channel access opportunity
    appear it selects a SU service, among many, that is to be processed. To manage
    the queues, the FCFS scheduling discipline is applied for each queue, i.e., the
    first user in the queue is the first service that is to be processed [43]. Moreover,
    when channel access opportunities appears, those opportunities are divided between
    the NQ and the PQ according to the assigned priority. Based on the above assumptions,
    we depict the proposed spectrum access strategy in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Illustration
    of the proposed queueing based spectrum access strategy with p -Retry policy.
    Show All SECTION 4 Markov Chain Modeling The system is modeled using a five-dimensional
    continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). At any instant, the system state is determined
    by x=(i,j,k,l,m) where i , j and k denotes the number of PUs, RSUs and NRSUs occupying
    the spectrum respectively, l represents the number of queued new NRSUs, and m
    represents the number of queued interrupted (handoff) NRSUs. The corresponding
    set of feasible states S in the CTMC model is given by S= {x | 0≤i≤N,0≤j≤N,0≤k≤N,  i+j+k≤N,0≤l≤
    Q n ,0≤m≤ Q h }. (1) View Source Because of the imperfect sensing, the number
    of PUs, NRSUs and RSUs will affect the channel searching results. In view of this,
    to accurately model CRN, the CTMC includes state-dependent (i.e., depending on
    the current state) transition rates by taking into account the number of users
    in the channel searching process. Each feasible state transition is associated
    with a given probability/rate. Consider the number of idle channels in state x=(i,j,k,l,m)
    to be r=N−i−j−k . For use in the sequel, we define the indicator variable, θ as
    θ= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ 0; 1; α; if l=0 if m=0 if l>0 and m>0. (2) View Source Since the
    number of states grows largely with the number of channels and buffer sizes in
    the system, recursive approach is utilized to derive CTMC transition rates. Function
    f(.) is used to define the increase in number of SUs by 1. We have the recursion
    f(i,r) = r i+r (1− P FA1 )+ r i+r P FA1 f(i,r−1)  + i i+r P D1 f(i−1,r). (3) View

    f(i,1)= 1 i+1 (1− P FA1 ) ∑ n=0 ∞ P i D1 . (5) View Source Also, we use the recursive
    function g(.) to define the decrease in number of PUs by 1. We get the recursion
    g(i,r)= i i+r P M1 + i i+r P D1 g(i−1,r) + r i+r P FA1 g(i,r−1). (6) View Source
    In the considered system, any of the following events can cause the system to
    change its state: PU requests or completes its services, RSU requests or completes
    its services or occurrence of FARs by RSU, or NRSU requests or completes its services
    or occurrence of FARs by NRSU. In what follows, we describe the system dynamics
    for all possible state transitions, with different conditions in the following
    subsections. 4.1 PU Events When a PU appears at the system, then it either selects
    a free channel with probability N−(i+j+k) N−i or preempts one of the ongoing RSU
    with probability j N−i or preempts one the ongoing NRSU with probability k N−i
    . Using the recursive approach, Table 1 lists the state transition rates associated
    with the PU events, wherein the generic state ( i,j,k,l,m ) transits to one of
    the following states: State ( i+1,j,k,l,m ) when one of the following three situations
    occur: First, when a new PU arrives on a free channel ( i+j+k<N ) and occupies
    it. Second, when a PU preempts an NRSU ( k>0 ) and that channel is re-allocated
    to the newly arriving PU, the interrupted NRSU performs handoff to an idle channel
    ( i+j+k<N ). Third, when a new PU preempts an RSU ( j>0 ) and the interrupted
    RSU performs handoff to another idle channel ( i+j+k<N ). TABLE 1 Transitions
    From a Generic State x=(i,j,k,l,m) x=(i,j,k,l,m) Upon PU Events State ( i+1,j,k−1,l,m
    ) when one of the following two situations occur: First, when a new PU preempts
    an NRSU ( k>0 ), the interrupted NRSU doesn''t find a free channel ( i+j+k=N )
    to perform handoff and chooses to leave the system. The second situation is when
    such interrupted NRSU decides to join the buffer PQ but finds the buffer full
    ( m= Q h ). As a result, the NRSU drops. State ( i+1,j−1,k,l,m ) when a new PU
    preempts an RSU ( j>0 ) but the interrupted RSU doesn''t find a free channel (
    i+j+k=N ) to perform spectrum handoff. As a result, the RSU drops. State ( i+1,j,k−1,l,m+1
    ) when a new PU preempts an NRSU ( k>0 ), the interrupted NRSU doesn''t find any
    other free channel ( i+j+k=N ) and gets queued in the buffer PQ ( m< Q h ). State
    ( i−1,j,k,l,m ) if both the buffers are empty ( l=m=0 ) and when one of the following
    situations occur: First, when an existing PU ( i>0 ) departs the system because
    of service completion. Second (third), when a newly arriving RSU (NRSU) mis-detects
    and ends up colliding with a PU after searching on a channel already occupied
    by the PU ( i>0 ). State ( i−1,j,k+1,l−1,m ) when a PU ( i>0 ) completes its service
    or an arriving RSU ends up colliding with a PU ( i>0 ) and that idle channel is
    allocated to the NRSU at the head of the new buffer NQ ( l>0 ). Likewise, in case
    if the idle channel is allocated to the NRSU at the head of the handoff buffer
    PQ ( m>0 ), transition to ( i−1,j,k+1,l,m−1 ) happens. 4.2 SU Events Analogous
    to the PU events, by utilizing the recursive approach, Tables 2 and 3 list the
    state transition rates associated with the RSU and NRSU events respectively, with
    different conditions. Note that therein, the condition of being non-empty on the
    new buffer, NQ ( l>0 ) and/or on the handoff buffer, PQ ( m>0 ) indicates that
    the channel which becomes idle is occupied by a waiting NRSU service at the head
    of the new buffer with probability θ and hence with probability (1−θ) by the NRSU
    service at the head of the handoff buffer. In those tables, the generic state
    ( i,j,k,l,m ) transits to one of the following states: State ( i,j+1,k,l,m ) when
    a newly arriving RSU occupies an idle channel ( i+j+k<N ). TABLE 2 Transitions
    From a Generic State x=(i,j,k,l,m) x=(i,j,k,l,m) Upon RSU Events TABLE 3 Transitions
    From a Generic State x=(i,j,k,l,m) x=(i,j,k,l,m) Upon NRSU Events State ( i,j−1,k,l,m
    ) if both the buffers are empty ( l=m=0 ) and when one of the following cases
    occur. The first case is when an RSU ( j>0 ) completes its service and departs.
    The second case is, if after a mis-detection, the ongoing RSU ( j>0 ) ends up
    colliding with an arriving PU. The third case is when upon arrival of a PU, the
    ongoing RSU ( j>0 ) makes correct detection and vacates the channel for PU however,
    the RSU ends up colliding with another PU instead. The fourth case is, if after
    the occurrence of FAR, the interrupted RSU ( j>0 ) doesn''t find a free channel
    ( i+j+k=N ) and gets drop. Furthermore, under any of the above cases, if the buffer
    NQ is non-empty ( l>0 ), the generic state x transits to ( i,j−1,k+1,l−1,m ) and
    if the buffer PQ is non-empty ( m>0 ) then transition to state ( i,j−1,k+1,l,m−1
    ) happens. Along the similar lines, when an ongoing NRSU undergoes any of the
    above four cases instead of an RSU, the transition occurs to state ( i,j,k−1,l,m
    ) if both the buffers empty ( l=m=0 ) or to state ( i,j,k,l−1,m ) if the buffer
    NQ is non-empty ( l>0 ) or to state ( i,j,k,l,m−1 ) if the buffer PQ is non-empty
    ( m>0 ). Herein, under the fourth case of occurrence of FAR, the interrupted NRSU
    when doesn''t find a free channel to handoff ( i+j+k=N ), chooses to leave the
    system with probability ( 1−p ). Also, the transition happens to state ( i,j,k,l−1,m
    ) or ( i,j,k,l,m−1 ) when such interrupted NRSU chooses to join the buffer PQ
    with probability p but finds the buffer full ( m= Q h ) and gets drop. State (
    i−1,j−1,k,l,m ) if both the buffers are empty ( l=m=0 ) and when after the occurrence
    of FAR, the RSU ( j>0 ) ends up colliding with a PU ( i>0 ). Otherwise, if at
    least one of the buffers is non-empty then the two created idle channels are allocated
    to the NRSU services waiting in their respective buffers and consequently, transition
    happens to state ( i−1,j−1,k+2,l−1,m−1 ) if l>0 and m>0 , to state ( i−1,j−1,k+2,l−2,m
    ) if l>1 or to state ( i−1,j−1,k+2,l,m−2 ) if m>1 . Similarly, when an NRSU (
    k>0 ) instead of the RSU undergoes the aforementioned event of the occurrence
    of FAR, the transition happens to state ( i−1,j,k−1,l,m ), ( i−1,j,k+1,l−1,m−1
    ), ( i−1,j,k+1,l−2,m ) or ( i−1,j,k+1,l,m−2 ) based on the occupancy of buffers.
    State ( i,j,k+1,l,m ) when a newly arriving NRSU occupies an idle channel ( i+j+k<N
    ). State ( i,j,k,l+1,m ) when an NRSU arrives, finds all the channels occupied
    ( i+j+k=N ) and gets queued in the new buffer NQ ( l< Q n ). State ( i,j,k−1,l,m+1
    ) if both the buffers are empty ( l=m=0 ) and when after the occurrence of FAR,
    the interrupted NRSU ( k>0 ) doesn''t find another free channel to handoff ( i+j+k=N
    ) and gets queued in the handoff buffer PQ. Otherwise, in case the buffer NQ is
    non-empty ( l>0 ) and the buffer PQ has a waiting space ( m< Q h ), the corresponding
    idle channel is allocated to the NRSU service at the head of the new buffer and
    the transition occurs to state ( i,j,k,l−1,m+1 ). Note that in Tables 1, 2, and
    3, the condition of existence of an idle channel i.e., i+j+k<N implies that both
    the buffers are empty i.e., l=m=0 . By utilizing the system dynamics described
    above, Fig. 3 shows the state transition diagram for N=1, Q n = Q h =1. Fig. 3.
    State transition diagram for N=1, Q n = Q h =1 . Show All SECTION 5 Performance
    Analysis Based on the aforementioned analysis, we can obtain the transition rates
    between any two states of the considered five-dimensional CTMC, and thereby the
    state transition rate matrix, Q can be formulated. Let π(x) denote the steady
    state probability of being in state x . Accordingly, the steady state probability
    vector π , which is constituted by the stationary probabilities, π(x) can be determined
    using the global balance equations and the normalizing equation, given by πQ=0,
    ∑ x∈S π(x)=1, (7) View Source where 0 is a row vector of all 0''s. When N, Q n
    , Q h are large, finding a solution to the corresponding balance equations gets
    complicated as computational complexity increases. We utilize the recursive approach
    to obtain the state transition rates of the CTMC under study. For CTMCs with large
    number of states, some approximation methods have been reported in [44]. However,
    the results presented in this paper are obtained utilizing the exact full CTMC.
    Accordingly, in order to evaluate the performance of CRN, we derive different
    performance measures that are relevant to analyze the communication QoS and are
    obtained as follows (please refer to Tables 1, 2, and 3 for conditions on indicator
    variables). 5.1 Blocking Probability An incoming RSU gets blocked if upon its
    arrival all the channels are occupied. In such a case, the RSU blocking probability,
    P SR b , can be written as follows: P SR b = ∑ i=0 N ∑ j=0 N−i ∑ l=0 Q n ∑ m=0
    Q h π (i,j,N−i−j,l,m) . (8) View Source Furthermore, an incoming NRSU will be
    blocked if there is no idle channel to commence the service and the buffer PQ
    is fully occupied. Therefore, the blocking probability, P SN b , is given by P
    SN b = ∑ i=0 N ∑ j=0 N−i ∑ m=0 Q h π (i,j,N−i−j, Q n ,m) . (9) View Source Contrarily,
    a PU only gets blocked when all the channels are occupied by PUs. Therefore, the
    blocking probability of a PU, P PU b , is P PU b = ∑ l=0 Q n ∑ m=0 Q h π (N,0,0,l,m)
    . (10) View Source 5.2 Forced Termination Probability We use the term forced termination
    probability to refer to the probability that a call which has not been blocked
    initially, is terminated due to collisions because of the sensing errors i.e.,
    mis-detections or false alarms [45]. The forced termination probability of PUs,
    P PU ft , can be expressed as ratio of mean forced termination rate of PUs to
    the mean admitted PU rate, λ ∗ 1 = λ 1 (1− P PU b ) . Correspondingly, the forced
    termination probability of PUs is given by P PU ft = ∑ x∈S ( Φ 1 + Φ 2 + Φ 3 +
    Φ 4 )π(x) λ 1 (1− P PU b ) . (11) View Source Similarly, the forced termination
    probabilities of RSUs, P SR ft and NRSUs, P SN ft can be calculated as P SR ft
    = ∑ x∈S ( Φ 1 + Φ 3 )π(x) λ 2 (1− P SR b ) , (12) View Source P SN ft = ∑ x∈S

    A forced dropping of an RSU occurs when an interrupted RSU cannot find a free
    channel to handoff its call. In such a case, the forced dropping probability of
    RSU, P SR fd , is given as follows: P SR fd = ∑ x∈S ( Ψ 1 + Ψ 2 )π(x) λ ∗ 2 (1−
    P SR ft ) , (18) View Source where Ψ 1 = α 6 λ 1 j N−i P D2 (1−f(i,r)−g(i,r)),

    (20) View Source Likewise, the forced dropping probability of NRSU, P SN fd ,
    can be expressed as the total NRSU forced dropping rate divided by the total NRSU
    connection rate. When an interrupted NRSU ends searching without finding any other
    idle channel to handoff. In addition, the interrupted NRSU decides to return to
    the buffer PQ for later retrial transmission but finds the buffer full, then the
    NRSU has to drop its communication before its service is finished. Therefore P
    SN fd = ∑ x∈S ( Ω 1 + Ω 2 )π(x) λ ∗ 3 (1− P SN ft ) , (21) View Source where Ω

    interrupted NRSUs when ends the searching process without finding a new idle channel
    to handoff, will give up their transmissions and leave the system voluntarily.
    In this instance, we define the self dropping probability of NRSU, P SN sd , as
    follows: P SN sd = ∑ x∈S ( Υ 1 + Υ 2 )π(x) λ ∗ 3 (1− P SN ft ) , where (24) View

    Throughput The throughput, R can be defined as the product of the number of successful
    SU connections per unit time and the service time per completed connection [46].
    Thus, the throughput of RSUs, R SR and of NRSUs, R SN can be written as follows:
    R SR = λ 2 (1− P SR b ) (1− P SR ft ) 2 × (1− P SR fd ) 2 μ −1 2 , (27) View Source

    spectrum utilization of the system as the average number of utilized channels
    over the total number of channels available. Thus, the spectrum utilization of
    the CRN, U CRN can be expressed as U CRN = 1 N ∑ x∈S (i+j+k)π(x). (29) View Source
    SECTION 6 Numerical Results The numerical results used to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed spectrum access strategy are presented below. The default values
    of the network configuration are N=6, P F1 =0.15, P D1 =0.75, λ FAR =10, P D2
    =0.95,α=0.2,p=0.7, Q h =2, Q n =4, λ 1 =20 Mbps, λ 2 = λ 3 =15 Mbps. The service
    rate per channel is configured as μ 1 = μ 2 = μ 3 =4 Mbps, unless otherwise stated.
    Fig. 4 plots the forced dropping probability of NRSU with different values of
    buffer sizes. Intuitively with higher NRSU arrival rate, the forced dropping probability
    of NRSUs increases, including the system without queues. From this figure, we
    observe that when queues are integrated the forced dropping probability of NRSUs
    gets reduce significantly. The result highlights that the increase in the size
    of the handoff buffer has more significant impact on the forced dropping probability
    of NRSUs. The reason is that the would-be-dropped NRSUs are not rejected but instead
    queued in the buffer (with probability p ) in order to provide channel access
    when available. Also, we get that since a larger queue size allows to store more
    users’ requests, thus results in lower forced dropping probability of NRSUs. Fig.
    4. NRSU forced dropping probability as a function of λ 3 . Show All The spectrum
    utilization as a function of NRSU arrival rate, λ 3 is illustrated in Fig. 5.
    We observe that spectrum utilization is improved using our proposed queueing based
    strategy. When the scheme is evaluated without queues, it shows lower values compared
    to those with queues. Moreover, with higher λ 3 , the improvement of spectrum
    utilization is more significant. To further improve spectrum utilization, it is
    required to reduce the time period for channels being in idle state. It can be
    seen that the larger queue size can meet this requirement as more NRSUs’ requests
    are allowed to accommodate in the queues. In accordance, the comparison of the
    proposed model (i.e., with finite queues) and the model without any queue [33]
    in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that the system performance gets significantly affected
    by the support of queues. Fig. 5. Spectrum utilization as a function of λ 3 .
    Show All Further, in Figs. 6, 7, and 8, the comparison of the proposed model (i.e.,
    with retrial phenomenon) to the models without retrial phenomenon [27], [45] reveals
    the performance difference due to the provision of a retrial. The self dropping
    probability of NRSU for different retrial probabilities is plotted in Fig. 6 as
    λ 3 varies. We observe that with higher active NRSUs, it is less likely for an
    interrupted NRSU to handoff to an idle channel, resulting in higher self dropping
    probability. As shown in the figure, the self dropping probability of NRSU decreases
    using the proposed spectrum access strategy with p -Retry policy in contrast with
    the strategy without any retrial transmission. When using retry policy, the interrupted
    users due to insufficient channels instead of being dropped are allowed to queue
    in the buffer for later retrial transmission. This results in lower self dropping
    probability. In addition, the larger the retrial probability is, the lesser are
    the number of interrupted NRSUs (voluntarily) getting dropped will be, so the
    self dropping probability of NRSU gets significantly reduced further. Fig. 6.
    NRSU self dropping probability as a function of λ 3 . Show All Fig. 7. Spectrum
    utilization as a function of λ 3 . Show All Fig. 8. NRSU throughput as a function
    of λ 3 . Show All Fig. 7 depicts the effect of different retrial probabilities
    on spectrum utilization. We find improvement in spectrum utilization utilizing
    the proposed retry policy. With higher λ 3 , the improvement is more significant.
    Since employing the retry policy, allows the would be dropped NRSUs to queue in
    the handoff buffer. Thus, when a channel becomes idle, it more likely to be utilized
    by an NRSU. Again, with larger retrial probability, greater number of interrupted
    NRSUs join the buffer for retrial transmission. This reduces the time period for
    which channels remain in idle state, thus resulting in significant improvement
    of spectrum utilization. Further, Fig. 8 shows that the access retrial phenomenon
    given to NRSUs significantly improves the performance of the network in terms
    of the throughput of NRSUs, especially at high load conditions. Moreover, as the
    probability of retrial transmission increases, the number of NRSUs returning to
    the buffer increases. This results in more NRSUs to be transmitted and thus results
    in higher throughput. We now investigate the effect of P D1 on the spectrum utilization
    in Fig. 9 with varying λ 3 . It can be observed that under perfect sensing, the
    licensed spectrum is better utilized. This is because in such a case, all unoccupied
    PUs’ channels can be opportunistically utilized by SUs. On the other hand, we
    observe that the utilization of spectrum gets severely reduced after imposing
    the impact of sensing errors. The figure also highlights that the improved detection
    capability of SUs results in improvement of spectrum utilization significantly.
    Fig. 9. Spectrum utilization as a function of λ 3 . Show All Fig. 10 depicts the
    effect of λ 3 on the throughput of NRSUs with different configurations of P D1
    . With perfect sensing, SU is able to correctly classify all the unoccupied channels
    and the presence of PUs, therefore gives higher throughput. Further, it is apparent
    that the throughput of NRSU is greatly affected by the imperfect spectrum sensing.
    Due to the increase of P D1 , a transmission collision from imperfect spectrum
    sensing occurs seldom. As a result, NRSU obtains more opportunities for transmission,
    leading to higher throughput. Based on the results in Figs. 8 and 9, which depict
    the comparison between the model with reliable sensing [39] and imperfect sensing
    (proposed model), we can conclude that the achievable throughput and utilization
    are substantially affected by the reliability of sensing. Fig. 10. NRSU throughput
    as a function of λ 3 . Show All In Fig. 11, the effect of λ FAR on the forced
    termination probability of NRSU is demonstrated. It can be seen that high λ FAR
    degrades the NRSU performance. The degradation in NRSU performance can be explained
    by the fact that when λ FAR is high, SUs increasingly initiate the unnecessary
    spectrum handoff process, leading to increment in NRSU termination probability.
    Moreover, the figure also indicates that the forced termination probability increases
    with higher arrival rate of PUs. This is because with high primary arrival rate,
    most of the channels will be occupied by PUs, thus increasing the possibility
    of collisions with interrupted NRSUs. Fig. 11. NRSU forced termination probability
    as a function of λ FAR . Show All In Fig. 12, we investigate the effect of λ FAR
    on the forced termination probability of PU for different values of PU arrival
    rate. We observe that high λ FAR leads to poor PU performance. This is because
    an increase in the number of occurrence of false alarms increases the proportion
    of SUs colliding with PUs, leading to higher primary call terminations. However,
    with high primary arrival, most of the channels are occupied by PUs. This lessens
    the SUs residing in the system to be interrupted by newly arriving PUs, resulting
    in a lower probability of collisions with PUs. Thereby, decreasing the forced
    termination probability of PUs. Fig. 12. PU forced termination probability as
    a function of λ FAR . Show All We show the effect of λ FAR on the throughput of
    NRSU in Fig. 13. It can be observed that increasing λ FAR has a negative impact
    on NRSU performance in terms of throughput. As λ FAR increases, a growing number
    of NRSUs initiate the handoff process and get terminated or dropped in case of
    a collision or no free channel available. This indicates that NRSUs do not complete
    their service when λ FAR is high and therefore, the throughput decreases. Also,
    at high primary arrival rate since the channels are more often occupied by PUs,
    it reduces the opportunities for NRSUs to access the spectrum and thus, results
    in lower throughput. Fig. 13. NRSU throughput as a function of λ FAR . Show All
    Further, in Fig. 14, we measure the impact of λ FAR on the forced dropping probability
    of an RSU for different service rates of NRSUs. It can be observed that there
    are peak values in the curves. The following explanation is related to this behaviour.
    On one hand, when λ FAR is relatively low, RSU forced dropping probability increases
    until it reaches the peak value and then starts to decline. The deterioration
    in RSU performance can be explained by the fact that as λ FAR increases, unnecessary
    spectrum handoff increases, forcing RSUs to vacate and search for available channels
    to resume its communication. If they cannot find any other free channel, they
    get drop and thereby increases forced dropping probability. On the other hand,
    with high values of λ FAR (and consequently high P D2 ), the dropping probability
    gets reduce due to the improvement in the detection operation. In addition, we
    observe that diminishing the NRSU service duration, frees up its channels faster,
    enabling less RSU dropping events. Consequently, it enables a trade off between
    λ FAR and service time than can be tuned according to the different QoS requirements
    of the secondary users. Fig. 14. RSU forced dropping probability as a function
    of λ FAR . Show All The same effect of λ FAR for increasing service rate of NRSU
    applies to the self dropping probability of NRSU as shown in Fig. 15. Fig. 15.
    NRSU self dropping probability as a function of λ FAR . Show All SECTION 7 Conclusion
    The key emphasis of this paper is to introduce and explore the concept of imperfect
    spectrum sensing for heterogeneous traffic in CRNs. A joint design of spectrum
    sensing and spectrum access mechanisms is proposed and analyzed. More specifically,
    we have investigated a queue-based spectrum access strategy with p -Retry policy
    for multi-channel CRNs. In subsequence, an analytical framework is developed to
    analyze the proposed strategy under realistic network operating conditions. The
    proposed strategy not only examines the effect of sensing errors by incoming SUs
    but also takes into account the mis-detection and false alarm probabilities by
    ongoing SUs. The effect of false alarm rates, λ FARs is studied on the operation
    of CRNs. We then evaluated the performance of the system in terms of different
    performance metrics, including primary and secondary forced termination probabilities,
    dropping probabilities, throughput and spectrum utilization. Numerical results
    are presented to highlight the analysis. With numerical results, we have illustrated
    that the integration of queues with retry policy in the proposed strategy outperforms
    the existing ones without any retrial transmission or a queue. In accordance,
    analytical results under the proposed strategy show significant improvements in
    terms of the throughput, forced termination and dropping probabilities. Results
    have also shown that the sensing errors remarkably influences the performance
    of CRNs by degrading SU and PU performance. The incorporation of λ FAR into the
    CTMC model allows obtaining exact and more accurate state transition probabilities,
    which, in turn, improves the calculation of the performance evaluation metrics.
    In view of this, the results of the proposed strategy also provide new insight
    into the operation of CRNs and can be utilized to develop practical and more accurate
    performance evaluation models for CRNs. In our future work, we will consider spectrum
    sensing algorithms aiming at diverse application scenarios such as Wider-Coverage,
    Massive-Connectivity and Low-Latency, mainly from the perspective of improving
    energy efficiency. Furthermore, we will study the design of admission control
    to investigate the case where on collisions, only SUs will be terminated. Also,
    we will further perform the analysis in the time domain. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors

    \ \nINTRODUCTION \nImmovable and rigid cellular systems have been failing to cope\
    \ with the recent growing \ncommunication demands due to the lack of predefined\
    \ resources available for use, as well as the continuously \nexpanding data exchange\
    \ rates [1]. However, cognitive radio technologies were presented to alleviate\
    \ \nthe concerns of arbitrary reuse of the spectrum, which may introduce interference\
    \ [2, 3]. Cognitive radio \ntechnologies grant users a smooth access to white\
    \ bands to relieve the licensed spectrum and further prevent \ninterference. Additionally,\
    \ users are classified as either Primary Users (PUs) who use the existing licensed\
    \ \nspectrum, or Secondary Users (SUs) who are obliged to hop on the white band.\
    \ Accordingly, the US Federal \nCommunication Commission (FCC) limited access\
    \ of PU to distinct frequencies, and SUs to certain \nfrequencies. \nTo smoothly\
    \ access resources, the spectrum sensing process takes place to identify the available\
    \ \naccessible bands in the environment. This is considered as the most important\
    \ stage since it helps to avoid \nany potential overlapping between PUs and SUs\
    \ [4, 5]. These accessible bands will be further evaluated to \nselect and associate\
    \ the one with the least amount of interference to SUs. However, SUs are obliged\
    \ to \nimmediately hop off to another vacant band in case any PUs are trying to\
    \ access the band. Hence, Spectrum \nHandoff (SHO) must be efficient in identifying\
    \ vacant bands and taking immediate hopping decisions which \nrequire some pre-knowledge\
    \ about low traffic spectrums [6]. Figure 1 shows the SHO mechanism of \ntransition\
    \ of spectrum bands for users in Cognitive Radio (CR) networks. It presents that\
    \ there are three \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  \nISSN: 2088-8708 \n \n \nAn intelligent\
    \ spectrum handoff scheme based on multiple attribute decision…  (Abdulraqeb Alhammadi)\
    \ \n5331 \nspectrum bands which have some vacant channels. The SU occupies the\
    \ available channel 1 in spectrum \nband 1 and starts its connections. When the\
    \ licensed user (PU) arrives to occupy its licensed band,  \nthe unlicensed user\
    \ (SU) must stop its connection and switches to another available channel in other\
    \ spectrum \nbands and so on.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. SHO mechanism \n \n \n\
    The SHO was enhanced to attain adequate and seamless connectivity by various fuzzy\
    \ logic, \nintelligence techniques using mathematical tools that can compose real-time\
    \ decisions. Similarly, the authors \nof [7] presented an SHO scheme that considers\
    \ a negotiation approach based on both price and  \nusage-duration. The approach\
    \ had relatively minimized both numbers of return negotiations and HOs. \nNonetheless,\
    \ non-desired HOs may still occur. Subsequently, the authors of [8, 9] proposed\
    \ a multi-agent \nnegotiation scheme to allow PUs and SUs to share available resources\
    \ and reduce the number of HOs.  \nBoth scheme negotiations with PU depend on\
    \ minimal prices among the available ones. However, the first \nscheme negotiates\
    \ with PUs who hold identical resources, while the second negotiates with few\
    \ pre-selected \nPUs. This does not only minimize the HO blocking rate, but also\
    \ reduces service interruption probabilities. \nOn the other hand, the authors\
    \ of [10] employed the practical swarm optimization algorithm to accelerate \n\
    the HO time when a PU requests access to a SUs resource. The scheme reduced the\
    \ HO delay \nby approximately 35%, which also improved the quality of service.\
    \ Ahmed et al. [11] proposed to foresee \nthe gain of each channel to enhance\
    \ the spectrum selection process and further improve the Signal-to-\nInterference-plus-Noise\
    \ Ratio (SINR). The system initially anticipates the gain of all channels and\
    \ further \nselects and associates the one with the highest gain prediction. Nevertheless,\
    \ the availability of multiple \nchannels with different gains may impose some\
    \ difficulty for easily selecting the perfect channel, which may \nincrease delay\
    \ itself [12]. \nThe authors of [13] proposed a system that enhances the utilization\
    \ of the available spectrum to \navert incessant switching between channels. Unlike\
    \ the previous paper, it selects the channel with the least \nBit Error Rate (BER)\
    \ and the highest signal strength. Consequently, the throughput is improved, but\
    \ PUs’ \narrivals were not effectively detected. Alternatively, Pham et al. [14]\
    \ employed the Hidden Markov model to \nevaluate and oversee the channel status.\
    \ It arbitrarily selects channels using a proactive SHO algorithm to \nanalyze\
    \ system efficiency. The authors present a study on signal strength with frequency\
    \ approaches from \n1.8GHz to 2.2GHz in indoor environments. It focuses more on\
    \ mobility of the receiving device, where there \nwill be different distances.\
    \ In the paper, an USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) device is used as\
    \ \nBase Stations (BS) to transmit the desired frequency as well as to receive\
    \ the signal strength at certain \ndistances in the indoor environment [15]. In\
    \ another paper, the authors focus on the SH, which manages \nthe movements of\
    \ SUs to occupy the vacant unlicensed spectrum without interrupting the transmission\
    \  \nof PUs [16]. \nIn recent works, there are several research articles have\
    \ recently been published such as [7, 17, 18] \nthat discussed the SHO using different\
    \ algorithms to enhance SHO performance. Although these proposed \nalgorithms\
    \ provide some enhancement in SHO performance, however, they did not take some\
    \ important \nparameters such as traffic load of BS, Reference Signal Received\
    \ Power (RSRP) and arrival rate of the PUs \nand SUs into account. These parameters\
    \ have high impact on the spectrum mobility which allow the SUs to \nmove and\
    \ utilize the vacant spectrums smoothly. Thus, in this paper, we propose SHO mechanism\
    \ that \nutilizes the vacant spectrums using multiple attribute decision making.\
    \ It also applies the RSRP, traffic \nreadings, and PUs’ request rate to effectively\
    \ administer non-desired HOs. The rest of the paper is organized \ninto four sections.\
    \ Section II elaborates the system model and the proposed fuzzy logic based on\
    \ the SH.  \nThe performance evaluation of the proposed system and results is\
    \ presented in Section III. Lastly, Section IV \nconcludes the paper and presents\
    \ possible future enhancements. \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt\

    SYSTEM MODEL AND FUZZY LOGIC SYSTEM \nIn this section, we first introduce the\
    \ system model of the cognitive radio network in Section 2.1, \nand then Section\
    \ 2.2 explains the fuzzy logic system. Afterwards, the proposed approach based\
    \ on fuzzy \nsystem is presented in Section 2.3. \n \n2.1.  System model \nWe\
    \ introduce a CRN that is formed by a set of PUs Up =[Up1 Up2 Up3 ... Upn] and\
    \ a set of SUs Us \n=[Us1 Us2 Us3 ... Usn]. Users who are located within the overlapping\
    \ area in between two cells can be \ncategorized as Ups and are associated to\
    \ the primary network. Conversely, they are categorized as Us if they \nare associated\

    \ \nOne of the recent appealing approaches of spectrum hopping problems in regard\
    \ to representation \nand expressions is fuzzy logic. Mathematically, it also\
    \ deals with relatively high fuzziness-related issues.  \nA Fuzzy Logic Controller\
    \ (FLC) that consists of elements such as fuzzy interface, fuzzification,  \n\
    and defuzzification as shown in Figure 3 is often needed to apply fuzzy logic\
    \ concepts \nThe functionality of the fuzzification block is to receive input\
    \ parameters (crisp inputs) and logical \nparameters, respectively. It further\
    \ processes the input parameters in a similar way to the fuzzy logic of \nhumans.\
    \ Consequently, the linguistic control rules are used to process the results in\
    \ a single decision  \n(crisp output) and hence, advanced logical variables are\
    \ produced; as shown in Figure 4. The input fuzzy \nvariables are represented\
    \ by input fuzzy sets which consist of a number of membership functions as follows:\

    \ that have \na significant effect on system performance. These inputs, along\
    \ with the single output parameter, are shown \nin Figure 5. FLC quantifies and\
    \ assesses how possible the HO is likely to occur based on the input parameters\
    \ \nsuch as the overall traffic, request arrival rate (attained through a Poisson\
    \ distribution), and the received \npower.  Subsequently, the input parameters\
    \ that were considered in the proposed scheme are shown in  \nTable 1. Furthermore,\
    \ Figure 6 presents how the input parameters can contribute to the HO decision.\

    \ the performance evaluation is divided into subsections. Section 3.1 presents\
    \ \nthe analysis of the input parameters and its impact on the HO probability.\
    \ Section 3.2 investigates the impact \nof the proposed HO scheme with different\
    \ values of consider parameters \n \n3.1.  Analysis of the input parameters \n\
    The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulations carried\
    \ out using \nthe MATLAB tool where the values of the input parameters in Table\
    \ 1 along with the rules in Table 2 are \nconsidered. It can be seen in Figure\
    \ 7 (a) that the HO is much likely to occur when there is relatively high \ntraffic\
    \ and arrival rate. Consequently, the scheme changes the occupied channel to establish\
    \ a new \ntransmission on another idle channel. \nOn the other hand, HO is likely\
    \ to occur if request arrival rate increases while the received \npower degrades\
    \ below -115 dBm, as presented in Figure 7 (b). Consequently, the scheme will\
    \ switch \nthe transmission to another idle channel. However, if the received\
    \ power remains high, the HO decision will \nsolely be built on the request arrival\
    \ rates. \nAdditionally, Figure 7 (c) shows the HO decision evaluation based on\
    \ traffic and received power \nrates. This shows that the scheme jumps to a certain\
    \ channel only if it bears less traffic and high received \npower simultaneously.\
    \ For this decision to be taken, the two parameter values at the desired station\
    \ must be \nsatisfied at the connection time. \nFigure 8 demonstrates the rules\
    \ for input and output sets of the fuzzy inference system. It used to \nmonitor\
    \ the entire implication process from beginning to end. The first three columns\
    \ indicate the input sets \nwhilst the fourth one indicates to the output set.\
    \ To test the output set “HO probability” for all rules, the red \nline adjusts\
    \ for each observation input set. Setting each input set at different levels yields\
    \ a ranking of output \npoints, where higher values of the output set indicate\
    \ a high level of the input sets and vice versa. \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  \nISSN:\

    \ 3 present \nthe request arrival rate at three different times (λp=0.2, 0.5,\
    \ and 0.8) with different number of users. It also \ndemonstrates that the HO\
    \ only increases as users associated with the BS further increase. Hence, the\
    \ HO \nshould not be carried to a BS that has high arrival rates or high load.\
    \ In other words, it is observed that in \nthe case of BS low traffic of arrival\
    \ rate of PU, the proposed scheme guides the Sus to occupy that spectrum \nto\
    \ setup the connection. This will reduce the frequent HO and searching for other\
    \ available spectrum bands to \ncontinue their connections. On the contrary, high\
    \ rate of PU arrival and number of users increases the HO \nprobability which\
    \ affects the network performance.   \nFigure 10 demonstrates the impact of Pr\

    \U0001D43F were evaluated with rage of λp = 0.2 to 1 with step of 0.2. It shows\
    \ that the higher HO probability occurs \nwhen the UE communication link becomes\
    \ very poor and the BS is congested (scenarios 2). However, \nthe HO probability\
    \ gradually reduces when the λp of target BS increases. This due to the SUs avoid\
    \ \nthe interference that might be happening when the higher rate of the PUs arrive\
    \ to occupy their licensed \nspectrum. On the other hand, the lower HO probability\
    \ occurs when the UE communication link becomes \nvery strong and the BS is not\
    \ fully utilized (scenarios 3). In this case, the HO does not require or becomes\
    \ \nunnecessary since Pr and \U0001D43F are still in an acceptable level of communication.\
    \ Thus, reducing of unwanted \nHOs probability leads to increase the efficiency\
    \ of communications and reduce the interference.  \n \n      \n  \n \n      \

    \ \nIn this paper, an efficient SHO scheme was proposed based on the fuzzy logic\
    \ system to avoid \nthe high probability number of HOs. It can be concluded that\
    \ the proposed fuzzy logic-based algorithm with \nrealistic considerations of\
    \ traffic, requests arrival rates, and received power leads to relatively longer\
    \ HO \ndelays; this subsequently leads to the complete avoidance of unnecessary\
    \ HOs. Furthermore, reducing of \nunnecessary HOs leads to reduce the interference\
    \ occurs when Sus HO to PU licensed spectrum during \nhigh arrival rate. This\
    \ will further stabilize communication and prevent sudden interruptions. \nFuture\
    \ directions of this topic should apply some intelligence techniques, such as\
    \ swarm optimizations, \nto additionally decrease HOs. \n \nInt J Elec & Comp\

  description: Cognitive radio (CR) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are
    two technologies witnessed to offer tremendous possibilities for the next generation
    wireless networks to maximise their usage of available spectrum. In this work,
    we evaluate the performance of a downlink overlay secure CR-NOMA system while
    the secondary transmitter (ST) is used as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay to assist
    the primary transmitter (PT) to transmit information to the destination i.e.,
    primary user (PU), while covertly transmitting its own information to the secondary
    user (SU) against the eavesdropper (Eve) of PT. The secrecy performance comparison
    between two users i.e., PU and SU are obtained under perfect and imperfect successive
    interference cancellation (SIC), respectively. Furthermore, this paper investigates
    the secrecy performance comparison between the proposed overlay downlink CR-NOMA
    system comprising of single antenna (SA) and multiple antennas (MA) in terms of
    various performance metrics such as secrecy sum rate (SSR), the average secrecy
    rate (ASR), the average secrecy sum rate (ASSR), strictly positive secrecy rate
    (SPSC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP). It is to be noted that in our proposed
    system, MAs are equipped at both PT and ST with the main purpose to provide cooperative
    diversity and we employ both maximal ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining
    (SC) diversity techniques for processing the received signals at the PU/Eve which
    further improves the system's capacity and enhances the secrecy performance. In
    addition, for characterizing the secrecy performance of the proposed overlay CR-NOMA
    network, we present thoroughly the derivations of novel closed-form analytical
    expressions of the performance metrics such as SOP, SPSC and the ASR by taking
    into account both perfect SIC (pSIC) and imperfect SIC (ipSIC) scenarios. Based
    on the analytical frameworks, the numerical and simulation results are obtained
    under different network parameters. Towards this end, the outcomes of the simulation
    are shown to prove both the reliability of the mathematical analysis and the accuracy
    of the suggested technique.

    DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3361038 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction The rapid
    emergence of a diverse variety of applications such as the internet of things
    (IoT), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AI), unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV), autonomous driving, live video streaming, online gaming, video conferences,
    etc., is posing an unprecedented ultimatum for the fifth generation (5G) and future
    generations of wireless networks to cater the needs of the end users. More particularly,
    the 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks suffer from spectrum limitations
    due to this explosive increase in mobile traffic and high-rate data transmission
    capabilities. In a limited bandwidth, it is of utmost necessity for the network
    providers to take into consideration several aspects such as massive connectedness,
    ultra-low latency, extremely high throughput, improved user fairness, etc. Thus,
    in this context, with the major motive to address the aforementioned demands,
    rapid advancements in the utilization of multiple access techniques among all
    the generations of cellular communication systems starting from first generation
    i.e., (1G) through 4G such as the frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time
    division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and orthogonal
    frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) can be witnessed. However, these multiple
    access techniques rely on the same concept called orthogonality which implies
    that users share the resources in an orthogonal manner i.e., each of the users
    is allowed to utilize exclusively an orthogonal resource block i.e., either a
    frequency channel, time slot, spreading code, etc. The major drawback associated
    with the utilization of these schemes is that they lead to significant limitations
    on the total number of users that can access the spectrum thus curtailing the
    spectral efficiency. Eventually, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has gained
    a substantial amount of recognition to facilitate effective utilization of spectral
    resources. Particularly, NOMA circumvents the drawback of the aforementioned OMA
    techniques by serving an arbitrary number of users contemporaneously within the
    same frequency band. Generally, NOMA employs the phenomena of power domain multiplexing
    for superimposing multiple user signals within the same time-frequency resource
    blocks. A list of earlier studies affirms that NOMA exhibits the potential to
    be easily integrated with other existing communication technologies. Hence, it
    has been included in 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) where NOMA is ably
    known as multi-user superposition transmission (MUST). Apart from this, NOMA has
    been incorporated in the digital TV standard ATSC 3.0 where it is specified as
    layered division multiplexing (LDM). Notably, upon using the principle mechanism
    of NOMA, where multiple data streams are superimposed, the spectral efficiency
    of TV broadcasting can be enhanced. Thus, these examples clearly manifest the
    enormous caliber of NOMA which confirms its incorporation in future wireless communication
    systems. Besides, cognitive radio (CR) also offers a platform for effective utilization
    of the wireless spectrum where the secondary users (SUs) also known as CR users
    are allowed to opportunistically access the band of spectrum occupied by the primary
    users (PUs) by adopting three different paradigms such as the interweave, underlay
    and overlay. The spectrum sharing strategy which we focus in this paper is overlay.
    In all of these three mechanisms, SUs are allowed to occupy the spectrum of PUs
    only upon ensuring that they do not hinder the quality of service (QoS) of the
    primary user. Apparently, in order to facilitate the sharing of the spectrum in
    an intriguing manner, one simple solution is to integrate the prospects of NOMA
    with CR. More specifically the prevailing research articles demonstrate that the
    amalgamation of NOMA with CR satisfies several necessities of the future wireless
    networks such as the assurance of low latency, massive connectivity, high data
    transfer, etc. In this work we integrate the concepts of NOMA to the overlay CR
    system. Recently published studies have shown that CR-NOMA systems can meet 5G/B5G
    network requirements such as huge connection, low latency, and high throughput
    [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. In the overlay spectrum sharing mechanism, the secondary
    transmitter is allowed to cooperate with the primary transmitter and aids in relaying
    the information of the primary user in contemplation of sharing the licensed primary
    user’s spectrum and it is given a privilege to transmit its own signal as well.
    While developing any wireless communication systems, it is of utmost necessary
    to assure adequate amount of security. However, the broadcast nature of the wireless
    communication channel is resulting the wireless system to become susceptible to
    the adverse effects of eavesdropping. This threat is more pronounced in a CR system
    due to the fact that there is a lot more chance for such systems to get wiretapped
    when facilitating the unlicensed users especially the malignant users to access
    the spectrum occupied by the primary or licensed users. To circumvent such threats,
    several cryptographic algorithms and secret keys have been proposed to enhance
    the security of the transmitted information. Nonetheless, these encryption and
    decryption algorithms involve a lot of computational complexity. Thus, physical
    layer security (PLS) has emerged out as an excellent counterpart to guarantee
    with substantial amount of security at the physical layer. In addition, PLS which
    has been the subject of intense research to improve wireless system security,
    and it can also be used to secure NOMA [6], [7]. In this work, we address the
    PLS aspects of overlay CR-NOMA system by taking into consideration both perfect
    and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) scenarios. In [8], the
    PLS aspects of an underlay CRN is evaluated with respect to secrecy outage probability
    (SOP), average secrecy rate (ASR), and quantity of secrecy loss (ASL). From this
    work, it can be affirmed that the authors derived closed-form expressions of SOP,
    ASR, and ASL over imperfect channel state information (CSI) with Rayleigh fading,
    where the wiretap channels and the legitimate channels are correlated. A. Related
    Works Two uplink NOMA systems, one is the random jammer selection based uplink
    NOMA transmission (RJS-UNT) method that does not require knowledge of the eavesdropper’s
    CSI, and the other one is optimal jammer selection based uplink NOMA transmission
    (OJS-UNT) method that makes use of the eavesdropper’s CSI when it is available,
    are proposed in the work discussed in [9]. In addition, we compare this approach
    with another scheme called a non-jammer selection based uplink NOMA transmission
    (NJS-UNT) method that doesn’t rely on jammer selection to function. In order to
    measure how well these systems keep secrets, we create analytical formulations
    for the SOP. The results demonstrate that the schemes get closer to SOP levels
    as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improves. When compared to the NJS-UNT scheme,
    the SOP floors achieved by the RJS-UNT and OJS-UNT are substantially lower. This
    is indicative of the system’s superiority in terms of security. While the authors
    in [10] are mainly concerned to enhance the security of confidential information
    transmission between a source, two destinations, a friendly jammer (FJ), and an
    eavesdropper (Eve). To thwart Eve’s attempts to intercept data, the FJ sends a
    jamming signal concurrently with the source sending a superimposed signal across
    both receivers that through NOMA. Both users are aware of the jamming signal and
    subtract it from the received signal before decoding the information using the
    NOMA technique. Further, the authors in this work focus on the analysis of SOP,
    which varies based on the different target secrecy rates of the two users. The
    research work in [11] explores the application of NOMA in large-scale underlay
    CR networks with randomly deployed users. Predominantly, underlay CR networks
    operate on the principle that SUs can utilize the PU’s spectrum, provided they
    adhere to a predefined interference threshold within the primary network (PN).
    This concept allows SUs to access PU spectrum resources without causing significant
    disruption to the primary users. The authors in [11] focuses on characterizing
    network performance by deriving new closed-form expressions for outage probability
    (OP) through stochastic geometry. The study distinguishes between two power constraint
    cases: 1) fixed transmit power for primary transmitters (PTs) and 2) PT’s transmit
    power proportional to that of the secondary base station (SBS). In case-1, NOMA
    users experience a diversity order of ‘m’ at the m th -ordered user, suggesting
    improved performance. However, in case-2, an asymptotic error level is observed
    for the OP, indicating limitations. The authors of the article quoted in [12]
    investigated a cooperative underlay CR-NOMA framework with a single relay. This
    system enables multiple SUs to send and receive signals concurrently while still
    adhering to primary interference power limitations. The work in [13] explores
    the performance of a NOMA based underlay CR framework with partial relay selection
    (PRS). In this setup, the secondary network employs NOMA, utilizing K half-duplex
    (HD), decode-and-forward (DF) relays to assist the SBS in serving SUs. This study
    presents closed-form solutions for OPs obtained by SUs under erroneous SIC conditions,
    while also considering interference thresholds for primary receivers and maximum
    transmit power constraints for secondary nodes. An overlay CR-NOMA framework with
    a single relay was taken into consideration by the authors in [14]. This research
    article examines an overlay CR-NOMA framework that operates under the secrecy
    constraint imposed by PUs. In this network, secondary transmitters assist in relaying
    primary users’ messages in exchange for access to the primary user’s spectrum.
    The major focus of the work as stated in [14] is to assess the secrecy performance
    of primary users while treating secondary users as potential eavesdroppers. It
    highlights the need to adjust the power allocation between primary and secondary
    users to enhance security. Notably, the proposed scheme involves the consideration
    of multiple primary users who are paired based on their channel gains. This pairing
    enables the implementation of NOMA protocols to enhance the overall system performance.
    The work in [15] focuses on the relay selection issue in cognitive radio networks
    that operate within a spectrum-sharing framework. The SUs in the CR-NOMA framework
    opportunistically tap into licensed spectral gaps to increase the number of accessible
    SUs, which is vital given the limited and dynamic nature of available spectrum.
    To enhance the effectiveness of distant users, a PRS architecture is employed
    for both full-duplex (FD) and HD relays in both uplink and downlink communications.
    Furthermore, this work provides analytical expressions for OPs in FD and HD relay-aided
    CR-NOMA frameworks. Additionally, analytical expressions for asymptotic OPs and
    ergodic capacity (EC) are derived, shedding light on key factors influencing CR-NOMA
    network performance. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of these
    closed-form solutions, demonstrating their applicability to FD and HD relay-aided
    CR-NOMA frameworks. B. Motivations and Contributions In [16], the authors examined
    a multi-user cooperating overlay CR-NOMA system with imperfect SIC and imperfect
    CSI. By taking into consideration both imperfect SIC/CSI scenarios, the authors
    computed the end-to-end OP and capacities of both the primary and secondary networks.
    In [17], the closed-form equations for the end-to-end OP of the cooperative underlay
    CR-NOMA DF relaying networks across Rayleigh fading with the PU interference and
    incomplete CSI were developed. However, the work in [18] is similar to that of
    [17] where they were investigated OP of cooperative CR-NOMA system with imperfect
    SIC. In [19], the OPs and ECs for every pair of signals under the assumption of
    erroneous SIC and co-channel interference (CCI) were obtained as closed-form solutions
    in conjunction with the basic functions. Above all research works have not discussed
    any security methods and this motives us to incorporate PLS to improve system’s
    secrecy performance under the presence of external or passive eavesdropper node
    in our proposed work. In [4], the authors have examined the OP and throughput
    of overlay cognitive NOMA system with imperfect SIC (ipSIC). In their work, the
    authors have performed asymptotic analysis and attained the closed-form OP expressions
    of PU and SU when their transmit SNRs approaches infinity. Furthermore, the simulation
    results of this work demonstrated that overlay CR-NOMA system outperforms overlay
    CR-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and underlay CR systems via SU’s OP performance
    and system throughput. However, the authors have not considered PLS aspects and
    this motivates us to do the necessity. In [21], the researchers explored PLS based
    cooperative downlink NOMA system employing a HD relay in the context of an external
    eavesdropper (Eve). To ensure secured communication, a two-stage jammer approach
    was offered. In addition, they have evaluated the secrecy of the system in terms
    of the closed-form solutions of SOP for two trusted users. To improve transmission
    and achieve diversity gain, multi-antenna relays have been extensively deployed.
    The ability of Rician fading channels to conceal information is studied in [24].
    In specifically, the probability of having a strictly positive secrecy capacity
    (SPSC) is obtained in a closed-form expression. In [25], the authors have studied
    how well an uplink NOMA preserved information private for both single antenna
    (SA) and multiple antenna (MA) users. Also, the authors have analyzed the PLS
    performance in terms of SOP and SPSC. However, all these aforementioned research
    works are confined to analyzing the performance of cooperative NOMA system under
    imperfect SIC assumptions but they have not considered CR-NOMA systems. In order
    to study the effect of SIC on real-world detectors, the authors in [30] present
    a new generalized residual interference (RI) approach. They used the proposed
    method to analyze RI at receivers in a two-user untrusted NOMA network and found
    the analytical and asymptotic formulations of SOP for both users. According to
    the authors in [31], the SOP performance of CR-NOMA system is investigated using
    a hybrid SIC and power control (HSIC-PC) approach. The exact and asymptotic SOP
    of SU were found using mathematical calculations. To further improve the SU’s
    SOP, the HSIC-PC-artificial-noise (HSIC-PC-AN) method was also suggested. According
    to the research work as shown in [32] investigates the PLS of an OCRN with a strong
    PT operating under a peak interference power limitation. The capacity for outages,
    intercept probability, and SOP in passive eavesdropping are all expressed mathematically.
    New expressions for the exact and approximate average secrecy capacity (ASC) for
    active eavesdropping have been found after extensive research on the ASC. In order
    to enhance SR and examine IRS-aided NOMA PLS, the researchers of [33] suggested
    a realistic situation with IRS-assisted NOMA which involves barriers that hinder
    direct transmission among the base station (BS), users, and an eavesdropper. They
    derive a closed form expression for the ergodic secrecy rate, and the numerical
    data indicate that the system’s performance can be enhanced by incorporating IRS
    elements. The subject of secret communications among RIS-NOMA frameworks was investigated
    in [34] using on-off controls. For the k th legitimate user (LU) in RIS-NOMA networks,
    novel approximative and asymptotic SOP formulations were generated utilizing ipSIC/pSIC.
    As compared to RIS-OMA, AF relaying, and HD/FD DF relaying, these equations are
    far better. On top of it, the authors have come up with solutions for the secrecy
    system throughput in delay-limited transmission mode. The PLS has been mentioned
    about in context of a big NOMA framework that uses both FD and AN techniques in
    [35]. It was also possible to make a safe joint communication approach. In this
    system, NOMA users that are nearby and working in FD state mess up other signals
    and boost the PLS of the LU signal by making fake noise. For a certain set of
    users, one learns a closed-form answer based on the SOP. In [36], the authors
    explained how to set up a new DF-aided joint NOMA structure with two people which
    functions in both HD and FD states. Different types of SOP closed-form expressions
    have been made using the HD and FD methods. Two different ways of sending information
    have been suggested in [37] as ways to make the two-way relay (TWR) method with
    the listener more private. The analytical expressions of OP and intercept probability
    (IP) have been found. A numerical simulation was used to make sure that the mathematical
    findings were correct. The PLS of the simultaneously sending and reflecting (STAR)-RIS-NOMA
    was analyzed in [38]. The randomized geometry-based technique was employed for
    modeling random locations of the Eves and NOMA legitimate users (LUs). The authors
    in [38] have derived the mathematical forms of the SOP and the ASC for the time-splitting
    (TS) and energy-splitting (ES) protocols when the SIC order of the NOMA LUs is
    based on the channel gains. In a millimeter wave (mmWave) beamspace MIMO system,
    the employment of UAVs equipped with lens antenna arrays (LAAs) is contemplated
    in [39] as a means to facilitate multi-user transmission. In order to minimize
    the number of RF chains, a UAV-enabled multiuser MIMO system that combines the
    UAV’s altitude design with hybrid beamspace precoding is suggested. A minimum
    weighted mean squared error (MWMSE) approach is used to construct the optimization
    issue in the suggested approach. To achieve efficient and flexible coverage in
    mmWave UAV telecommunications, the contributors of [40] suggested a three-dimensional
    (3D) beamforming method. They achieve a smallest rectangular that will encompass
    the target area by taking the coordinate transformation of the target region.
    Then, they have achieved an extensible coverage. Afterwards, a broad beam is designed
    to span the rectangular using the sub-array approach. Inspired by the previously
    mentioned concerns, we introduce a PLS based overlay CR-NOMA downlink system which
    is equipped with SA as well as MA at the primary/secondary transmitters to perform
    a reliable transmission for two users under perfect and imperfect SIC assumptions.
    The following is a brief overview of our main contributions: The proposed PLS
    based overlay CR inspired downlink NOMA (CR-NOMA) system with two primary/secondary
    transceivers, and one eavesdropper is configured along with artificial noise aided
    jamming signals to improve the security of the system, where, the eavesdropper
    is having the ability to detect both NOMA users simultaneously. For the proposed
    overlay CR-NOMA system, the system diversity has been improved by incorporating
    both maximal ratio combining (MRC)/selection combining (SC) techniques for processing
    the received signal, and this work also derives the novel closed-form solutions
    for the average secrecy rate (ASR), strictly positive secrecy rate (SPSC) and
    SOP under both perfect SIC (pSIC) and ipSIC scenarios. By taking into consideration
    different network parameters such as transmit SNR, user target rates, and residual
    interference due to ipSIC, this work provides a secrecy performance comparison
    between both primary/secondary users (PU/SU). Further, the secrecy performance
    of the proposed overlay secure CR-NOMA network is improved by exploiting the multiple
    antennas (MA) at the primary/secondary transmitters and also analyzes the performance
    of PU for both exact/asymptotic behaviors for different network parameters. C.
    Organization of Paper Followed up by the introduction section, the rest part of
    this paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the PLS aspects in the
    two user overlay downlink CR-NOMA system which is making use of SA. In Section
    III, we present a detailed analytical derivations of SOP/SPSC, ASR, and ASSR,
    respectively. Section IV elaborates the overlay CR-NOMA system in which the Pt/ST
    transmitters are making use of multiple antennas along with its extended secrecy
    performance analysis. Section V illustrates the simulation outcomes and observations.
    In Section V, we wrap up our study and draw conclusions. SECTION II. Proposed
    Network Model With Single Transmit Antennas The suggested network model for an
    overlay downlink CR-NOMA network which is equipped with single trasnmit/receive
    antennas at all the nodes is illustrated in Fig 1,. The above framework utilizes
    the NOMA techniques for the downlink communication and has a primary transmitter
    (PT), a primary user (PU), a secondary transmitter (ST), a secondary user (SU),
    and an outside listener (Eve). Since the PU is nearest to the PT and the SU is
    more distant, everyone of the nodes have a single transmitter which operates in
    half-duplex (HD) manner. Obviously, we expect that each channel will be exhibiting
    Rayleigh distributions. Additionally, we presume all of the channels will have
    additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) having a mean of zero and a variance of σ
    2 . Where, h ij represents the channel’s fading parameter. For each i that is
    in the set {s,p} , The complex Gaussian random variable j∈{s,p,E} has a mean of
    zero and a variance of λ ij . The channel gain | h ij | 2 follows an exponential
    distribution with parameter 1 λ ij . FIGURE 1. Proposed network model: Overlay
    secure CR-NOMA network. Show All Although thinking about privacy, remain in the
    fact that an eavesdropper can listen in on U 1 , U 2 , and ST’s interactions.
    When receiving signals, there exist two primary phases. In this HD communication,
    we shall pretend that every node utilizes one antenna for trasnmission as well
    as reception. The x p and x s indicates the information signals of the PU and
    SU, accordingly. The sum of the values at PT and ST is the transmit power, denoted
    as P . The role of ST as a DF relay ensures that x p can reach PU in an overlay
    secure CR-NOMA system. Because of the NOMA technique, ST is able to transmit its
    own signal x s simultaneously, which is a major advantage. There are two equal
    stages that occur during communication as follows: A. Transmission Phase-I In
    the first transmission phase i.e., Ph-I, x p is transmitted by PT and at the same
    time SU sends jamming signal to confound Eve, since the distance between PU and
    Eve is greater than the distance between SU and Eve. The received signal at PU,
    ST, and Eve is given as [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13],
    [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]: y (1) PU y (1) ST y (1) E = h

    h sue are the channel gains between the PT to PU, PT to ST, PT to Eve, and SU
    to Eve, respectively. n (1) PU , n (1) ST , n (1) E are the noises during TS-1
    at PU, ST, Eve, respectively. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
    at the ST/PU to receive signal from PT, respectively, given as [4], [5], [6],

    where ρ (= P σ 2 ) is the transmit SNR. We assume the wiretap is capable of tracking
    multiple users simultaneously (MUD). In specifically, the Eve uses a parallel
    interference cancellation (PIC) approach to decipher the combined U i signal.
    Therefore, the Eve’s SINR for decoding U i ’s signal can be expressed as [4],
    [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18],

    B. Transmission Phase-II During second transmission phase i.e., Ph-II, ST after
    successfully decoding x p , it combines x p with its own message x s using the
    NOMA approach. Then ST forwards the superimposed mixer i.e., a 1 P − − − √ x p
    + a 2 P − − − √ x s to PU, and SU simultaneously. In NOMA theory, as the weak
    users (here SU) are given a greater share of the available power, i.e., a 2 >
    a 1 ( a 1 & a 1 are the power allocation (PA) factors) with a 2 + a 1 = 1. The
    received signal at PU/SU during phase-II is given as, y (2) PU y (2) SU = h sp

    TS-2 the BS transmits a jamming signal with power P j . It eavesdrops on the superimposed

    the received signal, and then choose the data with the highest SNR from the two
    stages to demodulate. The PU and Eve rates corresponding to the two stages towards

    Outage Probability ( SOP SA ) This part aims at how well the suggested overlay
    downlink CR-NOMA system using a single antenna works for SOP at two users, called
    PU and SU, in this way: The user’s instantaneous SINR is less than a certain threshold,
    and the PU and SU signals ( x p and x s ) are sent at acceptable rates ( R p and
    R s ). This leads to the outage. The proposed technique’s SOP is stated as 1)
    SOP of Secondary User ( P SA x s ) The secondary user’s SOP, i.e., P SA x s ,

    deal with a downlink overlay CR-NOMA architecture, depicted in Fig 2. The network
    consists of an array of M antennas at the primary transmitter (PT), an array of
    N antennas at the ST, two single-antenna users representing the PU and the SU,
    and a passive single-antenna eavesdropper referred to as Eve. All nodes are operating
    in HD mode for communication. Considering that the eavesdropper continues to overhear
    repeatedly. We presume the fact that all channels are independent, but all channels
    are not necessarily identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels. These fading
    channel coefficients are represented by h ij,X , i∈{s,p} , j∈{s,p,E} , X∈{M,N}
    which is modeled as an independent CSGD random variable with mean zero and variance
    λ ij,X . Correspondingly, the channel gain h ij,X follows an exponential distribution
    with 1 λ ij,X . Let | h ps,M | 2 , | h ss,N | 2 , | h pp,M | 2 , and | h sp,N

    mentioned in the previous two sections, two single antenna users have distinct
    SOP, SPSC as well as ASR/ASSR, which is mostly determined by power allocation
    variables and channel gains. Multi-antenna transmitters, on the other hand, demonstrate
    improved SOP, SPSC as well as ASR/ASSR performance, as described in (54), (58)
    (67), (70), (79) and (84), respectively. In the context of an overlay CR-NOMA
    method, the downlink communication tasks exhibit more sophisticated representations
    of secure performance. Despite the fact that end-to-end SINR and target transmission
    rate are comparable, the criteria for selecting for two MA transmitting devices
    is an arrangement of the most effective antennas for transmitting information.
    TABLE 2 Simulation Parameters To maintain confidentiality in wireless channel,
    it is feasible to transmit both the information-bearing signal and the jamming
    signals simultaneously through several antennas at the transmitter. From the literature,
    it can be affirmed that different type of jamming signals can be employed. For
    instance, friendly jammer (FJ) signal was employed in [10], while, cooperative
    jamming signal was used in [21] and [26] and artificial-noise (AN) aided jamming
    signal was employed in [41], [42], and [43] for safeguarding the system’s security
    aspects. The information signal becomes hidden during propagation by radiating
    the generated noise isotropically. Alike [10], in our work we have assumed that
    jamming signals are known at the intended users and when users receive the signal,
    they first detect the jamming signal, remove that signal, and then decode the
    information signal. SECTION V. Numerical and Simulation Results In this section,
    the outcomes of both the analytical and simulation are shown in order to demonstrate
    that the suggested secured system is trustworthy. We get outcomes from simulations
    that have been determined on the assessment we did earlier. Let R p = 1bit/s/Hz,
    R s = 0.5bit/s/Hz, the noise power is σ 2 = −110dBm. As we set the distances between
    each varies from 100m to 1km. The Gauss-Chebyshev node is set to n = 200. Fig
    3, shows a performance comparison between the proposed overlay CR-NOMA system
    with and without jamming at the Eve in terms of the SOP of PU and SU versus transmit
    SNR, respectively. The results obtained under the system without jamming is shows
    that, the SOP of PU and SU is very close to unity, where the PIC scheme is implemented
    at Eve. Therefore, in the suggested approach, an artificial jamming signal is
    utilised to guarantee safe reception. Our investigation is confirmed by the conformance
    between the mathematical and the simulation outcomes for the suggested system.
    It is also clear that the proposed overlay CR-NOMA system with jamming improves
    over the without jamming schemes in terms of PU/SU’s secrecy performances under
    pSIC/ipSIC. Since always strong user performs better than the weak user, the SOP
    performance of PU in the proposed NOMA scheme is higher than that of SU, as illustrated
    in Fig 3. FIGURE 3. Transmit SNR Vs secrecy outage probability performance comparison
    between SA-based overlay CR-NOMA system and MA based overlay CR-NOMA system under
    both pSIC/ipSIC assumptions. Show All The secrecy performance comparison of our
    proposed overlay CR-NOMA system equipped with single and multiple antennas is
    simulated in Fig 4 under the presence of the Eve in terms of the SOP of PU and
    SU versus transmit SNR. The results obtained in Fig 4 clearly shows that under
    the influence of MA system our proposed system exhibits improved SOP performances
    of PU and SU than the system equipped with SA. Therefore, in the suggested approach
    with MA system, an artificial jamming signal is utilised to guarantee safe reception.
    Our investigation is confirmed by the conformance between the mathematical and
    the simulation outcomes for the suggested system. FIGURE 4. Transmit SNR Vs secrecy
    outage probability under both SA and MA Case(s). Show All The secrecy performance
    comparison in terms of SOP of PU and SU versus transmit SNR of our proposed overlay
    CR-NOMA system which is equipped with single and multiple antennas is simulated
    in Fig 4 under the presence of the Eve. From the simulation results obtained in
    Fig 4 clearly demonstrates that under the influence of MA system our proposed
    system exhibits improved SOP performances of PU and SU than the system equipped
    with SA. Therefore, in the suggested approach with MA system, an artificial jamming
    signal is utilised to guarantee safe reception. Our investigation is confirmed
    by the conformance between the mathematical and the simulation outcomes for the
    suggested system. The secrecy performance comparison of our proposed overlay CR-NOMA
    system which is equipped with SA is simulated in Fig 5 under the presence of the
    Eve in terms of the SOP of PU and SU versus transmit SNR. The results obtained
    in Fig 5 clearly shows that under the influence of SC/MRC diversity techniques
    for processing the received signals at the PU/Eve end, our proposed system exhibits
    improved SOP performances of PU under MRC scheme than the system equipped with
    SC technique. Moreover, the asymptotic behavior outperforms the exact SNR behaviors
    under both SC/MRC techniques. Therefore, in the suggested approach with SA system,
    an artificial jamming signal is utilised to guarantee safe reception. Our investigation
    is confirmed by the conformance between the mathematical and the simulation outcomes
    for the suggested system. FIGURE 5. Performance comparison of SC and MRC diversity
    techniques in terms of Transmit SNR Vs Exact/Asymptotic SOP (under SA Case). Show
    All The secrecy performance comparison of our proposed overlay CR-NOMA system
    equipped with MA is simulated in Fig 6 under the presence of the Eve in terms
    of the SOP of PU and SU versus transmit SNR. The results obtained in Fig 6 clearly
    shows that under the influence of SC/MRC diversity techniques for processing the
    received signals at the PU/Eve end, our proposed system exhibits improved SOP
    performances of PU under MRC than the system equipped with SC method. FIGURE 6.
    Performance comparison of SC and MRC diversity techniques in terms of Transmit
    SNR Vs Exact/Asymptotic SOP (under MA Case). Show All In Fig 7, the SOP of PU/SU
    is comparable for different values of ζ when PA coefficient i.e., a 1 changes.
    We set ρ to 20 dBm and look at two situations of SIC imperfections where ζ = 0.05,
    and = 0.1. Based on the data, we can see that the SOP of PU goes down as a 1 increases
    upto the upper limit of 0.5. This is because the power given to SU goes down as
    a 1 goes up. So, it becomes more likely that the message x s won’t be decoded
    and then SOP of PU then goes up. At PA coefficients, it is understood that a certain
    level of performance can be reached. Also, we can see that as a 1 goes down, the
    SOP of SU goes down as well. Increasing the strength of the jamming signal to
    prevent eavesdropping is a simple way to increase security. FIGURE 7. PA Coefficient
    ( a 1 ) Vs secrecy outage probability under both pSIC/ipSIC assumptions. Show
    All In Fig 8, the SOP of PU/SU is comparable for different values of PA coefficient
    a 1 . For a fixed value of transmit SNR (i.e., ρ ¯ to 20 dBm ) and plot the graph
    for SOP of PU and SU under two SA and MA systems. From the simulation results,
    we can say that the SOP of PU/SU decreases/increases as a 1 value increases/decreases,
    respectively as illustrated in Fig 8. Finally, the SOP of PU/SU is intensionally
    decreases/increases when we vary a 1 value optimally. FIGURE 8. PA Coefficient
    ( a 1 ) Vs secrecy outage probability under multiple antenna case. Show All The
    simulated results as illustrated by figures 3 to 8 appear to be better in terms
    of both accuracy and efficiency when compared to the research works as portrayed
    in [20] and [21]. Notably, our investigation compares the level of privacy of
    overlay-CR-NOMA system which is equipped with both SA and MAs over Rayleigh fading
    channel. When compared with the aforementioned research works, our outcomes achieved
    better performance. As an illustration, for instance, if we consider Fig. 4, SOP
    of PU/SU at ρ ¯ = 10dB are 0.8726/0.66726 with SA and 0.0092/0.11665 with MA cases.
    On the other hand, SOP varies from 0.9-0.7 in [20] and from 0-0.4 in [21]. In
    addition, we employed both MRC and SC diversity techniques and derived both exact
    and asymptotic expressions for the performance metrics. Furthermore, from the
    simulation results, it can be deduced that our work achieves lower ρ ¯ values
    than what is presented in [20] and [21]. In addition, our study derives and validates
    the expressions corresponding to SPSC and ASR. Nevertheless, those parameters
    were not considered in the aforementioned works by [20] and [21]. As seen in Fig
    9, the only way the SOP changes noticeably is if the target rate is changed under
    both pSIC ( ζ=0 ) and ipSIC ( ζ=0.1 ), respectively. The target rate of PU, i.e.,
    R p , changes from 1 to 4 and must be determined in order to analyse outage performance
    under SA, MA cases, are indicated by the values in both (26), (58), respectively.
    At R p = 4, it is clear that our system is very close to an outage event. This
    primary result confirms that the proposed overlay CR-NOMA system’s outage performance
    suffers from the higher target rates that are required. This finding prompted
    us to investigate additional essential variables that, when combined with acceptable
    controls over related coefficients, can ensure reliable performance. As can be
    seen in the subsequent simulation results, the outage probability is critical
    to the computation of the ergodic and effective rates. FIGURE 9. Target rate (
    R th ) Vs secrecy outage probability under both pSIC/ipSIC assumptions. Show All
    The Fig 10, illustrates that the SPSC performance of PU and SU is plotted as a
    function of transmit SNR under pSIC/ipSIC scenarios. The assessment comparison
    of our suggested overlay CR-NOMA system equipped with SA and MA is simulated under
    the presence of the Eve node. The results obtained in Fig 6 clearly shows that
    under the influence of MA system our proposed system exhibits improved SPSC performance
    both of PU and SU than the system equipped with SA, this means that at low SNR
    levels SPSC is enhanced due to improved diversity gain. Therefore, in the suggested
    approach with MA system, an artificial jamming signal is utilised to guarantee
    safe reception. Our investigation is confirmed by the conformance between the
    mathematical and the simulation outcomes for the suggested system. FIGURE 10.
    Transmit SNR Vs SPSC under both SA and MA Case (s). Show All In Fig. 11, the average
    secrecy rates comparison of both PU and SU for the proposed overlay CR-NOMA downlink
    system under pSIC/ipSIC is shown as a function of transmit SNR over Rayleigh fading
    channel, wherein the outcomes of the analyses performed deploying equations (54),
    and (58), have been verified via experiments conducted in MATLAB. As ρ ¯ raising

    of the proposed system outperforms than that SU under pSIC/ipSIC respectively,
    and than OMA system over Rayleigh fading channel. FIGURE 11. Average SNR Vs ASR
    of both the NU&FU users under pSIC/ipSIC. Show All In Fig. 12, our proposed overlay
    CR-NOMA system is shown where the average secrecy rate performances comparison
    between two user is plotted under single and multiple antenna cases over Rayleigh
    fading channel. The outcomes of the analyses performed deploying equations (63),
    (67), (106), and (111), respectively, have been verified via experiments conducted
    in MATLAB. As ρ ¯ rises the ASR of each user also rises gradually. The graphs
    that are provided for the ASR of the SA structure have been exhibited simply the
    sake of contrast, and the achievement of the SA structure is worse compared to
    that of the MA scenario. The achievable ASR of PU of the proposed system outperforms
    than that SU under both SA and MA cases, respectively, and than SA system over
    Rayleigh fading channel. FIGURE 12. Average SNR Vs ASR of both the SU & PU users

    ASSR under SA/MA cases is plotted as function of ρ ¯ over Rayleigh fading channel

    conducted in MATLAB. As ρ ¯ raising along with the ASR of each of the users exponentially.
    The achievable ASSR of PU performs better than SU under both pSIC/ipSIC assumptions,
    respectively, and OMA system over Rayleigh fading channel. FIGURE 13. Average

    SECTION VI. Conclusion In this work, we have proposed a downlink overlay secure
    CR-NOMA scheme with MA/SA at the primary/secondary transmitters, the secrecy performance
    comparison between two users PU and SU are obtained under pSIC and ipSIC modes,
    respectively. This paper investigates the secrecy performance of proposed downlink
    CR-NOMA system equipped with SA in terms of few performance metrics such as ASR,
    ASSR, SPSC, SOP, etc. To characterize the secrecy performance of the proposed
    CR-NOMA network, the novel closed-form analytical expressions of the exact/asymptotic
    SOP/SPSC and the ASR/ASSR are derived under the both pSIC and ipSIC scenarios.
    Furthermore, we extend our proposed work with SA’s to MA scenario, where MA’s
    are exploited at the PT as well ST, respectively, for the sake of providing cooperative
    diversity. In addition, we implement both selection combining (SC)/maximal ratio
    combining (MRC) techniques for processing the received signals at the PU/Eve,
    which further improves the system’s capacity, and enhances the secrecy performance
    of the proposed system. To this end, a performance comparison for both the system
    models i.e., SA-based CR-NOMA system and MA-based CR-NOMA system in terms of SOP,
    SPSC, and ASR has been carried out through analytical and simulation results.
    Based on the analytical frameworks, the numerical and simulation results are obtained
    under different network parameters. In this regard, the outcomes of the simulations
    are shown to prove the reliability of the mathematical analysis and the accuracy
    of the suggested technique as well. In our future works, we intend to evaluate
    the secrecy performance of energy harvesting enabled overlay/underlay downlink/uplink
    CR-NOMA networks with transmit power optimization over different fading channels.

    Challenges Implementing Internet of Things (IoT) Using Cognitive Radio Capabilities
    in 5G Mobile Networks Chapter © 2016 Internet of Things and Cognitive Radio Networks:
    Applications, Challenges and Future Chapter © 2023 Cognition Radio Enabled IoT
    Chapter © 2020 Keywords Cognitive Radio Internet of Things (IoT) Spectrum sharing
    Dynamic spectrum access Frequency bands 1 Introduction Spectrum is a natural source
    and there is very limited availability of spectrum. There is a fixed spectrum
    assignment and bandwidth is also found to be very expensive. Some frequency bands
    like radio and TV are unutilized while the other frequency bands are overutilized.
    This shows that there is inefficiency in the utilization of the spectrum. This
    necessitates to exploit the spectrum opportunistically; therefore, we need to
    dynamically utilize the spectrum, which is called dynamic spectrum access [1].
    To achieve this dynamic spectrum access, we need a clever radio or clever system.
    Such a clever system or radio is known as cognitive radio. It is an intelligent,
    adaptive, aware radio model that senses its functional surroundings and dynamically
    adapts its radio operating parameter to update systems like mitigating interference,
    facilitating interoperability, and maximizing throughput. Spectrum scarcity is
    one of the major problems as most of the spectrum is left unused leaving behind
    spectrum holes. So, cognitive radio makes use of their spectrum hole in an efficient
    manner, thus leaving very less spectrum holes. Recent studies show that in the
    integration of cognitive radios with IoT-based wireless communication technologies,
    multiantenna systems [1,2,3] offer better results in terms of data rates, efficiency,
    availability, complexity, robustness and solve the spectrum scarcity issues even
    in coming age of the Internet of Things [4,5,6,7]. Improved intelligent radio
    systems efficiently work with fifth generation wireless networks by employing
    the licensed spectrum with the primary user and unlicensed spectrum combined with
    different application bands [8]. As it is an effective tool to mitigate various
    issues wirelessly, its smart sensing technique regulates the ability of spectrum
    resources [9]. The predominant characteristics of cognitive radio are its capability
    and reconfigurability. The capability of the cognitive radio to sense its radio
    environment by noting down the variations is called cognitive capability whereas
    the ability of the cognitive radio to change the functional elements according
    to the need of the radio surroundings is called reconfigurability. Achieving these
    characteristics in cognitive radio can be well explained in the “cognitive cycle”
    as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Cognitive radio cycle Full size image The primary role
    of cognitive radio is spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum sharing,
    and spectrum mobility. The process of detecting an unused part of the spectrum
    or spectrum hole, that is, detecting whether the primary user is present or absent.
    Occupying the efficient part of the spectrum to obtain the user’s requirement
    is spectrum management. In addition, the cognitive radio provides fair spectrum
    scheduling method among Cognitive radios users and distributes spectrum among
    the scheduled users is known as spectrum sharing. Further, spectrum mobility performs
    transition to a better spectrum, that is, to empty the channel, where the licensed
    user is identified. Further, this chapter is structured as follows. Section 2
    comprises the system model of the IoT-based cognitive radio network. Section 3
    comprises the spectrum sensing phenomenon and layer-wise structure of the cognitive
    radio cycle. Further, Sect. 4 illustrates the IoTs-based cognitive radio network
    structure. Section 5 presents the complete process of spectrum sensing using MATLAB.
    Section 6 comprises the simulation results and discussion followed by the conclusion
    in Sect. 7. 2 System Model for IoT-Based Cognitive Radio Considering an IoT-based
    cognitive radio network consisting of a primary IoT device (PD), primary access
    point (PAP), secondary IoT device (SD), and secondary access point (SAP) as shown
    in Fig. 2. It is assumed PD and SD transmit information to their respective access
    point. The spectrum has been divided into licensed primary IoT (P-IoT) and unlicensed
    secondary IoT (S-IoT). Assuming that primary access point (PAP) and the secondary
    access point (SAP) are unbuffered, thus there is no possibility of the combination
    of signals received from earlier transmissions. If an error occurs during the
    transmission, we adopt an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol to correct the
    error. When new information is generated at the PD or SD, while the primary IoT
    and secondary IoT users are busy in the current transmission, the PD and SD discard
    the current information and start to transmit new information or packet of data.
    Fig. 2 IoT-based cognitive radio network Full size image 3 Potentials of Cognitive
    Radio Cognitive radio is a dynamic spectrum access that improves spectrum utilization.
    It gives better interoperability and improved vertical handoff by selecting the
    best network. Link optimization is done with respect to modulation, power and
    topology, better usage of other resources, increased capacity and high data rates,
    improved coverage, service quality, and link reliability by intelligently identifying
    the channels for communication. In spectrum management, the use of radio frequency
    for efficient use and gain benefits of cognitive radio is regulated [10]. It has
    three processes such as cycle sensing, deciding, and acting. The measurements
    are taken in first process and spectrum sensing is performed, which is affected
    by various wireless limitations. Because the measurements may be uncertain in
    first process, a decision needs to be made by the secondary, which is knowledge
    based and observation. Eventually, in the last step of the cycle, because of the
    uncertainty, wrong actions are taken. So, it is important to acknowledge the uncertainty
    by sensing the spectrum optimally by making right decisions and taking correct
    action. Spectrum sensing is a very eminent method in cognitive radio system because
    it allows secondary users to acknowledge about the environment by finding the
    availability of primary user. It is formulated as follows: $$ y(k)=\\Big\\{{\\displaystyle
    \\begin{array}{c}{N}_0\\kern7.5em {\\mathrm{H}}_0\\kern0.5em :\\mathrm{PU}\\kern2.375em
    \\mathrm{Absent}\\\\ {}h\\ast x(k)+{N}_0,\\kern3.125em {\\mathrm{H}}_1\\kern0.78em
    :\\mathrm{PU}\\kern2.375em \\mathrm{Present}\\end{array}} $$ (1) where k = 1 ….
    K, K is the number of samples, y(k) is the SU received signal, x(k) is the PU
    signal, N0 is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and variance
    𝛿w2, and h is the complex channel gain of the sensing channel. H0 and H1 show
    the presence and absence of the PU signal. The PU signal detection is achieved
    using one of the spectrum sensing method to take decisions among the two hypotheses
    H0 and H1. At the receiver end, the test statistic (T), is then correlated to
    a threshold (γ) to sense the presence or absence of PU signal. The Hypothesis
    H1 and H0 refer to the presence and absence of the PU signal respectively and
    decided as follows: $$ \\Big\\{\\kern0.5em {\\displaystyle \\begin{array}{c}\\
    T\\ge \\gamma, \\kern6.75em {\\mathrm{H}}_1\\\\ {}\\ T<\\gamma, \\kern6.25em {\\mathrm{H}}_0\\end{array}}
    $$ (2) where 𝛾 denotes the sensing threshold. Absence of PU signals enables the
    SU to get access to the PU channel. 3.1 Generic Flow Diagram of Cognitive Radio
    The fundamental objective of cognitive radios is spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing,
    and spectrum access. They work in PHY and MAC layers [11]. Further, cognitive
    radios influence the functioning of upper protocol layer. For quality of services
    observation, learning and decision-making must also be performed at the network,
    transport, and application layers [12]. Figure 3, shows the generic flow diagram
    of cognitive system. Fig. 3 Generic cognitive radio flow diagram Full size image
    4 IoT-Based Cognitive Radio 4.1 Need for Cognitive Radio in IoT The exponential
    growth of internet traffic, count of licensed users will increase accordingly.
    This will make an issue to the unlicensed users. Therefore, it is very difficult
    to manage the expenses of obtaining spectrum from these unauthorized users. Cognitive
    radio networks are the feasible choice to combat this issue. Second, the expanding
    of internet will increase the count of IoT tools connected to the network. This
    will cause interference in the network due to device-to-device communication.
    IoT-based cognitive radio can assign channels that are interference free. Huge
    payload of information generated by individual users will require enormous bandwidth
    for transmission. Efficient spectrum utilization using cognitive radio technology
    will cater to this challenge. 4.2 Cognitive Architecture for IoT The cognitive
    architecture structure for the cellular IoT is shown in Fig. 4 [13]. The framework
    consists of three levels of enablers. Each layer consists of fabrics that are
    used for the mechanism of various functionalities. The virtual object (VO) levels
    create the virtual description of real-world and digital objects are used for
    the exchange of the information with the real-world object (RWO). Fig. 4 Cognitive
    radio IoT-based architecture Full size image The VOs can be further used for the
    generation of composite virtual objects (CVOs). Thus, the combination of these
    layers and structure together will create a cognitive network which can be used
    for power optimization, energy efficiency, reduced computational time, and increased
    reliability. The service function includes translation of service request, real
    world knowledge, and request information down to the CVO level in order to create
    meaningful mashups to serve the request. The real-world knowledge will help us
    decision-making necessary for cognitive radio cycle [14]. 5 Flowchart for Spectrum
    Sensing in Cognitive Radio In this section, a brief flowchart for spectrum sensing
    in cognitive radio is discussed. We considered five different combinations for
    primary users with different transmission signal frequencies of 1 KHz, 2 KHz,
    3 KHz, 4 KHz, and 5 KHz, respectively as shown in Fig. 5. Different cases have
    been considered describing various combinations of primary users. We calculate
    the sum of all primary users and plot the power versus frequency graph of the
    resultant signal. Further, the spectrum is checked for any empty slot and secondary
    user is supposed to occupy the empty slot. After the secondary user has entered
    in the spectrum, we calculate the sum of the primary user signal and secondary
    user signal and plot the power spectral density. The sampling frequency is chosen
    to be 12 KHz. The noise affects the spectrum sensing process; accordingly, we
    consider the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is equivalent to 15 dB in each case.
    Fig. 5 Flowchart for Spectrum Sensing Full size image 6 Results and Discussion
    This section covers all the results simulated in MATLAB software using efficient
    spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio. Figure 6 shows the presence of
    one primary user keeping channel capacity minimum and probability is less. Second,
    empty slots are occupied by secondary user as shown in Fig. 8, by improving channel
    capacity and deduction in probability. Secondary user fills the third and fourth
    slots in the iteration as shown in Figs. 10 and 12, respectively. Fig. 6 Only
    one primary user is present in spectrum Full size image In fifth iteration, due
    to the presence of one primary user, all slots are occupied as shown in Fig. 14,
    having maximum channel capacity and spectrum probability. Case 1: Figure 6 shows
    the power spectral density graph for the cognitive radio system when only one
    primary user is present. Only one slot is occupied, which is shown in graph by
    the spiky peaks on the both sides of 1 KHz frequency spectrum. The power in this
    frequency range is almost 1 dB, that is, most of the signal power is confined
    within this spectrum. Figure 7 shows the probability of detection of empty slots
    due to the presence of only primary user. The detection probability of vacant
    slot is maximum in this case. Fig. 7 Detection Probability of holes in presence
    of one PU Full size image Case 2: Secondary user senses the spectrum and occupies
    the second slot. Now, two slots are present in the spectrum. This is shown in
    graph by two spiky peaks ranging between 1 and 2 KHz frequency spectrum. Power
    in these two bands is almost equal to 4 dB as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Secondary
    primary user is present in spectrum Full size image Figure 9 shows the probability
    detection of unoccupied slots when only two slots are in use. The detection probability
    of empty slots somehow decreases as compared to case 1, because one more slot
    gets occupied in this case. Fig. 9 Detection Probability of holes in presence
    of second PU Full size image Case 3: In Fig. 10, secondary user again senses the
    spectrum and finds three empty slots, thereby, occupying the third slot. The spiky
    peaks at 1, 2, and 3 KHz band frequency demonstrate the occupancy of three slots.
    Again, the power at these frequency bands is 4 dB. Figure 11 shows the detection
    probability when three slots are occupied. Again, it can be seen that with the
    occupancy of one more slot, the detection probability of empty slot decreases.
    Fig. 10 Third primary user is present in spectrum Full size image Fig. 11 Detection
    Probability of holes in presence of third PU Full size image Case 4: Figure 12
    shows the power spectral density graph when four slots are occupied. This is shown
    with four spiky peaks at 1, 2, 3, and 4 KHz frequency bands. Figure 13, demonstrates
    the decrease in the detection probability of empty slots. Now, only one slot is
    left unoccupied. Fig. 12 Fourth primary user is present in spectrum Full size
    image Fig. 13 Detection Probability of holes in presence of fourth PU Full size
    image Case 5: Secondary user once again senses the spectrum in the fifth repetition
    and fills the fifth slot. Figure 14 shows the full spectrum with all slots being
    occupied. Now, there is no scope for any spectrum hole. The slots are occupied
    at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 KHz frequency bands. Most of the signal power is confined
    in the spectrum over these bands. The bandwidth requirement for the transmission
    of all primary users will be 4 KHz. In this way, efficient spectrum sensing is
    being done by the cognitive radio algorithm. Figure 15 shows the detection probability
    when all slots are occupied. The detection probability of empty slots is the least.
    Fig. 14 All five primary users present in the spectrum Full size image Fig. 15
    Detection Probability of holes in presence of fifth PU Full size image Table 1
    lists the detection probability (PD) of vacant slots versus probability of false
    alarm for different occupancy. The probability of false alarm (PF) has been taken
    as 0.1 for each case. Table 1 Detection Probability versus false alarm probability
    Full size table 7 Conclusion This chapter presents the insight and innovative
    ideas of cellular IoT-based cognitive radio networks. The need of cognitive radio
    in IoT and IoT-based cognitive radio architecture has been briefly discussed in
    this chapter. We also present efficient spectrum sensing algorithm depending on
    spectrum sensing. The algorithm takes five iterations to make the spectrum completely
    occupied. In each and every iteration, secondary user occupies the slot left vacate
    by the primary user. Thus, minimum resources are getting wasted and full occupancy
    of channel is obtained in the last iteration. The last iteration, that is, when
    all the slots get occupied are having highest detection probability and spectral
    efficiency. In this way, the channel goes from the worst to the best case. Simulation
    results validate our analysis. Cognitive radio can be used for 4G and 5G technology
    for better spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing. References T. Alam, S.R. Thummaluru,

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Cognitive unmanned aerial
    vehicles (CUAVs) play a significant role in meeting the communication requirements
    of next-generation wireless systems that operate in cognitive environments using
    unlicensed spectrum [1]. The necessity of CUAVs, commonly known as drones, is
    increasing daily; CUAVs can be employed as aerial next-generation base stations
    (gNBs) or relays for the immediate reconstruction of communication services [2],
    [3], [4]. A specific framework for creating a steady and reliable link between
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and existing cellular networks was established
    by the 3 rd generation partnership project (3GPP) [5]. Based on 3GPP, the following
    two connection linkages between a UAV and ground gNB are required. ( i ) Control
    link, referred to as a command-and-control (CaC) connection: it controls and regulates
    UAV flight operation among ground gNBs; and (ii) data link, referred to as an
    application data connection: it controls and regulates UAV flight operation according
    to customer requirements between the UAV and ground gNB [5]. Ultra-reliable and
    low-latency communications (URLLC) systems are needed for CUAVs. URLLC designs
    must balance low latency and high reliability. Since CUAV needs both high reliability
    and low latency, it is now important to research wireless networks using finite
    block length theory (FBLT). However, the traditional infinite block length theory
    (IBLT) can no longer be used because it does not meet the requirements for latency
    and reliability. The FBLT scheme is employed in mission-critical applications,
    such as real-time tracking, rapid transmission, autonomous driving, remote control,
    and tactile Internet. Contrastingly, the IBLT scheme is employed in sensing tasks,
    such as remote sensing, remote coverage, surveillance, security, observation,
    smart monitoring in the agricultural and civil infrastructure sectors, and environmental
    monitoring [6]. In the past few years, researchers have explored the various applications
    of UAV networks by applying IBLT and FBLT. Using the FBLT scheme, non-orthogonal
    multiple access (NOMA)-based UAV-aided communication networks have been proposed
    [7]. The authors of [8] focused on the control and non-payload links of UAV communication
    systems. From a UAV-enabled relay network perspective, wherein the UAV serves
    as a relay, the total decoding error rate minimization [9], joint power allocation
    and location optimization of the UAV [10], joint transmit power, and block length
    optimization scheme [11] have been addressed. In addition, UAV-assisted Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) networks [12] and device-to-device (D2D) networks [13] have been shown to
    be efficient ways of improving system performance. Moreover, millimeter-wave communication
    [14] and secure communication [15] in UAV networks have been investigated for
    low-latency and high-reliability applications. Spectrum-sharing cognitive radio
    (CR) network performance has been investigated using the FBLT scheme [16]. The
    aforementioned studies on UAV communications [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12],
    [13], [14], [15], [16] focused on relay networks, IoT networks, D2D networks,
    and CR networks where the FBLT was applied. In [7], the authors investigated optimum
    resource allocation methods for NOMA and relaying systems to maximize UAV throughput
    while ensuring ground users (GUs) transmission quality in terms of throughput
    and reliability. In [10], the research studied jointly optimizing the UAV’s position
    and power to decrease the probability of decoding errors while maintaining latency
    limitations. In [11], the authors proposed an efficient joint blocklength and
    transmit power optimization technique to optimize the adequate amount of information
    received by the control center while considering latency and reliability constraints.
    In [16], the authors optimized the minimal average rate for the secondary UAV-assisted
    IoT network, subject to a probabilistic interference power restriction on the
    primary network. Few recent studies have focused on integrating NOMA with UAV
    systems in a pairing scheme. In [17], the authors investigated the combined NOMA
    power allocation, user pairing, and UAV deployment for UAV-based wireless systems.
    For this configuration, the author optimized the user pairing, power distribution,
    and UAV placement in order to maximize the minimum total rate for each user pair.
    In [18], the study explored the utilization of a UAV as a pairing user to increase
    the total capacity through flexible pairing in NOMA. In addition, the performance
    of flexible pairing was described in terms of total capacity, outage probability,
    and throughput. In [19], a K-means clustering-based UAV deployment technique was
    presented to optimize the uplink NOMA service regions. Moreover, a location-based
    user pairing approach was provided for the multiple UAVs-assisted uplink NOMA.
    In [20], the study provided an energy-efficient pairing and power allocation approach
    for UAVs and GUs in a NOMA UAV network. Furthermore, the objective was to decrease
    the energy consumption of both UAVs and GUs during uplink data transfer and to
    ensure their needed transmission speeds by optimizing pairing and power. To the
    best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no recent work on the CUAV-assisted IoT
    network using the NOMA technique beyond [1]. In addition, the subject of maximizing
    energy efficiency has not been studied in the available literature [7], [10],
    [11], [16]. Moreover, the UAV pairing technique in CR environment utilizing the
    FBLT scheme has not been recently studied [17], [18], [19], [20]. In prior research
    [1], the CUAV has a massive machine-type communication (mMTC) transceiver for
    transferring application data, such as smart agriculture, environmental monitoring,
    and security monitoring. In addition, CUAV is equipped with a URLLC transceiver
    for transferring CaC data to conduct CUAV flight operations. Herein, one transceiver
    transmits mMTC and URLLC information by applying the NOMA technique jointly; therefore,
    this CUAV is hereafter referred to as m/uCUAV. Hence, it is necessary to investigate
    the m/uCUAV paring scheme using the FBLT because CUAVs provide both mMTC and URLLC
    services based on customer requirements. In this study, we investigate a pairing
    approach for multiple m/uCUAV devices to achieve better performance using the
    NOMA system. Our contributions to the present study are as follows. We propose
    multiple m/uCUAV-enabled NOMA technology wherein two m/uCUAV devices in each pair
    communicate with the gNB at the same bandwidth. Next, we derive the theoretical
    expressions of data rate, energy efficiency, and propagation latency for a pairing
    scheme of m/uCUAV devices by considering the FBLT scheme. In addition, we consider
    the 3GPP-based path-loss model and gNB antenna gain for accurately characterized
    channels, which is different from our earlier work [1]. Furthermore, we propose
    an optimization problem to maximize the energy efficiency of paired m/uCUAV devices
    by jointly optimizing the transmission power of the mMTC and URLLC information
    while fulfilling the latency requirement. To solve this problem, we divide the
    problem into two sub-problems with two stages: the pairing scheme and the optimum
    powers of the mMTC and URLLC information. We obtain the optimum powers of mMTC
    and URLLC information using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) criteria and Cramer’s
    approach. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed multiple-m/uCUAV-enabled
    wireless network. Simulation results show that compared to the existing scheme
    [1], the proposed scheme can significantly increase energy efficiency and reduce
    latency. In addition, the proposed approach maximizes energy efficiency compared
    to orthogonal multiple access (OMA), equal power, and channel inversion. The remainder
    of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the network model,
    frame structure, spectrum sensing, signal model, and propagation channel model.
    Section III presents the performance metrics, such as the data rate, energy efficiency,
    and propagation latency, for the considered network model. Section IV presents
    the optimization problem formulation for multiple m/uCUAV-enabled wireless networks
    and subsequently provides a solution to the formulated problem. Section presents
    the simulation results and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed solution.
    Finally, Section concludes the study. SECTION II. Network Architecture and Model
    A. Network Model We consider a CUAV-IoT network model for the execution of sensing
    tasks. One gNB, multiple rotary-wing1 m/uCUAVs, and one primary transmitter (PT)
    are deployed, as shown in Fig. 1. First, the m/uCUAVs sense the data/information
    in the uplink phase; they have a small server that stores the collected information.
    Subsequently, they transmit the information to the gNB in the downlink phase.
    This study describes only the downlink phase of the m/uCUAV devices where two
    types of information are transmitted: URLLC information, such as the CaC operation,
    and mMTC information, such as the sensing operation. The m/uCUAV and gNB are the
    secondary transmitter and receiver, respectively. They are each equipped with
    a single omnidirectional antenna with unitary gain in any direction and a uniform
    linear array antenna. A set of m/uCUAVs is denoted by K={i|1,2,3,…,K} , where
    K is the total number of m/uCUAVs. All m/uCUAVs were deployed at various altitudes
    h ui (∀i∈K) . Fig. 1. Illustration of the system model where the signal arrives
    at gNB from two paired m/uCUAV devices. Intrusion is generated only from a primary
    transmitter (PT). Here, m/uCUAV devices collect IoT/mMTC devices’ data according
    to their missions. Show All As shown in Fig. 2, each m/uCUAV must access one resource
    block with bandwidth B/K , where B is the available bandwidth for the system.
    Motivated by [21], [22], we proposed a pair of m/uCUAVs, such as ( k−1 )-th and
    k -th m/uCUAVs, owing to the higher bandwidth 2B/K . Therefore, the set of m/uCUAV
    pairs was denoted by K p ={(k−1,k)|(1,2),(3,4),…,(K−1,K)} . Based on the channel
    gains, gNB2 determined the pairs in which the k -th m/uCUAV is paired with k−1
    -th m/uCUAV. Without loss of generality, we considered the channel gains to be
    arranged as | g k ug | 2 <| g k−1 ug | 2 , where | g k ug | 2 and | g k−1 ug |
    2 represent the channel gains from k -th m/uCUAV to gNB and k−1 -th m/uCUAV to
    gNB, respectively. In addition, the corresponding power allocations for URLLC
    and mMTC information were arranged as: P k u > P k−1 u > P k m > P k−1 m . Fig.
    2. Considered bandwidth and power allocation scenarios for two m/uCUAV devices:
    (a) NOMA [1] and (b) proposed NOMA. Show All B. Frame Structure and Spectrum Sensing
    Owing to the solution for spectrum scarcity, m/uCUAV utilized the same radio resource
    blocks to transmit both mMTC and URLLC information; each resource block comprised
    a single frequency channel and a single time slot. To avoid collisions, we applied
    the NOMA scheme to mMTC and URLLC information so that m/uCUAV used the same frequency
    and timeslot in different power allocations. In primary communication, the PT
    transmits information to the assigned primary users. As a secondary communication,
    m/uCUAV measures the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the PT.
    The mathematical term Ω( γ p ) is denoted as [23]: Ω( γ p )={ 1, 0, γ p ≥ γ t
    γ p < γ t , (1) View Source where γ p is the SINR of PT, and γ t is the intended
    SINR. It should be noted that “1” implies an occupied resource block, and “0”
    indicates an unoccupied resource block. In secondary communication, m/uCUAV uses
    unoccupied resource blocks. C. Signal Model The NOMA signal transmitted by the
    ( k -1)-th and k -th m/uCUAV can be represented as x k−1 = x k = P k−1 u − − −
    − √ x k−1 u + P k−1 m − − − − √ x k−1 m P k u − − − √ x k u + P k m − − − √ x
    k m , (2a) (2b) View Source where x u and x m are the transmitted signals of URLLC
    and mMTC information, respectively. P u and P m are the transmit powers of the
    URLLC and mMTC information, respectively. Because P u is URLLC information, we
    assume P u > P m . The received signal at the gNB can be expressed as follows
    y g = x k g k ug + x k−1 g k−1 ug + P p − − √ x p g pg + n g , (3) View Source
    where x p is the transmitted signal of the PT; P p is the transmit power of the
    PT; g pg denotes the channel gain between the PT and gNB; and n g is the additive
    white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with a mean of zero and variance σ 2 g . Based on
    the spectrum sensing scenario discussed in Section II-B, two types of SINR are
    described as follows. ( i ) Effectual SINR: when the PT is inactive in communication;
    and (ii) Intrusion SINR: when the PT is active in communication. 1) Effectual
    SINR: In such a scenario, there is no interference from the PT. The SINR of the
    k -th URLLC information can be expressed as follows: γ k u = P k u ∣ ∣ g k ug
    ∣ ∣ 2 I k u + σ 2 g , (4) View Source where I k u = P k−1 u | g k−1 ug | 2 + P
    k m | g k ug | 2 + P k−1 m | g k−1 ug | 2 and σ 2 g =2 N o B/K . N o represents
    the noise power spectral density. For the transmission of mMTC and URLLC information,
    the gNB first decoded the k -th URLLC information followed by ( k -1)-th URLLC
    information, k -th mMTC information, and ( k -1)-th mMTC information using the
    successive interference cancellation (SIC) method. The SINR of the ( k -1)-th
    URLLC, k -th and ( k -1)-th mMTC information can be expressed as follows: γ k−1
    u = γ k m = γ k−1 m = P k−1 u ∣ ∣ g k−1 ug ∣ ∣ 2 I k−1 u + σ 2 g , P k m ∣ ∣ g
    k ug ∣ ∣ 2 I k m + σ 2 g , P k−1 m ∣ ∣ g k−1 ug ∣ ∣ 2 I k−1 m + σ 2 g , (5) (6)
    (7) View Source where I k−1 u = Θ 1 P k u | g k ug | 2 + P k m | g k ug | 2 +
    P k−1 m | g k−1 ug | 2 , I k m = Θ 1 P k u | g k ug | 2 + Θ 2 P k−1 u | g k−1
    ug | 2 + P k−1 m | g k−1 ug | 2 , and I k−1 m = Θ 1 P k u | g k ug | 2 + Θ 2 P
    k−1 u | g k−1 ug | 2 + Θ 3 P k m | g k ug | 2 . Furthermore, Θ 1 , Θ 2 , and Θ
    3 are SIC errors with values ranging from 0 to 1, where Θ=0 and Θ=1 indicate correct
    and incorrect SIC, respectively. 2) Intrusion SINR: In such a scenario, there
    is interference from the PT. The SINR of the k -th and ( k -1)-th URLLC information
    are as follows: γ k up = γ k−1 up = P k u ∣ ∣ g k ug ∣ ∣ 2 I k u + P p | g pg

    gain of the gNB. In this study, we adopted two path-loss models based on the 3GPP
    channel model: the U2G (m/uCUAV to gNB) and P2G (PT to gNB) channels. In addition,
    we briefly discussed the gNB antenna gain based on the 3GPP model. 1) U2G Channel:
    Each m/uCUAV has an LoS and NLoS link with varying probabilities depending on
    the m/uCUAV and gNB locations. The LoS probability for an m/uCUAV hovering between
    m/uCUAV and gNB is given by [5] ς l ={ 1, r o r 2D xy +(1− r o r 2D xy )exp( −
    r 2D xy p o ), r 2D xy ≤ r o r 2D xy ≥ r o (13) View Source where r o is measured
    in meters. The values of p o and r o can be represented as p o =4300 log 10 (
    h ui )−3800 and r o =max(460 log 10 ( h ui )−700,18) , respectively. In [5], [24],
    the average path-loss model was calculated as follows PL xy = ς l ⋅ Pl l xy +(1−
    ς l )⋅ Pl n xy . (14) View Source where the path-loss for the LoS and NLoS links
    is given by Pl l xy =28+22 log 10 ( r 3D xy )+20 log 10 (f) and Pl n xy =−17.5+(46−7
    log 10 ( h ui )) log 10 ( r 3D xy )+20 log 10 (40πf/3) , respectively; and f is
    the carrier frequency. 2) P2G Channel: By considering the property of the P2G
    channel, the path-loss factor is given as [25] PL xy =max( Pl l xy , Pl n xy ),

    t and h r are the altitudes of the transmitter and receiver, respectively. 3)
    gNB Antenna Gain: As stated in [26], the gNB antenna gain was calculated as the
    antenna element gain and beamforming gain (array factor). The gain of each antenna
    element is given by: A e (ϕ,θ)= G m −min{−[ A e,h (ϕ)+ A e,v (θ)], A f }, (16)
    View Source where A e,h (ϕ)=−min[12 ( ϕ ϕ 3dB ) 2 , A f ] ; A e,v (θ)=−min[12
    ( θ−90 θ 3dB ) 2 , A s ] ; ϕ and θ are the azimuth and elevation angles, respectively,

    directional gain of the antenna elements; ϕ 3dB = 65 o and θ 3dB = 65 o are the
    3 dB beam-widths of the horizontal and vertical patterns, respectively; A f =30
    dB is the front-back ratio; A s =30 dB is the side-lobe level limit; and A e,h
    (ϕ) and A e,v (θ) are the antenna radiation patterns in the horizontal and vertical
    directions, respectively. For beamforming [27], the total gNB antenna gain from
    (16) can be expressed as A ag (ϕ,θ)= 10 A e (ϕ,θ)/10 ⋅ G b (θ). (17) View Source
    where G b (θ)= sin 2 (π N a θ) N 2 a sin 2 (πθ) ; G b (θ) is the antenna array
    gain of the gNB; and N a is the number of antennas. E. User Plane Latency User
    plane (UP) latency is a significant challenge for the interaction and monitoring
    of CUAV with a secure and reliable approach in the CUAV-IoT network. The UP latency,
    denoted by t upl is the time required to transfer information from the transmitter
    to the receiver. As determined by [1], it consists of eight parts. t upl = t ss
    + t pp + t en +2( t t + t prop )+ t de , (18) View Source where t ss represents
    the time required for spectrum sensing and determines any unoccupied resource
    block over the unlicensed spectrum; t pp is the pre-processing time necessary
    for the transfer of information, such as channel requests, scheduling grants,
    and queuing delays; t en and t de denote the encoding and decoding of the information,
    respectively; t t denotes the time required for transmitting a single fragment
    of information; and t prop denotes the propagation time of information between
    the transceiver pair. In (18), we mention two times t t + t prop due to the transmission
    and re-transmission. Because the UP latency budget has been proposed as one millisecond
    (ms), conferring beyond 5G, one transmission time interval (TTI) is equivalent
    to 0.125 ms, based on (18). SECTION III. Performance Metrics This section presents
    a theoretical analysis of the data rate, energy efficiency, and propagation latency
    for the considered network model. A. Data Rate Based on the spectrum sensing scenario
    discussed in Section II-B, the following two types of data rates exist ( i ) Effectual
    data rate: when PT is inactive in communication, and (ii) Intrusion data rate:
    when PT is active in communication. The theoretical expressions for the data rate
    of paired m/uCUAVs are presented below. 1) Effectual Data Rate: Considering the
    URLLC information, the total effectual data rate of K p paired m/uCUAVs for Ω=0
    is given by [1], [28] E D u = E D k−1 u = E D k u = ∑ (k−1,k)∈ K p E D k−1 u +E

    where Ψ 1 = t d t s + t d p r (Ω=0)(1− p f ) , γ k−1 u1 =1−(1+ γ k−1 u ) −2 ,
    and γ k u1 =1−(1+ γ k u ) −2 ; B o , C b , ε , t d , and t s denote the paired
    bandwidth, channel block length, the probability of decoding error, transmission
    time, and sensing time, respectively; Q −1 (⋅) is the inverse of the Q -function;
    and p r (Ω=0)(1− p f ) denotes the perfect detection probability, where p f represents
    the probability of a false alarm. Similarly, for the decoding of mMTC information,
    the total effectual data rate of K p paired m/uCUAVs for Ω=0 is given as [1] E
    D m = E D k−1 m = E D k m = ∑ (k−1,k)∈ K p E D k−1 m +E D k m Ψ 1 [ B o log 2
    (1+ γ k−1 m )− γ k−1 m1 C b − − − − − √ Q −1 (ε)], Ψ 1 [ B o log 2 (1+ γ k m )−

    γ k−1 m ) −2 and γ k m1 =1−(1+ γ k m ) −2 . 2) Intrusion Data Rate: Considering
    the intrusion from the PT, we determined the intrusion data rate of the mMTC and
    URLLLC information. Thus, the total intrusion data rate of the URLLC information
    of K p paired m/uCUAVs for Ω=1 is given by I D u = I D k−1 u = I D k u = ∑ (k−1,k)∈
    K p I D k−1 u +I D k u Ψ 2 ⎡ ⎣ B o log 2 (1+ γ k−1 up )− γ k−1 up1 C b − − − −
    − √ Q −1 (ε) ⎤ ⎦ , Ψ 2 ⎡ ⎣ B o log 2 (1+ γ k up )− γ k up1 C b − − − − √ Q −1

    (Ω=1)(1− p d ) denotes the imperfect detection probability, where p d is the probability
    of detection. Moreover, the total intrusion data rate of the mMTC information
    of K p paired m/uCUAVs for Ω=1 is given by I D m = I D k−1 m = I D k m = ∑ (k−1,k)∈
    K p I D k−1 m +I D k m Ψ 2 ⎡ ⎣ B o log 2 (1+ γ k−1 mp )− γ k−1 mp1 C b − − − −
    − √ Q −1 (ε) ⎤ ⎦ , Ψ 2 ⎡ ⎣ B o log 2 (1+ γ k mp )− γ k mp1 C b − − − − √ Q −1

    γ k mp1 =1−(1+ γ k mp ) −2 . B. Energy Efficiency The energy efficiency of the
    considered network is a crucial characteristic because it is directly related
    to the network lifetime of the m/uCUAV operation. As mentioned in [1], the theoretical
    expressions of energy efficiency at the ( k−1 , k )-th paired m/uCUAV (∀(k−1,k)∈
    K p ) for the effectual and intrusion cases are given by E E Ek = E E Ik = E D
    k−1 u +E D k u +E D k−1 m +E D k m P k−1 u + P k u + P k−1 m + P k m + P hov +
    P c , I D k−1 u +I D k u +I D k−1 m +I D k m P k−1 u + P k u + P k−1 m + P k m
    + P hov + P c , (23) (24) View Source where P c indicates the power consumption
    for spectrum sensing, information processing, encoding, and decoding. Furthermore,
    P hov indicates the propulsion power consumption during the hovering of m/uCUAV
    and can be expressed as P hov = δ 8 ρs A d A 3 v r 3 +(1+η) W 3 2ρ A d − − − −
    √ , where δ , ρ , s , A d , A v , r , η , and W denote the profile drag coefficient,
    air density (kg/ m 3 ), rotor solidity, rotor disc area ( m 2 ), blade angular
    velocity (rad/s), rotor radius (m), incremental correctional factor of induced
    power, and weight of m/uCUAV (N), respectively. For simplicity, we considered
    the same power P c and P hov for all m/uCUAV devices. C. Propagation Latency Based
    on the discussion in Section II-E, the TTI value is 0.125 ms. Therefore, the propagation
    latency is derived as: t prop ≤ T c , (25) View Source where T c =0.125 ms. On
    the basis of (19) and (21), the propagation latency at the ( k−1 , k )-th paired
    m/uCUAV (∀(k−1,k)∈ K p ) for the effectual and intrusion cases is defined as t
    propEk = t propIk = N b E D uk , N b I D uk , (26) (27) View Source where N b
    denotes the number of bits to be transmitted. SECTION IV. Energy Efficiency Maximization
    To enhance the energy efficiency of our proposed model, we formulated an optimization
    problem and subsequently solved it for the effectual and intrusion cases. A. Effectual
    Case In the effectual case, the optimization problem hereafter referred to as
    problem IV-A, of energy efficiency maximization was formulated by jointly optimizing
    the transmit power in terms of the total power budget and SINR constraints such
    that the propagation latency and data rate requirements were satisfied. The optimization
    problem of the K p paired m/uCUAVs can be expressed mathematically as max P k
    u , P k−1 u , P k m , P k−1 m ∑ (k−1,k)∈ K p E E Ek ( P k u , P k−1 u , P k m
    , P k−1 m ) s.t. P k u + P k−1 u + P k m + P k−1 m ≤ P tk , γ k u ≥ υ k u , γ
    k−1 u ≥ υ k−1 u , γ k m ≥ υ k m , γ k−1 m ≥ υ k−1 m , υ k u ≥ υ k−1 u , υ k−1
    u ≥ υ k m , υ k m ≥ υ k−1 m , (28a) (28b) (28c) (28d) (28e) (28f) (28g) View Source
    where P tk = P k + P k−1 =2 P t represents the entire power budget (Simply assume
    that each m/uCUAV has the same power budget). υ k u and υ k m represent the lower
    limits of the SINR for URLLC and mMTC information, respectively, for the k -th
    pair of m/uCUAVs. υ k−1 u and υ k−1 m represent the lower limits of the SINR for
    URLLC and mMTC information, respectively, for ( k -1)-th pair of m/uCUAVs. Constraint
    (28a) refers to the energy efficiency of paired m/uCUAV for the effectual case
    provided in (23). Constraint (28b) describes the overall power limitation for
    a paired m/uCUAV. Constraints (28c) and (28d) describe the SINR necessities for
    the k -th and ( k -1)-th pairs of m/uCUAVs to achieve the URLLC latency requirements
    provided in (4) and (5). Constraints (28e) and (28f) describe the SINR necessities
    for the k -th and ( k -1)-th pairs of m/uCUAVs to achieve the minimum specified
    data rates provided in (6) and (7). Constraint (28g) is used to ensure that constraints
    (28c) and (28d) are greater than constraints (28e) and (28f). To solve this problem,
    we rearrange constraints (28c), (28d), (28e), and (28f) and rewrite problem (28)
    as max P k u , P k−1 u , P k m , P k−1 m ∑ (k−1,k)∈ K p E E Ek ( P k u , P k−1
    u , P k m , P k−1 m ) s.t. P k u + P k−1 u + P k m + P k−1 m ≤ P tk , P k u ∣

    ( I k−1 u + σ 2 g ), P k m ∣ ∣ g k ug ∣ ∣ 2 ≥ υ k m ( I k m + σ 2 g ), P k−1 m
    ∣ ∣ g k−1 ug ∣ ∣ 2 ≥ υ k−1 m ( I k−1 m + σ 2 g ), υ k u ≥ υ k−1 u , υ k−1 u ≥
    υ k m , υ k m ≥ υ k−1 m . (29a) (29b) (29c) (29d) (29e) (29f) (29g) View Source
    It is observed that the constraints of problem (29) are linear functions. However,
    it is still challenging to solve the problem (29) because its objective function
    is non-convex with respect to P u and P m . Two issues observed in the problem
    were m/uCUAV pairing and transmit power allocation. Consequently, we divided the
    problem into two sub-problems to solve it: ( a ) m/uCUAV pairing, and ( b ) transmission
    power optimization. Fig. 3 provides an overview of the entire procedure for solving
    the optimization problem. We employ Algorithm 1 in the initial step to identify
    the m/uCUAV pairing. The optimal transmit power is then determined in the second
    step by executing the Algorithm 2. Fig. 3. The overall procedure for solving the

    Pairing Scheme: Based on [29], [30], three types of pairing schemes were proposed:
    ( i ) high-high channel gain of two m/uCUAVs; (ii) high-low channel gain of two
    m/uCUAVs; and (iii) uniform channel gain of two m/uCUAVs. In [29], the usefulness
    of sum capacity maximization in a NOMA system was demonstrated using a uniform
    m/uCUAV pairing technique. However, the uniform channel gain of two m/uCUAVs was
    more complex for practical implementation because the high-gain m/uCUAV was paired
    with the mid-gain m/uCUAV. Another issue was that the synchronization occurred
    over a long distance between two m/uCUAVs. For the high-low channel gain, the
    capacity (data rate) gain of the pair decreased. This was due to the fact that
    reducing the power of a high-gain m/uCUAV also reduced its capacity. In contrast,
    when the power of a low-gain m/uCUAV was raised proportionally, its capacity gain
    was smaller than the capacity loss of a high-gain m/uCUAV. Similarly, with uniform
    channel gain, synchronization is a significant issue over long distances between
    two m/uCUAVs. To address the aforementioned drawbacks of high-low and uniform
    channel gains, we used a high-high channel gain of two m/uCUAVs. The whole process
    of the m/uCUAV pairing method is outlined in Algorithm 1. 2) Optimizing Transmit
    Power: Based on the above discussion in problem (29), the following theorem provides
    the optimal solution for the transmit powers. Theorem 1:The optimal transmit powers
    to problem (29) at the ( k−1 , k )-th paired m/uCUAV (∀(k−1,k)∈ K p ) can be expressed
    as P k ∗ u = P k ∗ m = D( C 1 o ) D( C o ) , P (k−1 ) ∗ u = D( C 2 o ) D( C o
    ) , D( C 3 o ) D( C o ) , P (k−1 ) ∗ m = D( C 4 o ) D( C o ) , View Source where
    D(⋅) represents the determinant of the matrix of the system; and C o =[ C o1 ,
    C o2 , C o3 , C o4 ] , C 1 o =[C, C o2 , C o3 , C o4 ] , C 2 o =[ C o1 ,C, C o3
    , C o4 ] , C 3 o =[ C o1 , C o2 ,C, C o4 ] , C 4 o =[ C o1 , C o2 , C o3 ,C] ,
    and C=[ P tk − σ 2 g ,− σ 2 g ,− σ 2 g ,− σ 2 g ] T . The values of the coefficients
    C o1 , C o2 , C o3 , and C o4 are given in the Appendix. In the Appendix, the
    detailed proof is presented. To obtain the optimum transmit powers, we calculate
    the minimum SINR requirements for URLLC and mMTC information using (A.3), (A.4),
    (A.5), and (A.6). We obtain some mathematical expressions in (A.11), (A.12), (A.13),
    and (A.14) by applying the KKT condition to the optimization problem in (29).
    From (A.11)–(A.14), the coefficient matrix ( C o ) , transmit power matrix (V)
    , and constant matrix (C) for Cramer’s rule are found. In the end, we find the
    optimal solutions using Cramer’s rule. From the aforementioned subject, the proposed
    transmit power allocation algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2. B. Intrusion
    Case Following the effectual case, we formulated the optimization problem of the
    K p paired m/uCUAVs, hereafter referred to as problem IV-B, as follows max P k
    u , P k−1 u , P k m , P k−1 m ∑ (k−1,k)∈ K p E E Ik ( P k u , P k−1 u , P k m
    , P k−1 m ) s.t. P k u + P k−1 u + P k m + P k−1 m ≤ P tk , γ k up ≥ υ k u , γ
    k−1 up ≥ υ k−1 u , γ k mp ≥ υ k m , γ k−1 mp ≥ υ k−1 m , υ k u ≥ υ k−1 u , υ k−1
    u ≥ υ k m , υ k m ≥ υ k−1 m . (30a) (30b) (30c) (30d) (30e) (30f) (30g) View Source
    It is observed that the optimization problem (30) is similar to the problem (28).
    Constraint (30a) refers to the energy efficiency of paired m/uCUAV for the intrusion
    case provided in (24). Constraint (30b) describes the overall power limitation
    for a paired m/uCUAV. Constraints (30c) and (30d) describe the SINR necessities
    for the k -th and ( k -1)-th pairs of m/uCUAVs to achieve the URLLC latency requirements
    provided in (8) and (9). Constraints (30e) and (30f) describe the SINR necessities
    for the k -th and ( k -1)-th pairs of m/uCUAVs to achieve the minimum specified
    data rates provided in (10) and (11). Constraint (30g) is used to ensure that
    constraints (30c) and (30d) are greater than constraints (30e) and (30f). In (30c),
    (30d), (30e), and (30f), P p | g pg | 2 is included in the SINR provided in (8),
    (9), (10), and (11), respectively. Because P p | g pg | 2 is constant, the proof
    can be determined by Theorem 1. Therefore, the same optimal transmit powers (
    P k ∗ u , P (k−1 ) ∗ u , P k ∗ m , and P (k−1 ) ∗ m ) are obtained using both
    the effectual and intrusion cases. The method to maximize energy efficiency for
    effectual and intrusion scenarios with propagation latency is outlined in Algorithm

    channel gain, characterized by a small-scale path-loss. In Algorithm 1, the m/uCUAV
    pairing scheme is presented. The optimal transmit power was determined using KKT
    conditions and Cramer’s rule. In Algorithm 2, the transmit power allocation is
    presented. All the above-mentioned procedures were performed using ground gNB.
    Each m/uCUAV was required to send local information (i.e., locations and maximum
    average transmit power) by the CaC link to the gNB. Subsequently, the optimized
    results (i.e., pairing and transmit power) were broadcast to m/uCUAVs. D. Complexity
    of Algorithms The following items were considered for calculating the system complexity:
    ( i ) m/uCUAV pairing scheme, and (ii) optimal solution of transmit power. Hence,
    the complexity of the proposed model lies primarily in Algorithms 1 and 2. The
    complexity of Algorithm 1 involved in solving optimization problem is O(K A c1
    A s1 A p1 ) , where A c1 , A s1 , and A p1 represent the arithmetic operations
    of m/uCUAV channel gain, sorting of all m/uCUAV channel gains, and the pairing
    of m/uCUAVs, respectively. The complexity of Algorithm 2 involved in solving optimization
    problem is O( K p A l2 A k2 A c2 ) , where A l2 , A k2 , and A c2 represent the
    arithmetic operations for determining the SINR lower limits, the KKT condition,
    and Cramer’s rule, respectively. Consequently, the total complexity of Algorithms
    1 and 2 is O(K A c1 A s1 A p1 + K p A l2 A k2 A c2 ) . SECTION V. Performance
    Evaluation In this section, we evaluated the performance of the proposed CUAV-IoT
    network for the mMTC and URLLC services. As shown in Fig. 4, we assumed an enclosed
    area of 300×600×100  m 3 ; herein, PT and gNB were positioned at (10,500,20) and
    (0,0,15), respectively. We consider that ten m/uCUAVs were randomly generated
    from the same area. For the considered network, g ug channel gain was computed
    using (12), (13), (14), (16), and (17); and g pg channel gain was computed using
    (12) and (15). Moreover, the simulation parameters are provided in Table I. In
    the flowing graphs, average effectual energy efficiency and average effectual
    propagation latency are defined as the mean values of energy efficiency and propagation
    latency for the effectual case (PT is inactive). Similarly, the average intrusion
    energy efficiency and average intrusion propagation latency are defined as the
    mean energy efficiency and propagation latency values for the intrusion case (PT
    is active). TABLE I System Parameters Fig. 4. Network architecture of multiple
    m/uCUAV implementations for simulation of the proposed system model. Show All
    A. Proposed Pairing Scheme Fig. 5 shows that the average energy efficiency initially
    increases due to the CUAV altitude ( h ui ) increment of approximately up to 120
    m. However, when the CUAV altitude exceeded 120 m, the energy efficiency decreased
    with increasing altitude. The highs and lows of energy efficiency can be seen
    for m/uCUAV because of the LoS probability and path-loss of the link. For the
    effectual case, the optimal altitude was 120 m, and the maximum energy efficiency
    was 8289.54 bits/J and 12733.1 bits/J for m/uCUAV3 [1] and the proposed m/uCUAV4
    pair, respectively. For the intrusion case, the optimal altitudes were 100 m and
    120 m for m/uCUAV [1] and the proposed m/uCUAV, respectively. In addition, the
    maximum energy efficiency was 471.20 bits/J and 1313.13 bits/J for m/uCUAV [1]
    and the proposed m/uCUAV, respectively. Hence, the proposed scheme improved by
    53.60% for effectual and 178.68% for intrusion cases. Fig. 5. Energy efficiency
    vs. CUAV altitude. Show All Fig. 6 shows the average propagation latency for the
    effectual and intrusion cases. For the effectual case, the propagation latency
    was constant at 0.118 ms for m/uCUAV5 [1] and 0.074 ms for the proposed m/uCUAV.6
    However, in the inference case, the propagation latency decreased for an altitude
    increment of approximately up to 120 m and then increased with increasing altitude.
    From this analysis, it can be inferred that the propagation latency for m/uCUAV
    [1] was 2.03 ms, whereas the propagation latency for the proposed paired m/uCUAV
    was 0.713 ms at an altitude of 100 m. Hence, applying the proposed scheme, we
    observed a 184.71% reduction in the intrusion case. Fig. 6. Propagation latency
    vs. CUAV altitude. Show All Fig. 7 presents that the average energy efficiency
    decreases for both the effectual and intrusion cases as the horizontal distance
    increases ( r 2D ug ) . For the effectual case, the energy efficiency was 8290.43
    bits/J and 12733.2 bits/J for m/uCUAV [1] and the proposed paired m/uCUAV at 200
    m, respectively. Contrastingly, the energy efficiency was 656.33 bits/J and 1384.66
    bits/J for m/uCUAV [1] and the proposed paired m/uCUAV at the same distance in
    the intrusion case, respectively. Fig. 7. Energy efficiency vs. CUAV horizontal
    distance. Show All Fig. 8 illustrates the average propagation latencies for the
    effectual and intrusion cases. The curve’s tendency in Fig. 8 is similar to that
    of Fig. 6. In the intrusion case, the propagation latency increased with increasing
    distance. We analyzed the propagation latency at 200 m and found that the propagation
    latency was 1.47 ms and 0.678 ms for m/uCUAV [1] and the proposed paired m/uCUAV,
    respectively. Hence, the propagation latency decreased by 116.81% for the intrusion
    case when the proposed scheme was applied. Fig. 8. Propagation latency vs. CUAV
    horizontal distance. Show All Fig. 9 shows the average intrusion propagation latency
    owing to various transmitted bits. From the observations in Figs. 6 and 8, it
    can be inferred that the propagation latency was higher than 0.125 ms for the
    intrusion case. Because of the intrusion case, it was possible to reduce the propagation
    latency to less than 0.125 ms by increasing the entire power budget and decreasing
    the number of transmitted bits. As shown in Fig. 9, the propagation latency increased
    for both schemes with the number of bits transmitted. The propagation latency
    was much lower than 0.125 ms owing to the low number of bits transmitted. Fig.
    9. Propagation latency vs. the number of bits transmitted. Show All B. Compared
    to the OMA Scheme We compare our proposed NOMA pairing scheme to the OMA scheme
    to demonstrate its usefulness. This scheme was identical to the proposed design
    except that it employed the OMA scheme during transmission rather than the NOMA
    scheme. The bandwidth was equally partitioned and allocated to each m/uCUAV device
    under the OMA system. Moreover, each device was assigned an orthogonal bandwidth
    allotment, ensuring that m/uCUAV devices did not interfere with one another. Fig.
    10 shows the average energy efficiency of the OMA and NOMA schemes as a function
    of altitude. As shown, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of all systems
    improved with altitude and eventually decreased with altitude. Observations revealed
    that the proposed NOMA pairing scheme consistently achieved superior performance
    compared to the OMA scheme. Regarding effectual energy efficiency, the proposed
    scheme improved performance by about 81.33% compared to the OMA scenario at 100
    m. Regarding intrusion energy efficiency, the proposed scheme improved performance
    by around 399% compared to the OMA scenario at 100 m. Fig. 10. Energy efficiency
    vs. CUAV altitude in comparison to OMA and NOMA schemes. Show All Fig. 11 shows
    the average propagation latency of the OMA and NOMA schemes as a function of altitude.
    Observations revealed that the proposed NOMA pairing scheme regularly outperformed
    the OMA scheme. Regarding effectual propagation latency, the proposed scheme reduced
    performance by about 595.89% compared to the OMA scenario at 100 m. Regarding
    intrusion propagation latency, the proposed scheme reduced performance by around
    613.18% compared to the OMA scenario at 100 m. Fig. 11. Propagation latency vs.
    CUAV altitude in comparison to OMA and NOMA schemes. Show All C. Compared to Benchmark
    Schemes The proposed pairing method is evaluated against two reference schemes:
    ( i ) the equal power and (ii) channel inversion approaches to determine its efficacy.
    The two reference frameworks are compared below. Equal power: Given that the m/uCUAV
    does not know the channel gains, assigning equal power to mMTC and URLLC information
    is appropriate. Channel inversion: Channel inversion is a kind of power regulation
    in which the transmitted power is inversely proportional to the channel quality.
    Therefore, the received signal power at the receiver is constant. Fig. 12 shows
    the performance of proposed pairing schemes compared to two reference schemes
    as the number of SIC coefficients varies. As depicted in Fig. 12, the proposed
    pairing scheme considerably outperformed the equal power and channel inversion
    methods as the number of SIC coefficients increased. It can be seen that when
    the SIC coefficient increased, the average energy efficiency performance decreased.
    This was because interference terms associated with SIC operation led to a decline
    in system energy efficiency performance. In general, the SINR decreased as the
    SIC coefficient rose. The proposed pairing scheme improved performance in terms
    of effectual energy efficiency by 26.73% and 25.85%, respectively, at 0.5 SIC
    coefficient for equal power and channel inversion. The proposed pairing scheme
    improved intrusion energy efficiency by about 27.48% and 26.59%, respectively,
    for equal power and channel inversion at a SIC value of 0.5. Fig. 12. Energy efficiency
    vs. SIC coefficient. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion We developed a mathematical
    model to analyze and compare the pairing schemes of multiple CUAV-assisted mMTC
    and URLLC services. The NOMA approach was employed to avoid collisions between
    mMTC and URLLC information. We derived mathematical expressions for the data rate,
    energy efficiency, and latency for such a network using the FBLT scheme. In addition,
    we formulated an optimization problem to achieve the maximum energy efficiency
    for paired m/uCUAV devices by considering the presence and absence of intrusion.
    The simulation results revealed that the CUAV pairing scheme is essential for
    minimizing latency while optimizing energy efficiency. Our simulation results
    demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared to the existing
    method. Also, the proposed method outperformed the traditional OMA method. Moreover,
    according to simulation study, the proposed scheme outperformed three benchmark
    schemes in terms of SIC coefficient. To further improve the applicability of the
    presented methods and analyzes, future work would explore a more general scenario,
    such as a network including uplink and downlink scenarios. In addition, it would
    be interesting to examine interference mitigation and CUAV trajectory design in
    this scenario. Moreover, the physical layer security of the proposed method will
    be analyzed. Appendix Proof of Effectual Case According to (28a), the Hessian
    matrix of the objective function is negative. Hence, the optimization problem
    is non-convex. Therefore, we determined the minimum SINR requirements of E D k−1
    u and E D k u using (19b) and (19c). From (26), we obtain E D k−1 u = E D k u

  description: The secondary users can opportunistically utilize the spectrum holes
    left by the licensed users (also called primary users [PUs]) with the help of
    cognitive radio (CR) technology. The cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is crucial
    for the implementation of CR algorithms in the next-generation wireless networks,
    for the specific identification of spectral gaps of PUs under any fading/shadowing
    channel. Accurate spectrum sensing reveals that the CUs only provide data when
    the PUs report being idle. Yet, there is always a possibility that CU transmission
    will cause interference with PU communications, leading to inefficient spectrum
    use. So, this work explores the performance of a proposed CSS by considering such
    factors with the key objective of enhancing spectrum utilisation efficiency. This
    paper evaluates the role of the proposed CSS with a variety of hard decision fusion
    rules (HDFR) schemes as well as soft data fusion schemes (SDFS) methods. Toward
    this end, for the proposed system, closed-form expressions for the evaluation
    of various performance metrics such as the false alarm, miss-detection probabilities,
    total error probability (TEP), and throughput/energy efficiency are derived by
    taking into consideration the Nakagami-m fading environment using different hard
    and soft algorithms and are validated by means of numerical simulations. Furthermore,
    by taking into account various network specifications, such as channel error probability
    (q), fading severity parameter (m), number of samples (M), number of CR nodes
    (N), average sensing (S) channel signal-to-noise ratio, and sensing threshold
    (λ), a performance evaluation between the SDFS and HDFR schemes has been carried
    out. Furthermore, using HDFR/SDFS schemes, analytical models are formulated for
    determining an optimal number of CR nodes ((Figure presented.)) and optimal threshold
    ((Figure presented.)) values for achieving the lowest TEP and highest energy efficiency.

    SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The secondary users can opportunistically utilize
    the spectrum holes left by the licensed users (also called primary users [PUs])
    with the help of cognitive radio (CR) technology. The cooperative spectrum sensing
    (CSS) is crucial for the implementation of CR algorithms in the next-generation
    wireless networks, for the specific identification of spectral gaps of PUs under
    any fading/shadowing channel. Accurate spectrum sensing reveals that the CUs only
    provide data when the PUs report being idle. Yet, there is always a possibility
    that CU transmission will cause interference with PU communications, leading to
    inefficient spectrum use. So, this work explores the performance of a proposed
    CSS by considering such factors with the key objective of enhancing spectrum utilisation
    efficiency. This paper evaluates the role of the proposed CSS with a variety of
    hard decision fusion rules (HDFR) schemes as well as soft data fusion schemes
    (SDFS) methods. Toward this end, for the proposed system, closed-form expressions
    for the evaluation of various performance metrics such as the false alarm, miss-detection
    probabilities, total error probability (TEP), and throughput/energy efficiency
    are derived by taking into consideration the Nakagami-m fading environment using
    different hard and soft algorithms and are validated by means of numerical simulations.
    Furthermore, by taking into account various network specifications, such as channel
    error probability (q), fading severity parameter (m), number of samples (M), number
    of CR nodes (N), average sensing (S) channel signal-to-noise ratio, and sensing
    threshold (λ), a performance evaluation between the SDFS and HDFR schemes has
    been carried out. Furthermore, using HDFR/SDFS schemes, analytical models are
    formulated for determining an optimal number of CR nodes ( ) and optimal threshold
    ( ) values for achieving the lowest TEP and highest energy efficiency. 1 INTRODUCTION
    Cognitive radio (CR) technology extensively optimizes licensed user''s spectrum
    to address spectrum limitations in next-generation cellular networks. As compared
    to individual performances, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) aided cognitive
    radio network (CRN) has a promising performance. Predominantly, spectrum sensing
    can be interpreted as one of the fundamental approach that allows several CRs
    to detect white spaces in wireless spectrum and opportunistically access licensed
    (primary) user''s spectrum holes avoid producing any interference that may be
    detrimental to primary users (PUs) [1, 2]. In [3], a white space cognitive radio
    protocol, IEEE 802.11af, also known as White-Fi and Super Wi-Fi, permits wireless
    local area network (WLAN) operation in TV white space spectrum in the VHF and
    UHF bands between 54 and 790 MHz. IEEE 802.22 is a wireless regional area network
    (WRAN) standard utilising TV white spaces in [4]. From a list of earlier renowned
    works, it can be evidenced that several sensing mechanisms have been developed
    for recognizing whether the licensed users are either in the active state or inactive
    state. The work in [5] portrays that since the knowledge about a PU is unknown,
    the energy detection (ED) strategy can be termed to be the easiest detecting approach.
    Even though non-cooperative spectrum sensing (NCSS) approach can be employed for
    the selection of PU; however, this approach cannot guarantee the identification
    of the primary user under extreme noise and fading [5]–[8]. Based upon these grounds,
    CSS is very much essential for accurately assessing the PU''s state. The underlying
    methodology involved in CSS method is that each CR node individually detects the
    same PU; however, it is a well-known fact that because not all the cognitive users
    will face significant noise or fading hence, subsequently, all the cognitive users
    exchange their respective sensing data and work together to make decisions about
    the PU''s status [9]. In this regard, there exists a diverse variety of techniques
    that combines distinct signals, and all these techniques may be applied at fusion
    center (FC), which is a common control center for all CR users. The FC uses hard
    decision fusion rules (HDFR) and soft-data fusion schemes (SDFS) mechanisms to
    combine sensing data received from individual CR nodes and takes a global decision
    on the status of PU [10, 11]. From the literature, it can be conceived that one
    of the cost-effective and computationally efficient technique which has been proposed
    in [12] not only minimizes the average error rate (AER) but also enables efficient
    and reliable communications. In [13], a relay nodes use amplify-and-forward (AF)
    or decode-and-forward (DF) protocol to amplify or decode the PU signal and forward
    it to the centre node (CN), where ED method is used for spectrum sensing. Simulated
    results apply to best relay selection using AF and DF protocols. Reference[14]
    examines the throughput performance of decision-aided CSS systems for diverse
    networks and k - μ fading characteristics. In [15], the analytical performance
    of CSS is evaluated under composite Lognormal-Hoyt fading channel via m out-of-N
    fusion rule over unshadowed and shadowed scenarios. The performance is evaluated
    using probability of detection with a truncation error upper bound. 1.1 Background
    works In [16], different HDFR strategies with various channel errors assess the
    suggested wide-band spectrum sensing (WSS). The analytical frameworks for evaluating
    miss-detection and total error probability (TEP) which in turn estimates an optimal
    N for the lowest TEP only but they have not done throughput and energy efficiency
    under soft/hard fusion schemes. In [17], an ED-based CSS system (CSSS) optimization
    has been examined under noise and generalised k-μ and η-μ fading channel. An optimal
    threshold is determined to minimise TER for all channel characteristics, but only
    HDFR schemes have implemented in this paper. The authors in [18] suggest a weighted
    strategy fusion decision approach whereby FC partitions spectrum sensing into
    time intervals to enhance cooperative decision accuracy. HDFR voting rule fusion
    decision strategies identified a superior midway between strong AND and conventional
    OR than the standard maximum voting rule. The authors were not discussed about
    soft-data fusion schemes (SDFS) in this paper. In [19], the authors evaluated
    energy-efficient CSN performance in noise and Nakagami-q/n fading channels. For
    all possible values of M and r, the ideal p and N achieve the maximum throughput
    and energy efficiency. Meanwhile, the authors have not discussed about any one
    of the SDFS. Throughput performance with SC diversity in a CSS system using an
    IED-based CRN is investigated in [20]. This is done in a noisy and fading channels
    (i.e. Rayleigh/Rician). The effect of network error on throughput and TER performance
    is examined across the suggested and the existing systems. In [21], the authors
    have examined and analysed the miss-detection and TER performance of an ED based
    spectrum sensing (on fusion scheme is implemented) in the presence of noisy and
    α - μ fading channels. Under various fading conditions, the optimal number of
    CR users, normalised threshold, and received signal power are limited. The performance
    is evaluated using CROC and TER curves in [22]. From a list of earlier renowned
    works [23, 24], it can be reported that authors worked to improve the performance
    of CSS. Particularly, the performance of HDFR schemes such as OR, AND, and MAJORITY
    rules and of SDFS schemes such as, square-law combining (SLC), square-law selection
    (SLS), selection combining (SC), and maximal ratio combining (MRC) are investigated
    in presence of individual fading environments. It can be elucidated from the works
    as stated in [25-27], that the authors have analyzed the performance of many soft-data
    techniques (such as equal gain combining (EGC) and MRC) for CRN over block-fading
    and fast fading models. The accuracy of several censoring algorithms for HDFR-aided
    CSS is studied through distinct fading conditions in [28, 29]. The performance
    of CSS employing ED under several diversity receiving algorithms, including MRC,
    SC, SLC, and SLS, has been investigated by the authors in [30]. In [31], over
    the Nakagami-m wireless channel, a distinct expression for the appropriate detection
    probability was established, and detector performances were investigated using
    a SC diversity based ED. The closed-form detection probability expressions are
    obtained under the SLC diversity only when the Nakagami-m is integral in [32].
    The work in [33] demonstrates that the SDFS methods for CSS seem to be more effective
    than HDFR methods. In [34-37], soft-data schemes illustrate how to merge the sensed
    information of a single CR sequentially at FC to make a global decision regarding
    the status of a PU. In [35], the researchers explained how various SDFS schemes
    such as SLS, SLC, SC, and MRC are used at FC to get the final decision on the
    status at PU. In [35-39], the implementation of various soft schemes is explored
    for CSS over AWGN, Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami-m fading channels; however,
    analytical equations of the detection performance are not accessible in most situations.
    In [40], a new methodology is developed for illustrating the trade-off between
    hard and soft methods for achieving an optimal system performance. The research
    work as portrayed in [41] investigates the CRN performance via throughput, energy
    consumption, and energy efficiency by employing both hard and soft techniques.
    In [42], the neural network (NN)-based clustering scheme in CRN is investigated.
    Simulation results illustrate that the suggested NN-clustering method improves
    accuracy and reduces false alarms by 10%. In [43], the authors describe the suggested
    CSS system under SC diversity to find the highest PU value and evaluated CROC
    curves, average channel throughput, and energy efficiency under different fusion
    algorithms. However, the authors have not discussed about the SDFS schemes. The
    authors in [44] derived the formula for the optimal value of CUs (k and Mr) in
    the k-out-of-Mr rule for CSS at all SNR using various threshold selection procedures
    to minimise the Bayes risk at FC and this reduced Bayes risk associated with spectrum
    sensing error. Since poor channel conditions affect the energy efficiency performance
    of CSS, hence, it is vital to employ diversity techniques for enhancing its performance.
    Toward this end, the authors in [45] studied the energy efficiency performance
    of improved energy detector based CRN over noisy-Nakagami-q faded channel under
    SC diversity. In [46], they have investigated a combination of both hard and soft
    fusion schemes that enable a joint compromise across both hard and soft techniques
    by incorporating their individual benefits. Furthermore, from this work, it can
    be affirmed that the authors showed the impact of the number of CR nodes on miss
    detection and total error probability (TEP). In [47], by considering different
    channel and network characteristics, the miss detection probability and TEP are
    evaluated for the proposed CSS using both HDFR and SDFS schemes over AWGN/generalized
    k - μ fading models. The analysis presented in [48] is restricted to AWGN and
    lognormal shadow fading channels only; it can be generalized over several fading
    channels (for instance, Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami- /q etc). In [49], an optimisation
    issue has been identified with the objective of optimising the sensing time to
    maximise the spectrum utilisation efficiency (SUE) while adhering to the constraints
    of a high probability of target detection and a low probability of interference
    with PU. The paper [50] examines a trade-off between the probability of spectrum
    hole utilisation (PSHU) and the number of secondary users (SUs) and the reporting
    bits. The study states the ideal number of SUs and the optimal number of reporting
    bits to achieve the highest PSHU. 1.2 Motivations toward our work Here, implementation
    of several soft and hard fusion strategies has been analyzed for a variety of
    network parameters using complementary receiver operating characteristics (CROC).
    By making use of energy detection with various diversity reception strategies,
    we provide the mathematical framework for the detection and false alarm probabilities
    across independent and identically distributed (i.i.ds) Nakagami-m fading channels.
    The complexity of such analytical expressions is then shown to be better than
    that of others available in the literature. Furthermore, the derived novel closed-form
    analytical expressions are validated by means of simulation results. In addition,
    with the aid of simulation results, the performance of several diversity receiving
    systems are compared in order to discover the best cooperative technique across
    possible limitations. It is to be noted that by taking into consideration the
    different network characteristics such as the CR nodes (N), channel error (q),
    and average S-channel SNR ( ), the performance of other soft-data techniques are
    compared with the hard-decision schemes. 1.3 Major contributions We have formulated
    a novel analytical framework for deriving the average probability of detection
    ( ) for different soft and hard schemes over Nakagami-m fading channel. The effects
    of q, m, N, M, λ and on miss-detection, TEP, and throughput/energy efficiency
    are also examined. Also and for which TEP is minimum (or energy efficiency is
    maximum) are determined. In order to determine the SUE, we present the spectrum
    utilisation probability (SUP) and the probability of interference ( ) to PU. 1.4
    Formation of the paper This work is structured into the next four sections: The
    proposed system model over non-faded/faded environments is discussed and the numerical
    framework is provided for NCSS in Section 6. In Section 12, the analytical frameworks
    for CSS are provided on the basis of soft and hard schemes. Section 26 comprises
    the explanations of numerical and simulation results. Finally, we conclude our
    proposed work in Section 27. 2 PRIMARY SIGNAL MODEL In general, conventional CSS
    architecture comprises of N cooperative CRs, a single PU, and a single FC, where
    each one is equipped with a single antenna other than FC, respectively. An energy
    detector (ED) and a single antenna are equipped to all the CR nodes for spectrum
    sensing. The channels connecting each CR and PU are known as sensing (S)-channels,
    while the channels connecting individual CRs and FC are known as reporting (R)-channels,
    respectively. In the beginning, every individual CR node detects the PU and receives
    sensing information through an imperfect (noisy-fading) S-channel. Then, using
    perfect (ideal) R-channels, each CR node submits its sensed data to the FC. After
    receiving the sensing information, the FC executes hard/soft fusion activities
    and determines the status of PU, whether it is active or inactive. In general,
    the Rayleigh, Rice, Nakagami-m, Hoyt, Weibull, and Log-normal shadowing models
    are some of the statistical probability distributions used to characterize fading
    in S-channels. In this proposed work, we have considered the AWGN and Nakagami-m
    fading model in the imperfect S-channels, while the perfect R-channels are presumed
    to be noiseless. Various parameters and their notations which are used throughout
    this manuscript are depicted in Table 1. TABLE 1. The various symbol notations

    be expressed as, (1) where in , ( ) are sample observations of unknown PU signal
    having mean zero and variance; that is, , denotes the noise samples with zero
    mean and variance, that is, , h denotes the complex fading channel gain, and and
    , denotes the absence and presence status of a PU, respectively. The PU''s signal
    is considered to be independent of both and h. At the sensing phase of the CSS
    frame cycle, as depicted in Figures 1 and 2, all SUs perform local spectrum sensing
    (SS) simultaneously and concurrently submit discovered information to FC. If we
    assume that each frame of time is observed for a total of milliseconds, then we
    may divide this total into sensing and transmission periods of and . Each SU can
    determine the PU''s spectrum in milliseconds; thus lowers with increasing , plus
    equals . The two states of PU were denoted by the symbols and , respectively.
    The PU''s random activity is evaluated as follows, where passive and active behaviours
    in the spectrum are determined with the help of the SS: FIGURE 1 Open in figure

    (primary user) PU detection in a multiple cognitive radio (CR) network. FIGURE

    secondary user (SU) for cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS): = and = - . 2.2 Energy
    detection at CR level The energy detection (ED) is the simple non-coherent detection
    method (shown in Figure 3); it does not need any prior information of the transmitted
    PU signal. Assuming that all cognitive users k depends on the energy of the received
    signal during local detection, the energy of the received signal ( ) for ED can
    be given as [53]; (2) where, denotes the number of sample observations; and denotes
    the sensing time and carrier frequency, respectively. Using the central limit
    theorem, we can determine and characterise the probability density function (PDF)
    of under both and as a Gaussian distribution and its variance and mean for a high
    value of M can be derived as [53]; (3) (4) FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    The energy detector (ED) for cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS). 2.3 The activity
    of PU The PU''s activity is treated as random and unknown to the CR. Even during
    CR transmission, the PU may reappear on the specified channels. It is quite possible
    that it may vanish from its own occupied spectrum too. Meanwhile, this random
    activity of PU (either inactive i.e. or active i.e., ) is postured using a two-state
    Markov chain process as shown in [54]. The active and inactive intervals of PU
    are exponentially distributed, where α1 and α0 are the mean of active and inactive
    intervals of PU under and hypothesis, respectively. and The probability distribution
    of active ( ) and inactive ( ) intervals can be expressed as, and Therefore, based
    on the two scenarios discussed above, the following four scenarios could occur
    as [49] when SU begins transmitting data in the spectrum as depicted in Figure
    4. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A two-state Markov chain process.
    Case I: SU conducts spectrum sensing in state of PU, and miss identifies the occurrence
    of the PU with a probability of . As a result, SU will commence its broadcasts
    at some point during the time period denoted by the symbol . This is depicted
    in Figure 4. This will ensure that PU will not be disrupted by SU transmissions
    because it is assumed that SU transmissions will take place when PU is not being
    used at the same time. Case II: When the SU is in its idle state (i.e. state),
    it can confidently establish that the PU is not available with probability , and
    hence begin transmitting during the time slot. Since SU is operating under the
    assumption that PU is not using the spectrum, it is sometimes referred to as interference-free
    transmissions, similar to case I. Case III: By using probability , SU is able
    to figure out that PU is not in its state, but SU''s communication seems to happen
    whereas PU is in its state. So, data transmission from the SU is seen as interference
    to the PU. Case IV: When the PU is in the state, the SU will discover the spectrum,
    but it will fail to identify the PU''s presence with such a probability of . Once
    the PU has entered the state, communications are started. For this reason, we
    assume that the communication of SU, similar in case III, will cause interference
    to the operation of PU. From Table 2, we show the probability of PU occurrence
    in the four scenarios already discussed. If we assume that PU will not experience
    any interference during the period, then we are able to write down the probability
    of no interference, denoted by , as follows: (5) Under cases III and IV, SU''s
    transmissions could interfere with PU, hence its is, (6) TABLE 2. Secondary user''s
    (SU''s) possible transmission cases under primary user''s (PU''s) transition states.
    PU Transition state (s) Transmission cases of SU I - II - III - IV - 2.4 The AWGN
    channel The equations for the false alarm, detection, and miss-detection probabilities
    for the kth CR node are calculated as follows, assuming that the S-channels are
    incorrect and AWGN affected and they can be derived as [52, 53]: (7) (8) (9) where
    λ, , and are the sensing threshold, the tail distribution of the standard normal
    distribution, and the instantaneous S-channel SNR, accordingly. The average SNRs
    (i.e. ) and the probabilities of false alarm ( ) are considered to be identical
    for all CRs. 2.5 The Nakagami-m fading channel As Nakagami-m distribution is considered
    in the S-channels, where changes, and the expression (8) will be a function of
    then, the average probability of detection ( ) at the kth CR user can be estimated
    as, (10) The PDF of over Nakagami-m fading distribution is expressed as [55]:
    (11) where is the PDF of at CR node for all CR users, as seen from (7) where is
    independent of under case. As a result, the average probability of false alarm
    ( ) is the same as (7) derived for AWGN channel. The fading severity parameter
    m ranges from and equation (11) changes to the Rayleigh PDF when (as a special
    case). The final expression of is given as follows and the mathematical proof
    is provided in Appendix A. (12) where, and, It is considered that every CR exhibit
    the similar kind of behaviours as, (13) (14) (15) where denotes miss-detection
    probability of a CR and represents the kth CR hard(binary)-decision. For a non-cooperative
    CR user by considering error (q) in S-channels, the modified expressions of and
    can be stated as [57], (16) (17) where and are taken from (7) and (9), respectively.
    Inaccurate sensing channels lower the CR users performing specification reliability.
    The non-cooperative TEP for a CR user is (18) where its prior probability of the
    PU being busy and idle are denoted by the values and , respectively. Then, . The
    TEP is calculated for different values of and in this work. 3 COOPERATIVE SPECTRUM
    SENSING The performance of each CR is improved by enabling numerous CRs to participate
    in the decision-making process using cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS). Every
    CR node in CSS detects the PU in a noisy-faded scenario and transmits its observations
    to FC via R-channels. The FC executes accurate merging activities and makes a
    final judgement concerning the PU''s existence, and notifies the CRs. There seems
    to be two major types of fusion techniques which may be performed at FC, such
    as soft and hard signal combining techniques. Pertaining to the scenario of HDFR
    fusion techniques, the FC simply merges the binary decisions, whereas corresponding
    to the SDFS scenario, the FC merges the energies by considering them as soft information
    [51]. To minimize the impact of fading, conventional diversity combining techniques
    can be deployed, that is, SDFS schemes [23, 24]. 3.1 Hard-decision fusion rules
    at FC The reliability of a NCSS may be compromised due to the presence of noise
    exposure and channel error in the incorrect S-channels, which may cause the system''s
    overall efficiency to deteriorate. To avoid this, numerous cognitive radios (N)
    and collaboration between all the individuals are recommended. As a consequence
    of this, each CR node shares the information that it has discovered and then transmits
    it to the FC. In order to improve the detection capabilities of CRs as a whole,
    so as to facilitate it to make a valid decision, FC uses a fusion rule, that is,
    the k-out-of-N rule. The CSS based on decision fusion can be summarized as follows:
    For kth CR node, for , ..., N performs spectrum sensing individually, that is,
    the energy detection with a result of , but it is assumed that each CR node has
    an identical threshold. As per , the CR users will submit their local decision
    . The knowledge that the FC collects from the kth CR will be denoted by the ,
    as denotes that the CR presumes that the PU is absent, and denotes that the CR
    presumes that the PU is present. The FC takes a global decision based on decision
    fusion (DF), which would be described as follows: (19) where, corresponds to OR-rule,
    corresponds to AND-rule, and or corresponds to half voting (HV) or MAJORITY-rules.
    In particular, the hard-decision rules which are being utilized for defining the
    expressions for cooperative false alarm, detection and miss-detection probabilities
    with errors are expressed as [56]: 3.1.1 For or (1-out-of-N)-rule (20) (21) (22)
    3.1.2 For and (N-out-of-N)-rule (23) (24) (25) 3.1.3 For MAJORITY ( -out-of-N)-rule
    (26) (27) (28) 3.1.4 For generalized k-out-of-N-rule The expressions for total
    false alarm, detection, and miss-detection probabilities with an error can be
    defined using the generalised k-out-of-N rule [57]: (29) (30) (31) Moreover, based
    on k values, the aforementioned generalized fusion rule yields different alternative
    fusion methods. For instance, the OR rule, that is, 1-out-of-N rule, the AND rule,
    that is, N-out-of-N rule, and the MAJORITY rule, that is, -out-of-N rules are
    derived for k = 1, k = N, and k = , accordingly. Then, the cooperative TEP with
    channel error (q) under HDFR fusion is given by, (32) The logical expressions
    without channel errors for , and under the OR/ AND/ MAJORITY rules over the AWGN
    channel are presented in Table 3. The approximated PDF of over the Nakagami-m
    fading channel is quietly different for various soft-data combining schemes, and
    the cooperative detection probabilities are calculated as follows: TABLE 3. and
    expressions for different hard-decision fusion rules (HDFR) schemes over AWGN
    channel. HDFR and OR Rule and AND Rule and MAJORITY Rule 3.2 Soft-data fusion
    schemes at FC In soft-data schemes, all the CR nodes send their sensed data in
    the form of to the FC without declaring any local decisions, and the decision
    would be made at the FC by merging the above results utilising suitable combining
    operations like SLS, SLC, SC, and MRC. The soft combining fusion outperforms the
    hard combining fusion, but it necessitates a greater R-channel bandwidth. In comparison
    to hard-decision techniques, it also creates higher overhead. As FC executes several
    soft fusion operations which are namely SLS, SLC, SC, and MRC is discussed and
    examined in this part. Figure 5, is a generalized form for implementing different
    diversity techniques. All CR nodes share their weighed sensed information (weighted
    energy) to the FC via perfect R-channels as part of the MRC fusion process. Then,
    FC [41] accumulates individual weighted energies, analyzes the aggregate total
    energy using an ED, and chooses between the two hypotheses. The SC method is also
    implemented using the same figure, in which FC chooses the R-channel well with
    the highest energy, and then ED at FC decides on PU which is based on such single
    energy sample. Finally, the other two fusion techniques, such as SLC and SLS,
    are similarly accomplished. FC receives the energy vectors from N collaborative
    CR nodes and fuses together in the SLC fusion algorithm [51], that is, . FIGURE

    spectrum sensing (CSS) with hard and soft-data combining schemes. In SLS fusion,
    the branch with the largest energy is picked by FC, that is, . Both and are tested
    to a pre-defined threshold in the final testing well with energy statistics, and
    thus, the FC chooses PU appropriately. However, among all other fusion schemes,
    MRC outperforms by integrating all R-channels optimally. Moreover, all RF chains
    must be activated at all times; this increases cost of the system, functionality,
    and power usage at FC. 3.3 Derivation of over Nakagami-m fading channel The expressions
    of and under soft-data techniques over AWGN environment are provided in Tables
    4 and 5, respectively. The (average ) is obtained by averaging over fading channels,
    and hence, for all the above-mentioned soft-data algorithms for a Nakagami-m fading
    channel may be analyzed as follows: TABLE 4. expressions for different SDFS schemes

    (SC) As a diversity combining method, SC method is one of the simplest. For this
    reason, the combiner selects the branches with the best signal-to-noise ratio
    (SNR) and only uses that one: (33) Under SC diversity, the false alarm and detection
    probabilities across the AWGN channel can be expressed using Tables 4 and 5, respectively.
    (34) (35) Due to multipath propagation, signal may experience fading over N independent
    fading channels, for all CR users, as seen from (34) where is independent of γ.
    As a result, the average probability of a false alarm ( ) remains the same as
    (34). Averaging in (35) across the combined SNR distributions yields the average
    probability of detection as, (36) where, is the SNR PDF under Nakagami-m fading
    environment as [58], (37) The end expression for is given by: (38) where I1 in
    (38) is given by, (39) 3.3.2 Square law combining One of the very simplest linear
    soft combining techniques is SLC. In this technique, every user''s estimated energy
    is transmitted to the FC, where it would be combined altogether. Subsequently,
    to examine if the PU exists or not, this aggregate is tested to a threshold, and
    a decision value is calculated as follows: (40) where represents the energy of
    the kth CR node. The false alarm and detection probabilities under the SLC method
    over AWGN channel are as follows: (41) (42) where , and is the received SNR at
    kth CR user. For all CR users, as seen from (41) is independent of γ. As a result,
    the average probability of a false alarm ( ) remains the same as (41). Averaging
    in (42) across the combined SNR distributions yields the average probability of
    detection as, (43) Assuming that, N fading channels are independent and identically
    distributed (i.i.ds); the PDF of output SNR under SLC, that is, depends on type
    of fading. The PDF for Nakagami-m fading channel is as [58], (44) The end expression
    for is given by: (45) 3.3.3 Square law selection In SLS fusion, the branch with
    the largest energy is selected by FC, that is, . The probabilities of false alarm
    and detection for the SLS technique for AWGN channel are given by, (46) (47) Assuming
    that, N fading channels are independent and identically distributed (i.i.ds) for
    all CR users as seen from (46), where is independent of γ. As a result, the average
    probability of a false alarm ( ) remains same as (46). Averaging in (47) across
    the combined SNR distributions yields the average probability of detection as,
    (48) where ; is the PDF of SNR under SLS fusion over Nakagami-m fading given by
    [58], (49) The end expression for is given by: (50) 3.3.4 Maximal ratio combining
    This technique differs from the SLC in that the energy delivered at FC from each
    CR node is evaluated with such a normalized weight before being combined. The
    weight is determined by the received SNR of each CR node. The energy of the MRC
    fusion is, (51) (52) where represents the weighted energy statistic of the MRC
    fusion. The false alarm and detection probabilities under the MRC method over
    AWGN channel are, (53) (54) (55) Averaging in (54) across the combined SNR distributions
    yields the average probability of detection as, (56) where is the PDF of SNR under
    MRC fusion over Nakagami-m fading given by [58], (57) The end expression for is
    given by: (58) The solution to the first integral part in (38), (45), (50), and

    TEP under SDFS fusion is given by, (67) 3.4 Throughput and energy efficiency In
    CSS, all the CR users access the channel of PU only when it is not in usage. The
    throughput calculation, as stated by [60], is described in this part. Let us consider
    and as the PU network throughput while CRN is idle and busy, respectively. Similarly,
    while the PU is idle and busy, the CRN system throughputs are and , accordingly.
    As per the generalized k-out-of-N rule, let denote the average overall system
    throughput as, (68) where (69) (70) (71) The following is an evaluation of energy
    efficiency indicated by the symbol η. Consider that every CR user uses E1 of energy
    to conduct sensing operations and E2 of energy to transmit sensed information
    to the FC. Also assume that the PU uses of energy to send its own data, and that
    the CR uses of energy to send its own data. The overall energy consumption is
    indicated as , given by, (72) where, (73) (74) (75) (76) and η could be calculated
    using the ratio of from (68) to the from (72) as [61]; (77) 3.5 Spectrum utilization
    efficiency Total spectrum utilisation (i.e. ) divided by the probability of interference
    ( ) is the definition of SUE as [49], (78) where of a SU node is calculated using
    (6), and of the SU node can be formulated as follows [49]: where the probability
    of no interference (i.e. ) of a SU node is calculated using (5). 4 NUMERICAL AND
    SIMULATION RESULTS The various numerical and simulation results and their discussions
    have been presented here. The performance of the system in terms of cooperative
    probability of false alarm, detection, miss-detection, TEP, and throughput/energy
    efficiency is simulated subject to soft-data and hard-decision combining schemes
    under and over different channel constraints, namely, q, M, m, N, and . The specifications
    of each parameter which were used for the evaluation of throughput/energy efficiency
    metrics are shown in Table 6. TABLE 6. Depiction of the specifications of each
    parameter employed for simulation framework. Parameter Value 100 ms 1 MHz 11 4
    19 11 41 11 E1 0.11 E2 0.06 Figures 6 and 7 show the variation of non-cooperative
    probability of detection (i.e. ) in terms of M and q over AWGN and Nakagami-m
    fading channels, respectively. Both results demonstrate that when M increases,
    the value of also increases exponentially for fixed values of , and . For better
    comparisons, the variation of curves for q = 0 is also plotted in both the figures.
    Both the figures emphasize that upon increasing the error values, a notable reduction
    in is obtained. The analytical results as delineated in the mathematical Equations
    (7) and (8) are in good agreement with simulated results over the AWGN/Nakagami-m
    fading channels for various readings of q. In addition, from the simulation result
    as portrayed by Figure 7, it can be interpreted that upon reducing the value of
    m, there is a significant increase in the achievable probability of detection
    . Furthermore, the plot even verifies the well-known fact that Nakagami-m fading
    reforms to Rayleigh fading as m tends to unity (i.e. at m = 1). Finally, from
    both Figures 6 and 7, it can be deduced that when compared to the AWGN scenario,
    the performance is degraded upon considering the fading channel such as the Nakagami-m
    fading channel. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Illustration of the
    performance of the probability of detection versus different sample values M over
    AWGN channel against different readings of q ( dB and ). FIGURE 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint versus M over Nakagami-m fading channel for various readings
    of q ( dB and ). Figure 8 illustrates the CROC curves which are attained by varying
    the values of q and taking into account fixed values of M, and over both AWGN
    and Nakagami-m fading channels, respectively. This simulation plot affirms that
    an increase in probability of false alarm, which is designated by , results in
    an exponential decrease in miss detection probability. While at lower values of
    probability of false alarm, the achievable miss detection probability is quite
    large, even at the optimal detection threshold, the false alarm and miss detection
    probability might not be achieved. To fulfill the requirements of the false alarm
    and the miss detection probability, one can either increase the number of samples
    or the sampling frequency until the maximum permissible sensing time is reached.
    As a result, it optimizes ED performance at low SNR levels. Besides, from this
    plot, it can be deduced that the miss detection probability increases with the
    increase in the error that is, q and for different values of m. This seems to
    be due to imperfect reception at FC caused by errors (q) or fading in both sensing
    or reporting channels. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The variation
    of with respect to for various values of q fixing the value of , and = -10 dB
    over Nakagami-m channel. The effect of average SNR, that is, on cooperative probability
    of detection which is specified by the parameter by taking into account the various
    hard decision fusion rules such as the OR, AND, and MAJORITY rules over Nakagami-m
    fading environment is shown in Figure 9. Further, the performance of versus is
    attained by varying the value of error, that is, q and the values of m. From this
    plot, it is evident that the cooperative probability of detection is computed
    over the larger range of average SNR values by taking into consideration the fixed
    values of , , and . Upon increasing the values of , increases significantly. The
    primary reason behind this increase of probability of detection at higher values
    of SNR is that the higher values of SNRs not only substantially reduce the impact
    of interference in S-channels but also improve the quality at all the CRs. For
    reference, we also provide the curves at NCSS (i.e. under no fusion case) for
    and . Additionally, from this plot, it can be inferred that the detection performance
    which is achieved using the OR rule dominates the other HDFRs. FIGURE 9 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Illustration of the performance of versus for different
    values of q (Nakagami-m channel, , , and ). Figure 10 signifies the effect of
    probability of false alarm, that is, , average SNR values , error values q on
    cooperative probability of miss detection . From this plot, it can inferred that
    when either of the aforesaid parameters increase, the miss detection reduces significantly.
    Furthermore, the performance of is similarly seen to be significantly impacted
    by q. For reference, we also include the NCSS curves for the two alternative scenarios,
    where q = 0 and q = 0.06. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Performance
    of against various values of M and for various error q values over Nakagami-m
    fading channel by considering different HDFR rules ( = 0.06, = -10 dB, ). It is
    inferred that the recent studies have shown that the above generated results in
    Figures 7, 9, and 10 are often superior to the existing ones presented in [48]
    in terms of their quality and effectiveness, as the channel error considered is
    quite different (i.e. q = 0.06 considered here instead of 0.05). Figures 11-13
    illustrate that the TEP varies in terms of N, λ, and over Nakagami-m fading channel
    by considering different HDFR schemes, respectively. For instance as depicted
    in Figure 11, it is apparent that for rule, initially with the increase in the
    value of N, TEP reduces till a particular point, and later on, further increasing
    the value of N results in significant increase in TEP. Thus, this inference from
    the simulation result clearly suggests that there exist an optimal value of N,
    that is, , in order to minimize the TEP. From the plot, it is evident that for
    larger fusion rules like greater than rule, whenever N value rises, then TEP value
    initially reduces and the optimal value of N, that is, moves to the right from
    the origin. For instance, for rule, is 2 (where = 0.2022) and for rule, is 9 (where
    ). In order to facilitate a better understanding, the optimal number of CR nodes
    (i.e. ) which our proposed system can support has been identified and listed in
    Table 7 along with the attained minimum TEP values under different HDFR. TABLE

    of the performance of different hard decision fusion rules in terms of the achievable
    total error probability (TEP) and average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over Nakagami-m
    fading channel. Furthermore, the error probability, that is, TEP performance in
    terms of sensing threshold λ over Nakagami-m fading channel for various HDFR schemes
    is illustrated in Figure 12. Much similar to the previous scenario, it is evident
    that for any value of k, the TEP value increases initially with the increase in
    the value of λ, but it decreases upon further increasing the values of λ. Consequently,
    it necessitates to find the optimal value of λ, that is, for attaining lower values
    of TEP. Out of other HDFR rules, the OR rule exhibits a superior performance in
    terms of achieving lower TEP. In order to highlight this performance of OR rule,
    the optimal sensing threshold values (i.e. ) of all CR nodes have been identified
    and listed in Table 8 for different hard-decision fusion rules. TABLE 8. List
    of and TEP values obtained for different HDFR schemes. Fusion rule TEP 0.962 0.462

    of different HDFR rules like the OR, AND, and MAJORITY rules in terms of TEP and
    average SNR for different values of Nakagami-m fading parameter m. For larger
    values of the fading parameter m, it is desired to increase the average SNR value
    for achieving the minimum TEP. From this simulation outcomes, it is concluded
    that OR rule performs better when compared to other fusion rules. For the CSS
    system using various HDFR, the impact of the sensing threshold λ on the achievable
    throughput is illustrated in Figure 14 over Nakagami-m fading channel for a fixed
    values of = , m = 1.5, q = 0.06, = -10 dB, N = 5, and M = 1000. From the figure,
    it is clear that the throughput increases and reaches its peak for certain values
    of λ and then subsequently drops. Upon applying k = 1 rule, at a sensing threshold
    of 1.04, the highest is found to be 14.83, whereas while applying k = 2 rule,
    at a sensing threshold of λ = 1.02, the highest value of throughput which is reported
    is 14.92. Thus, this implies that there exits a suboptimal rule, that is, k =
    2 because it offers the lowest λ, that is, 1.02 with the highest , that is, 14.92.

    cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) system exploiting different hard decision fusion
    rules (HDFR) in terms of throughput and λ over Nakagami-m fading channel ( , ,
    dB, , and ). Figure 15 illustrates the performance of CSS system which is making
    use of different HDFR schemes in terms of the achievable energy efficiency versus
    total number of CR nodes N. From this simulation result, it can be deduced that
    for a certain extent, the energy efficiency increases with the increase in the
    value of N and then subsequently reduces. When k value rises to the higher level,
    then energy efficiency is increased by 11.2% when N = 20. In order to properly
    illustrate this aspect, across the maximum achievable energy efficiency, the optimal
    number of CR nodes (i.e. ) has been identified and listed in Tables 9 and 10.

    for different fusion activities under Nakagami-m fading environment at fixed values
    of m = 1.5, q = 0.06, N = 10, and M = 1000 is shown in Figure 16. It is to be
    noted that in this simulation result, the energy efficiency versus average SNR
    for OR, MAJORITY, and AND rules is plotted by applying k = 1, k = 6, and k = 10,
    accordingly. From this plot, it is clear that with the increase in average SNR,
    a substantial amount of increase in the energy efficiency is witnessed. Among
    the fusion rules, the OR rule outperforms the other fusion rules till the average
    SNR reaches up to -10 dB and then becomes constant beyond -10 dB of average SNR,
    while MAJORITY rule outperforms beyond -5 dB of average SNR . The CRN needs have
    at least = -10 dB under OR rule, -5 dB under MAJORITY rule, and 10 dB value under
    the AND rules, respectively, to attain maximum energy efficiency (i.e. η = 0.75)
    values over Nakagami-m (where, m = 1.5) fading. For lower values for , OR rule
    performs well and for higher values of , MAJORITY/AND rules perform well. FIGURE

    hard decision fusion rules (HDFR) in terms of energy efficiency as a function
    of (Nakagami-m fading, , , , and ). In the meantime, the results presented here
    are a bit more optimal than the ones that were drawn in the existing literature.
    For example, let us analyse Figure 15, because we have obtained greater η values
    under the k = 1/ k = 2/k = 3 (i.e. 0.559/0.414/0.412) rules than that of the values
    shown in fig. 3 of [43] with a lower fixed = - 10 dB value. As can be seen in
    Figure 16, our observations are optimal; that is, we have obtained greater values
    of η under OR (i.e. k = 1)/MAJORITY (i.e. k = 6)/AND (i.e. k = 10) rules (i.e.
    0.462/0.396/0.396) than those depicted in fig. 4 of [43] for a lower fixed value
    of = -10 dB, respectively. The CROC curves in terms of versus as shown in Figures
    17-19 represent the interpretation of different SDFS strategies for N number of
    CR nodes over Nakagami-m faded channel for different values of m, N, M, and ,
    respectively. Besides that, these simulation results also depict the scenario
    of a non-cooperative CR situation, that is, no fusion for the purpose of comparison.
    These simulation plots demonstrate that for a given value of , M, and m, the slowly
    drops whereas the increases. For a specific value of , it can be shown that the
    miss detection drops with the increase in . Furthermore, with the increase in
    the value of average SNR , the non-cooperative detection probability, that is,
    of each CR increases, which in turn results in the increase of cooperative detection
    probability, that is, ; therefore, since (= 1 - ), we can witness a reduction
    in miss detection. The simulation results which are presented in this section
    emphasize that they are in good agreement with the analytical framework. FIGURE

    addition, the aforesaid simulation results corresponding to SDFR techniques emphasize
    the fact that the performance of CSS under MRC fusion performs much better when
    compared to all the other merging activities, such as SLS, SLC, and SC, where
    the MRC scheme requires channel state information. However, SLC operates better
    than SLS and SC and have never been concerned over CSI details. As a result of
    its performance, we frequently pick the SLC technique when channel information
    is not essential. Therefore, a smaller value of m for the given value of results
    in the reduction of value. By enhancing cooperation among the CR nodes, it provides
    higher detection statistics than an individual CR, and the effect of fading over
    S-channel may be eliminated. Because when increases from 5 to 7 dB as well as
    from 7 to 10 dB at = 0.1 and N = 3, respectively, decreases in accordance with
    previous fusion processes. Also, the aforementioned results are superior to the
    outcomes mapped out in the current research. For illustration, take a look at
    Figure 17, as we have obtained lower values under MRC/SC/SLC/SLS (i.e. 0.04/0.11986/0.06356/0.09447)
    schemes than those shown in figs 3and 4 in [23] for lower values. Our results
    are optimal, which means that we have obtained lower values of under MRC/SC/SLC/SLS
    schemes (i.e. 0.018/0.098/0.060/0.023) than the results plotted in fig. 5 of [23],
    and figs 4, 5, and 7 of [24], respectivelty, as shown in Figure 18. This can be
    seen by referring to our results are ideal, which means that we have obtained
    lower values of for MRC/SC/SLC/SLS schemes (i.e. 0.0095/0.09125/0.05686/0.05378)
    than the ones that are presented in fig. 7 of [23]. These values can be seen in
    Figure 19. The TEP performance in terms of λ over Nakagami-m fading channel for
    various SDFS schemes is illustrated in Figure 20. It should be noticed that for
    all fusion schemes, as λ increases initially, TEP decreases up to a certain value
    (i.e. minimum value), but it increases upon further increasing values of λ. Consequently,
    it entails to determine the optimal value of the sensing threshold, that is, which
    achieves a lower TEP value. This plot emphasizes that the increase in the value
    of λ results in reduction of TEP at an alarming rate, and among the other soft
    data fusion techniques, the MRC scheme performs effectively with λ = 6 (lower
    λ value). The optimal threshold values (i.e. ), which achieve minimum TEP of all
    CR nodes employing the SDFS schemes, have been listed in Table 11. TABLE 10. List

    The SUE and for various values at 50 ms are shown in Figure 21. In improved SNR
    instances, optimum SUE is achieved at a fairly low optimal sensing time, but in
    lower SNR situations, the higher sensing time and SUE substantially decrease.

    fading environment with imperfect S-and perfect R-channels (where S-channels are
    noisy-faded and R-channels are error-free). The system performance is analysed
    through probability of false alarm, miss-detection, TEP, and throughput/energy
    efficiency, by considering different channel constraints, that is, q, m, N, M,
    and . At FC, the performance of different hard and soft fusion combining schemes
    has been interpreted. The results of the simulations show that the OR rule provides
    the greatest improved performance of the hard-decision schemes, whereas MRC fusion
    outperforms better under soft fusion schemes. We also analyzed the spectrum utilisation
    efficiency of the CR user against sensing time for a variety of predefined values
    of . For higher values of , it can be deduced that it is desired to substantially
    increase the values of N or M in order to reduce miss-detection/TEP, accordingly.
    Furthermore, the study of the results shows that errors/fading in the S-channels
    has an impact on the suggested CSS effectiveness. Moreover, channel error (q)
    and the fading severity parameter (m) have a significant impact on the detection
    performance of an individual CR node. For many fusion methods, an optimal value
    of N = 3 or 5 or 10 is seen to improve system performance by reducing the development
    of errors and fading. In addition, the cooperative miss detection and TEP decrease
    dramatically as M increases. The ideal value of or for achieving the lowest TEP
    (or greatest energy efficiency) has been determined for various fusion algorithms.
    In future study, we plan to design an ideal CRN for next-generation wireless networks
    in any context with extreme fading. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Kiran Kumar Godugu: Conceptualization,

    IEEE Conference Location: Chiang Mai, Thailand SECTION I. Introduction Data traffic
    has soared due to the rapid evolution of wireless applications and the enormous
    growth of mobile users [1]. Therefore, more radio spectrum is required to enable
    high speed data networks [2]. Effective spectrum management policies are required
    for communication networks to work successfully [3]. As a result, cognitive radio
    (CR) technology posed as a viable solution to address the spectrum shortage in
    wireless communication. In addition, an energy-harvesting technique is envisioned
    as propitious solution to overcome the energy constraint for the wireless communication
    systems [4]–[7]. In [8]–[11], EH-enabled CRN is extensively investigated, improving
    both spectrum and energy efficiency. The performance of CR can be analyzed at
    the node, network, and application levels using a variety of performance measures.
    One typical performance indicator considered for CR users is the transmission
    rate. However, the error rate is also an important performance metric that estimates
    the reliability of CR communications. Consequently, a number of recent studies
    [12], [13] include error rate in CR analysis. The improvement of network quality
    is dependent on a variety of factors, and one of the key factors to improve network
    performance is modulation techniques. Most CR networks (CRNs) employ binary phase
    shift keying (BPSK) as the fundamental modulation technique. However, in LTE-Advanced
    standards and future technologies, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is the
    ideal modulation technique to deliver high data rates due to its excellent power
    and bandwidth efficiency. In the next generation wireless communication networks,
    the transmission of high data rates while maintaining power and spectrum efficiency
    are major concerns. To overcome both the concerns, an adaptive modulation technique
    can turns out to be a practical solution [14], [15]. Higher-order QAM modulation
    techniques are a potential solution for high data rate transmission with better
    power and spectrum efficiency. The family of QAM includes several significant
    QAM constellations namely, square QAM (SQAM), rectangular QAM (RQAM), and hexagonal
    QAM (HQAM)[16]. RQAM is a flexible and general order modulation technique. It
    consists of SQAM, BPSK, quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), and others as special
    cases [17], and it is widely used in telecommunication systems, microwave etc.
    HQAM has highly compact 2D constellations that provide low peak-to-average power.
    Due to its supremacy over the other constellations, HQAM is preferred for a wide
    range of applications namely multiple-antenna systems, advanced channel coding
    etc. The performance of QAM techniques employed in various communication systems
    over various fading channels has been studied and reported on by researchers in
    a number of papers [18]–[22]. Under the Nakagami-m fading channel, [19], calculates
    the average symbol error rate (ASER) expression for RQAM, QPSK, and differentially
    encoded QPSK. In [20], the authors constructed the exact ASER expressions of RQAM
    and cross QAM in an amplify and forward (AF) multiple relay network over Rayleigh
    fading channels. The authors investigate the performance of a SC receiver using
    HQAM and RQAM over k - μ fading channels [21]. [22]evaluated a novel analytical
    symbol error probability (SEP) for HQAM. To effectively utilize the scarce spectrum
    with optimum power, the QAM schemes particularly RQAM and HQAM are adopted in
    this work for a cooperative CRN. We analyze the performance of a cooperative prediction-sensing
    based EHCRN under a Nakagami-m fading channel and use higherorder QAM constellations
    for high data rate, spectrally efficient, and low ASER communication. To acquire
    better system performance, the exact analytical expression of ASER for RQAM and
    HQAM constellations is determined. The ASER performance for several QAM constellations
    is examined in order to validate the supremacy of RQAM and HQAM. Lastly, the mathematical
    modelling of the system is established by using Monte Carlo simulation. Fig. 1.
    PU detection frame. Show All The Remaining paper is structured as: Section II
    provides the system model. Performance analysis is reported in Section III. Numerical
    findings are discussed in Section IV. Conclusions are put forward in Section V.
    SECTION II. System Model We assume a cooperative EH-CRN comprised of a PU transmitter,
    a fusion center (FC) and a group of CR users. Each CR user consists of an energy
    harvester and an energy splitting device. The harvester is capable of harvesting
    energy out of RF signal emanating from the PU as well as non-RF signals. This
    harvested energy is saved in an energy buffer having infinite capacity such as
    a supercapacitor. The CR user predicts and senses for the presence of PU in a
    time-slotted model. The CR users freely predict for the presence of PU in the
    channel and forward the prediction results to the FC to get final information
    about the existence of PU. The CR users next cooperatively sense the channel for
    the existence of PU and forward the sensing information to the FC to yield the
    cooperative decision. In either case, the FC employs a hard combining rule i.e.,
    OR rule to determine the ultimate decision pertaining to the presence of PU. Lastly,
    the FC communicates the final decision as a set of four level-quantized decision
    which can be either of 00, 10, 01, 11 where the initial bit is the final prediction
    decision and the subsequent bit is the final sensing decision. All the frames
    of the CR user are made up of prediction, sensing and transmission periods and
    are expressed as τ p , τ s , and T r , respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. In addition,
    the CR user is unfamiliar with the PU signal, which is arbitrary. It is to be
    noted that there is likelihood that the PU may re-claim spectrum access amidst
    ongoing CR transmissions. A. PU Activity model The two distinct states of the
    PU i.e., busy and idle states are modeled as a two state Markov model. Both states
    have an exponential time distribution with mean b and a for the two hypotheses
    H 0 and H 1 . H 0 stands for absence of PU and the alternate hypotheses H 1 stands
    for PU occupancy. The expression of probability density functions (PDFs) of both
    the states are P B (t)= 1 b e −t b ; P l (t)= 1 a e −t a , (1) View Source respectively.
    Here, P(⋅) gives the probability. Given that the PU regains channel access, and
    as such, there exist some probable hypotheses corresponding to the PU channel
    possession state of the specified channel [23]. B. Channel Prediction The CR users
    in the cooperative network predicts about the channel occupation of PU based on
    the prior information about the PU activity. The overall prediction X ^ P is a
    function of the individual prediction outcomes x ^ P l . Consequently, the overall
    prediction is formulated as, X ^ P =f( x ^ P1 , x ^ P2 , x ^ P3 , ⋯ x ^ PN ) (2)
    View Source Here, f(⋅) is the fusion rule. C. Channel Sensing After sampling the
    received signal at fs Hz, the number of samples, N s = τ s f s is calculated.
    The received signal Y C R i (n) at the CR user can be described as Y C R i (n)={
    hs(n)+u(n) u(n) , for  H 1 , for  H 0 (3) View Source We assume the following:
    a) u(n) is the i.i.d AWGN noise signal having mean and variance as 0 and σ 2 u
    , respectively. Also, h represents the channel-fading coefficient;b ) s (n) indicates
    the primary user signal having mean zero and variance σ 2 s . The decision statistics
    of the ED can be given by T C R i = 1 N s ∑ n=1 N s | Y C R i (n ) 2 |. (4) View
    Source The decision statistic approaches a Gaussian distribution for a bigger
    number of samples. Each of the CR users compare their decision statistics with
    a fixed threshold value, λ CR . Consequently, the sensing probabilities at the
    i-th CR in case of an ideal ED can be calculated as given in [23]. We use a Nakagami-m
    statistical fading model to demonstrate an easy and precise ASER analysis of RQAM
    and HQAM. The envelope of the faded signal in a Nakagami-m fading channel has
    a PDF given as f γ (γ)= 1 Γ(m) ( m γ ) m γ m−1 exp(− m γ ¯ γ),γ≥0 (5) View Source
    where m refers to the fading severity parameter. The average probability of detection,
    P ~ d,Nak , is given as P ~ d,Nak = A 1 + β m e − λ 2 σ 2 × ∑ i=0 N/2−2 (− λ 2
    σ 2 ) i i! × 1 F 1 (m;i+1; −λ(1−β) 2 σ 2 ). (6) View Source Here, A 1 = e − λβ
    2m σ 2 [ β m−1 L m−1 ( −λ(1−β) 2 σ 2 )+(1− β) ∑ m−2 i=0 β i L i ( −λ(1−β) 2 σ
    2 )],β= 2m σ 2 (2m σ 2 +α γ ¯ ) and 1 F 1 ( .;.;. ) indicates the confluent hypergeometric
    function [24]. The false alarm probability does not change because it does not
    include any terms related to the fading channel parameters. The final channel
    sensing decisions are calculated as given in [23]. D. Hard Combined Decision The
    choice of data transmission and the form of energy harvesting source is determined
    by the CR; once the outcomes of prediction and sensing mechanisms are obtained.
    Both these outcomes are coupled to form the hard combined decision. Please note
    that both the prediction and sensing mechanisms are mutually independent. SECTION
    III. Performance Analysis A. Energy Harvesting The proposed model is incorporated
    with energy harvesting, allowing a CR user to collect energy from RF and non-RF
    sources. During prediction-sensing time, the CR user leaves both the harvesters
    on, as the CR user is unaware of the presence of PU. Accordingly, there arises
    a necessity of determining the probability of when the PU remains busy during
    the prediction-sensing time. This probability is given P ac = ∫ τ p + τ s 0 P
    B (t)dt. (7) View Source The energy harvested can be calculated by [23] E H =
    M[(1− P ac ) E nrf + P ac E rf ( τ p + τ s )+ E 1 + E 2 ] + X M−1 [P( H 0 ) P
    f ( T r − T c ) E nrf + T c E rf ]. (8) View Source where, E1, E2 are expressed
    as E 1 =P( H 1 ) P d (1− P dis ) T r E rf , (9) View Source And E 2 = T r E nrf
    [P( H 1 ) P m +P( H 1 ) P AM1 +P( H 0 ) P AM2 ], (10) View Source respectively.
    For multiple detection frames, a CR reports the channel occupation of PU for (M−1)
    frames and initiates transmission in the M th frame when the PU vacates the channel.
    B. Throughput We observe successful transmissions only when the hard combined
    decision declares P( X ^ P = H 0 , X S = H 0 ∣ H 0 ) . Then, the secondary network
    throughput is given R 0M = [ T− τ p − τ s − T c T ]P( H 0 )[P( H 1 )( P d + P
    AM1 ) +P( H 0 )( P f + P AM2 )] (M−1) P nf C 0 . (11) View Source C. Outage Probability
    The outage probability is denoted P oιιt and is described as the link failure
    probability where the instantaneous SNR, γ insi lies below a preset threshold
    SNR, γ th . Mathematically, the outage probability is defined as [25] P out  =
    ∫ γ th  0 f γ (γ)dγ (12) View Source where, f γ (γ) characterizes the PDF of the
    fading channel. The threshold SNR is determined by γ th = 2 R −1 where R denotes
    the desired transmission rate. Utilizing (5), the OP for a Nakagami-m faded channel
    is calculated as P out = 1 Γ(m) γ(m, m σ 2 γ th γ ¯ P s ) (13) View Source Here,
    Γ(⋅) and γ(⋅,⋅) portrays the complete and incomplete Gamma functions. D. Average
    Symbol Error Rate (ASER) The average symbol error rate (ASER) is another key performance
    criterion and is perhaps the most critical parameter to evaluate. A generalized
    expression for ASER based on the CDF of a digital modulation scheme is expressed
    as P s (e)=− ∫ ∞ 0 P ′ s (e∣γ) P out (γ)dγ (14) View Source For the received signal
    SNR, P ′ s (e|γ) is the first-order derivative of the conditional ASER P s (e∣γ)
    . For the ASER analysis to be more compliant the outage probability is considered
    for analysis. 1) Rectangular QAM (RQAM) The analytical formula of ASER for M-ary
    RQAM modulation technique for Nakagami-m fading channels is given in (15), where
    p= 1−( 1 M I ),q=1−( 1 M Q ),a= 6 ( M 2 I −1)( M 2 Q −1) λ 2 − − − − − − − − −
    − − − √ ,b=λa, Ψ 1 = ∑ ∞ r 1 =0 (1) r 1 r 1 ! 3 2 r 1 ( a 2 2 ) r 1 , Ψ 2 = ∑
    ∞ r 2 =0 (1) r r 2 ! 3 2 , and Ψ 3 = ∑ m−1 n=0 1 n! ( m σ 2 Ω P s ) . M1 is the
    in phase constellation points and MQ is the quadrature phase constellation points.
    2) Hexagonal QAM (HQAM) The analytical formula of ASER for M-ary HQAM modulation
    technique is given in (16), where α,τ , and τ c are constant terms, provided their
    values are adjusted so as to obtain the required HQAM constellation [22]. SECTION
    IV. Results and Discussion In this section, the derived mathematical expressions
    for the different performance metrics are numerically evaluated and the plots
    are obtained using MATLAB and Mathematica software. The simulation results substantiate
    the exactness of the mathematical modelling of the system. The harvested energy
    in relation to the sensing channel SNR for various fading severity parameters
    is shown in Fig. 2. In a Nakagami-m channel, m characterizes the fading severity
    parameter. We observe that the harvested energy increases as the fading severity
    parameter rises. A larger value of m indicates a greater signal strength and confines
    the signal variations within an admissible limit. When m= 1, the Nakagami-m fading
    is analogous to a Rayleigh fading channel. In this case, m= 1 indicates the most
    severe channel fading. P s (e)=−p(q−1)−(p−1)q+ abpq π [ Ψ 1 ( r 1 !) ( a 2 + b

    2. Harvested energy vs SNR for m = 1, 2, 3 and 4. Show All The variation of the
    normalized throughput with the sensing channel SNR is illustrated in Fig. 3. The
    impact of fading severity parameter on the normalized throughput is shown. The
    normalized throughput begins to rise as the fading severity parameter increases.
    This is because larger the value of m, less severe is the fading scenario. Since,
    m= 1 indicates the most severe channel fading condition (Rayleigh fading), therefore,
    the system throughput deteriorates when m =1. The OP versus SNR for various data
    rate parameters is shown in Fig. 4. It is apparent that the OP drops as the SNR
    increases. The OP also depends on the data rate parameter such that a higher data
    rate results in poor outage behavior. For various fading severity values (m= 1,
    m = 2 and m = 3) the OP is indicated. The OP falls as the fading depth parameter
    increases. A rising fading severity parameter implies less severe fading condition
    and hence, the probability of a CR node moving into outage decreases. The simulations
    are performed and it can be seen that the simulation and analytical results match
    well with each other. Fig. 3. Normalized throughput for different SNR. Show All
    The OP as a function of the normalized distance for various fading severity parameters
    is shown in Fig. 5. The OP is evaluated for different SNR levels and fading severity
    parameters. The OP increases as the normalized distance between the base station
    and the CR nodes increases. As the normalized distance increases the signal strength
    decreases and hence, the prospects of a CR node to move into outage is more. The
    outage probability decreases as the SNR as well as the fading severity parameter
    increases which is desirable. Fig. 4. OP vs SNR for various data rate parameter.
    Show All Fig. 5. OP vs normalized distance for various fading severity parameter.
    Show All Fig. 6 illustrates the ASER performance for 4 × 2 RQAM and 8 × 4 RQAM
    technique for the generalized Nakagami-m fading channels. It is observed that
    the ASER performance of the considered network improves with the severity parameter
    m. Further, it is observed that the ASER performance degrades with increase in
    order of the modulation scheme. To achieve an ASER of 10−2 for m= 3, approximately
    7.2 dB gain is achieved when 4 × 2 RQAM is compared with 8 × 4 RQAM. The ASER
    vs SNR curve for HQAM is shown in Fig. 7. The HQAM modulation technique for various
    modulation orders M and fading severity parameter (m = 1, 2, 3) is shown. The
    ASER performance degrades with the increases in the modulation order. However,
    the ASER performance improves with the fading severity parameter m. To attain
    an ASER of 10−2, approximately 6.5 dB and 8 dB gains are achieved when m increases
    from 1 to 2 and 1 to 3, respectively. Fig. 6. ASER for Rectangular QAM. Show All
    Fig. 7. ASER for Hexagonal QAM. Show All Fig. 8. ASER comparison for RQAM and
    HQAM. Show All 4 HQAM for a fading severity of m= 3, has the least ASER which
    is desirable. The extent of fading diminishes as the fading severity factor increases,
    and subsequently the ASER reduces. Fig. 8 analogizes the numerical and simulation
    results of RQAM and HQAM. HQAM outperforms RQAM by a wide margin. This is because
    HQAM has a highly dense 2D packing structure compared to the RQAM, which provides
    low peak and average powers. To attain an ASER of 10−1, we achieve roughly about
    1.08 dB and 2.54 dB gain when 32 HQAM and 8 HQAM are compared with 8 × 4 RQAM
    and 4 × 2 RQAM, respectively. SECTION V. Conclusions This article evaluates the
    behavior of a prediction-sensing based EH-CRN under the generalized Nakagami-
    m fading channel for high data rate communications. The system performance is
    analyzed in terms of the harvested energy, throughput, OP, and ASER for specific
    network parameters such as fading severity, threshold data rate, and constellation
    size. The closed-form expressions of OP and ASER for RQAM and HQAM modulation
    schemes are derived. The OP decreases as the SNR and the fading severity parameter
    increase, which is desirable. The ASER performance is valid for the different
    values of fading severity factor. It is found that the HQAM offers better performance
    in comparison to other QAM techniques under the presented scenario. The result
    of the Monte Carlo simulation establishes the appropriateness of the analytical
    modeling of the system. The higher order QAM modulations will enable the development
    of extremely reliable, versatile, and efficient broadcasting as well as mobile
    communication networks owing to its high data-rate with excellent spectral efficiency.
    The considered system model can be practically implemented for the 5G and beyond
    network systems to improve both spectral as well as energy efficiency. Authors

  description: With the rapid growth of wireless communication systems, there is a
    rising demand for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna systems capable of adapting
    to various frequency bands and operating conditions. This paper presents an integrated
    design for MIMO antennas based on a varactor diode as a promising component for
    achieving frequency agility in the proposed system. A dual-polarized system is
    achieved by employing a combination of two antennas. One antenna is situated on
    the exterior surface of the side-edge frame, while the other is positioned on
    the substrate surface. The spatial configuration enables the creation of orthogonal

    incorporating varactor diodes with a variable bias voltage (0.5–10 V) into the
    antenna design, the resonant frequency can be dynamically adjusted, allowing the
    antenna to operate across a wide range of frequencies (4.3 to 6.5 GHz) with more
    than 18 dB of mutual coupling in the working band. The presented reconfigurable
    antennas are printed on compact dimensions of 15 × 25 × 0.8 mm3 using a Rogers
    RT5880 material with a relative dielectric constant 2.2. Because of its flexible
    frequency range, extensive tuning range, small size, and planar structure, it
    is well-suited for various current and future wireless communication applications,
    including cognitive radio, software-defined radio, and next-generation wireless

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Hanoi, Vietnam SECTION I. Introduction Cognitive
    radio has been realized as an efficient solution to overcome many existing practical
    problems of spectrum allocation, utilization, and management in dynamic dense-connected
    wireless environments [1]. Especially, in recent wireless communication generations
    like beyond fifth-generation (5G) and 6G, the combination of multiple-input multiple-output
    (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technologies has
    been adopted with adaptive modulator and demodulator [2], in which machine learning-based
    algorithms were embedded in the receiver to accurately identify the modulation
    type of the incoming signal without the need for channel information. In the last
    decade, several approaches have been introduced by exploiting the advantages of
    machine learning and deep learning [3], but most of them processed the signals
    generated by single-input single-output single-carrier (SISO-SC) instead of MIMO-OFDM.
    For instance, MCNet [4], SCGNet [5], RanNet [6] were designed with advanced convolutional
    neural network (CNN) architectures for automatic modulation classification (AMC).
    Few AMC methods were proposed to identify the modulation fashions of received
    wireless signals in MIMO-OFDM systems because of many challenging issues like
    signal distortion in impaired transmission environments and the diversity of channel
    conditions without channel state information [2], [7]. For example, Zheng and
    Lv [8] classified modulation type based on determining the active subcarriers
    and the constellation diagram of OFDM-IM signal. Gupta et al. [9] recognized OFDM
    modulation by calculating the normalized high-order cumulants, but the impairments
    from propagation channels attenuated the system’s performance significantly. With
    the assumption of symbol-timing and carrier-frequency OFDM synchronization obtained,
    some works adopted a general machine learning framework, including feature extraction
    (e.g., high-order statistics) and classification algorithms (e.g., Bayesian network
    [10] and random forest [11]). The above-mentioned methods presented low modulation
    classification accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to the failure
    of learning intrinsic features at multi-scale signal representation [12]. In this
    work, we propose an efficient AMC method to classify the modulation types of incoming
    signals at the receiver in MIMO-OFDM systems under a variety of channel impairments.
    To this end, we aptly design a sophisticated CNN architecture with various cutting-edge
    structures, including asymmetric depthwise separable convolution (a point-wise
    convolution following a depthwise convolution), residual connection, and attention
    mechanism. Compared with regular convolution, the asymmetric depthwise separable
    convolution significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and the computational
    cost with nearly no sacrifice of performance. Residual connection and attention
    mechanisms, meanwhile, improve learning efficiency and address the vanishing gradient
    descent problem. The performance of our method with the designed deep network
    is benchmarked on a synthetic dataset of MIMO-OFDM signals recorded with different
    SNR regimes under various wireless transmission impairments. Fig. 1. A regular
    MIMO-OFDM system with an efficient AMC algorithm that should be adopted at the
    receiver to determine the modulation fashions of received signals, thus assisting
    in symbol demodulation. Show All SECTION II. Signal Model We investigate a regular
    MIMO-OFDM system, as illustrated in Fig. 1, which is configured by Nsc subcarriers,
    M OFDM symbols, and the antenna pattern Nt ×Nr. At the receiver, we developed
    a modulation classifier to identify the modulation fashions of received MIMO-OFDM
    signals that are transmitted over a frequency-selective multipath Rayleigh fading
    channel. At the transmitter, the system encodes the input bits using a predefined
    digital modulation fashion, usually done by an adaptive modulator depending on
    the transmission conditions and user requirements, to generate symbols. For each
    symbol, a pilot is appended and coordinated into equally spaced frequency bins
    by a serial-to-parallel conversion scheme. The symbols are then converted to multiple
    orthogonal overlapping sinusoids using the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT)
    before being affixed with the cyclic prefix (CP). Notably, known pilot symbols
    may be attached to facilitate channel estimation and equalization. Given the complex
    data of a modulated signal on the n-th subcarrier snt [n,m] of the nt-th antenna,
    the k-th baseband signal for the m-th OFDM symbol can be expressed by s ′ n t
    [m,k]= ∑ n=0 N−1 s n t [n,m] e j2πnk/N ,0≤k≤N−1, (1) View Source where the number
    of IFFT points N is equal to the number of subcarriers Nsc with a full oversampling.
    The ℓ cyc -length CP information is then affixed on ahead s n t [m,k] to counteract
    the inter-symbol interference that may affect to neighboring OFDM symbols. The
    signal of this step can be written as s ~ n t [m,k]={ s ′ n t [m,k+N], s ′ n t
    [m,k], − ℓ cyc ≤k≤−1, 0≤k≤N−1. (2) View Source A filter f [k] with sinc impulse
    response is adopted to enhance the out-of-band radiation of sub-band signals as
    follows x n t [m,k]= s ~ n t [m,k]⊗f[k], (3) View Source where ⊗ symbolizes the
    circular convolution. As we assume that symbol-timing and carrier-frequency OFDM
    are synchronized at the receiver, the OFDM signal of the rt-th receive antenna
    can be obtained as follows y r t [m,k]= x n t [m,k]⊗h[m,k]+ξ[m,k],0≤k≤ ℓ sym −1,  (4)
    View Source where ℓsym = N + ℓcyc is the signal length of an OFDM symbol, ξ is
    additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and h denotes the element of a channel matrix
    representing the impulse response as H N t × N t [m,k]= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ h 1,1 [m,k] ⋮
    h 1, N r [m,k] ⋯ ⋱ ⋯ h N t ,1 [m,k] ⋮ h N t , N r [m,k] ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ . (5) View Source
    As validated by indoor and outdoor measurements [13], this work considers the
    Kronecker model having the spatial correlation between transmit and receive antennas
    H= R 1/2 r Λ R T/2 t , (6) View Source where Λ is an Nr×Nt matrix of independently
    and identically distributed complex Gaussian variables; and Rt and Rr are the
    spatial correlation matrices at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. The
    channel spatial correlation matrix should be represented as the Kronecker product
    as Rspat = Rr ⊗ Rt. The signal yrt of M symbols has the length of ℓsig = M × ℓsym
    complex envelope samples. The burst OFDM signal z ∈ ℂ1×L (where L = ℓsig × Nr)
    acquired by Nr receive antennas can be represented as y=[ y 1 [m,k],…, y N r [m,k]],0≤k≤
    ℓ sym −1. (7) View Source The burst signal vector contains the complex envelope
    samples acquired by Nr antennas, where each complex sample y r t [m,k]= y I r
    t [m,k]+ j ~ y Q r t [m,k] should be decomposed into the discrete in-phase and
    quadrature (IQ) components represented by real values y IQ r t [m,k]=[ y I r t
    [m,k] y Q r t [m,k] ] =[ Re( y r t [m,k]) Im( y r t [m,k])]. (8) View Source The
    IQ data of a burst MIMO-OFDM signal at the receiver is now formed into a three-dimensional
    data array Y IQ ∈ R N r × ℓ sig  ×2 correspondingly, where the depth (a.k.a.,
    third dimension) represents the IQ components. This data array is finally passed
    through a DL-based modulation classifier to identify the modulation fashion accurately
    and consequently to assist the demodulation procedure. SECTION III. OMCNet: Deep
    CNNs for MIMO-OFDM Modulation Classification To efficiently learn complex modulation
    patterns in MIMOOFDM signals, we design a specialized deep network using CNN architecture
    as a modulation classifier to assist the demodulator in decoding signals. Our
    network, namely the OFDM modulation classification network (OMCNet), is fabricated
    by many advanced deep learning techniques, including asymmetric depthwise separable
    convolution, residual connection, and attention mechanism, for the aim of extracting
    and learning more underlying high-discriminative features to improve the modulation
    classification accuracy under synthetic channel impairments. The overall architecture
    of OMCNet is presented in Fig. 2, in which there are two kinds of processing blocks:
    coarse feature extraction (CFE) and fine feature extraction (FFE). Fig. 2. The
    detailed architecture of the proposed OMCNet, in which the CFE block aims to calculate
    the coarse features and the FFE blocks is to capture fine features as high-level
    correlations of OFDM samples, such as residual connection and attention mechanism.
    Show All CFE block: This block aims to capture the general coarse features with
    the intention of using large-size kernels in multiple regular convolution (conv)
    layers that are connected in a serial flow and followed by batch normalization
    (bn) layers and Gaussian error linear unit (gelu) activation layers. Given the
    input to the CFE block F CFE int  , the data processing in this block can be represented
    as follows F CFE out = F 3×3 ( F 3×5 ( F 3×7 ( F 3×11 ( F CFE in  )))), (9) View
    Source where ℱn×m denotes a sequential conv-bn-gelu operation with the filter
    size of n × m and the stride of (1,2) for dimensionality reduction and multi-scale
    feature extraction. The output F CFE out is then processed as the input to FFE
    blocks. FFE block: For extracting more intrinsic discriminative features that
    can describe the high-level correlation of samples in each OFDM symbol and between
    different symbols, we specialize in a cutting-edge structure for FFE blocks with
    several benefits, including complexity reduction and learning efficiency enhancement.
    In particular, each block has two sub-blocks for extracting fine features with
    asymmetric depthwise separable convolution for complexity reduction (including
    the computational cost and the number of trainable parameters) [14], two residual
    connections to prevent the network from vanishing gradient descent, and one module
    of attention mechanism to refine extracted features. The following part describes
    the processing flow in an FFE block. Given the input to a sub-block Fin, the output
    Fsub is written as follows F sub =G(G( F in )) (10) View Source where G denotes
    an operation sequence of two depthwise convolutions with asymmetric kernels (e.g.,
    1 × 3 and 3 × 1), one pointwise convolution, batch normalization, and gelu activation.
    Implementing asymmetric kernels helps reduce the number of trainable parameters
    in the network if compared with a regular symmetric kernel without sacrificing
    learning efficiency. The residual connection is finalized with an element-wise
    addition in the case of the first sub-block as follows F + = F ′ + F sub01 , (11)
    View Source where F′ denotes the output of conv-bn operation containing the identity
    information. For the module of attention mechanism, the flow can be described
    as follows F att =fc( F dep ∗sigmoid( F dep )) (12) View Source where F dep =fc(gap(
    F 1×1 ( F FFE in ))) with representing fully connected (fc) layer and global average
    pooling (gap) layer, respectively, and ∗ symbolizes the element-wise multiplication
    operation. Notably, Fatt contains the attention values signifying the overall
    characteristic weights of feature maps. At the end of the FFE block, we multiply
    the attention values with gradient-maintained features in F++ to emphasize the
    relevant features and invalidate the irrelevant features as follows F FFE out
    = F ++ ∗ F att . (13) View Source The network is finalized by a depthwise separable
    convolution layer (formed with the kernel of size 2 × 1 to calculate the sample
    correlations between signals received by different antennas) followed by a cascade
    operation bn-gelu-gap-fc-softmax. The number neurons in the fc layer is determined
    by the number of modulation classes in a given dataset. TABLE I Parameter Configuration

    A. Dataset Generation and Deep Training Setup A synthetic MIMO-OFDM signal dataset
    of four modulation techniques (BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM) is generated under multiple
    channel impairments (e.g., multipath Rayleigh channel with frequency-selective
    mode, additive Gaussian noise, phase offset, frequency offset, and Doppler effect)
    with different delay spread conditions. Some important configurations of the signal
    model and the deep model training are summarized in Table I. The dataset has 80K
    signals spreading on eight SNR levels [−10,25] dB, which is divided randomly with
    56K signals in the training set and the remainder in the test set. The accuracy
    is reported as the average of multiple classification times on the test set. TABLE
    II Model Comparison In Terms Of Accuracy and Complexity (Network Size and Computational
    Cost B. Numerical Results The first simulation studies the performance of OMCNet
    with different delay profiles [15]. The accuracy results versus SNR are plotted
    in Fig. 3(a), in which our network performs well under synthetically impaired
    channel environments with an overall accuracy higher than 92%. The accuracy of
    ETU is better than that of EPA and EVA due to the lower path loss in the typical
    urban environment. Interestingly, in the high-SNR regime, the accuracy of EPA
    is worse than that of EVA because the modulated signals are strongly deteriorated
    by the high attenuation of path gains. In Fig. 3(b), we accomplish an ablation
    study by investigating the accuracy of various cutting-out OMCNet versions with
    the EVA delay profile to highlight the efficiency of the proposed architecture.
    Without the attention mechanism, a.k.a. α-OMCNet, the overall accuracy is around
    89.46% (lower than nearly 3.0% compared with OMCNet) which continuously reduces
    by 1.9% without residual connection of β-OMCNet. The overall accuracy is slightly
    improved when we adopt the regular convolution fashion and symmetric kernels in
    γ-OMCNet and δ-OMCNet, respectively, but the number of trainable parameters and
    computational cost increase drastically (to be discussed hereafter). By exploiting
    various advanced techniques in the architecture, OMCNet achieves twofold objectives,
    i.e., accuracy improvement and complexity reduction. The second simulation investigates
    the influence of the network’s hyper-parameters on the overall classification
    accuracy. In particular, we vary the number of kernels and the number of FFE blocks
    with the accuracy results shown in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. As accuracy
    improves along with the increase in the number of kernels, some significant improvements
    are yielded in the cases of using 16 and 32 kernels, meanwhile, a trivial improvement
    is produced by adopting 64 kernels. It should be noticed that the complexity (including
    the network size, a.k.a., the number of trainable parameters, and the computational
    cost) highly intensifies when increasing the number of kernels. Nearly tripling
    the network size and doubling computation (measured by the number of multiply-accumulate
    operations - MACs) of 64 kernels for 1.04% improvement seems unreasonable in Table
    II. By varying the number of FFE blocks in the network architecture, we recognize
    that the four-block model performs slightly better than the standard OMCNet around
    0.51%, but the network size is nearly two times heavier. SECTION V. Conclusions
    In this paper, we have introduced an efficient modulation classification method
    for MIMO-OFDM signals in next-generation networks. We have designed OMCNet with
    an architecture specialized by various advanced techniques, including asymmetric
    depthwise separable convolution, residual connection, and attention mechanism.
    In the simulations, our proposed method with OMCNet demonstrated high performance
    in terms of accuracy and complexity of modulation identification under a synthetically
    impaired channel condition. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics Footnotes

    field of mathematics that addresses conflict and cooperation among intelligent
    decision makers [1]. It is very prominent in Social Sciences, Auctions, Humanities,
    Economics, Natural Sciences, Engineering, Biology, etc [2], [3]. The players are
    decision-makers or agents and strategy is a specification of decision that is
    paid off in terms of reward or punishment. Players decide their strategies on
    the basis of available information which may be complete or incomplete in nature.
    The game may be represented by matrix or a tree, where the matrix does not include
    the time feature while the tree or graph includes the time feature similar to
    a sequential process. In recent years, wireless communication (WC) has replaced
    wired communication, providing Anytime, Anywhere, and Always connectivity in a
    cost effective manner. This not only connects people but also improvises their
    lifestyle through internet banking, online shopping, online studies, traffic monitoring,
    disaster management, health services, etc. The various key parameters of wireless
    networks are efficiency [4], spectrum allocation [5], profit [6], security [7],
    [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21],
    [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34],
    secrecy outage probability (SOP) [35], and energy harvesting from the radio frequency
    (RF) source, etc [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. This fastest-growing
    technology needs to be robust with the feature of maximum security, maximum efficiency,
    timely connectivity, and minimum operating power [44]. This prompted us to implicate
    GT in WC which is similar to conciliate the connection among the nodes in spite
    of their rational behaviors for optimizing spectrum, power, and available resources.
    GT models are proliferated in many areas of WC like interference management and
    signal processing [45], for making intelligent decisions in order to provide desired
    secrecy, optimum price decisions, resource and spectrum allocation with the constraints
    of power [46] and energy. The concept of Nash equilibrium (NE) or Stackelberg
    equilibrium (SE) is applied for optimization of any network. This review emphasizes
    on the diversified applications of GT in WC like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
    [47], [48], [49], [50], non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks [51], cyber–physical
    systems (CPS) [52], mmWave [53], vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) [22], [27],
    [54], anti-jamming [55], multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) [56], fifth-generation
    (5G) [57], [58], cloud computing [24], [25] and so on. The learning behavior of
    the players or nodes through Q-learning [59], deep learning [60], and reinforcement
    learning [61] further improvises the performance of GT based WC. GT is used to
    resolve various issues related to security, energy harvesting (EH), resource allocation,
    price sharing, reliability, and efficiency of a wireless network. Various techniques
    of WC such as frequency hopping (FH) [62], [63], power controlling [64], cooperative
    anti-jamming, friendly relaying, and jamming [65] combined with the GT framework
    to resolve and analyze the security issues of WC. It is used in applications like
    internet of things (IoT) [21], [23], [32], [59], MIMO [66], [67], cooperative
    communication [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], cellular communication

    of future generation wireless communication. Likewise, wireless nodes require
    energy to operate and this energy demand becomes insatiable with an increase in
    the number of nodes. So, EH by nodes from the nearby RF sources is used to overcome
    this problem. Simultaneously, the intermediate nodes provide security in addition
    to EH. To get optimum results in both domains, the GT models are used in applications
    like CRN [91], [92], [93], WSN [30], [94], [95], [96], [97], cooperative communication
    [98], [99], [100], IoT [101], NOMA [102], multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) [103], [104], CPS [105], device-to-device
    (D2D) [106], secret-key generation [107], V2V [108], etc. The nodes in WC are
    rational in nature, i.e. no one participates in the system without any incentive.
    The optimal prices borne by the nodes are determined by various GT models in different
    applications like cooperative communication [109], [110], cellular communication
    [111], UAV [112], CRN [113], V2V [114], [115], wireless ad hoc networks [116],
    CPS [117], IoT [118], 5G [119], etc. There is a scarcity of available spectrum
    however, seamless and secured transmission is required to support spectrum sharing.
    GT proves to be a pivotal tool in various applications such as CRN [120], [121],
    RF/free space optical communication (FSO) hybrid communication [122], cellular
    communication [123], machine-to-machine (M2M) [124], D2D [125], Fog radio access
    network (RAN) [126], [127], mmWave [53], IoT [128], 5G [129], peer to peer networks
    [130] etc. Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) have been used to address the critical
    issues of coverage and capacity in 5G and 6G wireless networks. As a result, building
    a realistic mathematical model for optimizing the 6G UDNs is critical. In order
    to enhance the UDN performance, Bui et al. in [131] properly explored issues and
    challenges that were raised while implementing UDNs. Furthermore, the joint optimum
    strategy of real-time optimization and game theory (ROG) is proposed which is
    a powerful tool for solving large-scale UDN optimization problems with low complexity.
    Moreover, the GT models are also used in various applications related to dynamic
    or decentralized power allocation [49], [127], [132], [133], [134], [135], [136].
    The Reliability of the WC system depends on its outage probability. Further, the
    efficiency determines the system’s performance to obtain the desired output with
    the given input. Both of these parameters are appropriately handled by GT in various
    domains like MIMO [137], wireless charging V2V [138], NOMA based Mobile edge computing
    (MEC) [6], WSNs [139], D2D [140], and wireless ad hoc networks [141]. The GT models
    are used to provide the most appropriate coverage area within limited resources
    used in applications such as cellular communication [142], D2D communication [143],
    IoT [144], and MIMO [145]. With the increase in the number of subscribers, the
    interference increases and hence, the quality of service (QoS) of the network
    decreases. Sawyer et al. [146] proved that the implementation of the GT framework
    provides promising results to resolve the above mentioned issue. Although the
    existing wireless networks support features such as automation, programmability,
    modularity, and network slicing. However, mobile devices are progressively being
    modified to support critical machine-type communication (MTC) and massive MTC.
    The massive MTC leverages smart buildings, logistics tracking and fleet management,
    smart meters, smart agriculture, capillary network etc. The critical MTC leverages
    traffic safety control, remote manufacturing, surgery, wearable sensors, industrial
    application, and control. The IoT ecosystem with broadband and media provides
    everywhere and anytime services, smart vehicles transport and infrastructure,
    and critical control of remote devices. This key technology imbibed with artificial
    intelligence (AI) can smartly manage the huge volume of devices with ultra reliability,
    low latency, and fully connected real-time communication [147], [148]. For instance,
    these features are incorporated in home enterprises, combined mobile interfaces,
    wireless and fixed services, virtual reality, and augmented reality. The AI techniques
    like machine learning, deep learning, and Q-learning combined with GT framework
    make the device intelligent enough to take the right decisions in order to obtain
    optimized power with minimum delay. The combined approaches of GT with Q-learning
    techniques to support future generation networks are demonstrated in Refs. [55],
    [59], [60], [61], [123], [149], [150], [151], [152], [153]. Furthermore, the GT
    can be efficiently applied in future generation networks as illustrated in Fig.
    1. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of
    GT based WC which addresses the important features of WC like security, EH, profit,
    reliability, efficiency, interference, and network coverage which has not been

    games formulated in wireless networks. Every game is associated with the number
    of players, their strategies, payoffs, and final decisions for the equilibrium
    state as shown in Fig. 2. The payoff associated with the players depends not only
    on its own strategy but also influenced by the other player’s strategy. Hence
    in every game, the strategies, payoffs, and the output are mutually dependent.
    The games are classified as cooperative or non-cooperative, static or dynamic,
    complete information or incomplete information game, and zero sum or non-zero
    sum games. Based on various situations, the game is chosen by the players or any
    entity having decision making capability to handle different situations with alternative
    strategies in order to maximize the reward or punishment. Download : Download

    of review work. 2.1. Games associated with wireless communication The Mathematical
    model based on game theory can be formulated, where the agents’ discord and cooperation
    are considered. An agent is rational and the probabilistic assignment which may
    be subjective or objective over the events in the actions is taken to maximize
    the expected payoffs. Earlier game theory was mostly used in economics, political
    science, and human behavior. However, nowadays, it is also applied in computer
    science and wireless networks where the nodes are treated as players and the plan
    of actions is defined in order to increase their benefits. GT attains its application
    in wireless networks from the 1990s in internet services for the pricing policy
    then in a later year it was used in nanoeconomics, routing and resource allocation
    in order to improvise network traffic. Game theory improves network performance
    as well as the efficiency of wireless networks. For a better understanding, the
    subsequent section discuss various games applied in wireless communication and
    their classifications in detail. 2.1.1. Cooperative game The cooperative game
    requires mutual agreement among the players or agents. The agreement needs to
    be self-enforcing in nature. The joint action by the group results in collective
    payoffs. The cooperative games can be further categorized into bargaining game,
    repeated game, and coalition game. The Bargaining game A bargaining game is one
    in which two (or more) players play and they need the fraction of benefits. A
    deal is accomplished in the Nash Bargaining game, where on request, the resource
    (bandwidth or power) is granted according to the availability. It is widely used
    in multi-hop wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) for improving QoS and fairness
    of resource allocation. By using co-operative relaying, this game can maximize
    the performance of the utility function to achieve bargaining NE. Further, it
    can be used to obtain optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [47], [93], [116]. The
    Repeated game The repeated game is also called a stage game or iterated game.
    It involves the interaction between two individual players playing repeatedly.
    In each stage, the player’s action is noted to determine the subsequent action
    of the next player. Depending on the number of stages and rounds, the game is
    further subdivided into finite and infinite repetitive games. The finite repetitive
    game is played for particular duration and thereafter, it is solved by backward
    induction. However, the infinite repetitive game is played for infinite rounds
    and cannot be solved by backward induction. In every stage, the results are different
    and their subsequent strategies are also different [154]. The Coalition game According
    to the coalition game, the players in a group perform better as compared to the
    individual players. The objective is to maximize mutual outcome, where the mutual
    benefit is defined by coalition value. It helps in sharing the cost for the network
    design and the delay cost of queue for routing the traffic. Furthermore, it provides
    a solution for false alarms, energy conservation, early attack prediction, and
    selfish behavior detection [53], [124], [125], [143], [145]. 2.1.2. Non-cooperative
    game A non-cooperative game is a game where the competition occurs among individual
    players in the absence of any external authority. In addition, each player plays
    rationally in order to maximize its own payoff. It is sub-categorized into zero-sum
    game, Stackelberg game, Bertrand game, Bayesian game (BG), Evolutionary Game,
    etc. They are widely used to regulate security-related issues and resource allocation
    to improve the performance of any network [58], [64], [127]. The Zero-sum game
    The Zero-sum game is played between two players where one player maximizes its
    gain while the other minimizes its losses. The utility of one player in terms
    of profit or loss is balanced by the utility of other player’s loss or profit,
    respectively. The algebraic sum of the utility of both the players is zero. Here,
    the total utility factor remains constant during the game. The utility of zero-sum
    game is a combination of energy consumption, probability of malicious nodes, and
    probability of dropped packets. In addition to maximize the transmission capacity,
    it mitigates the action of jammer, helps in routing and security against external
    intruders [51], [59], [67], [151]. The Stackelberg game It is formulated between
    two or more than two players in a hierarchical manner. One player leads the game
    by choosing certain action and the second player follows the leader’s actions.
    This is widely used to mitigate eavesdropping and jamming attacks. In this game,
    the defender acts as a leader and attacker acts as a follower or vice-versa. The
    attacker aims to disrupt the transmitted data stream. The utility function of
    a legitimate player is maximized with the aim to increase its power and signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) with minimum transmission cost. The network optimization is obtained
    at the SE [21], [29], [32], [34], [44], [55], [61], [65], [69], [70], [72], [73],
    [74], [77], [78], [82], [83], [85], [91], [92], [96], [97], [102], [104], [108],
    [109], [111], [113], [114], [119], [121], [126], [129], [133], [134], [136], [146],
    [150], [155], [156]. The Stochastic game The stochastic game is one of the dynamic
    games that are played in a sequence of stages based on a probabilistic transition
    by one or more players. The state of the game is random and depends on the previous
    player’s actions. It is formulated between service providers and network operators
    to provide desirable QoS. The NE is determined by spectrum management and network
    operators [124], [137], [149], [157]. The Bayesian game In the Bayesian game,
    the players have incomplete information while executing their actions. Here, a
    player can estimate the other players’ payoffs to perform probabilistic based
    intrusion detection for wireless nodes [31], [55], [70], [82], [91]. The Evolutionary
    game This is fundamentally applied to biological networks in which the players
    combine pure and mixed strategies with rational behavior to enhance the population
    characteristics with the increase in the number of species. Evolutionary game
    theory helps in learning the adaption for survival. It is used to enhance the
    cooperation in static and mobile multi-class wireless nodes, where each class
    is managed by a different authority [26], [27], [144], [158]. The Mean field game
    Game theory which is applied to the analysis of differential games with infinite
    players is known as mean-field game (MFG). This term is coined from the mathematical
    physics which is based on the behavior of many identical particles. In this game,
    each player has a state, a set of actions, and a control policy. For a pre-defined
    time, the control policy maps every state into action. The MFG considers the collective
    behavior of all the players. Thus, at each step of the game, the mean-field is
    simply the fraction of players at every state in contrast to the traditional games.
    This technique is used by UAV-GCS (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Ground Communication
    Systems) to overcome the cumulative interference from other link and determine
    the payoff function [47], [48], [142]. The Bertrand game The Bertrand game model
    helps in pricing decisions based on the interdependence of rivals or players in
    a game in an oligopoly market. Oligopoly is defined as the condition where only
    a few sellers (i.e., oligopolists) manage a special market. In the considered
    market, the sellers take part in competition independently in order to achieve
    their targets (i.e., maximize profit) by managing the performance or the price
    of the product in the competition. Each seller’s decision is impacted by the actions
    of other sellers. In a Bertrand game, the target of one seller is influenced by
    its competent sellers. In non-cooperative WC, nodes are selfish in nature, the
    intermediate nodes try to maximize their profits with the knowledge of the strategies
    of other sources using a Bertrand game [71], [110]. The Potential game The potential
    game describes the specific behavior of payoff functions using potential function.
    A potential function keeps track of changes in the reward when one of the players
    deviates. This games has recently got a lot of attention considering various variants
    including generalized ordinal, precise, and weighted potential games [49], [50],
    [65], [106], [112], [159], [160], [161]. 3. Application areas of GT in wireless
    communication This study reveals the applications of GT in various fields of WC
    as shown in Fig. 2. On the basis of a recent study, 41.6 billion IoT devices require
    internet connectivity which will generate 79.4 zetta bytes (ZB) of data by 2025
    [162]. However, it is difficult to support the huge volume of data through existing
    technology. Therefore, sixth-generation (6G) communication is the main focus of
    researchers nowadays [163], [164]. The review work summarizes various technologies
    based on 5G which adopted GT for their optimization. IoT ecosystem features the
    communication among different objects, devices, machines, humans or animals with
    internet facility. Due to this IoT ecosystem, there is an escalation in the data
    traffic which causes trade-off between capacity and available spectrum. The mmWave
    technology addresses a wide spectrum from 30 GHz to 300 GHz. Another paradigm
    of next-generation network is D2D or M2M communication where information is transmitted
    among devices or machines directly with or without RF signal. This increases the
    spectral efficiency, throughput, and reduces latency and energy consumption of
    the network [165]. MIMO is the spatial modulation technique utilizing the multiple
    antennas at different positions of transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). Due to
    this, multiple copies of the same signal are transmitted thereby, minimizing the
    fading probability and BER. Another important concept in this series is NOMA,
    multiple access scheme which shares time, frequency, and space of the spectrum.
    It uses superposition coding at the Tx and successive interference cancellation
    (SIC) technique for decoding the multiple signals at the Rx. To include fairness
    in transmission, the user with higher channel gain is allocated lesser power and
    the user with lower channel gain is allocated comparatively higher power. This
    multiple access RF technique provides higher spectral efficiency and massive connectivity
    with low latency [166], [167]. The UAV is a flying base station (BS) which supports
    ground BS to increase the coverage area, security, and efficiency of WC network
    [168], [169], [170], [171]. The V2V communication transmits information among
    vehicles, traffic signals, road side units (RSU) using multi-hop adhoc communication
    called VANET. It is feasible due to the GPS navigation system with road sensors
    which send information about traffic, road condition, and location to assist the
    traffic management and route optimization. It reduces traffic congestion and road
    accidents. Similarly, autonomous driving coined as Vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
    communication, provides high reliability and fast communication by the integration
    of V2V, vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle to people (V2P), and vehicle
    to network (V2N) communication. Blockchain is the trusted decentralization of
    the database which is now adopted in 5G for securing and managing the data. In
    this, the information of the network is stored in every computer to avoid breakdown
    or security breach, unlike the failures in a centralized system. The data remains
    available after proper authentication, validation, and consensus [172]. In order
    to improvise the system’s performance based on the above-mentioned technologies,
    we can effectively apply various game theory algorithms to address the different
    challenges discussed in the forthcoming sections in detail. 3.1. Privacy and security
    As WC is an open-air wide network which is more vulnerable to attacks and eavesdropping
    due to increase in the number of users. The following sub-sections discuss the
    physical layer security and privacy related issues in detail. Download : Download

    security using cooperative communication. 3.1.1. Physical layer security The invasion
    can be dare either by internal agents or external agents. Further, it can be active
    eavesdropper including jamming with wiretapping or passive eavesdropping due to
    wiretapping only. This security breach becomes more prominent in heterogeneous
    high-speed communication. So, security parameters like confidentiality, privacy,
    authentication etc. gain significant importance in high-speed WC. The secrecy
    capacity is an important parameter to evaluate the performance of any secured
    system. In the vicinity of an eavesdropper, secrecy capacity specifies the maximum
    rate of information transmitted between the source and legitimate user or destination.
    With the advancement in technology, the malicious eavesdropping node subterfuges
    the legitimate link and reduces the secrecy capacity of the system. Earlier, cryptographic
    techniques [173] with the key exchange were widely used but it increases the complexity
    and redundancy of system. In addition, they are more vulnerable to eavesdropping
    attacks especially, when the keys are not exchanged in real-time scenarios. So,
    physical layer security (PLS) introduced by Wyner [174] attains great importance.
    Wyner manifested that high secrecy capacity is obtained in a better channel condition
    between the legitimate links without using any keying techniques as compared to
    unauthorized access where link condition deteriorates by eavesdropping or jamming.
    The physical layer security using cooperative communication becomes the promising
    candidate due to its high efficiency, low power consumption, broad coverage area,
    high diversity gain, high reliability, high capacity, low latency, etc. Hence,
    cooperative communication becomes the addendum tool to the conventional encryption-based
    security system. A form of cooperative communication by relaying and jamming using
    artificial noise (AN) can be used to overcome the active eavesdropping as shown
    in Fig. 3. The selection of relays and jammers must be done with confidentiality,
    otherwise, the eavesdropper can use the coordinated beamforming to hamper the
    secured transmission of the system [7]. The different techniques adopted to overcome
    jamming are frequency hopping, power control, and reactive transmission [175].
    GT not only counteracts external intruders but also detects malicious nodes and
    selfish nodes. Jamming attacks now become smarter due to artificial intelligence
    (AI) which creates more of a problem to the existing wireless system. The issues
    with anti-jamming become more complicated due to adversarial characteristics,
    incomplete information constraints, dynamics, uncertainty, dense deployment, and
    heterogeneous feature of the wireless networks. The dynamic anti-jamming technique
    is used to improve the defense mechanism of the system [8]. The power control
    game with incomplete information and anti-jamming channel selection in dense wireless
    networks are adopted to increase the transmission rate [55]. The value of expected
    weighted aggregate interference and jamming (EWAIJ) decreases with the increase
    in number in order to address dynamic and incomplete information of the network
    randomly. The two resource sharing schemes proposed in [20] are security-oriented
    users (SeUs) and regular users (ReUs). These schemes address a mathematical program
    with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and equilibrium programs with equilibrium
    constraints (EPEC) for single and multiple leaders, respectively. In the existing
    literature, the issues of security are addressed with GT to combat the effect
    of eavesdropping in order to obtain the desired efficiency, payoff, and availability
    of the system. The subsequent subsections explain the brief overview of areas
    addressed by GT in WC, such as MIMO, UAV, NOMA, cognitive radio network (CRN),
    cooperative communication etc. Moreover, different games with their findings and
    issues related to physical layer security are listed in Tables 1(a), 1(b), and
    1(c). (a) Cooperative communication. In the wireless networks multi- objective
    problems arise due to anti-jamming in cooperative communication, as the source
    strives for maximizing its data rate and eavesdropper to maximize wiretapping.
    However, relays and jammers aim to benefit themselves by maximizing their profits
    against their services. The nodes/agents in WC sell or share their resources similar
    to trading in the game. The incentives for relay nodes are decided on the basis
    of games played and challenges associated with it. Ghose et al. [10] also proved
    that the proactive relay selection scheme is harmful to the system as it increases
    SOP without changing the diversity order. The SOP is reduced by using the jamming
    power estimation technique to confuse the eavesdropping node [68]. The full-duplex
    (FD) active eavesdropper performs wiretapping and jamming simultaneously. However,
    it requires complex hardware to perform both actions with high risk of self-exposure.
    The jammer is incentivized to mitigate the wiretapping by any malicious node in
    order to achieve the desired QoS. This low complex AN method works for multiple-input-single-output
    (MISO) systems [75]. Game theory is applied to optimize the ergodic secrecy capacity
    using NE by considering the minimum power allocation factor, jammer’s optimal
    position, and jamming power. Likewise, Huang et al. [64] proposed a two-player
    non-cooperative game to examine the power decision process between the transmitter
    and eavesdropper. From the utility function of both players and Karush-Kuhn–Tucker
    (KKT) condition, the best response power function is determined. Similarly in
    [69], the investigators discussed framework for SG for the FD active eavesdropper.
    Here, the eavesdropper is the leader and a legitimate user is the follower. The
    optimal transmission strategy and jamming strategy for single channel and multichannel
    cases, respectively are proposed. Furthermore, Fang et al. [74] considered a PLS
    of the system which consists of one transmitter, multiple relays, and one FD active
    eavesdropper. To increase the secrecy capacity, the authors proposed a three-stage
    SG model and determined SE. Likewise, in [70] the authors analyzed the utility
    for a three-stage SG, where users act as leaders, relays act as vice-leaders,
    and jammer acts as a follower, considering incomplete information and the observation
    error. Similarly, for the multi-users and multi-channel communication, the authors
    proposed the idea of “No Pains No Gains” for an anti-jamming problem [65]. The
    proposed model addresses the cooperative anti-jamming problem with multi-leaders
    and one-follower SG. The throughput for the multi-user and multi-channel is enhanced
    by using the channel bonding technique. Further, Wang et al. [71] used the strategy
    to select the jammer for broadcasting the AN and relay to re-transmit the source
    signal from intermediate nodes to improvise the secrecy capacity of the system.
    A new particle swarm with a simulated annealing optimization algorithm is employed
    to obtain the solution of pricing and node selection. Wu et al. [119] investigated
    the maximum secrecy capacity for the multiple-input-single-output multiple antenna-eavesdropper
    (MISOME) to wiretap the channel with randomly located multiple jammers to assist
    multi-antenna BS. In the presence of jammer, the maximum secrecy sum-rate achieved
    is about 5.29 dB higher than the case without any jammer’s assistance. Gao et
    al. [62] introduced the anti-jamming technique for wireless communication in the
    presence of a jammer using bimatrix and non-bimatrix games. Quadratic programming
    is implemented to represent the relationship between the NE solution and the global
    optimal solution. In this method, the legitimate link and the jammer employ a
    pseudo-random frequency hopping sequence for information transmission and interference,
    respectively. When the frequency bands of entities overlap, the jammer injects
    additive interference into the legitimate channel. Further, the optimal frequency
    hopping strategy affects the payoffs of the entities and thereby, improving the
    performance by offering better jamming resistance. For a separate jammer and eavesdropper
    in cooperative communication, Luo et al. [13] considered a scenario where Gaussian
    jammer and a friendly eavesdropper are used for a broadcast channel for two-receivers.
    In this scenario, the eavesdropper acts friendly and sends a jamming signal (Gaussian
    codebooks) using compress and forward (CF) technique to the receiver to reduce
    the jamming effect. Table 1(b). Physical layer security contd.. Application Author

    connected through the internet in IoT as illustrated in Fig. 4. This smart system
    processes, controls, and makes intelligent decisions for the exchange of information
    globally. Hu et al. [19] investigated the security of the downlink transmission
    from the controller to the actuator for IoT communication using cooperative jamming.
    It reduces SOP with minimum secrecy rate. The four different attacking scenarios
    of an eavesdropper: silent attack, eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing are considered
    in [59]. A power control strategy based on the Q-based learning technique is proposed
    showing significant results for the different attacking scenarios. The authors
    in [21] considered a decentralized IoT environment with peer legal devices, unauthorized
    devices (eavesdroppers), and selfish helper jamming devices (jammers), and present
    a unique incentive jamming-based safe routing mechanism using SG. The suggested
    routing method is individually rational, robust, decentralized, and computationally
    efficient. (c) Cellular communication. Cellular communication is based on the
    geographical coverage area, inter-cell, and intra-cell communication. The LTE
    network installs M2M communication and D2D communication used in telemedicine,
    IoT, VANET etc., as shown in Fig. 5, which reduces the latency, energy consumption,
    and traffic of the network. This system provides efficient spectrum usage and
    high throughput. This section addresses the application of GT in the area of security
    for cellular communication, M2M communication, and D2D communication. Download

    D2D/M2M communication. The two-level SG in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers
    is presented by Wu et al. in [77]. The macro base station (MBS) makes use of small
    base station (SBS) to jam the eavesdropper’s operation. The secrecy performance
    of a multi-antenna cellular network is discussed by Wang et al. [78], where the
    eavesdropper acts smartly and adapts itself from passive to active based on its
    position from the BS. In the discussed framework, the independent Poisson point
    process is implicated with SG, where the eavesdropper and the BS become leader
    and follower, respectively. The secrecy transmission probability reduces by 56%
    due to the adaptive nature of eavesdroppers. In [14] the security of heterogeneous
    D2D cellular networks with multiple users and the multiple friendly jammers are
    used to combat the actions of the eavesdropper. Luo et al. [79] proposed the best
    response (BR)-based hierarchical power control algorithm and a robust learning
    method for D2D security in the presence of both perfect and imperfect information.
    To ensure the security of cellular networks Rudenko et al. [80] investigated a
    system resource allocation scheme using an extensive game-based algorithm with
    high efficiency and less overhead. Also, the secrecy capacity (SC) between cellular
    users (CUs) and D2D users (DUs) is obtained with optimized resource allocation.
    Further, the security of ad hoc D2D network using friendly jammer is determined
    by minimizing SOP and connection outage probability (COP) [15]. In order to improve
    the security of the cellular system without CSI, Zhang et al. [16] proposed cooperative
    jamming in two stages. In the first stage, the spherical location of the eavesdropper
    is considered by estimating the channel. Further in the second stage, a semi-definite
    relaxation (SDR) search method using semi-definite programming (SDP) is used to
    maximize the secrecy rate. It decomposes the primal problem into a ratio of interference
    from the eavesdropper to the legitimate user transmitted by jammers. In research
    paper [150], the observation and rationality factors are considered ranging from
    0 to 1. Likewise, for the fixed area with unknown CSI of the eavesdropper, Huang
    et al. [18] investigated security with a cooperative jammer and proposed a superimposed
    jamming scheme to minimize the synthetic jamming power to the intended receiver
    in addition to interference to the nearby users. In the vicinity of a co-channel
    interference, Li et al. [17] proposed techniques for multi-user environments where
    security and reliability (SRT) trade-off occurs in the presence of an eavesdropper.
    Further, the intercept and outage probability results reveal that the proposed
    technique i.e. joint optimal user and optimal jammer selection (JOU-OJS) outperforms
    the traditional multi-user scheduling (TMUS) scheme with and without the availability
    of CSI of an eavesdropper. Moreover, the secrecy outage probability (SOP) is derived
    in [7] using the exhaustive search method. The power allocation for the joint
    overlay and underlay cognitive radio is proposed in [177]. (d) Q-learning and
    reinforcement learning. The ‘Q’ in Q-learning stands for quality. It is a learning
    algorithm specifying an action or strategy to be taken in a particular environment.
    The payoff or reward is used to provide the reinforcement as shown in Fig. 6.
    The authors proposed a Q-learning based power allocation scheme against the eavesdropping
    and jamming attacks for the highly random and dynamic environment of WC [149].
    The findings show that even in the presence of multiple smart attackers, the achieved
    secrecy data rate reaches up to 1.7 b/s/Hz. Likewise, a learning scheme is also
    proposed by Li et al. [151]. Here, the number of antennas at the transmitter are
    used to combat the attacker’s action. Through smart tuning, the antennas are used
    for beamforming and filtering to mitigate the eavesdropper’s action at the Tx
    and Rx end. Download : Download high-res image (118KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Q-learning or reinforcement learning. Xiao et al. [60] proposed
    a reinforcement based Q-learning power allocation strategy for the UAV against
    a smart attacker. Here, the attack model and channel model both are considered
    unknown. For the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes,
    the authors implemented prospect theory (PT) based on the probability weighing
    and value function to model the subjective decision. Thereafter, Q-learning and
    deep learning are combined to accelerate the learning speed. Through this learning
    and trial-and-error, the optimal UAV power allocation strategy using a Markov
    decision process (MDP) is derived. Furthermore, a WoLF-PHC (Win or Learn Faster-Policy
    Hill Climbing) based power allocation algorithm has been used to target the uncertainties
    in the UAV transmission to mislead the smart attackers. To further accelerate
    the learning, a deep Q-network (DQN) based power allocation strategy is used.
    The results reveal that the safe rate of the DQN-based strategy is 93% that is
    7% and 11% higher than the WoLFPHC and Q-learning based schemes, respectively.
    A reinforcement learning method proposed in [61] analyzed closed-form expressions
    for both complete and incomplete information at the source. (e) MIMO. MIMO provides
    a high data rate due to spatial multiplexing (SM) as shown in Fig. 7. The multiple
    antennas with smart signal processing increase the spectral efficiency and throughput
    with reduced radiated power. Further, the diversity of the system is improved
    by beam steering. In order to overcome the effect of external eavesdropping in
    MIMO system, Siyari et al. [56] has proposed transmit-based friendly jamming (TxFJ)
    interference which restricts the eavesdropper by sending a misleading signal generated
    by the legitimate transmitter. In the considered system, each link acts as a player
    in the game and implements non-cooperative GT with a distributed method to maximize
    the sum of secrecy rates using robust friendly jamming control algorithm. Findings
    reveal that the robust friendly jamming approach is 25% better than the greedy
    approach. Download : Download high-res image (191KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. MIMO communication. Similarly, Abdalzaher et al. [66] discussed
    a framework for mitigating the effect of jamming in uplink massive MIMO using
    linear zero-forcing jamming suppression (ZFJS) and minimum mean-squared error
    based jamming suppression (MMSE-JS) estimator for channel training. Results show
    that by using these techniques the system becomes more robust against jamming
    attacks. The authors investigated security for the MIMO radar systems [67]. To
    improve the performance of radar system, polarization states (deceptive jamming
    suppression in the main lobe) of transmit waveforms are controlled. The researchers
    investigated security in wireless multi-casting for a relay aided MIMO system
    in [9] for passive adaptive eavesdropping. Among the group of relays, the best
    relay is selected to transmit the source information with and without the friendly
    jammer using Monte Carlo simulation. (f) Cyber physical system. The CPS is the
    embedded system formed by the integration of the digital controlling unit for
    physical devices. It provides real-time communication with smart computing techniques
    as shown in Fig. 8. To obtain the maximum utility from the source or sensor, the
    optimal strategy is determined via adjusting the sensor’s transmission power.
    To achieve the SE, a stochastic algorithm with feedback (SAF) and a renewed intelligent
    simulated annealing (RISA) algorithm is proposed by Wang et al. [85]. In this
    game, the sensors are leaders and the jammer is a follower. The authors investigated
    the problem to provide a secured transmission between sensors and controller through
    wireless networks in the presence of malicious eavesdropper and jammer in the
    CPS using SG. In [52] the considered system, after gaining the knowledge of the
    sensor’s transmission power, the jammer decides its optimal power strategy to
    hamper secured communication. Furthermore, to maximize the utility, the sensor
    adjusts its transmission power through the controlled feedback. Download : Download

    system. (g) UAV. UAV provides strong line-of-sight communication from the air
    to ground wireless link which is used for high-speed, cost-effective, wide-coverage,
    and high mobility data communication as shown in Fig. 9 [171]. However, it is
    more vulnerable to eavesdropping over a large area on the ground. Therefore, to
    ensure the confidentiality of UAV communications against malicious eavesdropping
    attacks, the authors proposed a cooperative scheme to control the trajectory and
    enhance the security of UAV communication [168]. In the presence of randomly deployed
    non-cooperative UAV eavesdroppers (UEDs), Tang et al. [169] investigated a piece-wise
    fitting model of the air to ground (ATG) link compared to the existing sigmoid
    fitting. In addition, the UAV jammer is used to combat the UEDs, where the secured
    connection probability (SCP) is determined on the basis of the jammer’s height
    and location. The SCP for the specified configuration can be increased by 75%
    by activating the UAV based jammer. The researchers also proposed [170] a low-complexity
    iterative algorithm to maximize the intercept probability security region (IPSR)
    similar to the three dimensional exhaustive search (3DES) technique with less
    computational overhead. Proposed scheme requires only 2.6% of the execution time
    as compared to 3DES. Xu et al. [82] investigated the anti-jamming transmission
    problem in the presence of co-channel interference. A Bayesian Stackelberg game,
    where UAVs (users) act as followers and the jammer as a leader is proposed. A
    sub-gradient based Bayesian Stackelberg iterative algorithm is implemented to
    obtain SE. Due to the imperfect CSI in the multiple-input-single-output multiple-eavesdropper
    (MISOME), Chen et al. [81] used a UAV enabled friendly jammer. Without interfering
    with legitimate receiver, the secrecy rate is maximized with AN beamforming. Download

    UAV communication. (h) mmWave. A high data rate and dense connectivity can be
    provided due to ample availability of the spectrum in mmWave. To reduce propagation
    losses, beamforming with large antenna arrays can be used as shown in Fig. 10.
    A GT framework is also used to analyze a passive eavesdropping attack in millimeter
    wave (mmWave) based wireless personal area networks (WPAN) [86]. A game is played
    among the devices behaving as defenders and attackers. The devices are equipped
    with directional antennas with perfect CSI. Based on the prior knowledge of probability,
    each player selects its strategy. The results of the proposed work reveal the
    effects of using directional antennas and the prior probability of transmitters
    for determining the NE. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download :

    overlay networks, continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) for dynamic spectrum access
    by SU and PU is developed by Yao et al. [83]. Due to the self-seeking behavior
    of players, a cooperative jamming approach is proposed. In addition, an artificial
    noise-based jamming scheme is proposed for secondary users. In this method, the
    information about CSI of the eavesdropper is necessary. When the primary user
    transmits data, then the secondary user switches to the AN based jammer. The selection
    combining (SC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) diversity schemes are implemented
    by Chopra et al. [84]. According to the results shown, the MRC at the source–destination
    (SD) link and SC at the eavesdropper link provides the best performance. However,
    for higher secrecy rates, SC system performs better than the MRC system. It is
    also proved that the direct link between source and eavesdropper is more vital
    than the source and destination link. 3.1.2. Security and threats A security threat
    is a harmful act that seeks to corrupt or steal data by disrupting the communication.
    A security incident is an occurrence in which a company’s data or network is potentially
    exposed. Moreover, various games, their findings and issues related to security
    and threats are listed in Table 2. (a) IoV, IIoT, and IoT. As the RSU runs with
    static settings, an adversary assesses the RSU’s vulnerabilities and conduct strikes
    for threatening the IoV’s privacy. The attackers have a strong position in this
    asymmetrical situation, making it difficult to adequately defend. The authors
    in [22] used the moving target defence (MTD) to dynamically alter the RSU’s IP
    address based on the differential game strategy thereby, increasing the difficulty
    of the attacker. Authors in [23] proposed pragmatic and efficient power perturbation
    strategy to mitigate the threat of practical received signal strength (RSS)-based
    adversarial localization attack for the industrial internet of things (IIoT).
    The numerical results demonstrated that the learning process successfully improves
    the network throughput by the power perturbation approach. An IoT device is more
    susceptible to attacks as it operates in the public domain and is also less equipped
    with security devices due to its miniature size. So, Liu et al. [32] proposed
    resource constraint cyber security IoT system based on SG model. The open and
    closed loop NE for the optimal allocation of resources are determined. (b) Cloud
    computing and CE-IoV (Cloud enabled-Internet of vehicle). In today’s world, securing
    cloud data in a shared environment is a critical responsibility for IT companies.
    Hence, at the computational level, there is a need to improve cloud security and
    the security at virtual machine (VM) level. The authors in [90] demonstrated lack
    of VM placement for abating side channel attack (SCA). It is a survey on current
    SCA which proposed game theory to be the best fit and bin packing method for optimum
    placement of VM. Furthermore, an enhanced evolutionary game theory (EGT) model
    is proposed to address dynamic attack protection. The incentive coefficient was
    utilized in [26] to extend the framework of EGT, which not only examines the evolutionary
    stability of two players but also the strategy selection and game performance
    of many players. Stackelberg Bayesian game is used to defend against Bayesian
    inference threats and motivate rational users to share their data for public health
    in a multi-cloud secure data architecture for infectious-disease analysis [25].
    The suggested effort facilitates involvement while simultaneously forming a broad
    privacy group, ensuring that each user’s data is “hidden in the crowd”. Results
    reveal that the average privacy loss reduces up to 28% for a modest aggregate
    size of 20 users. In [24], the Leila et al. presented a location based privacy-preserving
    solution for cloud computing, vehicular networks and the IoTs. To avoid tracking
    by the malicious attacker, the strategy is formulated based on cooperation, obfuscation,
    and silence. Using the GT method, the authors investigated its performance and
    robustness. The modeled Global Passive Attacker (GPA) uses four eavesdropping
    and linking attacks including semantic, syntactic, observation, and mapping linking
    attacks. The simulation results show that the solution is robust and resilient
    to the threats listed with a privacy level of 90% on an average. (c) VANET. For
    VANET, an intelligent defense behavior based on evolutionary games is proposed
    in [27] to protect against DoS attacks causing disruption of services, Sybil attacks,
    and black hole attacks. Before the game begins, none of the participants are aware
    of their opponent’s selected approach. They select the best approach based on
    probability in order to maximize their utilities. (d) WSN. The security of WSN-based
    CR against the spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack is addressed
    by Abdalzaher and Muta [29]. The attacker makes use of the interference signal
    to corrupt the delivery report sent by the sensor node (SN) to the fusion center
    (FC) to lead the game however, the attacker follows it. This maximizes the number
    of protected reports sent by the SNs to the FC which leads to an accurate decision
    of the spectrum status. A repeated game model in [28] is proposed to enhance clustered
    WSN-based IoT security against the selective forwarding (SF) attack. This model
    relies on the TDMA protocol to facilitate the detection process and to avoid collision
    between the delivered packets at the cluster head (CH). The proposed model aims
    to keep the transmission of packets: isotropic or non-isotropic form the cluster
    members (CMs) to the CH for maximizing the data transmission. (e) Blockchain.
    Blockchain, as shown in Fig. 11, is a decentralized technique, consisting of numerous
    blocks for data management. Using proper consensus, the various nodes exchange
    information by applying cryptographic algorithms. It is a trustworthy transaction
    which is widely adopted in IoT ecosystems. Khan et al. [30] proposed a double
    auction theory combined with blockchain technology to make the trading among transmitters,
    relays, and jammers. This technique is more transparent and trustworthy against
    the occurrence of any malicious activity in a WC system. They considered the player’s
    rationality, balancing of the budget, and trustworthiness in terms of payment
    and prices of the participant nodes in the network. The proposed work significantly
    mitigated various security attacks like replay, repudiation, brute force attacks
    etc. Table 2. Security and threats. Application Author & Year Game Algorithms/Methods

    Blockchain communication. A hierarchical game-based energy scheduling system was
    developed using cooperative wireless energy transfer mode to optimize the strategies
    of energy nodes, charging energy vehicles (EVs), and discharging EVs. To build
    a secure and efficient wireless charging based network, the authors combine blockchain
    technology and game theory. The cooperation and competition in vehicle energy
    networks (VENs) in motion is addressed in [34] by using dynamic wireless power
    transfer (DWPT) technology. Here, the energy capacity of energy storage devices
    (ESD) in every node varies from 100 to 250 kWh. The authors show that as the number
    of energy nodes increases the service cost reduces due to which the energy node
    lowers its bid price in order to win the auction, which is completed in less than
    4 ms in a competitive scenario. (f) V2V communication. Edge computing-based Internet
    of Vehicles (EC-IoV) is used for various activities like autonomous driving, augmented
    reality, and computational offloading. The SG is used to provide the incentive
    for EC-IoV, where RSUs act as leaders and the vehicles act as followers [31].
    The RSUs implanted in a hotspot region acts as the backbone for the network which
    handles packet forwarding and localized data processing between the service provider
    and mobile vehicles. The authors proposed a scheme for dummy traffic delivery
    of local vehicles to overcome the attacks at RSU hotspots. To encourage clients
    to participate in federated learning (FL) training, the system includes two game-theoretic
    techniques. Furthermore, the power of an antagonistic client is defined and limited,
    and data privacy is similarly ensured. Experiments on real-world data sets with
    different training models work effectively in the presence of adversarial clients
    [33]. The regional FL in IoV as the process of knowledge trading market based
    on smart contract for safety and efficiency has offered as an optimal competitive
    pricing approach based on non-cooperative game in [87] by Zou et al. The simulations

    BSs (masters) and employees are analyzed using stochastic Bayesian games as a
    direct stochastic first-price-sealed-bid (FPSB) auction. Furthermore, due to privacy,
    security, and communication constraints, players’ payoff functions and actions
    become blind to each other in a reward-based learning dynamics for continuous
    potential games. Convergence to NE is guaranteed by the suggested payoff-based
    learning dynamics method in [178] by Tan et al. for multi-agent system. 3.2. Energy
    harvesting Due to the tremendous increase in number of users, the energy required
    to operate the nodes or associated devices is unquenchable. So, energy harvesting
    (EH) through RF sources in wireless communication plays a pivotal role in order
    to fulfill this demand. The energy harvested by the intervening nodes not only
    increases the diversity gain of the system but also boosts the life span of the
    system, especially for restrained WC networks. It also reduces the operational
    cost of the system. There are two ways of EH in RF communication: Simultaneous
    Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) and Wireless Powered Communication
    Networks (WPCN). In WPCN, the node harvests energy from the RF source and then
    uses this harvested energy for further transmission. However in SWIPT, either
    a time switching or power splitting technique is used to harvest energy and transmit
    the information to another node simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 12. Moradian
    et al. [40] investigated wireless energy harvesting (WEH), which switches to different
    modes in time, that are EH and data decoding (DD). In order to increase throughput
    and reduce transmission delay, the static and dynamic (delay-optimal and throughput-optimal
    dynamic policies) techniques are proposed. The relay harvests energy both from
    the source and other RF environmental resources. To analyze the system and switching
    between the two modes, the Markovian and quasi-birth–death (QBD) processes are
    proposed. Li et al. [96] describe energy harvesting by eavesdropper from the source
    and the information is decoded using a power splitting SWIPT technique. In this
    paper, the eavesdropper tries to optimize its power splitting ratio ( ) to attain
    a maximum eavesdropping rate, while the source node optimizes the transmit power
    to maximize its sum secrecy rate. Providing high data rate services with reliable
    communication during travel such as railways, airways etc., is a major challenge.
    The issue is addressed by providing green communication using EH and energy-efficient
    resource allocation in D2D communication by Dai et al. [106]. This enhances the
    spectrum efficiency, system capacity, and also reduces load on small base stations
    (SBSs) in railway carriages. Likewise, a jammer harvests energy from the power
    station which is termed as green energy [73]. It is observed that the proposed
    algorithm in [73] attains SE by achieving lower SOP. Also, it consumes less power
    from the power station compared to the benchmark algorithm. In the upcoming technologies,
    centralized and distributed online power control schemes are developed using deep
    neural network (DNN) [152]. Download : Download high-res image (228KB) Download

    The issue of security along with EH from power transfer stations (PTOs) have been
    addressed using multiple sensors and relays in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers
    addressed by Nguyen et al. [35]. When an eavesdropper attacks the base station
    (BS), then the selected relay from multiple relays acts as a jammer to combat
    this attack. The author determined SOP after selecting the best jammer and relay.
    The secrecy capacity of the above-mentioned scheme is better than both the best-relay-and-random-jammer
    scheme and the random-relay-and-best-jammer scheme. Similarly, Hoang et al. [41]
    discussed the SOP of the system, where the intermediate node adopted a time switched
    based relaying protocol (TSR) to harvest energy from the source signal. It is
    demonstrated that the security of the system deteriorates if the harvesting time
    is greater than the information processing time. However, with the increase in
    the number of intermediate nodes, the security and efficiency of the system increases.
    The system performance deteriorates if the fraction block time ( ) tends to zero
    or one. Similarly, Rezgui et al. [63] proposed the EH to overcome the jamming
    attack without enhancing the spatial resources as in the DSSS and FHSS. The results
    reveal that EH is better at low signal to interference ratio (SIR). However at
    high SIR, jamming is failed to be overcomed by EH. However, by tuning the EH and
    transmission power time, the jamming becomes nullified. The authors use the zero-sum
    game and attain the NE. The subsequent section discusses the applications of WC
    where GT models are implemented to harvest energy in addition to the security
    of the system. Moreover, different games, their findings and issues related to
    EH and security are tabulated in Tables 3(a) and 3(b). 3.2.1. Two-way relay The
    two-way relaying efficiently saves bandwidth in the era of high resource constraint
    transmission systems. In order to maximize the secrecy capacity of the system,
    Lee et al. [43] determines the optimum power splitting parameter ( ) and time
    switching parameter ( ) for power splitting based two way relaying protocol (PS-TWR)
    and time switching in two way relaying protocol (TS-TWR), respectively. Moreover,
    PS-TWR outperforms TS-TWR against eavesdropping. Likewise, similar results are
    obtained in [36] using convex optimization. In [37], the outage probability is
    determined by two-way relay cooperative communication in the Nakagami- fading
    environment. At lower SNR regime, the results proclaim that EH using Amplify and
    forward (AF) relaying achieves full diversity gain and outperforms the conventional
    AF relay system. Download : Download high-res image (183KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Wireless sensor network. 3.2.2. WSN Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs) consist of a lattice of sensors that monitor the environmental or physical
    parameters and send this information to the server node or base station. This
    information can be retrieved or sent to the end-users through the internet from
    the base station as shown in Fig. 13. It addresses a dynamic network, where new
    devices or sensors can be added easily and can be used in surveillance, industrial
    control, processing units, and health monitoring systems. The energy harvesting
    wireless sensor node (EH-WSN) consists of multiple power stations, multiple sensor
    nodes, base station, a friendly jammer, multiple passive eavesdroppers etc. The
    system works in two stages. In the first stage, the power station transfers RF
    energy to the source and in the second stage, the source nodes transmit information
    to their BS, while a friendly jammer jams multiple eavesdroppers. Nguyen et al.
    [38] derived the closed-form expressions for existence probability of secrecy
    capacity and SOP. In order to provide physical layer security, an optimal sensor
    scheduling method has been implemented which outperforms in comparison to the
    conventional round-robin scheduling technique. The theoretical results are supported
    by Monte Carlo simulations. Similarly, the non-cooperative GT model has been used
    to optimize the energy of EH-WSN [94]. The nodes considered are homogeneous and
    uniformly distributed and harvest energy from their surroundings. The neighboring
    node’s RSSI (Received signal strength indicator) is used to wake up the nodes.
    The utility of the nodes are broadcasted to effectively manage their waking time
    and network traffic. The authors investigated a GT-based dynamic behavior monitoring
    scheme to provide security and energy conservation in WSN [95]. It is widely used
    in a hostile environment to protect the sensor network from various attacks, especially
    in the routing process. This trust-based secured technique increases the lifespan
    of the network. A wireless-powered multiantenna-multicasting has been investigated
    by Chu et al. [104]. To provide reliable communication in the presence of multiple
    eavesdroppers, power is supplied by multiple power beacons (PBs) which is further
    harvested by the transmitter. An SG is formulated to provide monetary incentives
    to the PBs in order to achieve secured communication. Similarly, Sarma et al.
    [97] harvest energy from the power beacon of multi-sensor nodes. The equilibrium
    is evaluated analytically for a single sensor node and the equilibrium strategies
    for multiple sensor nodes. Table 3(a). Energy harvesting. Application Author &

    Nguyen et al. [39] proposed an EH for the nodes deployed in a moving vehicle.
    The capacity of the considered system is improved by implementing NOMA. The source
    and relay in the proposed system harvest energy from the power beacon. Successive
    interference cancellation technique is implemented in NOMA for two different destinations
    in addition to energy harvesting. The end-to-end delay is significantly reduced.
    Further, the outage probability and ergodic capacity for both the destinations
    are determined. Results reveal that there is a significant gain in the system’s
    capacity of about 1.2 bits/s/Hz. 3.2.4. Internet on vehicle (IoV) An intelligent
    energy-harvesting framework (IEAF) based on vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications
    is proposed by Wang et al. [101]. The authors implemented a three-stage SG to
    maximize the utilities of both roadside units (RSUs) and electric vehicles (EVs)
    in V2I communications. The RSUs are placed along the side of roads to determine
    a location in order to provide services for autonomous driving. However, the RSUs
    are often battery enabled devices therefore, energy is harvested from solar and
    wind energy to serve the EVs. This work mainly focuses on two energy consumption
    components in IoV systems, battery-enabled RSUs and EVs. The different research
    aspects discussed for energy saving during RSU scheduling are: (1) Reduction of
    energy consumption by turning on and turn off in a periodic manner (2) Sending
    RSUs in sleep mode in case of insufficient energy and harvest the same from solar
    and wind (3) Vehicle-grid technology based EV charging, where EV not only purchases
    energy from the power grid but also sells energy. In addition, particle swarm
    optimization is implemented to incur the benefits of EVs and power grid (4) Wireless
    power transfer for EV using induction coil to receive electric power from the
    electromagnetic field. 3.2.5. CRN SWIPT based EH technique is adopted for CRN,
    where the EH node behaves as a malicious attacker and decodes the signal of secondary
    transmitter (ST) during the process of energy harvesting thereby, reducing the
    secrecy capacity [91]. Further, the network’s average secrecy capacity increases
    by 0.391 b/s/Hz. In order to formulate the problem among the STs with limited
    CSI, a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) is determined. Further, performance of
    BNE is proven better than NE for limited CSI. Similarly, GT is also used where
    EH and information decoding of the source is simultaneously carried out by the
    eavesdropper using convex optimization to reach the SE [92]. The eavesdropper
    harvests energy from secondary base station (SBS). Moreover, SBS tries to maximize
    the secrecy rate and minimizes its interference at the primary receiver (PR).
    Similarly, ST harvests energy from the RF source in addition to the implementation
    of sequential bargaining mechanism for sharing of spectrum with primary transmitter
    (PT) [93]. 3.2.6. NOMA The EH and jamming of eavesdroppers using the null steering
    beamforming technique for downlink NOMA communication system is demonstrated by
    Alsaba et al. [102]. The results of secrecy capacity show that this technique
    outperforms the AN technique as beamforming affects the targetted node in the
    desired direction only. Similarly, for the downlink NOMA system in [51], the two
    techniques: superposition coding (SC) for the base station and successive interference
    cancellation (SIC) for the strong users are implemented. This system consists
    of multi-antenna BS with two users per transmission slot, where the strong user
    wiretaps and decodes the information of the weak user. To overcome this problem,
    the weak user can introduce some AN to confuse the eavesdropper. The authors formulate
    a non-cooperative zero-sum game between the strong and weak user to obtain secrecy
    capacity. Further, to avoid eavesdropping, a pure and mixed-strategy NE is proposed.
    The AN aided security scheme enhances the secrecy performance of NOMA in comparison
    to the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. Moreover, imperfect
    or partial CSI scenarios by introducing robust secured algorithms are proposed
    as the future work. 3.2.7. Cooperative communication The authors discussed Nash
    BG of EH for wireless powered relay networks with one relay and multiple source–destination
    pairs [99]. The EH from a relay is divided into three sub-problems: energy transmission
    power optimization, power control for data transmission, and time-division between
    energy transmission and data transmission. The sub-optimal solution is obtained
    using alternating power control and time division algorithm. The wireless energy
    transfer (WET) in cooperative communication consists of one source and multiple
    relay–destination (RD) pairs. However, Leng and Yener [108] proposed an asymmetric
    WET (AWET) for a relay-centric two-hop network. Relays receive source signals
    sequentially however, the nodes that wait longer accumulate more energy by harvesting
    from previous signals. The SG is formulated between RD pairs (leaders) and SD
    pairs (followers). Relays harvest energy from the signals intended from previous
    relays during their waiting times. The results reveal that the proposed AWET outperforms
    the symmetric WET, broadcast WET, and independent WET in terms of system utility
    and energy efficiency. The Baidas et al. [98] discussed the physical layer security
    for both regular users (REUs) and security oriented users (SEUs). The equilibrium
    techniques are discussed in wireless security with EH. The two considered multi-relay
    scenarios are constrained selection (CS) and unconstrained selection (US). The
    relay harvests energy which is known by the source using non-Bayesian learning
    (NBL) algorithm. The Best Response (BR) recursive algorithm with CS outperforms
    the US. The source nodes takes multi-relay selection decisions to guarantee perfect
    NE. 3.2.8. MIMO-OFDM The Bannour et al. [103] investigated an EH-powered cooperative
    MIMO-OFDM transmission using algebraic space–time coding (ASTC) with a coalitional
    game-based relay selection. The players are EH-powered relay nodes. On the basis
    of the amount of EH and the channel condition, the relay node cooperates with
    the BS. The relay dynamically configures virtual MIMO network for transmitting
    to destination at each epoch. The suggested approach has a better goodput gain
    at SNRs greater than 15 dB than [179]. However, the gain reduces at lower values
    of SNRs, specifically below 15 dB due to the formation of coalition after the
    negotiations. The findings show that at SNR 30 dB, the gain is 5.3%. However,
    at 40 dB and 10 dB, the gains achieved are 12% and 6.6%, respectively. 3.3. Price
    sharing and profit maximization Intermediate nodes help the legitimate node in
    transmitting information and hence the capacity is improved. As the nodes are
    rational in nature, their participation can be encouraged by price sharing and
    payoff schemes. The various application areas where GT models are used for the
    price sharing and profit maximization are summarized in Table 4 including different
    games, findings and related issues. Table 4. Price sharing and profit maximization.

    Chopra et al. [109] investigated the performance of networks with and without
    the direct link between SE and SD. In this paper, the price and power of relays
    are controlled by SG, where the relay and the source play the roles of leader
    and follower, respectively. The intercept probability of the threshold-based DF
    relay is determined with MRC. Using convex optimization, closed-form optimal solutions
    for price and power are obtained. In [110] the jammer strives to attain maximum
    profit for combating the action of eavesdropping. This problem is modeled using
    Bertrand game to obtain the optimal pricing scheme for a friendly jammer. 3.3.2.
    CRN Games played between multiple PUs and SUs are classified in upper and lower
    sub-games. The users compete with each other to maximize their utilities and revenues
    using GT. The non-cooperative game is formulated to maximize the utilities in
    terms of global interference and outage constraints by Yang et al. [113]. 3.3.3.
    Cellular communication The SG is formulated between the spectrum provider (SP)
    as leader and BS as follower to maximize profit and improvise the spectrum usage
    in off-peak hours. The different selling prices of bandwidth are considered to
    address on-demand services. Furthermore, closed form expressions of Stackelberg
    equilibrium are determined for both single user and multi user scenarios. This
    game realized greater profit for both BS as well as SP. The pricing of statistical
    request delay information (RDI) closely matches with the non-causal RDI in Huang
    et al. [111]. For the delay constraint of 2, the utility gains of the spectrum
    provider (SP) with non-causal RDI and statistical RDI improves by 90.8% and 39.1%,
    respectively, when compared to the system without RDI. 3.3.4. V2V communication
    To avoid collision and provide seamless traffic on roads, information about the
    speed and position of the vehicles are exchanged in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
    networks as shown in Fig. 14. Yang et al. [114] discussed V2V data offloading
    network to transmit the data using vehicle-to-vehicle in a single hop or multi-hop
    network. The SG based pricing scheme for data offloading in software defined network
    (SDN) based VANETs is presented. In this game, the client follows the action of
    the leader. The NE is determined to select a service provider according to the
    lowest unit price by reducing the downloading time. Download : Download high-res
    image (135KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Vehicle to vehicle
    communication. Zhang et al. [115] investigated the V2X for ultra reliable low
    latency communication (uRLLC), where the MBS set the interference price for transmitting
    power to VUEs. The SG is formulated between MBS and VUEs to get the optimal price
    for MBS services. The MBS maximizes its gain from interference revenue cost consideration
    and VUEs maximize their gains per unit of power consumption. The SG shows the
    trade-off between profit and power saving. The authors plan to address location-based
    resource allocation for realistic vehicle traffic in the near future. For a wireless
    ad-hoc network and WSN, incentive-based techniques are generally used for stimulating
    nodes to cooperate in the network [116]. 3.3.5. UAV The Unmanned aerial vehicle
    or drone is an aerial base station which improves the efficiency and coverage
    of wireless communication systems. The line of sight (LoS) communication by UAV
    can be properly adjusted by its height. Ni et al. [112] proposed a modified binary
    log-linear learning algorithm (BLLL) for multiple UAVs in a cooperative search
    problem using potential game theory. This is an effective and feasible model that
    converges at less time in both simple and complex environments. 3.3.6. Cyber physical
    systems In a cyber physical system there exists a price competition among service
    organizers (SOs), entities and users to obtain better services. According to the
    available services, the SO dynamically increases or reduces its price. To decide
    the price, Liu et al. [117] proposed a game based service price decision (GSPD)
    using the rule of “survival of the fittest” considering the diversity and complexity
    of the CPS system. 3.3.7. IoT Rawat et al. [118] proposed a three-layered game,
    where wireless network virtualization is studied through the slicing of wireless
    infrastructure into Wireless Infrastructure Providers (WIPs), Mobile Virtual Network
    Operators (MVNOs), and IoT devices (or end-users). The players play sequentially
    to determine their optimal strategies. With the help of a controller, WIPs divide
    and reconfigure their RF bands to sublease frequency slices to MVNOs based on
    their service-level-agreement (SLA). This game presented a unique optimal solution
    to facilitate the trade-off between QoS of end-users, payoffs of MVNOs, and the
    payoff of WIPs. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated
    using numerical results which reveal that the payoffs of WIPs and MVNOs can be
    maximized by offering a competitive price for the subleased RF spectrum. 3.4.
    Resource management Resource management including power and spectral allocation
    is the major challenge for any efficient wireless network. The resource allocation
    problem is portrayed using SG for CRN in [181] by Chowdhury et al. Further, the
    subsequent sections presented GT for resource allocation in various applications
    like cooperative communication [76], IoT [159], edge computing [155], [156], [160],
    [161], shared spectrum [180] UAV [48], [50]. Further, distributed power allocation
    is addressed in different applications including MEC [132], [133], UAV [49], [134],
    satellite network [135], cooperative communication [136], and F-RAN [127]. Table

    assigned to the cellular device to provide desired services. It is a payable quantity
    and also limited in nature. Therefore, spectrum sharing becomes important to support
    numerous internet applications and devices. Tables 5(a) and 5(b) brief the GT
    models and their findings for resource allocation and efficient utilization of
    spectrum. (a) CPS and IoT. To overcome the challenges of efficient allocation
    of limited resources to selfish users in a network, a distributed resource allocation
    scheme is presented for CPS and IoT systems [128]. A technique of dynamic competitive
    spectrum allocation is proposed for IoT devices in [182] based on a two-level
    (upper level and lower level) game. The optimal control problem is modeled by
    the upper level however, the lower level game is formulated by the Colonel Blotto
    game. The two service providers (SPs) possessing different spectrum are consider
    to serve the users. The SPs auction the spectrum for each time slot. The users
    independently and opportunistically choose a SP to maximize their utility. Further,
    SP competes to achieve maximum access for the users in order to lift its profit.
    To evaluate the optimal strategy for each time slot, the SPs adopt a decentralized
    non-cooperative repeated game. Using a sequential game method, Mughal et al. in
    [76] presented distributed resource allocation to efficiently assign channels
    from diverse frequency bands to relay nodes in order to improve total transmission
    time, effective throughput, and relay node efficiency for IoT system. (b) MEC.
    The non-polynomial computing complexity is solved in edge resource allocation
    (ERA) in [159] using a decentralized algorithm to discover the NE solution that
    maximizes the total quality of experience (QoE) by Li et al. Results reveal significant
    performance and scalability in the large-scale distributed edge computing scenario,
    making it suitable in real time systems. Learning for computation offloading and
    resource allocation (L6C) problems are addressed by Liu et al. in [160]. The authors
    used machine learning for resource management in wireless networks using multi-agent
    deep reinforcement learning. The proposed technique leads by 63.3%, 24.06%, and
    34.45% in terms of average edge reward, average user reward, and edge resource
    utilization ratio, respectively. Furthermore, Xia et al. in [161] proposed a two-phase
    game-theoretic decentralized method for problem named data, user, and power allocation
    (DUPA), which is characterized as a potential game with at least one Nash equilibrium.
    DUPA game outperforms centralized algorithm for cache placement (CACP) by 116.63%,
    data rate greedy (DRG) by 119.37%, and user coverage greedy (UCG) by 104.57% in
    the overall data rate. Javanmardi et al. in [180] defined a distributed dynamic
    rate and channel selection in a multi-user network as a multi-player multi-armed
    bandit problem. A decentralized learning algorithm is proposed that achieves near-optimal
    exploration of the transmission rates to learn quickly in time. The results reveal
    that accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 10% to 40% higher than other algorithms
    and vice-versa for a time slot. Xiao et al. [183] used the minority game and different
    reinforcement learning (RL) methods for MEC servers. It provides an energy-efficient
    and effective distributed resource allocation for the efficient utilization of
    available resources. Moreover, Chen et al. [184] adopted a non-cooperative game,
    real-time update computation offloading (RUCO), and multi-user probabilistic offloading
    decision (MPOD) algorithms to determine the offloading strategy with minimum cost
    for dense distribution of edge servers. Further, Ding et al. [185] used a non-cooperative
    game for offloading the distributed network for D2D communication. Messous et
    al. [186] explored the data offloading for UAVs considering the constraints related
    to energy, cost, and time. The NE exists and the GT-based offloading results outperform
    to the local computing. (c) Blockchain. For mining, a mobile blockchain application
    with edge cloud support is used in [155] by Liang et al. Miners, mobile devices,
    and the cloud collaboratively mined mobile devices and edge cloud operators (ECO)
    in order to authenticate the device. Because of tremendous computational capabilities,
    the edge cloud is explored for computational offloading. As a result, it is suitable
    for outsourcing mining workloads rather than regular cloud. The interactions among
    them constitute a multi-leader multi-follower SG that ensures profit maximization
    for all participants. (d) UAV. Chen et al. in [48] presented a mean-field game
    using deep reinforcement learning techniques for effective interaction between
    multiple objectives and numerous UAVs. The proposed GT framework maximizes communication
    efficiency while assuring fair communication range and network connectivity. The
    approach is also scalable and adaptable. The proposed approach uses seven UAVs
    to train a model and scaled up to ten UAVs. The results show that the suggested
    technique is more effective, resilient, and superior to the centralized control
    method. Gao et al. in [50] optimize multiple UAVs’ trajectory optimization with
    offloading delay, energy efficiency, and obstacle avoidance by formulating mixed-integer
    non-linear problem (MINP). Moreover, trajectory optimization and obstacle avoidance
    are addressed by the reinforcement learning method and the service assignment
    is solved by potential game. It lowers computational complexity and communication
    overhead, where the offloading task completes within 212 s by multi-agent deep
    deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) compared to 232 s by DDPG. The UAVs are
    capable of determining their ideal 3-D deployment intelligently in order to optimize
    the MIMO system’s channel capacity [49] by Gao et al. With regard to the rank
    function, the optimization issue may be separated into numerous optimization sub-problems
    using the potential game. The results imply that when the SNR increases from 0
    to 10 dB, the channel capacity also increases by 13 bits/s/Hz and for the SNR
    ranging between 10 to 20 dB, the channel capacity improves by 20 bits/s/Hz. (e)
    Fog radio access network (F-RAN). F-RAN is a multi-layered structure including
    small sites with low transmission power like relay stations, picocell sites, and
    home base stations with advantages of low latency, high spectrum utilization,
    flexible networking, strong coverage etc. For effective resource utilization,
    a two-level game is formulated between traditional network operators (TNOs) and
    virtual network operators (VNOs). A spectrum pricing and resource allocation scheme
    (SPAS) is proposed to improve operator’s revenue and reduce wastage of resources
    [126]. (f) M2M. Soorki et al. [124] investigated a stochastic coalition game which
    reduces the average fail ratio and energy consumption as compared to non-cooperative
    cluster-based distribution of machine type devices (MTDs). Results reveal that
    for the uniform and cluster-based distributions, the performance difference between
    the proposed method and the optimal solution is 20.5% and 13.5%, respectively.
    However, the complexity and signaling overhead of proposed method are significantly
    reduced. Likewise, a coalition game is proposed by Chen et al. [125] for mmWave
    and D2D users. The system’s sum-rate is maximized in a statistical average sense
    compared to other practical schemes such as, full mmWave Communication (FMC),
    random communication (RC), cellular coalition game (CCG), and full cellular communication
    (FCC). (g) Massive MIMO and peer to peer network. Due to the time-varying nature
    of the wireless channel, the estimation of a channel becomes very difficult. However,
    the pilot symbols are used but the overhead increases correspondingly. To address
    these challenges, Khan et al. [5] proposed a novel scheme for an efficient CSI
    acquisition with reduced pilot overhead in multi-user (MU) massive MIMO systems.
    The virtual angular domain is used to split the channel matrix using spatial correlation.
    In addition, compressed sensing is used to estimate the CSI matrix. This technique
    effectively estimates the channel at both high and low SNRs with less number of
    pilot symbols. In peer-to-peer networks, there is no central server and each peer
    acts both as a client and a server. The resource allocation scheme for a peer
    to peer network using two non-cooperative games, demand game, and reputation game
    is analyzed by Goswami et al. [130]. In the discussed server selection policy,
    the requested node chooses the server with high local reputation. The NE of the
    two games jointly push the system towards a steady-state. (h) Cognitive radio
    network. Quantum GT can be used in the MAC layer to avoid collision with effective
    spectrum sharing [120]. A multiple-user multiple-choice quantum minority game
    is proposed for resource allocation in CRN. The cognitive radio ad-hoc network
    (CRAHN) combines CR technology with an ad-hoc network to maximize the utilization
    of resources by minimizing the mutual interference. Reward and punishment mechanisms
    are discussed by Liu et al. [121] to reduce the selfish behavior of SUs while
    relaying. The SG is played between the PU (leader) and SUs (followers) to resolve
    the resource allocation problem. Furthermore, selfish behavior of SUs can be minimized
    by offering certain incentives, which result in the significant improvement in
    the system’s capacity. (i) RF FSO hybrid communication. The optical wireless channel
    (OWC) including both FSO and visible light communication (VLC) makes very high
    data rate systems but the significant transmission occurs only in line of sight
    communication. Mixed RF FSO discussed in [187], [188], [189], [190] proves to
    be the promising end-to-end solution. A spectrum trading game for RF/FSO hybrid
    communication is discussed [122]. FSO links are more susceptible to scattering
    due to fog and turbulence-induced scintillation however, RF links above 10 GHz
    are more susceptible to rain conditions. In order to get seamless services, hybrid
    RF/FSO communication systems are used. In case of strong turbulence/fog, the FSO
    link fails and the source transmits through available RF link. Market-equilibrium
    based pricing is applied to allow the source (buyer) and RF nodes (sellers) to
    play a spectrum trading game. For the number of RF surrounding small cells to
    be 5, the above specified system’s availability increases up to 99.996% and 99.9997%,
    for the traffic load of 10 and 1, respectively. (j) Cellular communication. In
    order to address the problem of under utilization of resources in any network,
    Sanguanpuak et al. [123] implemented a many-to-one stable matching game. The authors
    formulated the social welfare optimization problem for optimum spectrum sharing
    by multiple operators. They proposed a stochastic geometrical approach and a generic
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for resource allocation. To avoid redundant backhaul
    transmission in 5G networks, the authors proposed an efficient edge caching scheme
    and formulated SG for service provider (leader) and numerous edge nodes (followers).
    The two formulated games are storage allocation game (SAG) and user allocation
    game (UAG) [129]. The results show that this network can easily be scaled to the
    large scale caching problem with lesser resources. (k) mmWave. In the mmWave wireless
    backhaul network, the effective full duplex (FD) scheduling flow mechanism is
    presented by Jiang et al. [53]. The proposed FD concurrent scheduling algorithm
    based on coalition game (FDCG) outperforms the TDMA, STDMA, and SFD in terms of
    throughput and resource utilization efficiency. 3.4.2. Power allocation Power
    allocation refers to efficiently modify and manage the power from MS/BS in both
    directions (uplink/downlink). Interference plays a crucial role in defining system’s
    capacity and voice quality of any system. Interference on the uplink is more significant
    than on the downlink because of non-coherent detection at BS. As a result, uplink
    power regulation is considerably more important. For any link gain, a centralized
    power control (CPC) strategy needs a central controller and global information.
    As a result, implementing distributed power control (DPC) by utilizing only local
    data to take decisions is comparatively simpler. Dynamic power management at the
    uplink is beneficial as it increases system capacity, battery life, and talk time.
    Isnawati et al. in [191] analyzed CPC and DPC used for cognitive femtocell network
    (CFN). Results signify that CPC can produce SINR values that are higher than the
    SINR targets, but DPC the maximum value can reach up to target SINR. However,
    the power consumed by the CPC is greater than that of DPC thereby, DPC proves
    to be more power efficient than CPC. In that series, Tsiropoulou et al. in [192]
    proposed a game-theoretic framework using convex pricing compared to linear pricing
    of users’ transmission power for effective distributed power regulation in the
    uplink of CDMA wireless networks. This suggested framework succeeded in producing
    more revenue for the system by compelling users to engage in social behavior at
    large. Table 5(c) briefs the GT models and their findings for dynamic or decentralized
    power allocation used in various application related to wireless communication.

    Ning et al. in [132] explored MEC-enabled 5G in-home health monitoring for IoMT
    which is categorized into intra-WBANs and beyond-WBANs, thereby implementing the
    bargaining game and the potential game for bandwidth scheduling and cost minimizing,
    respectively. The decentralized algorithm saves 78% of an average time as compared
    to the centralized algorithm. In addition, with the increase in the number of
    patients, number of slots increases correspondingly. For offloading the decisions,
    decentralized approximation algorithms with SG are used to decrease the completion
    times for edge computing [156] by Josilo et al. The results conveyed that a cost-cutting
    resource allocation policy requires less completion times than the time-based
    allocation method. Using a decentralized computation offloading technique, Wang
    et al. in [133] suggested a multi-agent imitation learning-based compute offloading
    approach with stochastic GT to reduce the average task completion time for each
    device. It also uses generalized adversarial imitation learning in a multi-agent
    context. Further, the mixed-integer and non-convex (MINC) NP-hard problem of combined
    scheduling and power allocation with the aim of optimizing the average weighted
    sum-rate (WSR) of the 5G network is addressed in [58] by Sheemar et al. To solve
    this problem, the authors decoupled the problem by allocating power first using
    a low-complexity, greedy, and decentralized method and then by scheduling the
    mode via a game between cells. Results signify that for the cross-interference
    management factor of 0.3, both simplified-payoff and approximated-payoff are selected
    and higher average weighted sum rates are obtained as compared to that of static
    TDD. (b) Cooperative communication. The power allocation problem is solved using
    a model price incentive mechanism based on SG, which tries to gain active participation
    support from relays and reduces system signaling overhead in [136] by Xu et al.
    The destination node buys the relay’s collaborative power and the relay reports
    the unit power price according to the destination’s requirements. The dynamic
    power allocation approach based on SG can quickly determine the optimal allocation
    for the new locations. (c) Satellites. Based on the computational power of LEO
    satellites, a dynamic power allocation strategy for the inter-satellite link of
    Low Earth Orbit (LEO)/Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites is proposed in [135]
    by Zhang et al. The inter-satellite link distance is projected using the spherical
    geometric relationship between the LEO/MEO satellites based on the initial orbit
    characteristics of the satellite and the satellite’s operational duration. The
    penalty factor is controlled by the MEO satellite thereby improving the overall
    network’s utility. The suggested distance prediction-based non-cooperative power
    game (DPNPG) strategy has lesser influence on battery life cycle loss than the
    non-cooperative power game with non-cost (NPG-NC). (d) NOMA and F-RAN. NOMA and
    fog computing radio access network (F-RAN) provide robust support for augmented/virtual
    reality (AR/VR) applications, automotive networking, intelligent medical applications,
    and so on. For this type of novel time-varying network, Qiu et al. in [127] proposed
    a non-cooperative game for resource optimization to reduce complexity while decoupling
    the dynamic optimization issue from sub-channel assignment and power allocation.
    Results reveal the potency in terms of the utility performance of the network.
    (e) UAV. The work in [134] addresses a user-centric UAV swarm with device-to-device
    user equipment (DUE) and proposed an hierarchical SG to create distinct profit
    functions for different game players by Zhang et al. The simulation results demonstrate
    that the power allocation algorithm of the two-level Stackelberg game (PAOTLSG)
    method successfully boosts throughput by 4.65 percent when compared to the pricing-based
    Stackelberg game (PSG) algorithm. Edge Intelligence is the result of convergence
    of AI and edge computing supported by the FL based heterogeneous network. The
    hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework has been developed to mitigate
    the node failures by Lim et al. in [193]. The evolutionary game theory is chosen
    to serve the model owner at the upper level, whereas model owners must compete
    for the cluster heads’ services. As a result, to determine the value of each cluster
    head’s services, the author in [158], [193] proposed a deep learning-based auction
    process. The results demonstrate the originality and stability of the proposed
    evolutionary game and revenue maximization. (f) VANET. To know the position, speed
    and acceleration of other vehicles, Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) known as beacons
    are periodically broadcasted in the Vehicular Adhoc NETworks (VANETs) [54]. The
    authors proposed a distributed beacon transmission power control algorithm for
    proper channel usage which controls traffic congestion. By this technique, every
    vehicle can transmit with optimum power and fair and proper bandwidth utilization.

    in various applications of wireless communication using game theory. 3.5.1. MIMO
    The researchers in [137] illustrate the improvement in reliability and the data
    rate of MIMO systems using GT. A non-cooperative game is used to explore the optimization
    problem of energy efficiency (EE) in a multi-user cognitive MIMO system [194].
    The NE of the system is determined in the proposed distributed iterative energy-efficient
    optimization algorithm (DIEEOA) for the multi-user (MU) cognitive MIMO interference
    channel (IC). Competition occurs among the SUs to get access to the MIMO interference
    channel using a transmission covariance matrix. With each iteration, this matrix
    is updated in order to maximize energy efficiency. The updated information is
    not shared among SUs which indirectly supports the practical implementation of
    the system. A higher EE is achieved in the proposed algorithm compared to the
    spectral efficiency algorithm for MU-MIMO cognitive IC system. 3.5.2. Wireless
    charging vehicles (WCVs) Lin et al. [138] proposed a unique approach to address
    the issues related to the collaborative charging in large-scale WRSNs with multiple
    WCVs using Game Theoretical Collaborative Charging Scheduling (GTCCS) scheme.
    The payoff function is designed rationally to improve the energy efficiency and
    reduces the number of dead nodes. In addition, the charging conflicts are resolved
    among WCVs. The experimental and simulation results of [138] show significant
    improvement of energy efficiency of up to 20% and 15% than that of PushWait and
    Hierarchical schemes, respectively. 3.5.3. NOMA based MEC A novel NOMA-based MEC
    network is proposed by Xu et al. [6] to improve the energy efficiency during task
    offloading process with minimum energy consumption. Moreover, it improves the
    spectral efficiency and reduces the network pressure from the computing-intensive
    and latency-sensitive applications in future wireless networks. Additionally,
    a matching-coalition approach coupled with computing resource allocation and power
    control to find the optimal solution has been proposed. The average derivation
    between the suggested approach and exhaustive search for total energy consumption
    is approximately 7.72%. 3.5.4. Wireless ad hoc network The independent Poisson
    point process (PPP) is investigated for two conditions by Kwon et al. [141]. The
    authors considered that the source and eavesdropper are randomly located in the
    network. The two situations are discussed, and an alternating optimizing scheme
    is presented where the eavesdropper triggers all the nodes in order to wiretap
    maximum information from the source and in another, the eavesdropper triggers
    few nodes near to the source to maximize its secrecy energy efficiency (EE). After
    few iterations, the best response dynamics converges to the NE. The secrecy EE
    improves by approximately 50% compared to the secrecy spectral efficiency (SE)
    at 25% reduction in price. 3.6. Network coverage Network coverage is the geographical
    area covered by the BS or service providers (SPs). Table 7 illustrates different
    GT models and their applications to mitigate the interference and for improving
    the network coverage. This section deals with the GT concepts used in different
    applications of WC. Table 7. Network coverage and interference management. Application

    network consists of a FD base station (BS) having a baseband unit (BBU) which
    is responsible for signal processing and BS control and a radio remote unit (RRU)
    is a radio transceiver which is closer to half-duplex (HD) UEs. The HD UE is served
    by the FD BS and correspondingly BBU periodically charges RRU. For this network,
    Ge et al. [142] model the energy efficiency and coverage optimization problem
    as a mean-field game. Furthermore, a case study of a bargaining game between two
    UAVs is presented in order to increase the coverage area in Mkiramweni et al.
    [47]. The utility of the player is defined where UAV encounters the mobile unit
    by sending beaconing signals. Moreover, an optimal beaconing period is determined
    by the UAV to get the maximum value of Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) with different
    encounter rates. To minimize the errors in the channel estimation of MIMO system,
    Zhu et al. [145] proposed a pilot allocation algorithm based on coalitional GT.
    In the proposed algorithm, preference functions of users are used to obtain the
    stable state by forming a desirable coalition. To avoid pilot contamination by
    other coalitions, the users of a particular coalition share the same pilot signal
    in a distributed MIMO system. 3.6.2. IoT Yan et al. [144] presented a UAV assisted
    IoT communication network (U-ICN), where UAV performs access selection and BS
    allocates bandwidth with a hierarchical game framework to make a cost effective
    network. To overcome overloading due to tremendous IoT applications, UAV assisted
    communication networks are flexible solution for a large coverage area with less
    environmental restrictions. A dynamic evolutionary game is formulated among UAVs,
    where SG is implemented between UAVs and BSs and a non-cooperative game for BW
    allocation is formulated between BSs and UAVs. A stochastic geometry tool is used
    to model the positioning of network nodes and payoffs based on different network
    parameters. 3.6.3. D2D/M2M communication A new paradigm, D2D communication provides
    high speed communication with very low latency at eNodeB. Zhuoming et al. [143]
    used fuzzy logic to propose an architecture for achieving significant gains in
    average rate utility for a tree network. To incorporate these features with an
    uncertain relationship between the resource and UEs, the authors implemented fuzzy
    mathematics. The above discussed system improves utility in terms of rate and
    bit error rate (BER) and converges to a NE. By using coalitional GT, each UE self-organizes
    into a stable structure without the control of eNodeB. The arrangement of all
    UEs to eNodeB in star topology converges to a tree network, providing significant
    improvements up to 50% in average achieved rate utility. 3.7. Interference management
    RF interference is a major factor that affects the QoS of any network. In D2D
    communication, the dynamic SG is formulated between the BS and D2D pairs. The
    leader (BS) assists in reducing the interference among the D2D pairs (followers).
    The followers compete with each other for the optimum allocation of resources
    and power. Sawyer et al. in [146] categorized the D2D users into three classes
    according to their applications (casual, interactive, and streaming), each having
    a different utility function. This enhances the QoE (quality of experience) of
    D2D users. 4. Simulations The performance evaluation of the GT in WC is presented
    in this section. We assess the SG for physical layer security in the first scenario,
    and we determine the NE employed in resource allocation for the coexistence of
    5G and Wi-Fi networks in the second scenario. 4.1. Security problem We use GT
    to analyze a WC situation in which a legitimate link supplemented by a friendly
    jammer combats active eavesdropping. An active eavesdropper (E) is a malicious
    node that operates in full-duplex mode, performing both the operations: jamming
    and wiretapping the legitimate link between source (S) and destination (D) link.
    Further, the E’s link is disrupted by the friendly jammer (J). In this scenario,
    the J’s interference only affects the active eavesdropper in first case however
    in the second case, the jamming signal jams the active eavesdropper by negligibly
    affecting D. In the aforementioned scenarios, the active FD malicious eavesdropper
    is considered to be less prominent than the main channel in order to obtain a
    non-zero secrecy rate [195]. The friendly jammer is selfish therefore, charges
    price, , for combating E and assisting legitimate link. The S, J, and E send ,
    , and signals with power , , and , respectively. The SINR of the signal received
    and channel capacity at D in the presence of active eavesdropper, friendly jammer,
    and source can be written as (1) where and represent thermal noise at destination
    and eavesdropper, respectively. The channel gains of the links s d, s e, e d,
    e e, j e, and j d are , , , , , and , respectively. The variance of Additive White
    Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is specified by . The normal distribution with zero mean
    and variance characterizes the channel coefficient ( ) between nodes i and j.
    To simplify the expression, we substitute , , , , , and . Thereafter, the SINR
    and channel capacity for the active eavesdropper’s link can be written as (2)
    where is self interference coefficient. The achievable secrecy rate of the legitimate
    link S-D, can be written as , where specifies max (., 0). 4.1.1. Problem formulation
    To maximize the utility function of jammer stated as , the optimal price ( ) is
    required to obtain optimal interfering power ( ). The maximize is obtained by
    differentiating with respect to and equating to zero. When the is positive, the
    friendly jammer abates the effect of active eavesdropper. Otherwise, it pauses
    its aid to the legitimate link due to its selfish behavior. (3) The objective
    is to find the optimal cost that maximizes the Jammer’s utility. The interfering
    jammer broadcasts with power of at the cost of unit power from the source. In
    continuation, the utility of source becomes (4) On differentiating (4) with respect
    to and equating to zero, we obtain quartic equation, where the positive real root
    yields optimal jamming power ( ). Similarly, in the absence of gjd the positive
    root of quadratic equation obtained is (5) 4.1.2. Simulation results We consider
    that the active eavesdropper transmits with 0.1 W power per unit bandwidth of
    the channel. The channel gains between S-D and S-E links are presumed to be 5
    and 4, respectively. The channel gain of links E-D, J-E, and J-D are considered
    to be 2, 3, and 0.2, respectively. In Fig. 15, we observe for in watt: 0.3, 0.7,
    and 1 for specifically ranging between 0.3 to 0.7. The decreases with an increase
    in and increase in . This is due to the fact that the eavesdropper’s link is adversely
    affected by resulting in lower optimal cost thereby resulting in less . Further,
    the adverse impact of link on secrecy capacity is observed. The results reveal
    the fact that cost increases due to adverse effect of on secrecy capacity as additional
    loading occurs on the communication link. It is also inferred from the results
    that with the increase in , the , increases and per unit power price from the
    source decreases. After determining and , the utility of the source ( ) is tabulated
    in Table 8 for both the considered cases of . It is noted that utility of source
    outperforms in the absence of due to the fact that it has detrimental effect on
    main transmission which increases with the increases in . Table 8. Utility of

    Optimum cost of Jammer. The anti-eavesdropping mechanism for a full duplex active
    eavesdropper using a friendly but selfish jammer is the goal of this study. The
    jammer strives to earn as much profit as possible from its service in order to
    help legitimate transmissions. We cover both the scenarios when the jammer not
    only interferes with the malicious eavesdropper but also with the destination.
    For both the scenarios, the utility of source is established, and a closed form
    expression is obtained. 4.2. Resource allocation Based on the latest report on
    global mobile data, traffic is expected to exceed 77.5 exabytes (EB) per month
    by 2022 due to high-speed mobile data that has been fast expanding since the introduction
    of data-intensive applications [196]. Therefore, the actual deployment of 5G-unlicensed
    necessitates the development of algorithms that allow 5G to coexist with available
    Wi-Fi technology in a seamless manner. 5G and Wi-Fi share the unlicensed spectrum
    in a time-division fashion using CSAT (Carrier Sense Adaptive Transmission) [197].
    Due to this fact, cooperation among all nodes in the network is required, which
    is not possible when the nodes are owned by different operators. Therefore, the
    framework of GT is well suited to model for 5G and Wi-Fi technologies. Table 9.

    We posit a utility maximization problem where 5G base stations share the available
    Wi-Fi spectrum incorporating sufficient set of constraints. The objective is to
    maximize the sum utility of 5G BSs and WiFi access points (WAPs), where and denote
    allocated time for ‘n’ and ‘w’ number of 5G BSs and WAP, respectively. Further,
    their rates are specified by and , respectively. In this competitive environment,
    game-theoretic techniques are utilized to simulate various scenarios in which
    the optimum time ( ) is described in terms of constrained Nash equilibrium. According
    to the definition of best response, the NE for two 5G BSs is given by, (6) where
    is The pseudo code of the implemented algorithm is described as follows: Download

    results The considered scenario is equipped with three 5G based BSs and one WAP,
    where two BSs transmit with 30 Mbps data rate however, the data rate of third
    BS varies from 20–50 Mbps. The maximum data rate of Wi-Fi is considered to be
    10 Mbps. We have performed simulation for three cases, the coexistence of one
    5G BS with one WAP, two 5G BSs with one WAP, and three 5G BSs with one WAP. The
    optimal allocated time obtained after implementing NE in Algorithm 1 and stated
    in Table 9. In case of a single BS, increases to support high data rate. However,
    with the increase in number of BSs, reduces in order to support the Wi-Fi spectrum.
    As a result, GT enables an effective allocation of resources in a decentralized
    wireless communication system. We analyzed game-theoretic formulations to solve
    the problem of time-sharing of the unlicensed spectrum for the network of 5Gs
    and WAP. We are considered wireless communications scenario where GT is used to
    give a flexible way for studying nodes to interact and cooperate for resource
    allocation and profit. 5. Future implications of GT in WC The major challenge
    is to address a hybrid, multi-user, and multi-antenna system to provide seamless
    coverage, high throughput, low latency, large bandwidth, and high resolution with
    conflicting interest of nodes or agents due to their covetous and selfish nature.
    Security, infrastructure cost, deployment and coverage, device support etc., need
    attention for ultra-dense distributed and dynamic networks, where each node acts
    independently and capable of taking intelligent decisions based on the scenario
    and predetermined algorithms. In these diversified areas, GT is used as an effective
    tool for the interaction and rational decision among independent nodes to obtain
    optimal solutions for heterogeneous networks. Moreover, various applications,
    existing works, challenges, and future research directions are listed in Tables
    10(a) and 10(b). Table 10(a). Future implications of GT in WC. Application Existing

    using GT in WC. • Due to randomness and availability of incomplete CSI of a wireless
    channel, stochastic games can be formulated to optimize the utility function.
    • Ultra-dense wireless networks have various traffic demands and priorities due
    to diversified areas of applications. Therefore, designing a dynamic game model
    to ensure high quality services to the users is a challenging task. • The security
    of a heterogeneous network is a critical issue which can be addressed using game
    theory for future generation networks. • To combat intra and inter system interference
    in the case of full duplex eavesdropping, GT models can be considered. 6. Conclusion
    Game theory is a powerful mathematical tool that can be used to solve complicated
    problems of society (Economics, Biology, Communication, Finance, etc.) in order
    to achieve optimum results. More specifically, different games such as non-cooperative
    and cooperative with their derived Nash equilibrium/Bayesian Nash equilibrium/Stackelberg
    Equilibrium have been explored. This paper posits a brief summary of GT casting
    efficient solutions in different domains such as security, energy harvesting,
    resource allocation, profit maximization, reliability, efficiency, etc. In a real-time
    scenario, the nodes are proliferated by learning and adapting according to the
    random behavior of WC. Hence, Q-learning with GT potentially proves to be a good
    solution for improving the performance of the system. Besides this, to accelerate
    the team spirit among the nodes coalition games are used, where nodes work together
    and share the cost to maximize profit and reduce the latency in the network. In
    this framework, the existing game theoretical approaches, components, and future
    research directions are outlined. This review highlights various game-theoretical
    models applied in different future generation technologies such as mmWave, UAV,

    SECTION I. Introduction The main requirements of beyond fifth-generation (B5G)
    wireless networks are typically categorized into three primary service classes
    [1]: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) to provide an improved network capacity
    and peak data rates for high throughput demanding users; massive machine-type
    communication (mMTC) to support the ever-increasing number of low-power low-cost
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices; and ultra-reliable low-latency communication
    (URLLC) for mission-critical applications. Optimizing the network resources to
    achieve these goals jointly is a multi-objective combinatorial problem, which
    is hard to solve in real time, even for small-scale networks. The interwoven relations
    among these goals are coupled by spectral efficiency (SE), which is determined
    by the interference between users competing for scarce network resources [2].
    Legacy orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes have struggled to deliver adequate
    support for the eMBB and mMTC service requirements. As a remedy, non-orthogonal
    multiple access (NOMA) technology has been recognized as a promising technology
    to improve the SE by simultaneously serving multiple users on the same resource
    via multiplexing them in either power or code domains [3]. Coupling NOMA with
    cooperative communications (CC) [4] and cognitive radios (CR) [5] shows significant
    promise for B5G networks. In the CC-NOMA, a relay node with a strong channel decodes
    the messages intended to weak channel users and fully exploits such prior information
    to improve the weak user’s performance [6]. In the CR-NOMA, the unlicensed/secondary
    users (SUs) operating on the NOMA scheme are permitted to transmit over spectrum
    bands licensed to primary users (PUs) in an opportunistic and non-intrusive manner
    [7]–[9]. Therefore, the conflation of cooperative and cognitive NOMA (CCR-NOMA)
    concepts has recently attracted much attention to provide dense wireless networks
    with more significant SE. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received
    attention to serv as an aerial relay to enhance the coverage of geographical regions
    with high user density and heavy traffic loads [10], [11], which are also known
    as (a.k.a.) hot-spots. Since the relay coordinates mainly determine the channel
    quality and capacity of links to/from the UAV, the UAV deployment has a significant
    impact on the overall network performance. For a given UAV location, CCR-NOMA
    gain is also affected by the user pairing/clustering strategy, channel allocation
    due to the varying interference to/from PUs, power control mechanisms, and allocated
    time portions at each hop. That is, the UAV deployment strategy in CCR-NOMA networks
    should jointly account for user clustering/pairing, interference to/from a primary
    network, and resource (i.e., power and time) allocation aspects. Therefore, this
    paper develops an integrated approach that provides a fair service to users located
    in a hot-spot region. A. Related Works Unlike the network sum-rate maximization
    that may lead to intolerable rate loss to weak users, max-min fairness aims at
    improving overall network performance by pushing the weakest user’s quality-of-service
    (QoS) to its upper limit. Therefore, this section concentrates on the literature
    with max-min fair objective since resource allocation and user clustering, and
    thus UAV deployment, heavily depend on the system objective. Resource Allocation
    and User Clustering for NOMA: In [12], Liu et al. proposed three different max-min
    fair clustering approaches to realize different trade-offs of complexity and throughput.
    The proposed clustering algorithms were shown to achieve 80% throughput of the
    optimal/exhaustive solution. The developed methods have factorial time complexity
    and depend on numerical power allocation methods. In [13], the authors proposed
    a max-min rate user clustering and resource allocation approach that iteratively
    pairs two users based on the optimum beamforming and power allocation vectors.
    Noting that the developed polynomial-time complexity method is limited to a cluster
    size of two, the authors only compared its performance with a random clustering
    benchmark instead of an optimal solution. Moreover, Jiao and Dai also studied
    the beamspace clustering based on the max-min rate fairness in [14], where a user-specific
    digital precoding method was proposed to optimize the digital precoding vector
    for each beam and the power allocation for each user. Likewise, in [15], Bui et
    al. proposed a max-min rate user pairing and beamforming algorithm. Although the
    developed method was shown to provide superior performance to random clustering,
    a cluster size was limited to two users, and performance was not compared with
    an optimal benchmark. In [16], Zheng et al. investigated a max-min fair NOMA system
    for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. The authors decomposed the master problem
    into three sub-problems: power allocation, power control/subcarrier assignment,
    and user clustering. The authors showed that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal
    results with polynomial time complexity. The work in [17] proposed a UAV-assisted
    NOMA model to solve the strong asymmetric interference problem, while [18] focused
    on the precoding optimization for a UAV-aided NOMA to maximize the sum rate of
    users and mitigate the interference generated by the UAV. The authors in [19]
    jointly optimized the UAV trajectory and ground base station association in order
    to minimize the UAV mission completion time. In [20], the performance of multiple
    UAV-assisted NOMA systems under user-centric and UAV-centric strategies was investigated.
    We should note that the above works do not apply to CR-NOMA schemes as they do
    not account for interference temperature constraint (ITC) of the primary network.
    Further, Xu et al. studied a joint power allocation, and SU assignment problem
    for underlay CR-NOMA networks under channel uncertainties in [21]. Although generated
    results showed that the proposed approach gains higher throughput than that of
    the Mitran algorithm, their work did not provide a clustering solution for either
    PUs or SUs. There are other works on UAV-assisted CR which considered a spectrum
    sensing/sharing problem for the secondary UAV [22]–[24]. For example, the sensing
    radian optimization was proposed in [22] to maximize the effective throughput
    of the secondary UAV. The authors in [23] suggested a model, where the UAV predicts
    the OFF periods of the PU and then the number of consecutive transmission slots
    are chosen for the secondary communication. In [25], Lima et al. investigated
    max-min fair power control of full-duplex two-way CC-NOMA schemes. The obtained
    results delivered a better performance in terms of the fairness, achievable rate,
    and outage probability than the other adaptive power allocation techniques. In
    [26], Chen et al. presented dynamic and fixed power allocation methods for a CC-NOMA
    scheme that switches between half-duplex and full-duplex modes. Nonetheless, [25]
    and [26] neither considered user clustering nor optimal phase-time allocation
    for two-hop communication of the CC-NOMA. Moreover, a two-hop CC-NOMA system was
    studied in [27] to reduce the overall system outage probability by optimizing
    power and time allocations. This aforementioned CC-NOMA literature only considered
    two users without accounting for an N -user case along with clustering in a large-scale
    network. Thus, a CC-NOMA system with generic cluster size was investigated in
    [28], where the authors used successive convex approximation (SCA) to optimize
    precoders, message split, time slot allocation, and relay user scheduling. The
    authors utilized the centralized and decentralized user scheduling and analyzed
    the global optimal point of the max-min fairness problem. The proposed method
    achieved 95.6% of the rate of the optimal clustering method. We should note that
    the above CC-NOMA works do not consider the ITC constraints typical for CCR-NOMA
    networks. The Recent UAV Deployment Works on NOMA: The authors in [29] investigated
    the mobility and optimal deployment of several UAVs using circle packing theory
    to ensure energy-efficient data collection from IoT devices. In [30], a two-dimensional
    (2D) trajectory and a transmit beamforming vector of the UAV were jointly optimized
    with the help of monotonic optimization theory and semi-definite programming relaxation
    methods. Besides, a low-complexity suboptimal iterative algorithm was developed
    based on the SCA, which showed near-optimal performance with polynomial time complexity.
    On the other hand, the authors in [31] optimized the coverage performance of a
    wireless network with multiple UAV-BSs by minimizing the average distances between
    the UAV and end-users. A joint precoding optimization scheme for simultaneous
    wireless information and power transfer in UAV-assisted NOMA systems was studied
    for security purposes in [32]. Moreover, the authors in [33] considered multiple
    UAV-BSs, where an optimal placement algorithm that executes an exhaustive search
    was proposed to solve the multiple circles’ placement problem while maximizing
    the number of covered end-users with different QoS requirements. The proposed
    algorithm obtained 97% of user coverage of the optimal exhaustive algorithm in
    less computational time. In [34], the CR-based UAV network was investigated, where
    the UAV serves as a secondary aerial transmitter to communicate with a ground
    secondary receiver. The objective was to maximize the secondary receiver’s average
    worst-case secrecy rate and minimize the transmit power, at the same time, guaranteeing
    a tolerable interference level for the primary receivers. The SCA-based efficient
    iterative algorithm was proposed to attain a locally optimal solution. A stochastic
    geometry-based UAV deployment approaches were developed in [35], [36]; while the
    former determined the number and location of the hovering stations to minimize
    the total time spent for data aggregation from a large-scale IoT network, the
    latter found the optimal locations of tethered and regular UAVs to maximize the
    coverage of users in a hot-spot region, while the UAV altitude and bandwidth were
    optimized by assuming interference-free scenario in [37]. The Recent UAV Deployment
    Works on Cooperative OMA/NOMA: The authors [38] investigated the deployment problem
    of a single UAV-BS aimed at achieving the maximum reliability performance metrics,
    such as power losses, bit-error rates, and overall outage of single OMA user.
    It was demonstrated that both static and mobile UAVs’ optimal altitude values
    are not identical for different metrics. Here, the UAV was fixed at the top of
    the circle to serve a user, where only the altitude of the UAV was optimized.
    The authors in [39], [40] studied a circular UAV trajectory to provide an energy-efficient
    UAV communication by optimizing the UAV trajectory and its transmit power, where
    time complexity was a polynomial complexity in the worst case. On the other hand,
    [41] proposed the SCA technique to optimize a UAV location by maximizing all terrestrial
    users’ minimum throughput. The results revealed the outperformance of the candidate
    approach over the circular trajectory method. Furthermore, [42] aimed to enhance
    the SE for a two-hop UAV-NOMA network considering both line-of-sight (LoS) and
    non-LoS (NLoS) links. Also, an access-priority-based receiver determination approach
    was proposed for resource allocation. After the resource allocation optimization
    results, the user association was implemented using the three different heuristics
    strategy-based approaches. All three algorithms performed better than the OMA
    approach. However, the benefits of these algorithms were not compared with the
    optimal optimization method. Another work in [43] also considered a UAV-NOMA to
    relay a signal of the base station to ground users. Aiming to minimize the power
    consumption of the UAV, the authors suggested penalty and successive convex approximate
    methods to jointly optimize the location and transmission power of the UAV. The
    proposed scheme outperformed the OMA and NOMA randomly searched location methods
    in terms of power efficiency when a small number of ground users were considered.
    However, it may not be suitable for many users as the computational time complexity
    increases rapidly with the increasing number of users. On the other hand, [44]
    investigated the weighted sum-rate maximization problem for the UAV and terrestrial
    users by jointly optimizing the transmission power and uplink rate of the UAV.
    The proposed egoistic and altruistic transmission schemes, which are special cases
    of heuristic search, gained better achievable rates than the OMA and non-cooperative
    NOMA methods for the cost of time complexity. Distinctions of the Paper: Our contributions
    are distinct from existing works in the following manners: The above works are
    limited either by 1) depending on numerical optimization techniques for the power
    control mechanisms, 2) being not readily applicable to CC-NOMA schemes, where
    each hop’s power and time allocation must be jointly handled for optimum end-to-end
    performance, or 3) considering idealistic assumptions on channel state information
    (CSI) imperfections and hardware impairments (HIs). Since the successive interference
    cancellation (SIC) receiver requires received power disparity among multiplexed
    users, CSI uncertainty may yield erroneous successive decoding and significantly
    degrade the performance [45]. On the other hand, all transceivers undergo several
    HIs caused by in-phase/quadrature (IQ) phase shifts, amplifier non-linearity,
    additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and phase noise [46]. Some other HIs are
    generated by inaccurate calibration, and different sorts of noise can not be appropriately
    removed despite the existence of various algorithms designed to mitigate the HIs’
    impact [47]. Moreover, manipulating transmission power cannot eliminate the effect
    of HIs on the system performance [48]. The design of a HI-free system in modern
    wireless networks is extremely costly and especially challenging at high frequencies
    due to the scaling laws [49]. Hence, it is necessary to investigate the influence
    of HIs and imperfect CSI on the throughput performance of CCR-NOMA networks. Apart
    from the works surveyed above, this work presents a closed-form jointly optimal
    power and phase-time allocation that accounts for the ITC constraints, CSI imperfections,
    and HIs, which is more challenging than power control of an ideal system and analyzes
    their impacts on the key performance metrics. These closed-form solutions are
    then used to develop a fast yet high performance user pairing method to reach
    max-min fair clustering of the secondary network, which is also not considered
    by most of the works mentioned above. The prior works on UAV deployment either
    considered a 2D positioning without altitude optimization [39]–[41], [43], [44]
    or optimized the UAV altitude by assuming that the UAV always hovers at the top
    of the hot-spot center [38], [42]. Unlike these works, this paper considers a
    3D deployment approach that finds the best location by evaluating its max-min
    fair fitness based on an integrated clustering and power/phase-time allocation.
    B. Main Contributions The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as
    follows: For a given set of users (i.e., cluster) on a primary channel, we formulate
    a max-min fair CCR-NOMA framework for two joint sub-problems: power control and
    phase-time allocation while taking into consideration the constraints on maximum
    transmit power of the secondary base station and UAV as well as an interference
    constraint imposed by the primary network. Our work differs from the works listed
    in Section I-A in providing optimal max-min fair power and phase-time allocation
    in closed-form for generic CCR-NOMA cluster sizes. Derived solutions also account
    for the imperfections caused by channel estimation errors and HIs. The results
    show that, in comparison with numerical benchmarks, the proposed closed-form solutions
    reach optimal end-to-end max-min rates faster for less total transmission power
    consumption. Based on the optimal end-to-end max-min rate obtained by closed-form
    power and phase-time allocations, we propose a fast yet highly accurate user clustering
    and channel allocation approach. Unlike the common min-sum assignment (a.k.a.
    Hungarian Algorithm) approach used for the maximum sum-rate objective, this paper
    is first to exploit the linear bottleneck assignment (LBA) approach. The numerical
    results show that the LBA achieves 100% accuracy at five orders of magnitude faster
    time duration than an optimal integer linear programming benchmark. The proposed
    clustering and channel allocation approaches are also suitable for real-time applications
    as it provides solutions for 200 users and channels in around 64 milliseconds.
    We present an optimal deployment of the UAV to maximize the minimum throughput
    of the CCR-NOMA network. The proposed deployment smoothly integrates developed
    user clustering, channel assignment, and resource allocation subproblems. To the
    best of authors’ knowledge, this paper is first to develop UAV deployment for
    CCR-NOMA networks. The convergence analysis shows that our integrated approach
    has a high efficacy and low complexity as it converges in 12 iterations over 3
    seconds. This is mainly thanks to the closed-form power and phase-time allocation
    and the LBA’s high performance. C. Notations and Paper Organization Throughout

    proposes the LBA-based user clustering, channel assignment, and UAV deployment
    approach. Lastly, Section VII presents numerical and simulation results and Section
    VIII concludes the paper by remarking the key findings. SECTION II. System Model
    A. Network Model We consider a downlink CCR-NOMA network that consists of a primary
    network (PN) and a secondary network (SN), as illustrated in Fig. 1. The PN comprises
    a single primary BS (PBS) that serves K primary users (PUs) over K primary channels
    (PCs) in an orthogonal and time-slotted fashion. At each time slot duration of
    T , the PBS transmits on PCk with power P k p such that overall power consumption
    cannot exceed the total transmit power P p , i.e., ∑ K k=1 P k p ≤ P p . We assume
    that each time slot duration of T is much smaller than the coherence time. Hence,
    each particular channel remains constant during a transmission time slot T and
    varies independently within each time period. The set of SUs allocated to the
    same PC is referred to as a cluster and denoted by C k ={n| χ n k =1} , where
    χ n k ∈{0,1} is the binary channel allocation indicator variable. The cluster
    size is represented by C k ≜| C k |= ∑ n χ n k ,∀k . Each cluster/PC/PU has a
    bandwidth of W Hz.1 The PN operator allows the SN to use PCk in a cognitive underlay
    manner such that the SN ensures that its total interference to PUk on PCk cannot
    exceed a predetermined interference temperature constraint (ITC) threshold [50],
    ITC k . Fig. 1. The illustration of the considered underlay CCR-NOMA network and
    time slot allocation for primary and secondary transmission. Show All On the other
    hand, the SN consists of a secondary base station (SBS), a relaying UAV that works
    in the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol, and SUs. The UAV is assumed to operate
    in the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol, which has been shown to outperform amplify-and-forward
    relaying in key performance metrics (e.g., spectral efficiency, outage performance)
    [51]–[54]. The SBS is overloaded with geographical regions that experience high-user
    density and heavy traffic conditions, which are also referred to as hot-spots.
    In order to keep up with the growing QoS demands of N SUs located within the hot-spot,
    the SBS is required to improve the hot-spot coverage by offloading some of its
    traffic onto the PCs while ensuring that ITCs are not violated. With the aim of
    enhancing the traffic offloading performance, the network operator deploys a UAV
    that hovers around the hot-spot region and relays the hot-spot traffic from the
    SBS. Hence, each timeslot is divided into broadcasting and relaying phases with
    durations of λ k T and (1− λ k )T , respectively. In the first phase, the SBS
    transmits on PCk with power P k s such that overall power consumption cannot exceed
    the total transmit power P s , i.e., ∑ K k=1 P k s ≤ P s . Likewise, in the second
    phase, the UAV transmits on PCk with power P k r such that overall power consumption
    cannot exceed the total transmit power P r , i.e., ∑ K k=1 P k r ≤ P r . In the
    remainder of the paper, we assume that the total downlink transmission power of
    the PBS/SBS/UAV are evenly distributed among channels/clusters. Thus, we have
    P k p = P p /K , P k s = P s /K , and P k r = P r /K for the PBS, SBS, and UAV,
    respectively. That is, for N= 10 and cluster size C= 5, we have K= 2 clusters
    (each consisting of five SUs) each with total transmission power of P s /2 and
    P r /2 at the SBS and UAV sides, respectively. B. Channel Model For a generic
    transmitter node i and receiver node j , the composite channel gain is given by
    g j i = ℓ j i − − √ h j i ,i∈{p,s,r},j∈{k,n,r},i≠j, (1) View Source where ℓ j
    i is the spatial expectation of attenuation over the probabilities of having line-of-sight
    (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links. h j i is the channel gain that represents
    small-scale fading and modelled by the Nakagami- m distribution, which is an adequate
    generalized small-scale model that can form channel links between the UAV and
    ground users due to the fact that the propagation meets fewer obstacles and less
    scattering effects [55]. In addition, Nakagami- m is a general channel model from
    which Rayleigh fading channel can be modelled by setting m= 1 and the Rician channel
    is approximated by setting m> 1. Moreover, to capture CSI imperfections, we model
    channel coefficients using the minimum mean square error channel estimator as
    h j i = h ~ j i + e j i , where h ~ j i and e j i ∼CN(0, ζ j i ) are the estimated
    channel coefficient and channel estimation error, respectively.2 The error variance
    is modelled as ζ j i ≜θ ρ −μ , where ρ= P σ 2 is the transmitted signal-to-noise
    ratio (SNR), and μ≥0 , θ>0 [45]. This model allows us to describe the SNR-dependent
    and independent imperfect CSI scenarios by setting μ≠0 and μ=0 , respectively.
    Further, denoting υ j i (LoS)≜1− υ j i (NLoS) as the probability of having a LoS
    link between i and j , the spatial expectation of attenuation factor is given
    by ℓ j i = ∑ l∈{LoS,NLoS} [ η l i FSPL] − υ j i (l) , (2) View Source where η
    l i is the attenuation coefficient related to the LoS/NLoS links [57], and FSPL
    is the free-space path loss (FSPL). Similarly, the spatial expectation of path
    loss (PL) (measured in dB) is given by [57] PL j i = ∑ l∈{LoS,NLoS} υ j i (l)(FSPL+
    η l i ), (3) View Source The FSPL is calculated as FSPL=20 τ i log 10 ( d j i
    )+20 log 10 ( f c )+20 log 10 ( 4π c ), (4) View Source where f c is the carrier
    frequency and c is the speed of light. For the fixed PBS/SBS heights H p / H s
    , the probability of having an LoS transmission on the SBS-UAV backhaul link and
    PBS-UAV interference link is given by υ r i (LoS)= 1 1+ a i exp[− b i (arctan(
    H r − H i d r i )− a i )] , (5) View Source where a i and b i , with i∈{p,s} ,
    are the approximation parameters depending on H i , building heights distribution,
    the ratio of a land area covered by buildings to a total land area, and the mean
    number of buildings per km2 [58]. Similarly, assuming a zero height for SUn, the
    LoS probability for UAV-SUn access link and PBS-SUn interference link can be derived
    as υ n j (LoS)= 1 1+ a n exp[− b n (arctan( H j d n j )− a n )] , (6) View Source
    where ∀j∈{p,r} . SECTION III. UAV-Assisted CCR-NOMA Without loss of generality,
    let us first focus our attention on C k /PCk to explain the relaying mechanism
    of CCR-NOMA. The cluster set C k is sorted in a descending order of users’ composite
    channel gains, which is also followed during the successive decoding at SIC receivers.
    This naturally requires higher power allocation to cluster members with lower
    channel gains. A. The Broadcasting Phase In this phase, the SBS superposes the
    messages intended to S U n ∈ C k ,∀n and broadcasts the resultant signal to the
    UAV. The signal broadcast to the UAV is given by x k = ∑ n∈ C k α n k − − √ s
    n , where α n k and s n , with E{| s 2 n |}=1 , is the power allocation factor
    of the first phase and the corresponding message intended for SUn. By accounting
    for both CSI imperfections and hardware impairments, the UAV receives the broadcast
    signal as follows y k s,r = h r s ϱ r s − − √ ( x k + η r s )+ h r p ϱ r p − −
    √ ( s p + η r p )+ n r , (7) View Source where ϱ r i = P i ℓ r i /K , i∈{s,p}
    , the residual aggregate distortion noises originating from the transmitter (
    ϕ t ) and receiver ( ϕ r ) hardware can be modelled as η (⋅) ∼CN(0, ϕ 2 (⋅) )
    [59], where ϕ (⋅) = ϕ 2 t + ϕ 2 r − − − − − − √ denotes the compound HI level
    that is measured by the error vector magnitude. This hardware impairment model
    compounds all noises originated from the IQ phase shift, amplifier non-linearity,
    and phase noise [60, Sec. 14.3.4]. Finally, n (⋅) ∼CN(0, σ 2 (⋅) ) is the AWGN
    at each receive node. Following (7) and the decoding order mentioned above, the
    instantaneous signal-to-interference-distortion-noise-ratio (SIDNR) to decode
    the message s n at the UAV can be expressed by γ s,r k,n = | h ~ r s | 2 α n k
    χ n k | h ~ r s | 2 I s k,n +| h ~ r s | 2 ( ϕ r s ) 2 + E r s +| h r p | 2 I
    r p + σ ¯ r , (8) View Source where the SIC interference is given by I s k,n =
    ∑ C k j=n+1 α j k χ j k and E r s = σ 2 e r s (1+( ϕ r s ) 2 ) is the power of
    the channel error and the interference received from the PBS is given by I r p
    = ϱ r p ϱ r s (1+( ϕ r p ) 2 ) . Lastly, σ ¯ r = σ 2 r / ϱ r s is the normalized
    thermal noise at the UAV receiver. B. The Relaying Phase In the phase, the UAV
    relays the decoded information by broadcasting x ~ k = ∑ n∈ C k β n k − − √ s
    ~ n , where β n k and s ~ n are the power allocation factor of the second phase
    and message dedicated for SUn, respectively. Hence, during the relaying phase,
    the user n receives the following signal y k r,n = h n r ϱ n r − − √ ( x ~ k +
    η n r )+ h n p ϱ n p − − √ ( s p + η r p )+ n n , (9) View Source where ϱ n i
    = P i ℓ n i / K, i∈{r,p} . From (9), the instantaneous SIDNR to decode the message
    s n at SUn can be expressed by γ r,n k,n = | h ~ n r | 2 β n k χ n k | h ~ n r
    | 2 I r k,n +| h ~ n r | 2 ( ϕ n r ) 2 + E n r +| h n p | 2 I n p + σ ¯ n , (10)

    k χ i k while ( ϕ n r ) 2 stands for the power of the hardware distortion noise;
    E n r = σ 2 e n r (1+( ϕ n r ) 2 ) is the power of the channel error; I n p =
    ϱ n p ϱ n r (1+( ϕ n p ) 2 ) is the interference received from the PBS; and σ
    ¯ n = σ 2 n / ϱ n r is the normalized thermal noise at the user n . C. End-to-End
    SIDNRs and Data Rates Following (7) and (9), the end-to-end SIDNR of SUn within
    C k is given by γ n k =min{ γ s,r k,n , γ r,n k,n },∀n∈ C k , (11) View Source
    based on which the max-min SIDNR of C k is given by γ k = min n∈ C k ( γ n k ),∀k
    . Similarly, the end-to-end data rate of SUn within C k is given by R n k = min{
    λ k W log 2 (1+ γ s,r k,n ), (1− λ k )W log 2 (1+ γ r,n k,n )}, (12) View Source
    based on which the max-min rate of C k is given by R k = min n∈ C k ( R n k ),∀k
    . SECTION IV. Problem Statement and Proposed Solution Methodology In this section,
    we first present a formal problem statement and then discuss an outline of the
    proposed solution methodology. A. Problem Statement Our objective is to constitute
    a max-min fair rate enhancement for SUs residing within the hot-spot region. Accordingly,
    the objective of interest can be expressed as max c,χ,λ,α,β ( min ∀k,∀n [ R n
    k χ n k ]), (13) View Source where c∈ R 3 is the UAV location; χ∈{0,1 } K×N is
    the assignment matrix; λ∈ R K is the vector of phase duration portions; α∈ R K×N
    and β∈ R K×N is the matrix of power allocation factors in the broadcasting and
    relaying phases, respectively. The standard formulation of the max-min rate problem
    can be given as follows P o :  max c,χ,α,β,λ,ψ s.t. C 1 o (k,n):  C 2 o (n):  C
    3 o (k):  C 4 o (k):  C 5 o (k):  C 6 o (k,n):   ψ  χ n k R n k +(1− χ n k )≥ψ,∀k,n  ∑
    k χ n k =1,∀n  ∑ n χ n k ≤⌈N/K⌉,∀k  ∑ n α n k χ n k ≤min{1, ITC k P k s | g k
    s | 2 },∀k  ∑ n β n k χ n k ≤min{1, ITC k P k r | g k r | 2 },∀k  c∈ R 3 , χ n
    k ∈{0,1},  ψ, λ k , β n k , α n k ∈[0,1],∀k,∀n, (14) View Source where the max-min
    objective is handled by setting it to an auxiliary variable ψ and enforcing all
    rates to be greater than or equal to ψ . Thus, the constraint in C 1 0 is a standardized
    formulation of the following constraint C 1 o ={ R n k ≥ψ, 1− R n k ≥ψ, if  χ
    n k =1, if  χ n k =0, (15) View Source where R n k is zero if χ n k =0 . The constraint
    C 2 o allows an SU to join a single cluster at a time while the constraint C 3
    o limits the cluster size to ⌈N/K⌉ . The constraint C 4 o dictates two fundamental
    constraints on the total SBS power allocation on PCk: 1) The total power allocation
    cannot exceed the maximum permissible power on PC k  ( ∑ n α n k χ n k ≤1) ; and
    2) The interference received by PUk cannot exceed the ITC threshold ITC k  ( ∑
    n α n k χ n k ≤ ITC k P k s | g k s | 2 ) . Both power constraints also apply
    to the UAV as shown in C 5 o . By setting ψ to a constant value ψ ¯ ¯ ¯ , P o
    can be reduced to a feasibility problem, where a rate of no less than ψ ¯ ¯ ¯
    is guaranteed for all SUs. Since P o is a mixed integer non-linear programming
    problem (MINLP), it falls within the class of NP-hard problems. Since reaching
    the optimal solution takes impractically long time even for a moderate size of
    networks, it is necessary to develop a fast, yet efficient a sub-optimal approach,
    which is explained in the sequel. B. Solution Methodology As illustrated in Fig.
    2, P o can be decomposed into the following three sub-problems: SP1Resource allocation
    is a joint power control and phase-time allocation sub-problem that takes the
    UAV location c and the assignment matrix χ for granted. The S P 1 optimizes the
    power allocation factors of the broadcasting and relaying phases (i.e., α ⋆ k
    and β ⋆ k ) to obtain the optimal SIDNRs of C k , γ ⋆ k ( α ⋆ k , β ⋆ k ) . Based
    on γ ⋆ k , the phase-time allocation calculates the optimal time allocations,
    λ ⋆ k , which yields the max-min fair rate R ⋆ k for C k . In Section V, we provide
    closed-form solutions for γ ⋆ k , λ ⋆ k , α ⋆ k , and β ⋆ k . The resulting rate
    matrix R ⋆ ∈ R K×N is then fed into the clustering sub-problem. SP2For a given
    UAV location c and the rate matrix R ⋆ , S P 2 assigns SUs to clusters and clusters
    to PCs. Then, it returns the rate fitness of the UAV location F(c) (i.e., the
    max-min SNR of the entire secondary network) to the deployment sub-problem. The
    proposed clustering algorithm is developed in Section VI. SP3Lastly, the UAV deployment
    problem leverages S P 1 and S P 2 to evaluate the rate fitness of UAV locations.
    To do so, S P 3 feeds a UAV location c and get a rate fitness feedback F(c) in
    return. In this way, the UAV deployment problem can alter the coordinates to find
    the best location that provides the optimal max-min rate to the entire hot-spot
    region. Fig. 2. Schematic illustration of the solution methodology. Show All In
    Section VI, Algorithm 1 presents the algorithmic implementation of overall solution
    methodology. Besides, the optimality of proposed solution methodology is discussed
    in Section VII. Algorithm 1: Deployment-Clustering-Resource Allocation 1: Input:

    SECTION V. Max-Min Fair Resource Allocation The resource allocation problem consists
    of two joint sub-problems: power control and phase-time allocation. Since clusters
    have dedicated and independent power and time resources, they do not share any
    conflicting variables. This paves the way for the further decomposition of S P
    1 into individual cluster resource allocation problems [c.f. Fig. 2]. Each cluster
    can be further decoupled into power control and phase-time allocation sub-problems
    as they involve two distinct and independent resources. Therefore, in what follows,
    we focus our attention on a generic cluster C k without loss of generality. A.
    Power Control Noting that γ s,r k,n and γ r,n k,n are not functions of λ k [see
    (8) and (10)], the optimal power allocation that gives the maximum γ n k (thus
    R n k ) is independent of λ k , which justifies the motivation behind decoupling
    explained above. For a given UAV location and cluster set, the equivalent problem
    can be formulated as follows SP k 1 ( C k ,c) :  max α k , β k , γ k C 1 1 :  C
    2 1 :  C 3 1 :  C 4 1 :   γ k  s.t. γ n k ≥ γ k ,∀n∈ C k  ∑ n∈ C k α n k ≤min{1,
    ITC k P k s | g k s | 2 }  ∑ n∈ C k β n k ≤min{1, ITC k P k r | g k r | 2 }  β
    n k , α n k , γ k ∈[0,1], (16) View Source where γ k is an auxiliary variable
    similar to ψ in P o . SP k 1 can be numerically solved by geometric programming
    [61] via altering C 1 1 into 1/ γ n k ≤1/ γ k to put inequality constraints in
    the form of posynomials, as in C 2 1 and C 3 1 . Fortunately, SP k 1 can also
    be solved analytically based on two key propositions. Proposition 1:Following
    (11), the constraint C 1 1 can be expanded into two set of constraints: γ s,r
    k,n ≥ γ k and γ r,n k,n ≥ γ k ,∀k . This intuitively dictates at the optimal point
    that the SIDNRs of both phases must be no less than the optimal SIDNR, γ ⋆ k ,∀k
    . Proposition 2:At the optimal point ( α ⋆ k , β ⋆ k , γ ⋆ k ), at least one of
    the SIDNR constraints must be active, i.e., γ s,r k,n = γ k ∨ γ r,n k,n = γ ⋆
    k ,∃k . That is, there is no unique solution and thus enforcing all SIDNRs to
    be equal to γ ⋆ k is still optimal. Indeed, this equalization is especially preferable
    since it is also optimal in terms of the total energy consumption (i.e., E k =
    ∑ n∈ C k α n k + ∑ n∈ C k β n k ). This is true due to the fact that feasible
    SIDNRs greater than γ ⋆ k require higher power allocation factors, and thus higher
    E k . Based on Propositions 1 and 2, we have 2 C k equalities from C 1 1 and 2
    inequalities from C 2 1 − C 3 1 . These are sufficient to find closed-form primal
    solutions for 2 C k +1 variables in the sequel, which are given in the sequel.
    Lemma 1:The optimal first-phase power allocation factors for SU n ∈ C k is given
    by α ⋆ n k = I r γ ⋆ (1+ γ ⋆ ) N−n , (17) View Source where I r =( ϕ r s ) 2 +
    E r s +| h ~ r p | 2 I r p + σ ¯ r | h ~ r s | 2 is the interference-plus-noise
    term of the SIDNR in the broadcasting phase. Further, by substituting α ⋆ n k
    into (8), the optimal first-phase SIDNRs for SU n ∈ C k is given by γ ⋆ s,r k,n
    = ( Φ 1 I r +1) 1 N −1, (18) View Source where Φ 1 =min{1, ITC 1 P k s | g k s
    | 2 } and ITC1 are the ITC constraints of the first phase. The optimal second-phase
    power allocation factors for SU n ∈ C k is given by β ⋆ n k = I n γ ⋆ + ∑ j=n+1
    N γ ⋆ 2 I j (1+ γ ⋆ ) j−n−1 , (19) View Source where I n = σ 2 ϕ r n + E r n +|
    h ~ n p | 2 I n p + σ ¯ n | h ~ r n | 2 is the interference-plus-noise term of
    the SIDNR in the relaying phase. Then, substituting β ⋆ n k into (10), the optimal
    second-phase SIDNRs for SU n ∈ C k is given by3 γ ⋆ r,n k,n = γ ⋆ 2 = 4 I 2 Φ
    2 + ( I 1 + I 2 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ − I 1 − I 2 2 I 2 , (20) View
    Source where Φ 2 =min{1, ITC 2 P k r | g k r | 2 } and ITC2 are the ITC constraints
    of the second phase. Proof:Please see the Appendix. Corollary 1:The max-min end-to-end
    SIDNR of SU n ∈ C k , γ ⋆ n k , can be obtained by substituting γ ⋆ s,r k,n and
    γ ⋆ r,n k,n into (11), which yields γ ⋆ n k = γ ⋆ s,r k,n = γ ⋆ r,n k,n ,∀n∈ C
    k . Accordingly, the max-min SIDNR for C k is given by γ ⋆ k = min n∈ C k ( γ
    ⋆ n k ),∀k . Proof:This corollary directly follows from Proposition 2 and Lemma
    1. B. Phase-Time Allocation Lemma 2:For given SIDNRs, the max-min fair phase-time
    allocation factor for C k is given by λ ⋆ k = (a) log 2 (1+ γ ⋆ r,n k,n ) log
    2 (1+ γ ⋆ s,n k,n )+ log 2 (1+ γ ⋆ r,n k,n ) = (b) 1 2 . (21) View Source Proof:For
    given SIDNR values, data rates of the first (second) phase increases (decreases)
    with increasing λ k . Because of this inverse relation, the max-min rate is achieved
    when both phases deliver the same SIDNR, which yields equality (a). Equality (b)
    follows from Corollary 1 which states γ ⋆ n k = γ ⋆ s,r k,n = γ ⋆ r,n k,n ,∀n∈
    C k . The max-min fair rates can be obtained as described in the following corollary.
    Corollary 2:The end-to-end max-min data rate of SU n ∈ C k , R ⋆ n k , can be
    obtained by substituting λ ⋆ k , γ ⋆ s,r k,n , and γ ⋆ r,n k,n into (12). Therefore,
    the max-min rate for C k is given by R ⋆ k = min n∈ C k ( R ⋆ n k ),∀k . Proof:This
    corollary directly follows from Lemma 1 and Lemma 2. SECTION VI. User Clustering,
    Channel Assignment, and UAV Deployment In this section, we first present the proposed
    user clustering and channel assignment approach, then provide the algorithmic
    implementation deployment and overall solution methodology. A. Clustering: An
    Iterative Bottleneck Assignment Approach The user clustering and channel assignment
    sub-problem can be formulated as follows SP 2 (c) :  max χ min ∀k,∀n [ R n k (
    χ k ) χ n k ]s.t. C 2 o , C 3 o , C 6 o , (22) View Source which is an MINLP problem.
    Notice that the mixed nature is caused by the term R n k ( χ k ) that varies with
    the cluster size and cluster member identities. The special case of ⌈N/K⌉=1 reduces
    the objective to max χ ( min ∀k,∀n { r n k χ n k }) , where r n k is the max-min
    rate of C k if SUn is admitted to C k . Unlike the cost metric R n k ( χ k ) ,
    r n k is just a constant rather than being a function of χ as clusters can admit
    only one SU at a time. Thus, setting ⌈N/K⌉=1 converts the clustering problem into
    an integer linear programming (ILP) SU-PC assignment problem. An alternative solution
    approach to SP 2 is iteratively running ⌈N/K⌉ ILP problems such that each iteration
    adds an extra member to clusters until all SUs are assigned to a PC. Proposition
    3:The rate performance of a cluster is determined by its members, not by the order
    of member admissions to the cluster set, i.e., min{x,y}=min{y,x} . Since the current
    ILP iteration optimally admits new cluster members based on the cluster sets formed
    optimally in the previous iterations, ILP iterations are expected to yield an
    optimal MINLP solution at the very end. The mathematical representation of this
    ILP SU-PC assignment problem is also known as an LBA problem [62] and can be expressed
    as in line 46 of Algorithm 1. Indeed, LBA is the max-min version of the well-known
    min-sum (i.e., ∑ k,n r n k χ n k ) generalized assignment problem (GAP). In light
    of the above discussions, we present the proposed clustering solution between
    line 20 and line 43 of Algorithm 1. Lines 22 & 25 initialize cluster rates, cluster
    sets, assignment variables, and number of iterations, respectively. At each and
    every iteration of the most outer loop between lines 26 & 39, the outer loop between
    lines 27 & 34 and inner loop between lines 28 & 35 generates the cost matrix P(i)
    as follows: If SUn is already a member of any cluster, line 30 forbids its admission
    to C k by setting r n k to zero. Else, if SUn is not a member of any cluster,
    line 32 hypothetically admits SUn into C k and evaluates the new cluster probability
    as explained in Section V, which is then set to r n k . Line 36 executes the SU-PC
    assignment by calling the LBA between lines 44 & 47. Then, the clusters and their
    rates are updated in line 37 and line 38, respectively. Once the most outer loop
    is terminated, overall max-min fair rate and assignment matrix are set in line
    40 and line 41, respectively. One way of solving the LBA is using the threshold
    approach,4 which has a complexity of O( M 2.5 / log 2 M − − − − − − √ ) for an
    M×M cost matrix [62, Th. 6.4]. Denoting I=⌈N/K⌉ and M=max{K,N} , the overall time
    complexity of the proposed clustering approach is given by O(I[ K×N× M 2.5 log
    2 M − − − − − − √ ]) ≈ (K=N) O( N 4.5 log 2 N − − − − − √ ), (23) View Source
    where K×N is the complexity of generating the cost matrix. In Section VII, numerical
    results show that a commercial personal computer can execute the threshold approach
    based proposed clustering around 100 ms for K=N=250 . B. UAV Deployment: An Overall
    Orchestration The UAV location is the most conflicting variable that has a significant
    impact on the system performance due to its direct relationships with the channel
    gains, PL, LoS probability of signal and interference link budgets. Even for a
    given clustering and resource allocation setting, the deployment problem is a
    highly non-convex problem. From the clustering and resource allocation point of
    view, a change in the UAV location is seen as a change in environmental parameters.
    In this regard, the UAV deployment problem can be solved by meta-heuristic methods
    that run a global search of UAV locations and evaluate the location fitness by
    the proposed clustering and resource allocation procedure. There exist powerful
    meta-heuristic methods such as simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization,
    and genetic algorithm. Even though, we investigate these three methods in the
    numerical results section, we only provide the algorithmic implementation details
    of the simulated annealing approach in Algorithm 1. SECTION VII. Numerical Results
    In this section, we present numerical results to validate the analytical expressions
    and disclose the impacts of different system parameters and scenarios on the proposed
    system model. The default system parameters, if it is not stated otherwise, are
    listed in Table I, which mainly follow the parameters listed in [36], [57], [64].
    To provide a deeper insight into the entangled relations between resource allocation
    and UAV deployment, we first focus on a single-cluster performance based on the
    network setup shown in Fig. 3. TABLE I Default System Parameters Fig. 3. Network
    setup for verification of derivations. Show All A. Impact of the UAV Location
    on the Path-Loss In order to provide a better insight into how a UAV location
    has a direct impact on the optimal cluster performance, this subsection first
    discusses how the FSPL, LoS, and overall PL change with d and H r illustrated
    in Fig. 3. Fig. 4(a) demonstrates the effect of the FSPL on the SBS-UAV link for
    various UAV locations. The FSPL of the SBS-UAV link increases as d and H r increase
    since FSPL is mainly governed by a geographical distance. On the other hand, Fig.
    4(b) illustrates that the increase/decrease of the height/distance of the UAV
    regarding the SBS provides better LoS probability. This is mainly because of the
    fact that LoS probability increases as θ u s goes up. Furthermore, as it is noticed
    from Fig. 4(c), the increase of the height and distance of the UAV yields the
    growth in the overall PL. However, with a fixed d= 1000 m, the increase of the
    height from 300 m to 600 m decreases the PL level. This phenomenon can be explained
    due to the positive impact of the supreme LoS probability on the overall PL. When
    the UAV hovers at a higher altitude, the chance of having LoS communication is
    higher, especially, in urban area environments. Fig. 4. FSPL, probability of LoS,
    and overall pathloss (PL) for various distance and heights. Show All Figs. 4(d)–4(f)
    show the change of the FSPL, LoS probability and overall path-loss in the UAV-SU
    link as the UAV relocates. In these figures, we noticed that there are some minimum
    and maximum peaks at a certain UAV location. For example, in Figs. 4(d) and 4(f),
    the respective minimum peaks are obtained when the UAV is located at H r =10 m
    and d= 400 m. Besides, the maximum LoS probability in Fig. 4(e) is achieved at
    the same UAV location. This is because the reference SU is located at 400 m away
    from the SBS and when the UAV stands right above the SU, strong LoS communication
    is provided. In the next subsections, we demonstrate the impact of the UAV location
    on the system performance considering the user clustering. B. Validation of the
    Closed-Form Power and Phase-Time Allocations In Fig. 5, we show optimal power
    fractions for max-min throughput found using geometric programming (CVX [65])
    in (16) and derived analytically in a closed-form (CF) in Lemma 1. We consider
    four secondary NOMA users with the following coordinates5: { d 1 s ; d 2 s ; d
    3 s ; d 4 s } = {(500, 400, 0); (450, 400, 0); (350, 400, 0); (300, 400, 0)}.
    Fig. 5(a) illustrates the results for normalized optimal α and β considering various
    d locations of the UAV and different cluster sizes, C . For all cluster sizes
    and d regions, it is noticed that the values of β for both CVX and CF are equal
    to 1. This is due to the fact that the access link has lower transmission power
    compared to the backhaul link and the access link always provides minimum throughput
    for the considered system setup. On the other hand, the values of α are less than
    1 as the SBS decreases its transmission power to adopt the throughput of the backhaul
    link to that of the access link. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the
    values of α in the CF approach are much lower than those in the CVX. It means
    that the CF solution provides a much power-efficient solution than the CVX. For
    example, for C= 1 and d= 500 m, α for the CVX is 0.09, while, α for the CF equals
    to 0.02, which is 4 times efficient power usage than the CVX method. As shown
    in the Appendix, the values for α are found through the optimal SIDNR value of
    two links, while in the case of CVX, the optimal SIDNR is the minimum of that
    of two links. Due to this fact, the CF attains less α than the CVX. Moreover,
    the CF method provides better performance in computation time than the CVX as
    the CF approach does not use iteration to find the optimal SINDR. For example,
    when C= 2, the elapsed time for the CF solution to find the optimal power allocation
    factors is 0.05 sec, while the CVX method spends 230 sec for the same purpose.

    H r =250 m; b) for various height with the fixed d=R /2 m. Show All Fig. 5(b)
    plots the optimal power fractions for different heights ( H r ) of the UAV. It
    is observed that in some H r values α for both CVX and CF show a high increase
    compared with the other height regions. This happens due to the spatial expectation
    of the PL and LoS shown in (3) and (5), respectively. The probability of LoS or
    NLoS is strongly dependent on the elevation angle. For example, at 10–80 m height
    when the elevation angle between the SBS and UAV is low, the effect of NLoS is
    stronger for the SBS-UAV link, as a result, the SBS needs to increase its transmission
    power to meet the max-min end-to-end throughput. Fig. 6 plots the max-min throughput
    versus different phase-time factors considering the perfect system model. Here,
    the access link is allocated with the phase-time factor λ , while the backhaul
    link is allocated with ( 1−λ ). It is observed that the increase of λ improves
    the max-min throughput of the access links and degrades that of the backhaul links.
    We can notice that the optimal throughput, which is the max-min throughput over
    two links, for all cluster sizes are obtained when λ= 1 2 that proves Lemma 2
    in Section V-B. For example, for the optimal phase-time allocation factor, C=
    1, C= 2 and C= 4 achieve the max-min throughput of 0.91, 1.29 and 1.3 Mbit/s,
    respectively. These results match the findings in Fig. 7. Fig. 6. Optimal phase-time
    factor for access and backhaul links with the fixed H r =100 m, d=R /2 m, ϕ=0
    and ζ=0 . Show All Fig. 7. Max-min throughput performance for clusters with different
    sizes. Show All C. Impacts of Hardware Impairments and CSI Imperfections Fig.
    7 plots the max-min throughputs for clusters with different sizes obtained using
    optimal power allocation factors, which account for the system imperfections such
    as HI and CSI impairments. It is noticed from Fig. 7 that throughputs obtained
    from the CVX and CF are matched to each other. Fig. 7(a) illustrates the max-min
    throughput performance over various d values. For the perfect HI scenario, the
    figure shows that when C= 1 (i.e., OMA system), the overall max-min throughput
    of the clusters equals 1.29 Mbit/s and d= 400 m, which is the center of the hot-spot.
    Furthermore, when the system model turns into the NOMA mode with C= 2 and C= 4,
    the max-min throughput increases up to 1.306 and 1.308 Mbit/s, respectively. On
    the other hand, when the system has HIs, the max-min throughput of all cluster
    sizes decreases. For example, when ϕ=0.02 and ϕ=0.05 , the throughput for C= 4
    are 1 and 0.78 Mbit/s, respectively. In Fig. 7(b), the max-min throughput is plotted
    versus the different heights of the UAV considering the imperfect CSI. Similarly,
    as in the previous sub-plot, for the perfect CSI scenario, the OMA mode obtains
    the lowest throughput of 1.23 Mbit/s. The NOMA mode with C= 2 obtains 1.29 Mbit/s,
    while C= 4 gains the throughput of 1.3 Mbit/s. It is obvious that the throughput
    improvement from C= 1 to C= 2 is 0.06 Mbit/s, whereas that from C= 2 to C= 4 is
    only 0.01 Mbit/s. This can be explained by the fact that the rise of the cluster
    size increases the interference from NOMA users inside the cluster, negatively
    affecting the achievable throughput. Thus, a larger cluster size results in less
    throughput improvement. Besides, when the channel becomes imperfect, all clusters’
    throughput performance degrades by increasing the value of θ . For example, when
    θ=0.05 and μ=0 , C= 4 obtains the max-min throughput of 0.775 Mbit/s at H r =170
    m. However, we set the SNR-dependent CSI parameter as μ=0.01 , the max-min throughput
    of C= 4 increases up to 0.86 Mbit/s. Fig. 8 depicts the results for an imperfect
    system model which uses the perfect optimal PA factors shown in Fig. 5. Hence,
    Fig. 8(a) shows how the imperfect HIs affect the system’s performance that is
    optimized considering the error-free system parameters. Saying so, when ϕ=0.001
    , the small throughput degradation is noticed compared with the perfect HI case.
    However, when the HI level is increased to ϕ=0.005 , the max-min throughput of
    C= 4 shows a 50% decrease. It is also noticed that the impact of a higher level
    of HIs is more considerable on the larger cluster size than the lower one. For
    example, C= 1 and C= 4 achieve the best and worst performance with 0.94 Mbit/s
    and 0.65, respectively. This is because the NOMA users need to have proper PA
    factors to execute the SIC efficiently. Moreover, this issue becomes more crucial
    for a higher number of NOMA users per cluster. Furthermore, the imperfect CSI’s
    influence on the max-min throughput is shown in Fig. 8(b). Here, we plot cluster
    sizes of C= 1 and C= 2 considering different imperfect CSI scenarios. Similar
    to the previous subplot results, the higher value of the imperfection, i.e., when
    θ=0.005 and μ=0 , degrades the higher cluster size throughput. However, when the
    channel imperfection becomes SNR-dependent by setting μ=0.005 , both cluster sizes’
    throughput performance is improved. Besides, by setting μ=0.1 , the channel CSI
    model approaches the perfect case and obtains the maximum max-min throughput,
    which is identical to the perfect system model’s result without any imperfections.
    The results shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 reveal the importance of the consideration
    of the system impairments during the optimization process. Fig. 8. Imperfect max-min
    throughput performance with perfect optimal PA factors. Show All D. Performance
    Evaluation of the Proposed User Clustering Approach To evaluate the performance
    of the proposed user clustering and channel assignment approach, we compare it
    with an optimal ILP benchmark, which is computed by Gurobi and MOSEK solvers of
    the CVX [65]. The elapsed time for both approaches are shown in Table II, where
    we set K=N for the sake of simplicity and time consumed for computing closed-form
    power and phase-time allocations are included. It is obvious from Table II that
    the time complexity difference between these two approaches significantly increases
    as K=N increases. For instance, the ILP-CVX takes more than 3, 4, and 5 orders
    magnitude of time for K=N is 20, 25, and 30, respectively. At this point, we must
    note that the proposed approach reaches 100% accuracy at all cases. Since the
    ILP-CVX takes extremely long time for K=N> 30, we show the elapsed time only for
    the proposed approach in Table III, which shows that the LBA approach can provide
    a solution in less than half a second for 500 users. TABLE II Elapsed Time Comparison
    Between the ILP Benchmark and LBA Approach TABLE III Elapsed Time for the Proposed
    Clustering Approach E. The Optimality of the Proposed Solution Methodology Let
    us discuss the optimality of the proposed solution method based on the cases according
    to the need for iterations. No iteration (K = N): In this case, the resource allocation,
    user clustering, and channel assignment subproblems are executed once. The most
    important factor in evaluating the optimality of dividing these joint subproblems
    directly pertains to the relationship between their variables. While the resource
    allocation problem optimizes the real-valued power control (α,β) and phase-time
    allocation (λ) variables, the user clustering and channel assignment problem deal
    with the binary variable χ . Since these real variables and binary variable are
    independent of each other, decoupling resource allocation from user clustering
    and channel assignment problem is possible. That is, if each subproblem returns
    optimal values on its own, exploiting optimal resource allocation values in the
    clustering approach would yield an overall optimal solution for a given UAV location.
    The optimality of proposed closed-form power and phase-time allocation has already
    been discussed in Section VII-B and validated with numerical benchmarks. In Section
    VII-D, time complexity and accuracy comparison of the developed clustering approach
    with the optimal ILP solution also showed that the LBA provides almost optimal
    results. Therefore, one can conclude that the proposed solution methodology provides
    almost optimal results. Iterative clustering (K>N): Since each iteration admits
    at most one more user to the current cluster sets, the main problem of the iterative
    case is the order of new member additions. Being motivated by the fact that the
    minimum/maximum of a set is irrespective to the order within the set (i.e., min(a,b)=min(b,a)
    ), one can expect that the order of admitting new members to the cluster would
    not affect the final result as long as the LBA selects the correct member at each
    iteration. In order to validate this claim, we considered three different scenarios
    for K= 15 and N= 10: 10 users with the highest rates are selected as initial cluster
    members and the remaining 5 is admitted to clusters by using the LBA approach,
    10 users with the lowest rates are selected as initial cluster members and the
    remaining 5 is admitted to clusters by using the LBA approach, The initial cluster
    members are selected randomly and the remaining 5 is admitted to clusters by using
    the LBA approach. The obtained results showed that these three cases yield the
    same overall max-min rate and confirmed that the proposed iterative approach is
    not affected by the order cluster member admission. F. Convergence Analysis The
    clustering and resource allocation sub-problem S P 2 terminates in I=⌈N/K⌉ iterations
    as shown in Algorithm 1. Therefore, we focus our attention on the convergence
    behavior of the simulated annealing algorithm used for the deployment sub-problem.
    To this end, we consider two cases for initial locations: In Case 1, the searching
    point starts at the SBS, i.e., {d, H r }={0,0} . However, Fig. 4 shows that the
    best end-to-end channel SNR can be obtained at the hot-spot edge closest to the
    SBS. Indeed, the best hovering location would be at the hot-spot center if the
    SBS-UAV is perfect, which is not the case in practice. Therefore, UAV can provide
    better performance if it moves toward the SBS to enhance the SBS-UAV link to improve
    the end-to-end performance. Therefore, in Case 2, we select the initial search
    point at a hot-spot edge with SBS height, i.e., as {d, H r }={300,20} . By doing
    so, we can decrease the searching time for obtaining the optimal d and H r . For
    N= 50 users with cluster sizes C= {1, 2, 3, 4}, Fig. 9(a) shows that Case 2 provides
    a better convergence rate with 12 iterations over 3.04 seconds, compared to the
    Case-2’s convergence in 40 iterations over 6.57 seconds. At this point, we must
    note that our approach converges faster than the 60 iterations reported in [41],
    where authors also formulate an MINLP problem for UAV deployment, power allocation,
    and user association. Since each iteration runs S P 2 to evaluate the fitness
    of the UAV deployment, the proposed clustering and resource allocation approach
    is resulted in 0.16–0.25 seconds on average. Indeed, Algorithm 1 ’s fast convergence
    in terms of the number of iterations and related time complexity shows the efficacy
    and low complexity of the proposed solution methodology. This is mainly thanks
    to the closed-form power allocation and LBA’s high performance explained in the
    previous section. Fig. 9. Impact of the UAV location and cluster size on the max-min
    throughput: a) convergence of Algorithm 1; b) max-min throughput for various height
    and distance when C= 2; and c) optimal UAV location and max-min throughput for
    clusters with different sizes. Show All G. Impacts of User Density and Cluster
    Size on Optimal UAV Deployment In Fig. 9(b), we find an optimal UAV location for
    cluster size C= 2, where we vary distances of d and H r . As it is shown from
    the plot, the max-min throughput of 1.626 Mbit/s is obtained at optimal locations
    when d= 380 m and H r =80 m. It is noticed that the max-min throughput is lower
    when H r is closer to the ground, i.e., 0–10 m. This is due to the higher probability
    of NLoS link as the UAV is located below the SBS height. On the other hand, when
    H r >200 m, the achieved max-min throughput degrades due to the increase of the
    PL impact on the system performance when the UAV flies at a higher altitude. Moreover,
    the optimal location of d= 380 m is close to the center of the hot-spot. The reason
    for that is as follows. The UAV has lower available transmission power than the
    SBS. Therefore, the UAV needs to fly closer to the NOMA users in order to provide
    maximum throughput in the access link. Fig. 9(c) illustrates users clustering
    and searching the max-min throughput as well as the optimal UAV location, i.e.,
    d and H r , described in Algorithm 1. Here, we consider the cases when the total
    number of secondary NOMA users, which are randomly distributed within the hot-spot
    radius, is equal to N= 50, 100, 150, 200 and the maximum cluster size is C= 4.
    Moreover, we provide the results of the simulated annealing algorithm as it showed
    4 times quicker elapsed time performance compared to the particle swarm optimization.
    When N= 50 and C= 1, the total number of clusters is 50 and each cluster has just
    1 user, which can be considered as an OMA case. The max-min throughput for all
    clusters is 0.73 Mbit/s. Then, when C= 2, the max-min throughput increases by
    0.1 Mbit/s. This shows the outperformance of the NOMA mode compared to the OMA
    one. Furthermore, when the cluster size increased to C= 3, the max-min throughput
    is 0.89 Mbit/s, which is for 0.06 Mbit/s higher than that of C= 2 mode. When C=
    4, the max-min throughput equals to 0.93 Mbit/s, which 0.04 Mbit/s higher than
    the previous cluster size. As can be seen from the pattern of the throughput increase,
    a considerable performance improvement happens when the OMA mode transforms into
    NOMA with a cluster size of 2. On the other hand, the throughput performance shows
    only a slight improvement when the cluster size is increased from C= 2 to C= 3
    and from C= 3 to C= 4. The reason for that is the next: despite the broad bandwidth
    of higher clusters compared to lower clusters, the increase of the number of users
    in each cluster also raises the level of interference within that cluster. As
    a result, that interference negatively impacts on the end-to-end SINDR of users.
    Furthermore, when N= 100, we see that the max-min throughput for C= 1 and C= 2,
    3, 4 decreases for 0.4 and 0.5 Mbit/s, respectively, compared to the same cluster
    sizes when N= 50. Similarly, the max-min throughput reduces by further increasing
    the number of users to 150 and 200. The throughput reduction happens since the
    total transmission power is divided among the NOMA users, which means that each
    user achieve less power for the signal detection. It is worth noting that the
    optimal d and H r after averaging values of all clusters are equal to 399 m and
    83 m, respectively. H. Impact of Decoding Order on Optimal UAV Deployment All
    above results are obtained considering descending decoding order for NOMA users,
    i.e., higher PA is provided to cluster members with lower channel gains. Here,
    we compare the max-min throughput performance of the descending decoding order
    with that of ascending and random decoding orders. We consider four NOMA users,
    which are located differently in each scenario (see Fig. 10). In Scenario 1, all
    users are distributed within the entire hot-spot region, while, users are located
    before and after the center of the hot-spot in Scenarios 2 and 3, respectively.
    In Scenario 1, considering that the secondary base station (SBS) is located at
    the coordinate (0,0, H s ) , the coordinates of users are as follows: { d 1 ;
    d 2 ; d 3 ; d 4 }={(500,400,0);(450,400,0);(350,400,0);(300,400,0)} . Fig. 10.
    Different scenarios for the users’ allocation in the hot-spot. Show All Let us
    consider three decoding order methods for downlink NOMA users. 1) descending decoding
    order, where the users located further/closer to the SBS are allocated with the
    higher/weaker PA factors. 2) ascending decoding order, where closer/further users
    are provided with higher/weaker power. 3) random decoding order, when users are
    randomly located within the cluster and, as a result, decoding order becomes random,
    neither ascending nor descending. Fig. 11 illustrates the max-min throughput performance
    for all scenarios with the considered system settings for different decoding orders.
    In Fig. 11(a) illustrates the max-min throughput when the height of the UAV is
    fixed at H r =100 m and the UAV hovers within the hot-spot area. The results of
    Scenario 1 shows that the max-min throughput for descending and ascending decoding
    orders is equal to 1.308 Mbit/s. We also notice that the optimal max-min throughput
    for the cluster is found at the edge of the hot-spot closer/further to the SBS
    when the decoding order is arranged in descending/ascending manner. This illustrates
    that the UAV hovers closer to the user with a weaker PA allocation factor to optimize
    max-min throughput despite the decoding order methods. Moreover, the system achieves
    the worst max-min throughput when the decoding order is randomized. It is noticed
    that the optimal UAV location in this scenario is at the center of the hot-spot,
    which is also the transition point for the optimal max-min throughput of descending
    and ascending decoding orders. Similarly, the max-min throughput results for Scenarios
    1 and 2 show that achieved max-min throughput is the same for both descending
    and ascending decoding orders and the transition point is at the middle distance
    of the users’ location range. Fig. 11. Max-min throughput performance with different
    decoding orders. Show All In Fig. 11(b), we consider Scenario 1 and provide how
    max-min throughput performance changes with different decoding orders when d=
    {250; 400; 650} m and various H r . We can notice that the descending decoding
    order provides the best throughput results when d= 250 m. On the other hand, ascending
    decoding order provides the best performance when d= 650 m. Moreover, when d=
    400 m, which is the center of the hot-spot and transition point for descending
    and ascending decoding orders as shown in the previous results for Scenario 1,
    these two decoding orders obtain the same throughput results for all H r . However,
    the random decoding order achieves a slight better throughput than above mentioned
    orders at h r =20−100 m. From the results in Fig. 11 and Fig. 11(b), we can deduce
    that, in order to obtain the optimal max-min throughput over the more extended
    range of d , an optimal decoding order can be chosen depending on the hovering
    location of the UAV. For example, one can choose descending or ascending decoding
    orders before or after the transition point, respectively, while random decoding
    order may be preferable when the UAV is located at the center of the hot spot.
    SECTION VIII. Conclusion The CCR-NOMA is an inherent remedy to achieve a high
    spectral efficiency at large-scale networks. Considering expeditious 3D deployment
    capabilities of UAVs, their use as cooperative relays paves the way for the enhanced
    network performance. In this regard, this paper investigated the optimal UAV deployment
    by accounting for clustering, channel assignment, and resource allocation sub-problems.
    To reduce the computational time complexity, we derived closed-form solutions
    for optimal resource allocations for a user cluster. The closed-form solutions
    are then used by the proposed user clustering and channel assignment heuristics,
    which is fast yet highly accurate. The UAV deployment problem exploits this framework
    to evaluate the fitness of locations to find the optimal UAV placement. Besides,
    the obtained results demonstrated that the optimization needs to take into account
    inevitable real-time imperfections to accommodate a practical communication system.
    Appendix Proof of Lemma 1 For the sake of clarity of the presentation, let us
    omit the cluster indices. For simplicity, we consider a two-user case, where γ
    j i denotes the SIDNR of SUj in the phase i . For a two-user case, the end-to-end
    SIDNRs, considering the deterministic channel and perfect SIC, are given by γ
    1 =min( γ 1 1 , γ 1 2 ) and γ 2 =min( γ 2 1 , γ 2 2 ) . Following from Propositions
    1 and 2, we need to solve the following set of equations to find the optimal power
    allocation and SIDNRs: 1) γ j i =ω,∀(i,j) , 2) ∑ j α j ≤min{1, ITC 1 P k s | g
    k s | 2 } , and 3) ∑ j β j ≤min{1, ITC 2 P k r | g k r | 2 } , where ITC1 and
    ITC2 are the ITC constraints of the first and second phases, respectively. Since
    the first phase only involves variables α and ω , we obtain α 2 = f 2 (ω) and
    α 1 = f 1 (ω) from equations γ 2 1 =ω and γ 1 1 =ω as follows α 2 = α 1 = ω I
    r , ω α 2 +ω I r = ω 2 I r +ω I r . (A.1a) (A.1b) View Source Since the second
    phase only involves variables β and ω , we obtain β 2 = g 2 (ω) and β 1 = g 1
    (ω) from equations γ 2 2 =ω and γ 1 2 =ω as follows β 2 = β 1 = ω I 2 , ω β 2
    +ω I 1 = ω 2 I 2 +ω I 1 , (A.2a) (A.2b) View Source where the definitions of I
    r and I n , ∀n∈{1,2} , are provided in Lemma 1. By substituting α 1 and α 2 from
    (A.1) into ∑ j α j ≤min{1, ITC 1 P k s | g k s | 2 } , as well as after some mathematical
    manipulations, we can find the optimal SIDNR of the 1 st phase as γ ⋆ 1 = Φ 1
    I r +1 − − − − − − √ −1, (A.3) View Source where Φ 1 is defined in Section V-A.
    Moreover, substituting β 1 and β 2 from (A.2) into ∑ j β j ≤min{1, ITC 2 } , the
    optimal SIDNR of the second phase can be derived by γ ⋆ 2 = 4 I 2 Φ 2 + ( I 1
    + I 2 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ − I 1 − I 2 2 I 2 , (A.4) View Source
    where Φ 2 is defined in Section V-A. Then, the optimal SIDNR can be derived as
    γ ⋆ =min( γ ⋆ 1 , γ ⋆ 2 ) . Finally, optimal power allocation factors can be obtained,
    after substituting γ ⋆ with ω in (A.1) / (A.2), and written as α ⋆ 1 = α ⋆ 2 =
    β ⋆ 1 = β ⋆ 2 = γ ⋆ 2 I r + γ ⋆ I r , γ ⋆ I r , γ ⋆ 2 I 2 + γ ⋆ I 1 , γ ⋆ I 2
    . (A.5a) (A.5b) (A.5c) (A.5d) View Source By repeating similar steps for C>2 ,
    we obtain the optimal SIDNRs and power allocations as tabulated in Table IV. Based
    on the observed pattern in Table IV, the generalized closed-form equations for
    a cluster size C can be obtained as in Lemma 1. TABLE IV The Closed-Form Optimal

  description: Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) aided Cognitive Radio (CR) communication
    has been investigated as one of the primary candidates to fulfill the huge spectrum
    requirements of next generation wireless networks. To enhance the reliability
    and security aspects of CR-NOMA networks, we in this work incorporated cooperative
    relay-based communication. Cooperative transmission is a promising technology

    Bulgaria SECTION I. Introduction The vision of the wireless communication realm
    has been directed towards a humanitarian perspective in the form of digital societies,
    aiming to satisfy a wide range of new applications and use-cases [1]. Consequently,
    this new trend has led to a paradigm shift in the wireless communication industry,
    going from mere communication systems towards a convergence of multiple functionalities
    with an exploding data traffic and stringent user demands [2], [3]. In partic-ular,
    fifth-generation (5G) and beyond wireless networks are expected to support ten
    times more transmission rate compared with the conventional fourth-generation
    (4G) systems, while performing transmission below 1 millisecond [4]. Therefore,
    such a vision needs ubiquitous connectivity with high flexibility and efficient
    utilization of the spectrum. In line with this, several works have discussed ubiquitous
    connectivity under the context of cognitive radios (CRs), which is considered
    as a key enabler technology for efficient spectrum utilization [5]. Basically,
    the CR technology offers the opportunity to use the radio resources in an adaptive
    way, and thus, it can enhance the overall capacity for the wireless network operators.
    In particular, this technology allows us to sense the intended spectrum and decide
    about the occupancy state of these frequency channels, and thus, the wireless
    devices can reconfigure the communication link parameters in order to meet the
    user demands [6]. For instance, in CR, the frequency channel is located to the
    primary user (PU) to perform communication, while the secondary user (SU) needs
    to wait till this spectrum becomes idle [7]. Unfortunately, classical techniques
    of continuous spectrum sensing are restricted to the energy efficiency, transmission
    time, and system complexity. For this reason, spectrum prediction has been considered
    as an alternative approach to these challenges. In the literature, several methods
    for the prediction of spectrum occupancy have been proposed and discussed with
    the decision making process for the idle frequency channels [8], [9]. However,
    the majority of the conventional methods utilize overhead and need to scan the
    entire spectrum in order to identify any idle channel [7], and thus, these schemes
    suffer from low time and energy efficiency, which can become critical for applications
    with stringent latency and energy demands [10]. In line with this, machine learning
    (ML)-based techniques have attracted the interest of academia and industry in
    order to empower the process of spectrum prediction. For instance, in [11], authors
    utilize support vector machine (SVM) in order to identify patterns of spectrum
    occupancy for the PU, and thus, they can allocate the information of SU accordingly.
    In [12], Lunden et al. enhance the performance of spectrum sensing with the aid
    of reinforcement learning schemes. A prediction model based on the Long Short
    Time Memory (LSTM) has been designed and then trained with the aid of supervised
    learning before prediction, in [13]. Moreover, in [14], Selim et al. offer a convolutional
    neural network (CNN) based framework, aiming to identify the presence of radar
    signals even in case the desired signal suffers from interference for the intended
    spectrum. In [15], Shawel et al. have introduced a spectrum prediction architecture
    by utilizing Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Deep Learning Neural
    Network (DLNN), learning jointly spatial and tem-poral correlation observed in
    the spectrum occupancy. In this line, among the above techniques, deep learning-based
    solutions have shown a strong ability to explore the underlying temporal correlations
    between input data. Hence, aiming to offer a long-term prediction of spectrum
    occupancy, we proposed to apply a gated recurrent unit network (GRU) based design
    to perform spectrum prediction by utilizing the minimum and maximum “MinMax” values
    of the spectrum dataset instead of binary “Bin” value approach. Briefly, the main
    contributions of this study are listed as follows. Fig. 1: The architecture of
    the GRU. Show All Design of a new GRU-based architecture for spectrum occupancy
    prediction in order to capture the joint temporal spectrum features of the spectrum.
    Assess the performance of the proposed architecture with real environment data
    measurements under differ-ent spectrum bands and scenarios. The training and prediction
    window should be designed with respect to the spectrum characteristics in order
    to enhance the system''s accuracy. The remainder of this paper is organized as
    follows. Section II provides insides on the systems model and de-scribes the proposed
    GRU-based technique. Moreover, this section details the measurement setup with
    the procedures used to perform data collection. In Section III, we present the
    measurement results and assess the performance of the proposed spectrum prediction
    mechanism. The last section provides concluding remarks and potential future directions.
    SECTION II. Preliminaries In this section, we briefly describe the model that
    we use in order to predict the spectrum occupancy, leveraging from the previous
    occupancy trend. Technically speaking, the heterogeneous spectrum access method
    is used in order to model the spectrum access, where N number of equally spaced
    band-chunks have been used to split the spectrum [16]. In other words, the presence
    and the absence of a any signal is denoted as occupied spectrum or hole, respectively,
    and mathematically given as follows x={ Hs+n, n, H 1 : if the spectrum is occupied
    H 0  if the spectrum is hole, (1) View Source where s is the transmitted signal
    by operators, H is the channel matrix, and n is the noise impact. x represents
    the received signal within a particular band. In line with (1), in case of the
    conventional scheme that uses binary “Bin” format of spectrum occupancy, the idle
    spectrum is recorded as 0 and the occupied spectrum as 1, respectively. A. The
    Architecture of the GRU GRU scheme finds place under the category of recur-rent
    neural network (RNN). This category of models has been developed to facilitate
    the problem of the Vanishing-Exploding gradients due to the utilization of gradient
    -based learning methods and back propagation process in order to train the artificial
    neural networks (ANNs). Specifically, it is composed of three gates and does not
    include any internal cell state, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Moreover, at a particular
    time slot t a GRU node consists of an update gate Z 1 , a reset gate r t , and
    a current memory gate h ~ t , which are given as follows z t =σ( W z [ h t−1 ,
    x t ]), r t =σ( W r [ h t−1 , x t ]), h ~ t =tanh( W c ( h t−1 ⊙ r t , x t )),
    h t =( z t ⊙ h ~ t )+((1− z t ) h t−1 ), (2) View Source where W r and W r represent
    the weight matrices between the hidden state ( h t ) and the last-round hidden
    state ( h t−1 ) , respectively. x t denotes the input data and at the particular
    time slot t, W c is a concatenate matrix, and ⊙ represents the element wise multiplication
    process. Moreover, the update port defines the amount of the knowledge of the
    past that can be used in the future. Differently, the reset port determines how
    much of the information to be forgotten in the future. Moreover, in order to improve
    the accuracy of the GRU-based spectrum prediction models, different parameter
    tests i.e., the number of hidden layers, cells, batches and epochs has to be considered.

    Show All Table I: System parameters for dataset measurement B. Measurement Setup
    In this work, the measurements take place via a direct measurement of the energy
    for the intended spectrum as a function of frequency, time, and space. Moreover,
    we measure the noise power. In line with this, we use a Rohde & Schwarz FDH6 Portable
    Spectrum Analyzer, which is connected to a high performance discone antenna named
    AOR DA5000, in order to collect the data. This antenna is omnidirectional and
    it has a frequency range of 700–3000 MHz. In addition, a USB-optical cable is
    used to connect the spectrum analyzer with a laptop in order to store the measurements
    in real-time. In Table. I, we show the parameter settings of the spectrum analyzer
    for the study. We obtain the binary spectrum occupancy via thresholding the measurements,
    where “0” and “1” represent occupied spectrum and unoccupied spectrum, respectively,
    as in (1). In particular, we consider the noise power level as 75dBm and the equipment
    error of 3dBm, hence the reference threshold is 72dBm. During this study, to have
    sufficient and diverse data measurements considering both high and low population
    activity, we perform data collection for seven (7) consecutive days. Moreover,
    the rate of the data collection is 1 swept per minute ( sw min ) . Hence, the
    total number of sweeps is equal to N sw =1 sw min 60 min h 24 h day 7.5dαy . C.
    Measurement Process and Geographical Locations In this study, we take the measurements
    from Educational City, in Doha, which is the capital city of Qatar, with a very
    diverse level of population activity, and thus, we can investigate the performance
    of the utilized scheme. We use the same measurement setup at each of the locations.
    The starting measurement time is 8:00 AM with local Qatar time (GMT+3) on November
    25, 2021, and the ending measurement time is 1:00 PM on December 1, 2021. It is
    worth mentioning that we use different places and a wide range of time in order
    to analyze and benefit from the variability of the inherent characteristics of
    the spectrum occupancy regarding frequency, time, and space, as shown in Fig.
    2. The Education City is generally a flat area with several universities, a national
    library, many stadiums, several large parks, and a central subway station. Hence,
    it is an important point for traffic with high population activity. This makes
    this region very crowded during rush hour and commute times. For instance, there
    exist several dining places that make it crowded during the lunch and dinner time.
    In Fig. 3, we show the aerial map of the Educational City and the corresponding
    measurement location (MeLo) in paricular. The first MeLo (MeLo 1) is placed in
    the southwest part of the Educational City, including a large park that is surrounded
    by several residential buildings and restaurants, and some construction work going
    on. The MeLo 2 is a flat area, where the data is collected from the wireless communication
    lab of Texas AM University at Qatar (TAMUQ) Engineering building. As shown in
    Fig. 5, the average spectrum occupancy is around 10% for both MeLo 1 and MeLo
    2, with a slight 1 %-2% higher average spectrum occupancy for MeL02 compared with
    MeLo 1. Lastly, the MeLo 3 represents the most crowded region, where the measurements
    are collected from Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) building, which is surrounded
    by schools, universities, training centers, etc. In Fig. 5, it clearly obvious
    that the percentage of spectrum occupancy (above 30%) is at least three times
    higher compared with MeLo 1 and MeLo 2 scenarios. Basically, these locations are
    chosen wisely in order to exploit a diverse range of frequency, time and space
    diversity for a more efficient utilization of the radio resources. As a result,
    a better assessment for the RNN-based spectrum prediction can be established.
    In addition to average spectrum occupancy, Fig. 4 shows the average power density
    of the all data measurements (i.e., the entire time period) at the aforementioned
    locations. It is worth mentioning that MeLo 3 offers the strongest received signal
    strength and MeLo 1 has the lowest received signal strength. Fig. 3: Geographical
    area of the education city. Show All Fig. 4: Average power spectral density vs
    bandwidth at different locations. Show All Fig. 5: Percentage of spectrum utilization
    vs time at different locations. Show All SECTION III. Performance Results and
    Discussions In this section, the performance of the proposed design has been investigated
    and discussed over the diverse data sets, which have been recorded over-the-air,
    as described in the II-C. The data length of each sweep is 301 samples. For this
    study, the dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing processes
    in proportions of 3/4, 1/8, and 1/8, respectively. In other words, the dataset
    of the first 5.6 days has been used for the training of the spectrum prediction
    architecture, the dataset of the following day is used for validation, and thus,
    the last day is utilized for the testing stage. We conduct several experiments
    to test the performance of the spectrum prediction schemes. For all the experiments,
    we fixed the number of the epochs to 10, the batch size to 64, and the hidden
    size to 50 while utilizing a learning rate ϵ=0.001 . It is worth mentioning that
    the goal of this work is not to optimize the aforementioned parameters, but to
    investigate the ability of the spectrum prediction method. In addition, the models
    for the spectrum occupancy prediction are trained and tested on an Lenovo computer
    with Intel®Core™i7-10750H central processing unit (CPU) @ 2.60GHz, graphical processing
    unit (GPU), the graphic processing unit (GPU) is NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 and Windows
    11 operating system. Moreover, all the datasets are individually trained over
    the spectrum sensing models. To assess the performance of the given spectrum sensing
    mechanism, four measurement metrics have been considered including validation
    accuracy (“Te. Acu.”) and loss (“Te. Loss”), training accuracy (“Tr. Acu.”) and
    loss (“Tr. Loss”), as shown in Table. II for epoch 1, since the processing time
    depends on the number of epochs. In addition, the processing time decreases as
    the accuracy of epoch 1 increases, opening up the possibility of applications
    with strict latency constraints in 5G and beyond wireless systems. These results
    indicate clearly the validity of the GRU-based spectrum prediction method. A more
    detailed discussion of the spectrum occupancy prediction for realistic measurements
    via GRU-based approach is given as follows. Table II: Accuracy and loss at epoch
    1 for the proposed gru method. In Fig. 6, we show how the training accuracy varies
    with the increase of the number of iterations. From Fig. 6, we see that as the
    number of iterations increases, the accuracy of the considered spectrum prediction
    schemes first increases and then begins to saturate. The fact that the accuracy
    remains unchanged shows explicitly that the spectrum prediction scheme is converging.
    In addition, we can also see that the increasing speed of accuracy value varies
    during each iteration. This is related to the fact that the dataset received by
    the spectrum analyzer may not contain the same data quality for all the measurement
    environments. In line with this, the best validation accuracy is achieved for
    the MeLo 3 for both “Bin” and “MinMax” scenarios of spectrum occupancy prediction,
    since MeLo 3 has a high bandwidth utilization percentage of above 30% and a good
    signal quality versus noise as illustrated via Fig. 5 and Fig. 4, respectively.
    In other words, a high percentage of the spectrum utilization increases the performance
    of GRU-based spectrum prediction techniques at processing the sequence data, since
    the pattern of the sequence becomes more prominent and it is less affected by
    the noise influence. Therefore, for MeLo 1 scenario the “MinMax” method offers
    at least 1 % better accuracy within first 4 epochs compared with “Bin” method,
    since “MinMax” can better explore the correlation, which is less strong after
    the binary decision, as shown in Fig. 7 via blue lines. Moreover, this performance
    difference increases to at least 2% within the first 10 epochs. In this line,
    the performance difference exceeds 2.5% within the first 2 epochs for MeLo 2,
    since the pattern characteristics decay as the percentage of the spectrum utilization
    reduces as shown in Fig. 5. Different from MeLo 2 and MeLo 3, the accuracy of
    all spectrum prediction schemes does not exceed 78% for MeLo 1 scenario, as shown
    in Fig. 7. In other words, the prediction accuracy is limited from the weak signal
    strength quality and low percentage of spectrum utilization that consequently
    raises the noise impact and reduces the pattern correlation characteristics, respectively,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 5. In order to enhance the performance of
    the spectrum prediction, we perform subband-based prediction by taking into consideration
    the signal-to-noise ratio. For instance, in Fig. 7 we give the performance of
    the spectrum prediction architectures evaluated only for the first 25% of the
    dataset from Fig. 2(a), since the impact of the noise is less in this subband.
    In consequence, a gap in the performance accuracy by at least 20% exists between
    the intelligent noise-based methods and baselines, which utilize the whole spectrum.
    Therefore, the proposed method “MinMax” for spectrum occupancy exceeds 90% reliability
    after the first 4 epochs. It is worth noting that the accuracy difference between
    method “MinMax” and method “Bin” is at least 5%. Fig. 6: Accuracy graphs for the
    proposed spectrum prediction mechanism. Show All Fig. 7: Accuracy graphs for the
    proposed spectrum prediction mechanism with intelligent band selection. Show All
    Beyond fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication systems are expected to provide
    solutions for the wireless communication society, considering a wide range of
    applications and demands in the near future, where a flexible and intelligent
    utilization of the radio resources will become inevitable for wireless communication
    operators [17], [18]. Therefore, the design of practical spectrum prediction techniques,
    enabling CR-based technologies will play a crucial role in the future of the wireless
    communication realm. SECTION IV. Conclusion In this work, a GRU-based spectrum
    prediction mecha-nism has been designed and discussed in order to enhance the
    prediction of the spectrum occupancy for wideband wireless communication technologies.
    In particular, it has been shown that the accuracy of the GRU-based spectrum prediction
    is improved, and it is assessed via real datasets that represent measurements
    from the city of Doha. Briefly, in contrary to the conventional GRU-based spectrum
    occu-pancy prediction schemes with binary “Bin” input datasets (idle is “0” and
    occupied is “1”), minimum and maximum “MinMax” recorded measurements have been
    utilized for the spectrum prediction process. Moreover, in this work, it has been
    shown that percentage of the spectrum usage and received signal strength can significantly
    impact the decision-making stage for the prediction process. Hence, subband selection
    considering the noise adjustment has been proposed to relax the aforementioned
    misleading impacts on the prediction accuracy for spectrum occupancy. It is worth
    noting that a generalization of this study taking into account the various system
    configuration parameters such as ∊, higher number of epochs under the impact of
    signal-to-noise and interference ratio are imperative to investigate, which remains
    as our future studies. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This publication was made possible by the

    Introduction It is very challenging for current wireless networks to serve the
    ever-increasing Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications over the scarce spectrum
    using orthogonal resource allocation. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is
    a promising technique to break the orthogonality constraint for resource allocation
    [1]. Using joint superposition coding (SC) and successive interference cancellation
    (SIC), NOMA is able to serve multiple users in the same time-frequency resource,
    thus improving spectral efficiency and achieving massive connectivity. In addition,
    NOMA has the advantages of better fairness and lower latency compared to the conventional
    orthogonal multiple access (OMA), and is considered as a competitive candidate
    multiple access technique for next-generation wireless networks. Despite the aforementioned
    advantages, the broadcast nature of wireless channels poses new security challenges
    to NOMA networks, namely, the transmitted NOMA signals are vulnerable to passive
    eavesdropping attacks (where an eavesdropper remains silent while trying to decipher
    the confidential information based on its received NOMA signals), as illustrated
    in Fig. 1. Here, a base-station (BST) uses three orthogonal beams to connect three
    groups of users, and within each beam NOMA is applied to serve multiple users.
    In group 1, there is an external eavesdropper, while in group 2, an untrusted
    relay is used (i.e., the relay employs the designated amplify-and-forward protocol
    but may also try to decode the confidential information of the users). After the
    eavesdropper or the untrusted relay receives the superimposed signal from the
    BST, they can adopt SIC to decode and intercept all users'' information contained
    in the superimposed signal. In contrast, if OMA is used, by receiving a signal
    over a resource block, the eavesdropper or untrusted relay can only intercept
    one user''s information. Therefore, compared to OMA transmission, the use of NOMA
    triggers a more severe information leakage problem. In group 3, there are two
    users served by NOMA, and each user may serve as an internal eavesdropper and
    take advantage of SIC to overhear the signals of the other user. For example,
    if user-a (the near user) is an eavesdropper, it can decode user-b''s (the far
    user) signal easily, as user-a is designed to decode user-b''s signal first in
    SIC. If user-b is an eavesdropper, after retrieving its own signal, it tries to
    decode user-a''s signal through SIC. Thus, even without an external eavesdropper,
    the use of NOMA gives rise to internal privacy leakage. As a result, how to secure
    wireless NOMA communications against external/internal eavesdropping attacks is
    a new and challenging issue to address. In this context, physical-layer security
    has been recognized as an efficient means to enhance the transmission security
    of NOMA. Specifically, phys-ical-layer security exploits the intrinsic properties
    of wireless media to improve the secrecy rate, that is, the rate of the legitimate
    channel (from a legitimate transmitter to its legitimate receiver) minus that
    of the wiretap channel (from the legitimate transmitter to an eavesdropper) [2].
    Among all physical-layer security solutions, the use of network interference is
    highly appealing to secure NOMA communications, due to the following motivations:
    Intentionally generated interference, such as artificial noise (AN) and specifically-designed
    jamming signals (SJS) at the eavesdrop-per''s side, can make the wiretap channel
    a degraded version of the legitimate channel, which helps achieve a positive secrecy
    rate, that is, perfect security. Inter-user interference (IUI), which is inherent
    in NOMA due to the power-domain multiplexing, is traditionally treated as a deleterious
    factor to the legitimate users. However, the IUI also affects the eavesdropper
    and can be engineered toward a security advantage. By striking a balance between
    reducing the IUI at the legitimate users and amplifying the IUI at the eavesdropper,
    the secrecy rate can be increased significantly. In this article, we unveil the
    beneficial role of network interference for physical-layer security and investigate
    interference engineering strategies for secure NOMA communications. We provide
    an overview of three existing solutions that intelligently engineer the AN, SJS,
    and IUI to improve the transmission security of NOMA against passive eavesdropping
    attacks. Subsequently, by integrating NOMA with advanced wireless communication
    concepts, we propose several interference engineering strategies to exploit more
    network interference resources, which are inherent in full-duplex NOMA, intelligent
    reflecting surface (IRS) NOMA, cognitive radio NOMA, and multi-cell NOMA networks.
    Some open research problems and challenges are also discussed. Secure NOMA Communications
    via Artificial Noise Engineering In some cases, the distance from an eavesdropper
    to a BST may be shorter than those from the NOMA users to the BST. Due to the
    strong channel gain of the eavesdropper, any signal decoded by the users can also
    be decoded by the eavesdropper. Hence, it is beneficial to generate random AN
    to impair the signal reception quality of the eavesdropper. Ideally, AN should
    be engineered in the null space of the legitimate channels while only the wiretap
    channel is affected, which can be achieved using secure beamforming and cooperative
    jamming, shown as follows. Secure Beamforming The basic idea of secure beamforming
    is to let a user simultaneously transmit its signal and AN by using multiple-antenna
    techniques. In the conventional OMA scenario with only a single user, the signal
    beam is designed based on maximum ratio transmission (MRT) to enhance the reception
    quality of the user, and the AN beam is designed based on the zero-forcing (ZF)
    metric to avert the negative effect of the AN on the user. However, the use of
    NOMA brings fundamental challenges to the design of secure beamforming [3]. One
    challenge is that employing MRT based signal beams for different users is no longer
    suitable for NOMA. This can be illustrated by using a typical two-user NOMA example
    shown on the left side of Fig. 2, where the signals intended for user-1 (who has
    a strong channel gain) and user-2 (who has a weak channel gain) are denoted by
    s1 and s2, respectively. If MRT is applied, that is, the BST independently precodes
    the signal beam v1 (for transmitting s1) based on the channel gain of user-1 and
    the signal beam v2 (for transmitting s2) based on the channel gain of user-2,
    the received signal strengths of s1 and s2 are maximized at user-1 and user-2,
    respectively. This may result in an SIC failure at user-1, due to the fact that
    the IUI caused by s1 is also maximized when user-1 first decodes s2 in SIC, and
    thus, the system performance is degraded significantly. To guarantee both reliability
    and secrecy in NOMA transmissions, the signal beams v1 and v2 should be jointly
    designed using a weighted combination of the channel gains of both users [4],
    where the weighting coefficients are optimized to satisfy that: 1) at user-1,
    the received signal powers of s1 and s2 are boosted simultaneously to guarantee
    uscr-1 ‘s perfect SIC and signal decoding; and 2) at user-2, the received signal
    power of s2 is enhanced while the received interference power of s1 is suppressed
    to benefit user-2''s successful signal decoding. In addition, the AN beam v0 is
    engineered via ZF without affecting the legitimate channels of both users. As
    a result, by increasing the transmit power of the BST, the achievable rates of
    the users are improved while the achievable rate of the eavesdropper saturates,
    and perfect security for NOMA communications is achieved [4]. Figure 1. Typical
    passive eavesdropping attacks in NOMA networks. Show All Another challenge is
    that transmitting the AN in the null space of all legitimate channels may be impossible
    for a large number of NOMA users, since in this case the BST does not have sufficient
    degrees of freedom (DoF) to perform ZF. To address this problem, one viable solution
    is to employ user grouping and scheduling, that is, first dividing multiple users
    into several orthogonal groups with each group occupying a single resource block
    (i.e., a time slot), and then using NOMA to schedule the users in each group [5].
    As such, the BST has enough DoF to perfectly null out the AN in the user group
    and make the AN solely affect the eavesdropper, thereby ensuring the security
    of NOMA. Note that secure beamforming also performs well in the presence of multiple
    eavesdroppers. This is because AN is transmitted isotropical-ly except toward
    the legitimate users in secure beamforming, and the performance of all the eavesdroppers
    will be degraded by the AN. Cooperative Jamming In untrusted relay networks with
    no direct link between a BST and a user, cooperative jamming is an efficient means
    to prevent information from being leaked to the untrusted relay. In OMA, this
    strategy exploits the user as a helper in the first phase to send the AN to jam
    the relay when the BST is transmitting to the relay, and as a receiver in the
    second phase to retrieve the BST''s signal after employing the self-AN cancellation.
    Figure 2. AN engineering for secure NOMA communications: secure beamforming and
    cooperative jamming. Show All Figure 3. SJS engineering for secure NOMA communications:
    transmission rate control and decoding order design. Show All Therefore, only
    the reception quality of the relay is degraded by the AN, which is beneficial
    to improve the secrecy performance. As compared to the traditional OMA case, cooperative
    jamming in NOMA needs extra efforts in dealing with more sophisticated AN cancellation
    at the user side, illustrated on the right side of Fig. 2. In particular, the
    BST applies NOMA to communicate with multiple users via an untrusted relay, where
    all the users assist the BST''s secrecy transmission by sending AN in a collaborative
    manner to the relay [6]. To make the AN cancellation possible, each user has to
    know the AN not only from itself but also from the other users a priori. Therefore,
    the physical-layer key distribution mechanism needs to be performed, where all
    users share the seed information of the AN generation to facilitate the AN cancellation.
    Although using all the users for cooperative jamming can maximally degrade the
    reception quality of the relay, the involved physical-layer key distribution inevitably
    incurs a very high computational complexity and is not scalable as the number
    of NOMA users becomes large. To simplify the AN cancellation at the users, an
    alternative approach is to select one user to transmit the AN and let the other
    users receive and cache the AN in the first phase. Then, in the second phase,
    all the users can cancel the received AN completely since a copy of the AN is
    transmitted by the selected user and cached by the other users previously [7].
    In this way, secrecy against the untrusted relay is promised by cooperative jamming
    without coordination, thereby ensuring low complexity. On the other hand, a single
    user only has limited transmit power and DoF to jam the relay effectively, particularly
    when the relay has a powerful signal detection/ cancellation ability (e.g., with
    multiple antennas). Multiuser cooperative jamming is a promising strategy to combat
    the powerful untrusted relay. Hence, a multiuser scheduling scheme has to be developed
    to optimize the trade-off between the secrecy performance and complexity. Cooperative
    jamming also performs well when multiple untrusted relays are adopted to help
    forward information from the BST to the users. This is because the AN, which is
    transmitted by either all the users or one selected user, can degrade reception
    quality of all untrusted relays. Several future research directions are discussed
    next. The aforementioned AN engineering strategies mainly focused on the communication
    security, but neglected the reliability performance. In fact, the security and
    reliability are coupled and affect each other. For instance, although the AN is
    helpful in confusing the eavesdropper, the AN generation consumes extra transmit
    power which leads to less transmit power available for signal transmission, and
    this degrades the reception quality of the users. Therefore, carefully engineering
    the AN to achieve a balanced security-reliabil-ity trade-off is an open and interesting
    problem. Furthermore, in cooperative jamming with two-way untrusted relaying,
    the AN sent by the users cannot be canceled by the BST and affects the BST''s
    signal reception. In this context, how to design secure and reliable cooperative
    jamming for two-way untrusted relaying is a challenging future research problem.
    Secure NOMA Communications via SJS Engineering One unique feature of NOMA is that
    the receiver has the SIC capability, which provides an opportunity to use the
    SJS for intentionally degrading the eavesdropper''s performance. Unlike the AN
    which has similar characteristics to the additive noise and cannot be decoded,
    the SJS is generated by using random codewords of a public codebook known by the
    users and the eavesdropper. The key issue is how to properly transmit the SJS,
    such that each user can decode and remove the SJS in the first step of SIC while
    the eavesdropper cannot do so, which is nontrivial. To resolve this issue, two
    promising strategies can be employed, namely, transmission rate control for SJS
    and decoding order design for SJS, as elaborated next. Transmission Rate Control
    for SJS We consider a NOMA-based coordinated direct and untrusted relay transmission
    (on the left side of Fig. 3) to illustrate this strategy. The uplink transmission
    consists of two phases. In the first phase, when user-2 is transmitting, user-1
    simultaneously transmits its signal and the SJS. Specifically, the transmission
    rate for the SJS is adapted according to the channel gain between user-1 and the
    BST, so that the BST can first decode and cancel the SJS by SIC without affecting
    its own signal decoding. The relay also tries to decode the SJS; however, the
    signals of both users will serve as interference to the SJS decoding, which results
    in a very low achievable rate smaller than the transmission rate of the SJS. Hence,
    the relay cannot decode the SJS. In the second phase, the relay forwards its received
    signals and user-1 transmits a new signal both to the BST. User-1 ‘s new signal
    is perfectly secured as the relay works in a half-duplex mode. The downlink transmission
    also comprises two phases. In the first phase, when the BST is transmitting, user-2
    concurrently transmits the SJS. To ensure that user-1 can decode the SJS before
    decoding the signals of the BST, the transmission rate of the SJS is selected
    based on channel knowledge of the user-2 → user-1 → BST link, which is independent
    of that of the user-2 → relay → BST link. Thus, it is very unlikely for the relay
    to decode and cancel the SJS. In the second phase, the relay forwards the received
    signal and the BST transmits a new signal to user-1. It is clear that in both
    the uplink and downlink, the SJS serves as useful jamming to degrade the wiretap
    channels of the relay, but does not affect the legitimate channels of the users/BST
    [8], thereby improving the secrecy rate performance. In Fig. 4, the ergodic secrecy
    sum rate (ESSR) of this SJS engineering strategy is compared to that of the AN
    based strategy, that is, user-1 and user-2 transmit AN instead of the SJS in the
    uplink and downlink, respectively. It is observed that the SJS engineering strategy
    achieves a much higher ESSR than the AN based strategy in both the uplink and
    downlink, and the performance gap between the two strategies increases as the
    system transmit power increases. This reveals that the SJS engineering is helpful
    in safeguarding physical-layer security of NOMA, especially when the use of AN
    interferes with the signal reception quality of the legitimate users. When multiple
    untrusted relays are used, this SJS engineering strategy can also be applied with
    minor modifications. In the first phase, the transmission rate of the SJS should
    be chosen such that the SJS can be decoded by user-1/BST but not by any of the
    untrusted relays, with more stringent transmission rate control. In the second
    phase, all the relays use distributed beamforming to forward signals. Figure 4.
    The ergodic secrecy sum rate performance. The average channel gains from the BST
    to relay, from the relay to user-2, from the BST to user-1, from user-1 to user-2,
    and from the relay to user-1 are set to 0.9, 0.9, 0.8, 1, and 0.5, respectively.
    Show All Decoding Order Design for SJS As shown on the right side of Fig. 3, the
    M-anten-na BST serves K NOMA users in the presence of an eavesdropper, where M
    < K + 1. As discussed previously, even equipped with multiple antennas, secure
    beamforming via AN fails to achieve a favorable security performance due to the
    AN leakage issue. To overcome this difficulty, the BST can transmit the SJS and
    create distinguished decoding orders for the SJS at the users and the eavesdropper.
    Assume that the BST knows the channel state information (CSI) of the users and
    the eavesdropper. Then the BST can design its beamforming vectors to increase
    the received power of the SJS to the highest at the users while decreasing the
    received power of the SJS to the lowest at the eavesdropper [9]. As such, each
    user can first decode the SJS with SIC to mitigate its adverse effect on the users,
    but the eavesdropper fails to recover the SJS because its decoding order for the
    SJS is the last. Furthermore, by maximizing the transmit power of the SJS subject
    to the constraint on the achievable rates of the users, the eavesdropping capability
    is impaired as much as possible while the reliability performance of the users
    is guaranteed. In the case of multiple eavesdroppers, the beamforming vectors
    of the BST should be designed to decrease the received power of the SJS to the
    lowest level at all the eavesdroppers, at the cost of more stringent power optimization.
    Apart from the above. progress, there are other interesting yet unsolved issues.
    For instance, instead of solely controlling the transmission rate or the decoding
    order of the SJS, a joint optimization of the transmission rate and the decoding
    order of the SS and NOMA signals is desired to further enhance the communication
    security. In addition, secrecy energy efficiency, defined as the sum secrecy rate
    per Joule energy consumption, is an important measure to quantify the efficient
    use of the SJS for a trade-off between energy savings and secrecy guarantees.
    Research on secrecy energy efficiency maximization for SJS engineering is still
    missing in the literature, which motivates future research works. Preliminary
    works have revealed that big secrecy benefits for NOMA can be drawn from intelligently
    engineering network interference. When we integrate NOMA with other advanced wireless
    communication technologies, more network interference resources can be exploited
    to enhance security. Secure NOMA Communications via IUI Engineering Another unique
    feature of NOMA is the inherent IUI, which traditionally plays a harmful role
    in reducing the signal reception quality of the users. In fact, the IUI simultaneously
    affects the users and the eavesdropper. If appropriately engineered, the IUI can
    be beneficial to improve secrecy by serving as jamming signals to confuse the
    eavesdropper. This approach is cost-effective, in the sense that the secrecy is
    guaranteed not by constructing AN or SJS that consumes extra communication resources,
    but rather by reusing the IUI that already exists in NOMA networks. In general,
    the IUI can be engineered to achieve the goals of hindering SIC at the eavesdropper,
    impeding coherent detection at the eavesdropper, and creating strong IUI at untrusted
    users, as discussed below. Hindering SIC at the Eavesdropper Indeed, secrecy can
    be enhanced by carefully harnessing the IUI to disable SIC at the eavesdropper.
    We explore this concept by investigating a NOMA network comprised of a K-antenna
    BST, M users, and an eavesdropper. It is assumed that only M 0 (<K) users require
    secure transmission (in this case, the number of antennas at the BST is sufficient
    for ZF beamforming with respect to these users). The users that require secure
    transmission are called secure users (SUs) while the other users are called regular
    users (RUs), where the number of RUs is assumed, without loss of generality, to
    be more than that of SUs. A joint design of ZF beamforming, user clustering and
    scheduling can be applied to efficiently exploit the IUI for impeding the eavesdropper''s
    SIC [10], which is elaborated as follows. First, the BST groups all the users
    into Mo clusters with one SU and one or more RUs in each cluster. After user clustering,
    the IUI exists in two forms: inter-cluster and intra-cluster interference. Then,
    the BST designs its beams for each SU following the ZF principle, and schedules
    the RUs in each cluster to guarantee that the SU has the largest effective channel
    gain. In this way, each SU receives no inter-cluster interference and can subtract
    the intra-cluster interference by SIC. However, the eavesdropper does not know
    the ZF beams and the signal decoding order, and its SIC is prohibited. Hence,
    the eavesdropper is severely jammed by both inter-cluster and intra-cluster interference.
    This strategy also performs well with multiple eavesdroppers, since the resultant
    IUI degrades the reception quality of all the eavesdroppers. Impeding Coherent
    Detection at the Eavesdropper When the eavesdropper has a large number of antennas,
    the AN approach may not work well since the eavesdropper can perform null-space
    receive beamforming to eliminate the AN. In this situation, the system can exploit
    the IUI to degrade the eavesdropper''s detection performance [11]. Consider that
    a K-antenna BST communicates with two single-antenna users in the presence of
    an N-antenna eavesdropper with K « N. In each transmission, the BST splits each
    user''s message into two parts. Through NOMA signaling, the first parts of the
    messages of the two users are superimposed into signal s1, and the second parts
    of the messages of the two users are superimposed into signal s2. After that,
    the BST linearly precodes s1 and s2 based on MRT and random beamforming (RB),
    respectively. Here, the RB vector is designed to guarantee that the users still
    experience a block fading channel while the eavesdropper undergoes an equivalent
    fast fading channel. As a result, each user can do coherent detection to reliably
    retrieve its desired signal by SIC, while the eavesdropper can only detect the
    signals non-coherently without SIC, which significantly degrades its bit-error-rate
    performance. In the case of multiple eavesdroppers, each of the eavesdroppers
    can receive the IUI corrupted by the RB vector, indicating that the strategy is
    still applicable to scenarios with multiple eavesdroppers. Creating Strong IUI
    at Untrusted Users To combat internal eavesdropping in NOMA, it is beneficial
    to create strong IUI intentionally at the untrusted users [12]. Assume that in
    a NOMA network, only one specific user requests a secret signal (this user is
    called a private user), and other users try to eavesdrop the secret signal, that
    is, they are untrusted users. To protect the secret signal transmission, the signal
    beams for each user are appropriately designed, such that the received power of
    the secret signal is the highest at the private user but the lowest at the other
    untrusted users. Thus, when the private user decodes the secret signal, it can
    achieve a high data rate since it receives the secret signal with the highest
    power. Nevertheless, the secret signal can only be retrieved in the last SIC stage
    at the untrusted users. Recall that each untrusted user can partially subtract
    the signals of other untrusted users whose channel gains are stronger, and should
    leave the remaining signals as IUI when it decodes the secret signal. Having an
    extremely low secret signal power but a strong IUI power, the eavesdropping rates
    at the untrusted users are reduced. Therefore, a sufficiently large secrecy sum
    rate for NOMA can be achieved. All the previous IUI engineering strategies assume
    perfect CSI, which, however, is not always the case. In fact, the acquisition
    of perfect CSI is a non-trivial task. Due to fading, CSI feedback latency, and
    channel estimation errors, the obtained CSI may be imperfect. This will lead to
    an IUI design mismatch, for example, generating strong lUI at the desired user
    and weak IUI at the eaves- dropper, or time-varying IUI at both the desired user
    and eavesdropper. Thus, robust IUI engineering with imperfect CSI is worth exploring.
    Figure 5. Interference engineering strategies in more advanced NOMA networks.
    Show All Table 1. Interference engineering strategies for secure NOMA communications.
    A brief summary/comparison of the above-mentioned interference engineering strategies
    for secure NOMA networks is presented in Table 1. Interference Engineering in
    Advanced NOMA Networks Preliminary works have revealed that big secrecy benefits
    for NOMA can be drawn from intelligently engineering the network interference.
    When we integrate NOMA with other advanced wireless communication technologies,
    more network interference resources can be exploited to enhance security. In the
    sequel, we propose interference engineering strategies in advanced NOMA networks,
    and shed light on open research problems and challenges. Interference Engineering
    in Full-Duplex NOMA Full-duplex is a cutting-edge technology to improve spectral
    efficiency by allowing simultaneous information transmission and reception over
    the same resource block. Thus, the integration of full-duplex techniques into
    NOMA can bring further performance gains [13]. As shown in the full-duplex BST
    case of Fig. 5, the BST can have uplink and downlink NOMA transmissions simultaneously,
    while the untrusted relay intercepts signals of both the uplink and downlink.
    Here, the uplink signals can serve as beneficial interference, that is, inter-link
    interference (ILI), to confuse the untrusted relay. On the other hand, the uplink
    signals are received by the downlink users a priori and can be used for subsequent
    self-interfer-ence cancellation at the downlink users. To make such cancellation
    possible, rate adaptation and power allocation are needed to guarantee that the
    downlink users correctly decode the uplink signals with SIC. Another full-duplex
    NOMA is illustrated in the virtual full-duplex relay case of Fig. 5, where two
    untrusted relays listen and forward signals successively and the inter-relay interference
    (IRI) between them can be engineered to combat eavesdropping. In this situation,
    relay selection and user scheduling are meaningful to maximize the IRI at the
    untrusted relays while minimizing the IUI at the users, which deserves further
    investigation. Interference Engineering in Intelligent Reflecting Surface NOMA
    IRS is emerging as a promising technique to enhance the performance of wireless
    communications, via reconfiguring the radio propagation environment with low-cost
    passive units integrated on a software-controlled surface [14]. In particular,
    the fundamental operating principle of IRS provides an opportunity to engineer
    the IUI in NOMA constructively at the legitimate receiver but destructively at
    the eavesdropper. As illustrated in the IRS case of Fig. 5, two users apply uplink
    NOMA to transmit to the BST with the aid of an IRS. By carefully managing the
    amplitude and/ or phase of the IRS, the direct-path and reflect-ed-path signals
    of user-1 and user-2 can be added at the eavesdropper to create an overlapped
    signal constellation, which entails a high error rate for the eavesdropper''s
    signal detection and thereby significantly degrades the eavesdropping capability.
    The signal constellations at the BST can be non-overlapped, and the BST is able
    to reliably decode the signals. To achieve the above objectives, an optimization
    framework of transmit power control at the users and passive beamforming design
    at the IRS is needed, which represents interesting future research opportunities.
    For scenarios with multiple users, power allocation and user pairing are crucial
    to minimize the effect of the ICI to improve the secrecy sum rate. Therefore,
    it is necessary to investigate a joint design of optimal beamforming, power allocation,
    and user pairing to enhance the network security. Interference Engineering in
    Cognitive Radionoma Cognitive radio can be integrated with NOMA in a constructive
    way to realize better spectrum utilization [15]. In the underlay mode of Fig.
    5, the inter-network interference (INI) between the simultaneous primary and cognitive
    transmissions can be exploited as a source of jamming to the eavesdropper. The
    primary BST transmits combined s P and w P s c and the cognitive BST transmits
    w C s C , where s P denotes the primary user signal, s c denotes the superimposed
    signal for the cognitive users, and w p and w C denote the weighting coefficients.
    he designs of w P and w C are based on the channel gains of the primary and cognitive
    users, and they facilitate linear INI cancellation of s C at the primary user.
    The cognitive user combines the signals from both BSTs for its information decoding.
    However, the eavesdropper does not know w P , w c and cannot do SIC to eliminate
    the INI, such that its capability is degraded. Precise CSI is required in the
    above design, and efficient channel estimation methods should be devised. In the
    overlay mode of Fig. 5, cooperative jamming via primary and cognitive users can
    be performed for secrecy, which is explained as follows. First consider that global
    CSI is available and AN is coherently generated among the cognitive users in a
    secure fashion (e.g., by the seed of the random noise generator). In the first
    phase, the cognitive users cooperatively transmit the AN via distributed beamforming
    when the primary BST is transmitting s P . In the second phase, the cognitive
    BST forwards s P and s c via NOMA to all the users, and at the same time the primary
    BST injects the AN. The AN in both phases is used to intentionally confuse the
    eavesdropper. However, it may be hard to have global CSI and precise AN coordination.
    Accordingly, the cognitive users may transmit independent AN in an uncoordinated
    way. The independent AN is received by both the cognitive BST and eavesdropper,
    and thus, it is important to optimize the AN transmit power for striking a balance
    between degrading the capability of the eavesdropper and affecting the reception
    quality of the cognitive BST. Interference Engineering in Multi-Cell NOMA With
    the emergence of massive numbers of IoT devices, transceivers are densely deployed
    and multi-cell NOMA is becoming an attractive candidate for future wireless networks.
    Contrary to popular belief, the inter-cell interference (ICI) in multi-cell NOMA
    networks is not detrimental but useful to jam the eavesdropper and improve the
    secrecy performance. An example of ICI engineering is shown in the multi-cell
    network case of Fig. 5, where two BSTs in different cells jointly optimize their
    beams to simultaneously guarantee the reliability of the cell-edge users and the
    security of the overall network. Advanced interference alignment based coordinated
    beamforming can be applied to achieve zero ICI at the cell-edge users. Since each
    BST''s beam is designed according to the channels between the BST and its serving
    users, it is not possible for the eavesdropper to cancel the ICI. In such a way,
    the eavesdropper has to treat the ICI as additional noise to decode the signals,
    which decreases the eavesdropping rate. For scenarios with multiple users, power
    allocation and user pairing are crucial to minimize the effect of the ICI to improve
    the secrecy sum rate. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate a joint design
    of optimal beamforming, power allocation, and user pairing to enhance the network
    security. Concluding Remarks In this article, we presented a new view of the benefits
    of network interference and investigated interference engineering strategies for
    secure NOMA communications. Specifically, intelligent exploitations of AN, SJS,
    and lUI against eavesdroppers and/or untrusted users/relays were reviewed. Furthermore,
    several interference engineering strategies in more advanced full-duplex NOMA,
    IRS NOMA, cognitive radio NOMA, and multi-cell NOMA networks were proposed, and
    the corresponding open research problems and challenges were also outlined. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Rapid development in mobile and smart devices manufacturing, immersive mobile
    applications, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality, online
    gaming, 3 dimensional media, internet of things (IoT) and big data analytics have
    all contributed to a significant increase in network traffic. These core technologies
    influence every facet of our daily lives and economy. The main focus of 5G and
    beyond (B5G) networks is to support high data rates, diverse service requirements
    and ubiquitous connectivity, which can only be done by leveraging a wide set of
    technologies. It is estimated by the Ericsson Mobility Report, that the global
    mobile subscribers are expected to grow from around 8 billion in 2020 to 8.9 billion
    by the end of 2025 [1]. To enhance capacity, mobile and wireless communication
    has been utilizing different multiple access techniques from 1G through 4G, namely
    Frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Time division multiple access (TDMA),
    Code division multiple access (CDMA), Orthogonal frequency division multiple access
    (OFDMA) or their combinations. All these multiple access techniques rely on orthogonalization
    of resources. The allocation of disparate resources to different users not only
    gives an advantage of simpler receiver designs with reduced inter-user interference
    but it also limits the number of multiplexed users accessing the spectrum. Power
    Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (PD-NOMA) is a potential 5G multiple access
    technique which circumvents the spectral inefficiency of the above mentioned orthogonal
    multiple access (OMA) techniques, by multiplexing multiple users with distinct
    channel gains in one resource block (RB) (time, frequency, code) [4], [8], [11].
    Thus, it can support connectivity of a multitude of devices, improve spectral
    efficiency (SE) and give unprecedented traffic volumes. PD-NOMA allows multiple
    users to share the same spectrum based on different power values. It uses superposition
    coding and invokes successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver
    for detection of users. This promising B5G multiple access technology strikes
    a very good balance between the user fairness and SE of devices by proper user
    pairing and efficient power allocations (PAs) to the strong and poor channel gain
    users. Table 1. Existing surveys on PD-NOMA. Ref. Year Topics of survey [2] 2015
    Concept and advantages of NOMA, practical considerations in terms of signaling,
    PA, SIC error propagation, integration with MIMO and system level performance
    is analyzed. [3] 2015 PD and CD-NOMA along with a performance comparison between
    OMA and NOMA are explained in detail. [4] 2017 The interplay of NOMA with MIMO,
    CR and cooperative NOMA. NOMA’s standardization in 3GPP to implement it in LTE
    and 5G is reviewed. [5] 2017 Covers the significant opportunities and challenges
    that are encountered in a multi-cell NOMA environment. [6] 2017 PD and CD-NOMA
    is discussed in detail. Application of NOMA to MIMO, cooperative communication
    and millimeter wave communication along with their different design approaches
    are explained. [7] 2017 Issues and solutions related to NOMA for B5G considering
    resource allocation, PA, security, SIC complexity and sustainability problems
    are surveyed. Software-defined NOMA architectures, standardization and practical
    forms are also reviewed. [8] 2018 Basic principles and comparison of PD and CD-NOMA
    in terms of SE, complexity and performance along with comparison of NOMA with
    OMA has been discussed. [9] 2019 Flexible combination of NOMA with massive MIMO,
    millimeter wave, cooperative communication, CR, security, EH, MEC and VLC discussed.
    [10] 2019 Emphasis on rate-optimal PD-NOMA schemes for enabling technologies of
    5G including MIMO, massive MIMO, CoMP, cooperative communication, CR, millimeter
    wave, VLC, UAV, MEC, IRS, underwater communication and V2X have been investigated
    using optimization methods. [11] 2019 Common myths about NOMA have been identified
    and clarified. Adoption of NOMA in 5G is investigated and the possibility of use
    fullness of ML and deep learning in NOMA is discussed. [12] 2017 Different types
    of NOMA with major focus on PD-NOMA, potential solutions for issues caused by
    integration of NOMA in 5G, performance improvements for cooperative, MIMO, CoMP
    and beamforming NOMA systems are discussed. [13] 2018 Different user pairing,
    PA algorithms and practical challenges for DL PD-NOMA (SISO and MIMO) are reviewed.
    Performance comparisons are made for MIMO-OMA and MIMO-NOMA. The combination of
    PD-NOMA with other key enabling 5G technologies such as heterogeneous networks
    (HetNets), multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), massive MIMO, millimeter wave,
    cognitive radios (CRs), IoT, cooperative communication, mobile edge computing
    (MEC), visible light communication (VLC), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), vehicle-to-everything
    (V2X) assisted communication and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
    (SWIPT), etc., have substantial advantages. The flexible combination of these
    technologies will help in addressing the aforementioned issues and challenges
    of OMA. It is envisioned to give higher data rates, improved SE, massive connectivity,
    energy efficiency (EE) and diversity of wireless services [10], [11]. This paper
    surveys and explores different issues such as resource allocation (user pairing,
    PA, signaling (channel state information (CSI), SIC)) and security for PD-NOMA
    and its combination with key 5G enabling technologies. Further, it gives an overview
    of solutions for the identified issues by using different optimization, analytical,
    game theory, graph theory, machine learning (ML) and matching theory techniques.
    Moreover, practical implementations for both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) NOMA
    scenarios have also been reviewed. 1.1. Existing surveys on PD-NOMA PD-NOMA has
    been an active research topic for the past few years especially due to its SE,
    massive connectivity and the potential for being an enabling technology for 5G.
    It has been surveyed by several authors. The existing survey papers mainly focus
    on the basic concepts, design principles, performance, advantages and disadvantages,
    comparison with OMA, applications and its potential for use in future networks
    which have been summarized in Table 1. Power and code domain NOMA [3], [6], [8],
    [12] along with a performance comparison between OMA and NOMA are explained in
    detail in [3], [8]. Authors also propose a new idea of software-defined multiple
    access (SoDeMA) [3] which adaptively configures different multiple access schemes
    according to requirements of different applications and services in 5G. NOMA has
    been proposed as the latest multiple access technique in 3GPP LTE release 15 where
    its standardization for implementation in LTE and 5G has been reviewed in [4].
    It also discusses the interplay of NOMA with MIMO, CR and cooperative NOMA. Most
    of the research has been focused on single cell NOMA but Shin et al. has analyzed
    [5] significant opportunities and challenges that are encountered in a multi-cell
    NOMA scenario. Multi-cell NOMA has a serious issue of ICI (inter-cell interference)
    which results in reduced data rates for cell-edge users. Therefore, a combination
    of multi-cell DL NOMA and coordinated multi-point (CoMP) has been introduced that
    leverages the benefits of space diversity gains (CoMP) as well as power domain
    multiplexing (NOMA). In [2], [6], [7], [9], [10] and [12] authors survey the flexible
    integration of PD-NOMA scheme with many existing and upcoming wireless technologies
    such as MIMO, massive MIMO, millimeter wave, CR, cooperative communication, CoMP,
    MEC, VLC, UAV, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), underwater communication
    and V2X assisted communication. Emphasis on the rate-optimal PD-NOMA schemes for
    enabling technologies of 5G and optimization methods used to maximize achievable
    rates are presented in [10]. Potential solutions for issues caused by integration
    of NOMA in 5G with emphasis on its capacity analysis, resource allocation, EE
    along with performance improvements when NOMA is integrated with cooperative NOMA,
    MIMO, CoMP, network coding and beamforming have been discussed in [12]. The authors
    further evaluate the performance of NOMA on the basis of different metrics (outage
    probability, achievable rate, SE and EE) in different setups. It also includes
    an overview of several important implementation issues of NOMA (dynamic and number
    of user pairing, decoding computational complexity and error propagation, signaling,
    standardization and deployment environments etc.) There are very few survey papers
    [6], [7], [9], [12], [13] that discuss issues and solutions related to NOMA. These
    papers have covered issues such as coding and modulation for NOMA, user and cluster
    pairing, PA, user fairness, user scheduling, hybrid multiple access networks,
    SIC ordering and error propagation, receiver design, imperfect CSI, physical layer
    security, experimental implementation and standardization of NOMA. The authors
    in [13] review different user pairing and PA algorithms for DL PD-NOMA (SISO and
    MIMO) networks. Performance comparisons (outage probability and effective sum-rate)
    are made for MIMO-OMA and MIMO-NOMA under pre-defined QoS requirements for each
    user considering equal power for each cluster and cross-cluster PA scenarios.
    A divide-and-next-largest-difference-based user pairing algorithm (D-NLUPA) attaining
    cluster fairness in terms of sum-rate gain is proposed in  [13]. In [7], [9] authors
    also discuss energy harvesting (EH) techniques to improve EE in NOMA. Approaches
    such as wireless power transfer to NOMA through application of SWIPT and wireless
    powered communication networks (WPCN) are explained. A few other survey papers
    review code domain-NOMA (CD-NOMA) and other NOMA schemes in [3], [6], [8], [12],
    [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Most of the solutions in these papers are
    solved through optimization, matching theory or heuristics. Vaezi et al. have
    discussed the possibility of using ML to solve these problems [11]. Table 2. Acronyms

    Scope of this survey and contributions Although the aforementioned research surveys
    present a comprehensive explanation about the basic concepts, design, performance,
    challenges, significant applications in 5G and solutions to NOMA related issues.
    However, the issues and their solution techniques have not been categorized and
    investigated. Mostly, heuristic algorithms are studied. The goal of our survey
    is to not only review solutions for resource management, signaling and security
    related issues of PD-NOMA and its combination with 5G emerging and existing technologies
    using optimization techniques, but to also explore other solution approaches,
    such as, ML, analytical, game theory, graph theory and matching theory techniques.
    We compare these techniques qualitatively and give trade-offs in terms of complexity,
    applicability, advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, practical experimental
    implementation setups have also been reviewed. The contributions of this survey
    are summarized as follows. • We systematically categorize and analyze issues of
    resource allocation in terms of user pairing, PA and joint user pairing and power
    allocation (UPPA), security and signal processing related challenges in NOMA using
    different solution techniques. The solution techniques/tools considered are optimization(convex
    optimization, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO), heuristic
    approaches etc.), analytical (outage performance, coverage probability, secrecy
    performance, lookup tables etc.), matching theory (one-to-one matching), game
    theory (Stackelberg game, Glicksberg game, Nash bargaining game), graph theory
    (bipartite graph, multipartite graph) and ML (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
    reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, k-means clustering, k-medoids clustering,
    deep belief network). Key insights emphasizing the feasibility and applicability
    are discussed at the end of each issue to provide a qualitative analysis of the
    solution techniques presented. • Different from existing survey papers, we present
    a detailed review of potential solutions for explicitly identified main issues
    and challenges of resource allocation, signaling and security for NOMA and NOMA-enabled
    existing and emerging 5G technologies (HetNets, MIMO, massive MIMO, millimeter
    wave, cooperative communication, CRs, SWIPT, UAV, VLC, MEC, IRS and underwater
    communication). A critical evaluation of different solution techniques (optimization,
    analytical, game theory, matching theory, graph theory and ML techniques) in reference
    to the NOMA-enabled 5G technologies is also presented. • We summarize the existing
    NOMA experimental setups based on different testbeds for both DL and UL transmissions
    which have not been surveyed in any previous review paper. 1.3. Structure of the
    paper The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses
    the basic concept of NOMA while explaining both DL and UL transmissions. Table
    2 lists the acronyms and their description used throughout the paper and Fig.
    1 shows the structure of the paper. Section 3 investigates the resource allocation,
    signaling and security issues of NOMA and analyzes their solutions with key insights.
    Section 4 points out challenges of NOMA with existing and emerging 5G technologies
    along with a comprehensive summary of possible solutions using different techniques.
    Section 5 gives an overview of different experimental implementations of NOMA.
    Section 6 describes future challenges, opportunities and research directions for
    NOMA. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper. Download : Download high-res image

    2. Basics of NOMA NOMA is a novel spectral efficient multiple access technique
    which is considered to be a potential key enabler technology of 5G communications.
    It can be categorized into two fundamental types namely, PD-NOMA which multiplexes
    in power domain and CD-NOMA [3], [6], [8], [12] which multiplexes in code domain.
    CD-NOMA comprises of various UL and DL multiple access techniques such as low-density
    spreading CDMA (LDS-CDMA), low-density spreading aided OFDM (LDS-OFDM), sparse
    code multiple access (SCMA), multi-user shared access (MUSA) and successive interference
    cancellation aided multiple access (SAMA) based on the same core concept of orthogonal
    resource blocks (spreading code, time slot, frequency band and orthogonal spatial
    degree of freedom). Apart from PD-NOMA and CD-NOMA other recently explored NOMA
    solutions exist such as spatial division multiple access (SDMA), pattern division
    multiple access (PDMA), signature-based NOMA (S-NOMA) [14], interleave-based NOMA,
    spreading-based NOMA, bit division multiplexing (BDM) and compressive sensing
    (CS)-based NOMA. This paper focuses on PD-NOMA and the term NOMA is interchangeably
    used for PD-NOMA in rest of the paper. 2.1. Comparison between OMA and NOMA OMA
    techniques (TDMA, FDMA, CDMA or OFDMA) multiplex information signals from different
    users on orthogonal resources in either time, frequency or code domain. Different
    from OMA, NOMA multiplexes information of different users in the power or code
    domain while sharing the same (time, frequency and code) RB [19], [20] giving
    high bandwidth (BW) efficiency. In OMA good system throughput and multiplexing
    gain can be achieved by employing simple cost effective receiver designs capable
    of overcoming inter-user interference. But with the rapid development in the field
    of mobile communication and IoT there is an increasing demand of connected devices.
    Conventional OMA techniques are restricted by the number of users connected using
    the orthogonal resources. Also, such schemes have low SE as they limit BW resource
    assignment to users with poor channel conditions in order to attain high total
    user throughput. NOMA on the other hand is a desirable design alternative as it
    gives better system efficiency, increased SE for accommodating massive connectivity
    of sporadically transmitting 5G devices, enhanced quality of user experience (QoE)
    specifically for cell edge users, improved user throughput and fairness trade-off,
    high transmission rate, superior multi-user capacity, low transmission latency
    due to grant-free transmission (SCMA) and compatibility with other access technologies.
    NOMA gives user fairness with guaranteed minimum required rate and boosts SE by
    adopting advanced receivers for overcoming inter and intra-cell interference.
    In contrast to the water filling concept, the key idea in NOMA is to allocate
    more power to the weak channel gain user and less power to the strong channel
    gain user. This ensures a balance between overall system throughput and user fairness.
    NOMA is capable of serving multiple users over the same resources at the expense
    of inter-user interference. A special type of complex receiver called SIC [19],
    [20], [21] is used to overcome inter-user interference. SIC is employed at the
    strong NOMA user in case of DL transmission or at base station (BS) in case of
    UL transmission. This helps in decoding information of the multiplexed users and
    enhances channel capacity. The increased complexity of the receiver with increasing
    number of users and the requirement of distinct channel gain difference of paired
    users for improved performance in PD-NOMA can be tackled by hybrid OMA-NOMA [6],
    [22]. The flexibility of NOMA compared to existing techniques to be made compatible
    with other access techniques makes it possible to achieve hybrid OMA-NOMA. For
    NOMA to work efficiently, spatially distributed users with disparate channel gains
    are grouped together and allocated different PA factors. For the sake of simplicity
    a two user NOMA pair with single-input and single-output (SISO) BS is considered
    in DL and UL NOMA in the following two subsections. 2.2. Downlink NOMA A superimposed
    message comprising of user equipment (UE)-1 and UE-2 signals with different PA
    coefficients is transmitted from the BS as shown in Fig. 2(a). In DL NOMA the
    optimal SIC decoding order is in descending order of channel gains of the power
    multiplexed users. High power is allocated to weak channel gain users which helps
    in easy detection and interference cancellation at the strong channel gain user.
    The superimposed message in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
    is detected at the strong user according to the optimal SIC decoding order, by
    detecting UE-2’s signal at UE-1 followed by subtracting the detected signal from
    the superimposed signal and then finally detecting the UE-1 signal, whereas UE-2’s
    signal is detected treating other information as noise. Intra-cell interference
    is dominant at stronger user in DL NOMA, since higher power is allocated to weak
    channel gain user which is solved by applying SIC [23]. SIC is applied at the
    strong channel gain user to remove weak channel gain users’ interference. The
    strong channel gain user’s throughput mainly depends on its own channel gain and
    assigned power. It can perform better even with lower power levels leaving a greater
    proportion of total power available for weak channel gain users to perform well
    as the throughput of the weak user depends on its transmit power level only. Therefore,
    it is beneficial to pair distinctively strong channel gain users with weak users
    so that they can contribute in the overall sum throughput of the cluster. DL NOMA
    performs better in terms of capacity and throughput in comparison to OMA [5].
    2.3. Uplink NOMA In UL NOMA, the optimal decoding order for SIC detection is in
    descending order of channel gains of users at the BS. The cell-center user with
    high channel gain, UE-1, is detected first and subtracted from the superimposed
    signal received at the BS using SIC as shown in Fig. 2(b). Then the cell-edge
    user, UE-2, with weak channel gain, is easily detected as it is left with no intra-cluster
    interference. UL NOMA is less complex in terms of implementation and more spectrally
    efficient when compared to DL NOMA. Since, SIC is performed at BS which is a centralized
    entity having less energy constraints compared to an individual user with less
    processing capability. This allows it to be more spectral efficient compared to
    DL NOMA as more number of users can be connected. In an UL NOMA system, multiple
    users transmit their own signals with different power levels depending on their
    individual maximum battery power to the same BS in the same RB. In contrast to
    DL NOMA, the transmit power levels in UL NOMA of any specific user does not affect
    the transmit power of any other user for a given user pair and all users can independently
    use their transmit powers to the maximum. The performance depends more on the
    received SINR at the BS, which in turn requires significant distinct channel conditions
    regardless of the paired users’ transmit powers. UL NOMA gives superior performance
    in terms of fairness when compared to power controlled OMA [5]. Table 3. Summary

    3. Issues of NOMA and its solution techniques NOMA is a promising spectrally efficient
    multiple access technique for 5G. It opportunistically allocates transmit powers
    to users paired together on the basis of their distinct channel gains. A SIC receiver
    is employed at the user with strong signals (strong user) to decode its own message
    by subtracting other user’s message from the superimposed signal whereas the user
    with weak signals (weak user) detects its message by treating other user’s messages
    as noise. The SIC receiver operates according to an optimal decoding order. CSI
    is required to attain channel conditions for users to decide pairing and hence
    to decide the optimal decoding order which increases overhead. Whereas in SIC
    an incorrect detection at an earlier stage can result in propagation of error.
    Moreover, since the strong user decodes the weak user’s message first in order
    to perform SIC there can be security vulnerability too in the implementation of
    NOMA. These aforementioned issues have been characterized as resource allocation,
    signaling and security issues in NOMA which have been comprehensively discussed
    in the following subsections. 3.1. Resource allocation issues in NOMA In NOMA
    multiple users are capable of sharing the same RB. A SIC receiver is used at the
    receiver end to detect messages for all users from a superimposed signal. The
    users are paired on the basis of distinct channel gains to which different powers
    are allocated. Since multiple users share the same resources, therefore, proper
    pairing and power PA methods are required for efficient utilization of resources
    that results in reduced interference and enhanced system capacity. Different resource
    allocation issues for NOMA have been summarized as follows. User Pairing: NOMA
    multiplexes users of different channel gains in one (time/ frequency/ code) RB
    in the power dimension. It allocates higher power to weak channel gain users and
    lower power to the strong channel gain users which leads to user fairness. The
    weak user decodes the superimposed signal by treating the strong user’s signals
    as interference/noise and the strong user decodes the signal intended for it by
    applying SIC in DL. The greater the difference between the channel gains of users
    paired together the better is the SIC implementation and the overall increase
    in sum capacity. If in a given cell, the cell-center (high gain) users are paired
    with cell-edge (low gain) users then the mid gain users will either be paired
    together or left unpaired. The mid users which are paired together lead to capacity
    reduction due to SIC performance degradation. Whereas, if these users are left
    unpaired they do not have the SIC performance issue as they use OMA which means
    they cannot benefit from the capacity gains achieved by NOMA. Another issue in
    user pairing is the number of users that can be multiplexed together. Ideally,
    a given RB should be capable of pairing a large number of users to achieve maximum
    benefit from SE of PD-NOMA. However, the complexity also increases as the number
    of users increase beyond two. Next, we will present different techniques that
    can be adopted to solve user pairing issues in PD-NOMA along with the objectives
    they have considered. Table 3 gives its summary. Optimization: User pairing strategies
    proposed [24], [25], [26] help overcome these issues. Shahab et al. formulate
    an optimization problem that maximizes the sum of in-pair users’ channel gain
    differences while ensuring that the gain difference between any two users is not
    less than a predefined threshold [25]. Uniform channel gain difference (UCGD)
    focuses on pairing the cell mid users. The users are arranged in ascending channel
    gains and divided into two equal groups considering the median as the center point.
    The maximum gain user of one group is paired with the maximum of the other group.
    Followed by pairing the next maximum gain users of both groups till the lowest
    gain user of one group is paired with the lowest of the other group. This approach
    accommodates cell mid users resulting in overall capacity gain. Further, a hybrid
    pairing approach is proposed which is a combination of typical near-far pairing
    and UCGD-based pairing. User pairing can also help in mitigating co-channel interference
    by employing a vertical user pairing approach [26] where ordered users are paired
    together sequentially to accommodate a large number of NOMA users in a network.
    In [24], a PSO-based approach is used to solve the user clustering problem making
    sure that a transmitter requires minimum DL power under quality of service (QoS)
    constraint. A dynamic user pairing and beamforming design that maximizes the minimum
    rate among all users is investigated and is shown to attain user fairness in [27].
    Analytical: In [25] Shahab et al. proposed two schemes to solve the mid-cell users
    issue which either suffered capacity degradation or were left unpaired. The unpaired
    users cannot achieve benefit from NOMA. Therefore, the same authors solve the
    issue of unpaired weak users by proposing a virtual pairing technique [28]. Where
    two similar gain far users are multiplexed with one strong gain near user in a
    non-overlapping frequency band pairing fashion. Hence, efficiently using the unpaired
    spectrum of users. Authors propose a three user pairing scheme [34] that focuses
    on the performance improvement of cell-edge user with the help of two cell-center
    users. The cell-edge user is paired with each mid-cell user using NOMA avoiding
    high complexity at the cell-edge user. Inspired by [25], authors propose three
    similar strategies (high-low channel quality indicator (CQI), high-high CQI and
    hybrid CQI) [29] to solve the user pairing issue but the users are paired on the
    basis of CQI for maximizing sum capacity over UL NOMA system instead of channel
    gain. Using CQI as a feature in the proposed NOMA system gives a backward compatibility
    with previous technologies as it has already been implemented in LTE. Channel
    state sorting pairing algorithm (CSS-PA), a user pairing scheme based on user’s
    state sorting which pairs users with most disparate channel conditions and adopts
    common PA algorithms to increase system capacity and ensure user fairness is proposed
    in [30]. Authors analyze a different pairing scheme for the new concept of CR-inspired
    NOMA in [31]. In CR-inspired NOMA the highest channel gain user is paired with
    the second highest gain user and so on. In this pairing scheme the channel condition
    of the weaker user (acting as primary user (PU)) is more critical since the power
    allocated to the strong user (acting as secondary user (SU)) is dependent on the
    concept of CR network. Different from the aforementioned user pairing schemes
    most of which were based on channel conditions, authors propose a distance-based
    user pairing scheme called Minimum Distance NOMA (MD-NOMA) [33]. MD-NOMA uses
    a derived pairing distance threshold with fixed PA. This new approach gives an
    enhancement in the number of paired users from 50% to 80% thus, significantly
    increasing NOMA user connectivity. Graph Theory: In contrast to grouping users
    on the basis of their channel conditions, authors propose consideration of diverse
    QoS and interference aware arbitrary multiple user grouping strategy [37] using
    graph theory by focusing on minimization of transmitted power. Machine Learning:
    A user pairing network (UP-Net) based on deep reinforcement learning with cooperative
    game and CNN is designed to solve two channel capacity maximization problems in
    [35]. The simulations and results show that even under continuous action, state
    inputs and high dimensionality of the user pairing issue, the proposed UP-Net
    performs better than existing exhaustive search method. Inspired by correlation
    features of users Ren et al. investigate unsupervised learning-based clustering
    algorithms for fixed and dynamic user scenarios. By learning the inherent structures
    and channel correlations, an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm and
    an online EM (OLEM)-based algorithm for fixed and dynamic users is developed respectively
    [36]. Power Allocation: PA has been a high priority objective in wireless communication
    through different generations. Multiple users with different PAs by the transmitter
    are multiplexed in one RB in NOMA. Inefficient PA strategies may lead to significant
    interference, user unfairness in rate distribution among paired users, system
    outage due to SIC failure and energy inefficiency issues which results in performance
    degradation. Therefore, appropriate PA is required to enhance system performance.
    PA in NOMA is characterized by channel conditions, availability of CSI, QoS requirements
    and total available system power. In NOMA networks the high channel gain user
    is allocated less power and the weak gain user is allocated more power to ensure
    user fairness. Different tools and techniques have been used in recent research
    to resolve this PA issue in NOMA which has been summarized in Table 4 and explained
    below. Table 4. Summary of power allocation issues and solutions in NOMA. Ref.

    [39], [40], [41], [42], [47], [50] authors apply optimization techniques to solve
    the issue of PA considering user fairness for all users. For optimal PA Xu et
    al. propose sum throughput maximization techniques with alpha-fairness [40] for
    statistical and perfect channel state information at transmitter (CSIT). For perfect
    CSIT, optimal PA is solved to maximize instantaneous sum-rate with alpha-fairness
    under adaptive user rates according to instantaneous CSI. Different from previous
    work, instead of maximizing instantaneous sum-rate, the average sum-rate for optimal
    PA is maximized in [41], [51] under the constraints QoS on worst user performance
    and physical layer QoS of a NOMA system respectively. Considering average instead
    of instantaneous sum-rate reduces signaling overheads due to decreased power factor
    calculations between users and BS. The authors propose an optimal PA problem that
    considers minimum power consumption for a NOMA network in [47], [52], [64]. Since
    the problem is complex and NP-hard [52], its convexity is identified by relaxation
    and then a ’relax then adjust’ algorithm is proposed. Authors propose PA techniques
    [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48] by maximizing sum capacity/rate under rate
    and total power constraints. Multiple users are multiplexed in power domain using
    same frequency in NOMA which results in interference. Most of the PA schemes proposed
    in literature do not consider the interference issue which leads to lower bit-error
    rates (BERs) but authors propose a strategy [45] that optimizes the sum ergodic
    capacity while minimizing the interference among the users multiplexed together
    in one RB. A single cell NOMA system is mostly considered in the existing literature.
    Whereas authors have addressed this issue [49], [50], [64] by solving the power
    control issue in a multi-cell NOMA environment. Fu et al. were the first ones
    to consider the concept of a multi-cell DL NOMA environment in [64]. They investigated
    an optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power of two BSs under
    constraints of data rate requirements for all users. A joint user association
    and PA problem under maximum minimum (max–min) fairness is considered in [50].
    For dealing with the decoupled problem, the PA part is solved by investigating
    a decentralized scheme called diffusion adaptive PA. It optimizes the local fairness
    which eventually ensures the overall network fairness. In contrast to [50], [64],
    the authors consider UL NOMA transmission in [49]. The issue of interference mitigation
    is solved by proposing a power optimization problem under Nakagami-m fading channels
    for all cells. Game Theory: Game theory is applied to give flexible solutions
    of PA for autonomous and interactive scenarios. Price-based PA problems are modeled
    in [55], [56], [58], [59], [60] where the BS and users interact with each other
    in a Stackelberg game. The BS acting as the leader has priority to choose a price
    for per unit allocated power to each user in order to maximize its own revenue.
    The users acting as followers maximize their utility by choosing optimal transmit
    power considering the prices given by the BS. The non-convex revenue function
    is solved by decoupling the problem into three sub-problems to which alternating
    optimization algorithm is applied [55]. A two user scenario is considered [56],
    where either power is allocated to both users or to the user with better channel
    condition. The same algorithm is extended to more than two users by proposing
    a sub-optimal iterative algorithm. Authors propose a two user price-based PA optimization
    problem [58] under the QoS requirements of users. It is formulated based on the
    pricing and power purchasing interactions between the BS and admitted users using
    the Stackelberg game strategies. This work is different from [56] in that it considers
    minimum rate requirement while ensuring QoS of users. The proposed algorithm is
    extended to more than two user case without considering the QoS requirement. Unlike
    the aforementioned papers whose objective was to optimize total throughput, EE,
    or proportional fairness for NOMA systems. The goal of this work [60] is to maximize
    the number of user pairs that attain their rate demands concurrently while seeking
    to enhance total revenue. A fast resource allocation scheme is investigated that
    jointly optimizes the RBs and PA by maximizing the number of user pairs that achieve
    data rates more than their requirements along with revenue maximization. Instead
    of maximizing BS revenue as in previous literature [55], [56], [58], [59], [60],
    [61], in [57] the sum data rate of the users is maximized. A less complex and
    simpler PA method for different number of users modeled as a Glicksberg game in
    a NOMA network is proposed where price-based utility function is shown to be effective
    and restrictive. Table 5. Summary of issues and solutions for joint user pairing

    the earlier referred work where most of the research was done for DL transmission,
    authors propose a distributed power control method [54] for minimizing total power
    usage in a two user cell UL NOMA system. It is shown that a unique Nash equilibrium
    exists in [54], [57], [61] but for [54] the uniqueness is guaranteed only if the
    Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue of a certain link gain matrix is less than one. The
    crucial issue of PA in NOMA networks is solved in [61] by proposing an auction-based
    game design where the user pairs compete with each other to maximize their utility
    function by bidding for transmit power which is being sold by the auctioneer BS
    in a hybrid OMA-NOMA network. The proposed scheme gives better average sum-rate
    for users. With large scale networks and increasing network density, their is
    a need for analyzing conflicting resource allocation issues of NOMA-enabled emerging
    decentralized 5G networks such as IoT, adhoc sensor networks, CR networks from
    human/user behavior perspective to utilize spectrum resources efficiently. Optimal
    solutions guaranteeing stability, users interdependent behaviors and decisions
    have been met by applying these inherently self-organizing solutions using non-cooperative
    game theory and principles of tragedy of commons and prospect theory [62]. Authors
    in [62], [63] suggest risk aware behavior of users in terms of power investment
    in each band to address the issue of spectral scarcity by using both licensed
    and unlicensed spectrum for NOMA. Machine Learning: PA and sum throughput of a
    wireless network are closely interlinked. If power in a NOMA network is allocated
    efficiently it avoids interference and energy inefficiency related issues. In
    order, to effectively allocate power to all users a ML approach to maximize EE
    by optimizing the PA policy is proposed in [53]. The authors suggest a model-free
    reinforcement learning-based low complexity framework that uses an actor-critic
    algorithm to estimate the PA coefficient. The PA coefficients are dynamically
    assigned by the BS to all users according to actor-critic algorithm while optimizing
    the EE. The actor part constructs parameters and the critic part evaluates it.
    The actor part learns from the environment and adjusts according to the reward
    feedback from the critic part. Joint User Pairing and Power Allocation: The problems
    of PA and user pairing in a NOMA system are intertwined and hence usually solved
    by joint optimization. The following tools and techniques have been used to solve
    the issues of joint UPPA in NOMA which have also been summarized in Table 5. Optimization:
    One of the main user pairing and PA metrics in NOMA is proportional fairness which
    has been considered in [65], [66], [67], [70], [72], [73]. A closed-form optimal
    solution for PA and user pairing of two to three users in a NOMA system using
    Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions has been derived [65]. An efficient and less
    complex heuristic greedy algorithm for user pairing has been proposed which avoids
    the exhaustive user search techniques. In [66] and [67] before jointly optimizing
    UPPA the authors have used a user pairing prerequisite algorithm in order to circumvent
    computational complexity and exhaustive search for the valid user pair candidates.
    A joint spectrum resource and PA problem for balancing the maximum sum-rate and
    minimum rate requirement of users is proposed. Due to complexity and users unfairness
    the problem is solved by proposing a spectrum resource and PA algorithm considering
    adaptive proportional fairness user pairing. It subdivides the optimization problem
    into PA, subchannel and user pairing in [73]. Usually a cluster size of two is
    considered in most of the joint UPPA scenarios for NOMA in the literature. However,
    in order to leverage maximum advantage of SE, NOMA should be capable of multiplexing
    multiple users in a single RB. Authors present a clustering algorithm with variable
    cluster size [70] which analytically finds the largest possible feasible cluster
    size as a function of fractional error function (FEF), QoS and cluster bandwidth
    which iteratively matches users in order to maximize NOMA gain. In [65] two to
    three users are considered for a single user pair and two and four users scenarios
    are investigated in [68] for attaining optimal solutions. Arbitrary cluster size
    is considered in [45], [67]. Optimal PA closed-form expressions for sum throughput
    maximization are derived for any cluster-size considering both UL and DL NOMA
    transmissions [45] where it is numerically analyzed and shown that increasing
    the number of users beyond a certain threshold worsens the performance. Stochastic
    programming optimization techniques have been utilized to solve the joint UPPA
    problems in [71], [72]. For practical NOMA scenarios, dynamic traffic arrival
    and possible transmission failure with limited CSI feedback has been considered
    in [71] to jointly optimize the problem of UPPA with backlog stabilities as constraints.
    Two scenarios have been considered in [72] to jointly optimize the problem of
    UPPA targeting improvement in proportional fairness of users. The basic scenario
    considers users spread in only one BS cell which is extended to the complex scenario
    where multiple interfering users are distributed randomly outside the BS footprint
    by spatial homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP). In the basic scenario to
    avoid local optimum solutions, an exploratory user pairing algorithm called probability-based
    Tabu search (PTS), is proposed that has the capability to find global optimum
    solution. This complex scenario problem is tackled with a low complexity algorithm
    called the prediction-based particle swarm optimization (PBPSO), to achieve high
    proportional fairness gains in UL NOMA. Authors propose a joint UPPA problem [74]
    which is sub-divided into UPPA for tractability. Due to variation in channel gains
    and number of users in a given cluster the user pairing issue is solved by grouping
    users on the basis of correlation and by applying semi-definite programming. The
    PA problem is solved by proposing an iterative algorithm for optimal values. Analytical:
    Efficient UPPA is the basis to achieve performance gain from NOMA. A two step
    UPPA strategy is proposed [82]. In order to reduce the computational complexity
    in a two user pairing NOMA scheme, a user pairing prerequisite is applied initially
    to avoid unnecessary comparisons of candidate user pairs. To guarantee fairness
    and transmission efficiency a closed-form optimal solution is derived with a proportional
    fairness objective. The user pairing scheme discussed earlier in [33] is extended
    to a joint dynamic PA strategy. It considers channel conditions with the proposed
    distance-based pairing scheme to further improve the network performance. The
    joint proposed strategy, enhanced MD-NOMA, further enhances performance of the
    system by pairing the remaining left over unpaired users. Authors propose a different
    approach in [76], [77] of using lookup tables to analyze performance and maximize
    sum capacity. It is achieved by varying PA coefficients and channel gains for
    a two user pair UL NOMA system. A comprehensive lookup table is created by varying
    PA factors and positions of paired users (cell-center and cell-edge users) which
    results in varying channel gains to analyze dynamics of pair sum capacity. The
    authors extend the same idea of summarizing calculations and simulations in lookup
    tables to observe dynamics of maximizing sum capacity and individual user data
    rates of joint UPPA in [77] without exceeding BER upper limit. Game Theory: The
    authors propose price-based UPPA problems modeled as a Stackelberg game in [80],
    [81]. A practical NOMA design using multi-level Stackelberg game to protect the
    performance of multiplexed users is investigated in [81]. The interaction between
    the users acting as leaders that have accessed the subchannel and the users who
    access the subchannel later as followers are modeled to maximize the total revenue
    which leads to limiting the number of multiplexed users. A revenue maximization
    problem that jointly optimizes user selection and PA is investigated in [80].
    The effect of optimal solution on sum-rate and user fairness is also studied.
    Graph Theory: A many to one bipartite graph in an UL hybrid NOMA is used to solve
    an EE maximization problem in [77]. It jointly optimizes user clustering, PA and
    channel assignment. The users and RBs are taken as two set of nodes in a bipartite
    graph which is then solved based on swap matching where a RB association and PA
    algorithm is proposed which converges in a few iterations. Matching Theory: A
    CR-inspired NOMA scheme where two users can simultaneously transmit signals using
    a distributed one-to-one matching theory algorithm is proposed in [78] to solve
    the UPPA issue. Key Insights into Resource Allocation Issues in NOMA • Graph theory,
    matching theory and ML techniques have been researched and introduced to solve
    the user pairing issue in a more distributive and mutually beneficial manner compared
    to the previously well explored high computational and centralized resource management
    methods with optimization techniques. • ML techniques have been found to give
    better and less complex results compared to exhaustive search methods in dynamic
    environments by learning inherent structure and channel correlations using supervised
    and reinforcement learning techniques. • With the dynamically changing environment
    and increase in number of users the complexity of NOMA user pairing and PA grows
    exponentially. So, it is desirable to use learning-based approaches for resource
    allocation. • For energy efficient NOMA designs user pairing is an important factor
    which should be researched in future using matching game theory which can be an
    effective tool for distributed modeling. • To analyze conflicting dynamic PA issues
    of NOMA-enabled emerging decentralized 5G networks such as IoT, adhoc sensor networks,
    UAVs, MECs, CR systems etc. Nash equilibrium, different types of cooperative and
    selfishly optimizing non-cooperative games in distributed, autonomous and interactive
    scenarios should be applied. This will help in achieving low complexity and scalable
    procedures by balancing efficiency and fairness 3.2. Signaling issues in NOMA
    With significant increase in the number of connected devices and data-centric
    ultra-low latency applications there is a growing demand of spectrum resources.
    NOMA is a spectrally efficient multiple access technique that accommodates multiple
    users in a single RB (time, frequency and spatial direction). To bridge the gap
    between theory and practical implementation of NOMA solutions, certain signal
    processing issues have been identified. signaling issues for NOMA include CSI
    imperfections, SIC receiver complexity, decoding order, delay and interference
    management. Table 6 gives a summary of recent papers regarding these issues which
    are explained in the following subsections. Table 6. Summary of signaling issues

    scenario, imperfect small scale CSI and no small scale CSI. SIC Issues: The authors
    in [19], [20] were among the first ones to introduce the concept of NOMA with
    SIC for cellular radio access. They proposed to use the power domain for multiplexing
    different users in one RB and suggested the need of a complex receiver such as
    SIC for decoding the received superimposed message sent from BS to UE. Implementing
    SIC has hardware complexities with high power consumption but this theoretical
    idea has only been made possible due to advancements and evolution of signal processing
    capabilities following Moore’s law. One of the impacts on NOMA performance gain
    is due to imperfect SIC which is because of receiver complexity and sensitivity,
    decoding order, analog to digital quantization error, imperfect channel estimation
    and error propagation due to interference residue, a.k.a. FEF [100]. FEF is due
    to incorrect phase, amplitude and channel detection causing imperfect signal regeneration.
    In SIC previously decoded signals are subtracted from the superimposed signal,
    SIC imperfection can also be due to error in bit decisions made in the detection
    phase of the previously decoded users. In [101] one of the main issues of SIC
    receiver in decoding information for different users, that are multiplexed using
    NOMA is discussed. The case of imperfect SIC implementation when the decoding
    order does not match the sequence of cancellation is discussed and simulated.
    The mismatch causes incorrect message detection and request for retransmission
    has to be made to the BS which increases the number of iterations for decoding
    thereby prolonging the computation time. The prolonged computation time due to
    erroneous message might also be due to potential external network attacks. The
    following different approaches have been proposed to resolve such issues in SIC.
    Optimization: The availability of perfect CSI at BS is required to schedule users,
    SIC ordering and decoding policy of users. But due to channel estimation errors,
    quantization errors and delay in feedback, perfect CSI is difficult to achieve.
    Therefore, robust resource allocation approaches under imperfect CSI are considered
    for practical scenarios. Robust resource allocation and performance gain in terms
    of outage probability is discussed and solved using optimization techniques in
    [83], [84], [85], [86]. In [83], [84], [87] multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple
    access (MC-NOMA) scenarios are considered. Authors solve the issue of power efficient
    resource allocation of MC-NOMA [83] under imperfect CSI conditions by designing
    a transmit power minimization non-convex optimization problem that jointly optimizes
    rate allocation, PA, user scheduling and SIC decoding policy. Imperfect CSI is
    best modeled using stochastic method to design a robust resource allocation framework.
    The optimal SIC decoding order in DL NOMA is the descending order when the CSI
    is perfect. In this case actual channel gains of users are used for ordering.
    Whereas in practical situations where CSI is imperfect, the channel-to-noise ratio
    (CNR) outage threshold is defined from which optimal SIC decoding order to minimize
    transmit power is found. It covers the joint effect in statistical sense for channel
    conditions and individual QoS requirements of users, i.e. the estimated channel
    gain and error distribution, noise and required outage probability. Hence, the
    user with better channel condition has a higher CNR outage threshold whereas the
    user with worse channel condition has lower threshold level. The CNR threshold
    is defined on each sub-carrier and an outage event occurs if a user is unable
    to decode its data due to failure of SIC. To overcome the outage problem due to
    random residual error of SIC receiver a robust optimization problem is formulated
    [84] to minimize transmitted power with outage constraint. If the data from higher
    order user is not decoded correctly the lower order users’ data can still be decoded
    considering the uncanceled data as interference in [85]. The non-convex problem
    is decomposed into two steps. In the first step user scheduling issue is solved
    by matching theory and in the second phase PA is optimized by branch and bound
    (BB) technique and concave-convex procedure (CCP) method. Authors propose an optimization
    solution [86] for robust resource allocation problem in UL NOMA for high priority
    low power devices used in critical applications such as health and public safety
    sensor networks. The authors study the effect of imperfect SIC on performance
    and solve the residual error problem by applying chance-constrained robust optimization.
    Authors have a special focus on designing a low complexity joint PA and user scheduling
    framework [87] by maximizing weighted sum-rate in DL MC-NOMA with imperfect SIC.
    In designing PA algorithm specific attention is paid to SIC error at receiver
    and power order constraints for users at each sub-carrier. While in practical
    situations SIC receivers are not perfect as usually assumed in research. An iterative
    algorithm is formulated to solve the non-convex problem by using fractional quadratic
    transformation. The optimization of resource allocation with imperfect SIC in
    UL NOMA is extended to a DL/UL decoupled (DUDe) HetNet in [88]. The performance
    of NOMA is impacted by imperfect SIC which is because of receiver sensitivity,
    decoding order and residual interference, a.k.a. FEF. In contrast to the previous
    researches where mostly 2-user fixed pairing cluster was considered, the authors
    in this paper consider a variable cluster size. Increased cluster size also results
    in SIC delay. With the increase in number of connected devices there is a need
    of larger cluster size which leads to more interference cancellation delay but
    is possible due to high computational power at BS. Analytical: Outage probability
    for both UL and DL NOMA is investigated in [89], [90], [91]. Authors investigate
    the achievable outage rate of NOMA users in [90]. They propose an optimal SIC
    order by deriving a closed-form expression based on statistical CSI. The derived
    expression is used to show practical NOMA applications that have strict delay
    requirements. Traditionally the data at the receiver in DL and UL is decoded in
    a predefined order according to the statistical CSI. A new advanced SIC receiver
    for UL NOMA based on statistical CSI is proposed [91]. In UL NOMA, independent
    non-identically distributed signals with different transmit powers and path loss
    from different users share the same RB at the BS. In a typical UL SIC receiver,
    the data for later users is decoded only if the earlier user’s data is successfully
    decoded otherwise it results in outage for the later users. Whereas in the advance
    SIC receiver even if the earlier data is not decoded successfully the BS attempts
    to decode later users’ data considering the undecoded data as interference. This
    leads to performance gain from the perspective of outage. Gao et al. [89] discuss
    the SIC ordering issue for a dynamic SIC receiver of a three-user UL NOMA case
    where instantaneous CSI is known at the BS instead of statistical CSI. As in UL
    NOMA, when following fixed decoding order there are chances that the user with
    low received power gets decoded first which leads to performance degradation as
    there might be a difference in statistical and instantaneous CSI. Table 7. Summary

    issues and improve secrecy rate by encoding data with MAC address and IMEI. SIC
    order in multi-cell NOMA scenario is discussed in [21]. In multi-cell NOMA the
    decoding order for the multiplexed users depends on the interference. The PA and
    user pairing issues are intertwined with interference and hence the decoding order
    for SIC. The sum load minimization optimization problem for resource efficiency
    converges even if the SIC decoding order changes over iterations in contrast to
    the previous research that guaranteed convergence only if decoding order remained
    same through the iterations. CSI Issues: Most of the benefits of NOMA are mentioned
    in literature under the ideal assumption of availability of perfect CSI for all
    multiplexed users at the transmitter. CSI in NOMA is especially required for optimal
    SIC decoding order, user pairing and PA. Continuous availability of CSI for these
    signaling processes results in increased overheads and computational complexity
    which leads to delayed feedback. To overcome these issues several solutions such
    as statistical CSI, imperfect CSI and limited bits used for feedback channel using
    different techniques have been used in literature. Optimization and analytical
    techniques have been employed to summarize these solutions as follows. Optimization:
    For practical implementation of NOMA by focusing on partial CSI with reduced overhead
    and increased SE, authors investigate the performance in terms of outage probabilities
    in [92], [93], [94], [95]. Limited feedback CSI (channel direction information
    and channel quality indicator) is used to explore a NOMA-based zero-forcing beamforming
    network in [93]. A user pairing scheme to reduce interference is proposed along
    with PA strategy to increase sum-rate of the system. Furthermore, authors study
    outage probabilities for delay-sensitive applications [94] in DL NOMA network
    with one-bit channel feedback from each user to the BS. Optimal diversity gain
    is investigated under long and short term power constraints. Also, a dynamic PA
    strategy using limited feedback is proposed to minimize common outage probability.
    An efficient quantizer design for NOMA that dynamically adapts transmission rate
    according to the channel quality is proposed in [92]. It considers minimum rate
    and outage probability for receiver as a performance metric under limited distributed
    channel feedback. By considering the limited CSI feedback in this scenario between
    BS and user which is then shared with other receivers it is shown that the rate
    loses and outage probability decrease exponentially. Instead of studying performance,
    authors investigate the optimal power control and resource optimization with imperfect
    CSI in [93] where only distance information of each user from the BS is known.
    Analytical: Impact of limited channel feedback on outage probabilities of NOMA
    networks are studied in [96], [99]. Authors study the performance of NOMA not
    only in terms of outage probability but for average sum-rate with imperfect and
    second order statistics based CSI in [96]. Analytical results show that the second
    order statistics based CSI performs better than imperfect based CSI and is more
    closer to perfect CSI at low SNR. Whereas due to high speed and random distribution
    of users in a high speed railway scenario the effect of partial CSI is studied
    for outage analysis in [99]. The two variants of partial CSI, i.e., imperfect
    small scale CSI and no small scale CSI for single cell NOMA are compared with
    traditional OMA systems. For PA in NOMA instantaneous CSI is required for application
    of SIC. In practical scenarios the availability of perfect CSI is not possible
    which is replaced by usage of statistical or imperfect CSI based on limited feedback.
    These approaches lead to delay in feedback and SIC error propagation which eventually
    results in outage events. Choi et al. propose a repetition-based NOMA strategy
    for PA without instantaneous CSI with increased diversity gain and low outage
    probability [97]. This makes it suitable for low-latency applications such as
    typical NOMA, users in this design transmit with same power but different number
    of repetitions. Yapıcıet al. propose a two-bit quantized low feedback CSI approach
    to reduce overhead in a millimeter wave NOMA network using distinctive angular
    propagation characteristics [98]. For CQI one bit is used for distance information
    and the other bit is used for angle information. It is proved numerically that
    the proposed strategy performs close to the full-CSI scenario in terms of outage
    sum-rate. Key Insights into Signaling Issues in NOMA To overcome SIC/CSI issues
    in NOMA and NOMA-enabled 5G emerging techniques following potential approaches
    can be applied to improve performance. SIC: • Receivers with better detection
    algorithms having higher detection accuracy need to be designed to be employed
    at every stage in SIC to reduce the effect of error propagation. Moreover, effective
    designs need to be proposed for striking a good complexity and performance trade-off.
    • When NOMA is combined with MIMO or massive MIMO the optimal decoding order design
    becomes more challenging in contrast to single antenna scenarios where channel
    conditions of users are scalar values. For multiple antenna designs matrices/vectors
    are used for channel conditions of users, therefore, comparing channel condition
    matrices of different users to achieve optimal decoding order becomes difficult.
    The number of SIC orderings and delay increases greatly when more than two users
    are considered for a NOMA user pair. • Dynamic SIC receiver specifically for power
    constrained DL NOMA are areas that need to be researched more. • The availability
    of instantaneous CSI is a dilemma for reliable wireless communication. SIC detection
    performed on the basis of imperfect CSI leads to SIC decoding failures. • Spectral
    and energy efficient hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) techniques that are
    less complex need to be explored to tackle such decoding failure issues. Deep
    learning techniques can be used to optimize and enhance the efficiency of model-driven
    transmitter/receiver based designs. CSI: • Robust designs considering imperfect
    CSI can be proposed. • One of the solutions can be to rely on partial CSI for
    modeling systems by considering large scale fading only, as path loss does not
    change rapidly compared to other types of fading. For less overhead, ML techniques
    can be employed to learn the path loss model to give sufficient information for
    near optimal NOMA performances. • Partial CSI using blind interference alignment
    (BIA) or semi-BIA techniques requiring only large scale effects at the transmitter
    can be adopted for finding the SIC decoding order or PA coefficients. Such schemes
    can reduce signaling overheads and achieve efficient utilization of limited resources.
    • Low complexity near optimal designs for gathering CSI can be suggested that
    maintain a trade-off between the complexity and performance of the NOMA system.
    • The number of bits fed back to the BS can be reduced for CSI estimations. 3.3.
    Security issues in NOMA Due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmission,
    it is vulnerable to eavesdropper attacks as communication between legitimate users
    can be overheard and intercepted by unauthorized users. To overcome these wireless
    security issues, traditionally cryptographic techniques have been used for enhancing
    security of legitimate users from unauthorized users at the cost of increased
    complexity, increased communication and overhead. Encryption and decryption requirements
    both at transmitters and receivers increase latency and processing requirements.
    Also, if the eavesdropper is equipped with the computational capacity it can decrypt
    encrypted data by exhaustive key search. As an alternative an emerging research
    direction is physical layer security which uses the inherent randomness of the
    wireless channel to ensure security. Wyner was the first one to introduce physical
    layer security in wireless communication from an information theoretic perspective
    [114]. Authors survey various physical layer security techniques and challenges
    for future 5G wireless networks in [115]. They identify devices connected in a
    decentralized fashion with different power and computation levels which implies
    devices can connect or leave the network anytime. In this scenario cryptographic
    key distribution and management becomes challenging, therefore, physical layer
    security can be used for secure transmissions. Table 7 gives a summary of security
    issues. Zou et al. identify and study trade-offs between security and reliability
    of physical layer security of a conventional wireless communication link in the
    presence of eavesdropper [116]. The reliability of the communication link can
    be improved by increasing source transmit power or by reducing the data rate.
    This decreases the outage probability at destination but increases the intercept
    probability at the eavesdropper through a wiretap link. NOMA is a potential 5G
    enabling multiple access technology for future wireless networks. The security
    of NOMA is of utmost importance for the design and deployment of 5G wireless networks.
    NOMA implementation poses certain security challenges that need to be resolved
    such as different transmit powers, implementation of SIC involving user privacy
    and heterogeneous security requirements for users. The following techniques have
    been suggested to resolve such security issues in NOMA. Optimization: The authors
    in [102], [103] and [104] study the maximization of secrecy sum-rate (SSR) for
    physical layer security of a NOMA network. Zhang et al. consider a SISO NOMA network
    [102] where the source should transmit data at a specific minimum data rate to
    each legitimate user in NOMA system ensuring a predefined QoS requirement. A feasible
    region of transmit power is found that satisfies minimum QoS requirements for
    all legitimate users. Then an optimization problem is formulated to obtain a closed-form
    expression that allocates optimal transmit power that maximizes SSR which is validated
    by numerical results. The impact of a mobile scenario for two random mobile users
    under passive eavesdropping is studied for random way point (RWP) and random direction
    (RD) models [103]. A sum average secrecy rate maximization problem under the constraints
    of power and QoS is formulated. Since eavesdropper’s CSI is not known at the BS
    an algorithm is proposed for threshold PA strategy to improve average sum-rate
    secrecy rate of mobile NOMA users. The authors in [104] enhance the physical layer
    security of a multiple-input single-output (MISO) NOMA network by careful beamforming
    design with the help of artificial noise (AN). Improved secrecy performance is
    achieved by finding optimal beamforming factors that can balance signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) between the useful signal strength and interfering signal strength.
    The secrecy outage probability (SOP) as a secrecy performance metric in optimization
    problems is considered in [105], [106]. He et al. propose a new secure NOMA practical
    design under secrecy constraints where CSI of eavesdropper is not perfectly known
    at the transmitter [105]. Design parameters such as decoding order, PA factors
    and data rates are thoroughly investigated. The authors in [106] utilize a novel
    approach to discuss the performance of physical layer security of a NOMA system
    where a strong near legitimate user is paired with an untrusted distant weak user.
    Outage probability of the NOMA pair for reliability and SOP of the trusted user
    as a QoS performance metric are defined for formulating an optimization problem.
    An optimization problem that minimizes the pair outage probability under the security
    constraint of SOP of the strong user and optimal PA is formulated. Closed-form
    expressions for outage probability and SOP are derived. Sun et al. consider secrecy
    performance of a resource allocation problem by designing a robust and secure
    resource allocation algorithm for MISO MC-NOMA network with a full-duplex BS operating
    with multiple half-duplex UL and DL users sharing same RB simultaneously [107].
    A robust non-convex optimization problem is formulated under imperfect CSI of
    eavesdropping channel that maximizes weighted system throughput under the constraint
    of information leakage and QoS of legitimate users with AN to maintain secure
    communication in the presence of eavesdroppers. The proposed optimal approach
    outperforms MISO OMA systems not only by simultaneously ensuring UL and DL security
    but also by achieving significant system secrecy rate improvement. Analytical:
    The authors study the physical layer security of NOMA and derive analytical expressions
    for SOP [108], [109], [110], [111]. Qin et al. study the secrecy performance of
    NOMA [108] in large scale networks. The analytical expressions for SOP of the
    NOMA user pair in a large scale network are derived where NOMA users and eavesdroppers
    are spatially located according to stochastic geometry. A protected area is considered
    around the source to keep away eavesdroppers. Imperfect SIC with CSI known at
    Alice is assumed. It is proved analytically and numerically that the diversity
    order of a NOMA user pair is determined by the weaker user. It was also concluded
    that the secrecy performance of physical layer can be enhanced by increasing the
    eavesdropper exclusion area that reduces the SOP, by reducing the number of Eves
    and by reducing the user range which leads to smaller path-loss. The same authors
    further extend their research of physical layer security of NOMA in large scale
    networks from single antenna transmission to multiple antenna aided transmission
    [109]. New exact analytical expressions are derived which are numerically validated
    to reduce the SOP of multiple antenna scenario by increasing the eavesdropper
    exclusion area and creating AN at the BS. The AN has no effect on Alice as it
    is intended on its null space where CSI is assumed to be known at the BS. Injection
    of AN at transmitter degrades the channel quality of eavesdropper without affecting
    the channel of legitimate users hence improving security. It is also shown that
    the channel quality of the eavesdropper is independent of the number of antennas
    employed at BS. Lv et al. are the first authors to consider a scenario where BS
    and users are operating in half duplex and eavesdropper in full duplex. They have
    the capability of simultaneously eavesdropping passively and actively jamming
    interference limited NOMA user pairs. This leads to decrease in data rates and
    enhances chances of interception by eavesdropper [110]. To overcome transmission
    outage caused by jamming of eavesdropper, a novel NOMA scheme is proposed. It
    specifically designs code word rates of paired users which limits the probability
    of transmission outages to a maximum tolerable threshold and reduces secrecy outage.
    Xiang et al. study the physical layer security performance of an overlay CR-NOMA
    system [111] where the protection of QoS of PU is considered as a constraint and
    the SU as eve which relays PU’s information opportunistically using its spectrum.
    The new secure NOMA transmission is designed to guarantee QoS of PUs and to properly
    manage and reduce the increased mutual interference among users. Closed-form expressions
    are analytically derived for connection outage probability (COP), SOP and effective
    secrecy throughput (EST) of the PUs over a Nakagami-m fading channel to study
    the effect of PA factors and transmit power on system secrecy performance. It
    is shown that the secrecy performance can be improved by pairing users with better
    channel gain users and by reducing the number of SUs. The improvement of secrecy
    rate of a NOMA network is studied by authors in [112], [113]. A multi-user NOMA
    network scheme is proposed that superimposes uni-casting transmission with multi-casting
    transmission thereby enhancing security and SE [112]. While designing NOMA, SIC
    is employed to detect signals from the superimposed signals at receiver UE. The
    implementation of SIC has security and privacy issues as the strong user decodes
    and subtracts the far user’s information from the superimposed signal to recover
    its own information thus, affecting the privacy of the paired users. Satrya et
    al. suggest a new SIC scheme that enhances security by using MAC address and international
    mobile equipment identity (IMEI) as private keys to encode data without compromising
    the privacy of other users [113]. Key Insights into Security Issues in NOMA •
    In cases where NOMA user can be a potential eavesdropper conventional upper layer
    security protocols such as cryptography and scrambling bits based on UE-specific
    code are still valid as only legitimate user has the private key. • More security-aware
    robust resource allocation designs for NOMA networks need to be explored. Most
    of the scenarios studied in literature are for static and two user NOMA systems.
    • To enhance SE and secrecy efficiency of NOMA future networks more users in each
    cluster for dynamic environments need to be researched using data driven-ML techniques
    or complementing them with conventional iterative model-based techniques. 4. NOMA
    and 5G enabling technologies The integration of NOMA with key 5G enabling technologies
    helps exploit the power domain to serve multiple users concurrently while promising
    significant potential in improving SE, user fairness, mass connectivity, extended
    coverage area, low latency, enhanced data rates, superior capacity gains and improved
    performances. Fig. 3 shows the 5G existing and emerging technologies reviewed
    in this paper for combination with NOMA. The subsequent subsections cover the

    4.1. HetNets and NOMA Due to proliferation of smart devices the network traffic
    is on the rise. This strain on network capacity demands technologies that are
    spectrally efficient. HetNets [135] is one such technology in which large number
    of low-powered small cells are added in an existing high power macro cell infrastructure.
    This cell densification approach gives benefits of better extended coverage area
    [136], improved network capacity, enhanced QoS, increased connectivity and efficient
    utilization of spectrum through frequency reuse over much smaller regions [137].
    The combination of NOMA and HetNet is a desirable approach for 5G and next generation
    networks as both technologies are spectrally efficient and cause capacity enhancement.
    The concept of user pairing in NOMA can further increase the number of connected
    devices and can therefore, enhance the system’s throughput. The issues that arise
    due to the interplay of HetNet and NOMA and their solutions are summarized below.

    Fig. 4. NOMA HetNet. 4.1.1. Resource allocation issues in NOMA-enabled HetNets
    In a NOMA-enabled HetNet, the small cell BSs using NOMA can be added in a simple
    macro BS or a NOMA-enabled macro BS. The macro cell and small cell users share
    the same resources (frequency and time) that need to be utilized efficiently.
    The application of NOMA can help in overcoming cross-tier and co-tier interference
    in HetNets. Fig. 4 shows a user pairing scheme for a HetNet, where both small
    cell base station (SBS) and macro cell base station (MBS) are NOMA-enabled. Resource
    allocation issues of PA, user pairing and joint UPPA for HetNets integrated with
    NOMA summarized in Table 8 are explained below. Power Allocation: Sophisticated
    and efficient PA schemes are required to reap the benefits of NOMA-enabled HetNets.
    Different tools and techniques have been applied and discussed to achieve efficient
    solutions as described below. Optimization: Cooperative NOMA with HetNets has
    been proposed by different authors in [119], [138], [139], [140], [141]. Nguyen
    et al. propose an approach that formulates a PA problem by maximizing the number
    of satisfied users of macro and small cell users in a cooperative NOMA HetNet
    [119]. A suboptimal solution is derived by formulating an iterative low complexity
    algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and majorization minimization
    (MM) technique. Energy efficient communication for NOMA HetNets by optimizing
    PA is investigated in [118], [120], [122], [123], [124], [135]. Zhang et al. suggest
    an energy efficient resource optimization problem that jointly optimizes user
    scheduling and PA under perfect and imperfect CSI. A trade-off between minimizing
    power consumption (in circuitry usage and transmit power) and maximizing data
    rate is investigated [120]. Authors in [118], [122], [124] focus on EE of small
    cells only. NOMA is applied to small cells to enhance spectrum efficiency and
    user access [118]. A joint spectrum allocation and power control problem is formulated
    which maximizes sum-rate of small cell users and also considers user fairness.
    The non-convex power control problem for each small cell BS is solved using sequential
    convex programming to approximate it to a convex problem and to iteratively update
    the PA result while satisfying the KKT conditions. The trade-off between small
    cell power consumption and sum-rate is investigated in [122], by formulating an
    energy efficient PA problem with imperfect CSI. The PA problem formulated under
    the constraints of outage probability is non-convex and probabilistic in nature.
    The EE of small cells is maximized by jointly optimizing subchannel and PA considering
    cross-tier interference in a DL NOMA HetNet [124]. The non-convex optimization
    problem is solved by developing an iterative algorithm that optimizes the small
    cell BS EE. Different from aforementioned EE maximization for small cells, the
    authors propose a joint subchannel allocation and PA problem [123] that maximizes
    EE of the entire system (small cell users as well as macro cell users) considering
    the co-channel and cross-tier interference. A sub-optimal algorithm is proposed
    in which the EE of small cell and macro cell is optimized alternatively. Device-to-device
    (D2D) enabled HetNets with NOMA are studied in [117] and [121]. The ergodic sum-rate
    of near users is maximized by jointly optimizing the PA and user scheduling in
    a D2D-enabled cooperative NOMA network. Since the number of users and small BSs
    is large it is prohibitive in terms of complexity to find an optimal result through
    exhaustive search. Therefore, the joint problem is decomposed into two sub-problems
    for getting optimal results [117]. Liu et al. propose a joint mobile association
    and PA problem that optimizes the minimum rate and sum-rate of the network for
    which optimal closed-form expressions are solved using a two step method [121].
    SWIPT-enabled NOMA HetNets are investigated in [130], [131]. Both papers propose
    EE maximization problems where a joint subchannel and PA problem is formulated
    in [130] and a joint PA and user association problem for a practical multi-cell
    NOMA is proposed in [131]. The coverage and link throughput performance of a non-coordinated
    NOMA and coordinated joint transmission NOMA (JT-NOMA) HetNet is analyzed in [125].
    The proposed JT-NOMA approach maximizes the coverage and link throughput of the
    system by applying optimal PA schemes. Game Theory: A PA problem is investigated
    in [126], where small BS and macro BS compete with each other to maximize throughput
    using equivalent channel gain. The PA problem is approached using a Stackelberg
    game where the macro BS is the leader and small BS follows it. Stackelberg equilibrium
    is achieved by proposing a distributed PA algorithm. Authors propose energy efficient
    PA problems [127], [129] that attain Nash equilibrium for NOMA-enabled HetNets.
    Since the number of users and femto cells is large [127], therefore, in order
    to reduce the complexity of the optimization problem, the EE for each user is
    optimized using a non-cooperative game. A centralized implementation of the energy
    efficient power control algorithm reduces the information exchange between the
    users and BS and hence attains Nash equilibrium. Long et al. maximized the EE
    by optimizing a joint user scheduling and PA problem among users on same subchannel
    and PA across subchannels [129]. A joint interference alignment and PA approach
    for DL MIMO-NOMA HetNets is proposed in [128]. A two phase PA based interference
    alignment and coordinated beamforming (PA-IA-CB) scheme is proposed that achieves
    enhanced sum-rate and reduces signaling overhead as a consequence of CSI sharing
    between small cells and macro cells. For solving the complex non-convex PA, the
    problem is relaxed. A non-cooperative game between small BS and macro BS is modeled
    to maximize their sum-rate by optimizing the price of the transmitted power. Joint
    User Pairing and Power Allocation: Joint UPPA related issues in NOMA-enabled HetNets
    are solved as follows using the techniques of optimization and matching theory.

    Fig. 5. MIMO-NOMA Communication. Optimization: A two-tier optimal resource allocation
    framework for a DL NOMA-enabled cognitive HetNet in interweave mode is proposed
    in [132]. A mixed integer non-linear programming optimization problem is formulated
    that is divided into three sub-problems to make it tractable. A novel sub-optimal
    user clustering algorithm for small cell users is proposed that maximizes small
    cell throughput by pairing users with disparate channel gains. Matching Theory:
    The authors in [133], study the effect of dynamic PA and user pairing on capacity
    dimensioning of a DL HetNet with hybrid multiple access. Four generic pairing
    algorithms (Hungarian, Gale-Shapley, random and exhaustive pairing) are investigated
    for performance gains and complexity under the presence and absence of load balancing
    techniques. Celik et al. propose a distributed cluster formation and power bandwidth
    allocation design for an imperfect NOMA HetNet due to non-ideal SIC receiver [134].
    The proposed approach independently forms 2-user clusters and distributively allocates
    power to each cluster. The cluster formation scheme applies a multiple-partite
    graph through dividing users on the basis of channel gains. Further, a sequential
    weighted bipartite matching approach is used to solve the matching problem. Key
    Insights into HetNets and NOMA • Matching theory and non-cooperative distributed
    PA game theory algorithms for enhanced EE should be investigated where SBS and
    MBS compete with each other to maximize throughput. • PA and joint UPPA issues
    solved using evolutionary game theory can be used to improve EE of a NOMA-enabled
    HetNet in future. • As the number of optimization variables increase in a NOMA-enabled
    HetNet having a combinatorial optimization problem, machine learning or powerful
    deep learning techniques can be applied for optimal resource allocation results
    to achieve fast convergence and less complexity. 4.2. MIMO-NOMA In the early years
    most of the research on NOMA involved a single antenna. Later, in order to further
    enhance its performance gains and avail extra spatial degree of freedom along
    with power domain, the MIMO technique was applied to NOMA. The interplay between
    these two emerging technologies, a.k.a. MIMO-NOMA, can possibly further multiply
    the spectrum utilization benefit of NOMA according to spatial multiplexing order
    of MIMO. The performance superiority in terms of capacity for single antenna NOMA
    over OMA already exists in literature. However, for the case of combination of
    MIMO with OMA and MIMO with NOMA, no such capacity proof exists. The authors in
    [142] analytically prove that MIMO-NOMA performs better than MIMO-OMA for the
    case of two users in each cluster in terms of sum channel capacity and ergodic
    sum capacity. Zeng et al. further analytically prove the superiority of MIMO-NOMA
    over MIMO-OMA in terms of sum channel capacity and ergodic sum capacity when considering
    multiple users in one cluster [143]. It is studied that with the increasing number
    of admitted users to a cluster the sum-rate decreases. Therefore, a trade-off
    must be maintained between the number of admitted users and the sum-rate. Two
    main types of MIMO-NOMA structures exist in literature namely (1) the cluster-based
    MIMO-NOMA structure; and (2) the beamformer-based MIMO-NOMA structure [2], [4],
    [7], [144] and [145]. In [7] the authors summarize these two forms of MIMO-NOMA.
    In cluster-based MIMO-NOMA users are grouped into several different clusters where
    users in each cluster are served by the same beamformer. In beamformer-based MIMO-NOMA
    each beam serves a single user, therefore, transmit antennas at BS are used to
    improve SE by increasing SINR. Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) show 2-user pairing schemes
    for both cluster-based and beamformer-based MIMO-NOMA respectively. The combination
    of these two technologies leads to additional challenges. NOMA already has the
    user pairing/user clustering, PA, channel ordering, SIC complexity and security
    issues. Once NOMA is combined with MIMO these aforementioned issues need special
    attention due to the addition of angular domain because of multiple antennas.
    Since the channel conditions are represented in matrix form for multiple antennas
    in contrast to scalar channel for single-antenna NOMA, we need proper beamforming,
    precoding and detection designs [7]. Multiple antenna systems offer an additional
    degree of freedom (DoF) by allowing simultaneous transfer of independent interference
    free data streams. Even though the application of NOMA to such scenarios enhances
    the performance gains by allowing transmission of multiple data streams on a single
    spatial dimension it however, results in certain degree of inter and intra-cluster
    interference. Most of the schemes applied for cancellation of interference requires
    CSI at both transmitter and receiver ends which increases the signaling overhead
    and load on the network’s resources. Authors have proposed a BIA scheme that still
    provides reliable transmission and offer gains of additional DoF even in the absence
    of perfect or imperfect CSI [146], [147], [148]. This scheme paves a way to utilize
    the limited spectrum resources more efficiently. It is shown in [149] that a semi-BIA
    considering only large scale effects of the channel can be employed to overcome
    inter-cluster interference while adopting NOMA within each cluster for MU-MISO
    systems. With the explosive growth in the number of connected devices there is
    an unprecedented increase in the demand of resources and spectrum usage. The 0.3–3
    GHz frequency band is fragmented and already crowded thus, there is a dire need
    of exploring other chunks of spectrum. Millimeter wave communication allows usage
    of unused spectrum above 3 GHz to support high data rates, increased capacity,
    reliability and seamless connectivity. Millimeter wave communication suffers from
    propagation and penetration loss which can be solved by using directional antennas
    at both transmitting and receiving ends. In order to attain 5G data requirements,
    multiple antenna technologies (MIMO and massive MIMO) and millimeter wave communication
    can be combined together [150], [151]. As with millimeter wave, the wavelength
    requirements for antenna length decrease which allows usage of large number of
    small sized antennas at both transmitter and receiver ends. This significantly
    increases directional antenna gain and reduces path loss [152], [153]. Usually
    the number of RF-chains is equal to the number of antennas. However, due to increased
    power consumption and higher operational costs of RF-chains only a limited number
    of these are present at each BS in millimeter wave communication in comparison
    to the number of antennas. This in turn reduces the number of users served. The
    integration of NOMA with millimeter wave MIMO can further increase the SE of a
    dense network with large number of users and can lead to increase in capacity,
    mass connectivity and overall system performance [154], [155], [156]. The combination
    of NOMA with millimeter wave MIMO comes naturally and is preferable because directional
    transmission means that users channels’ will be highly correlated which is beneficial
    for user pairing in NOMA. A millimeter wave BS has the limitation of having less
    number of RF-chains due to high costs. The inherent feature of NOMA to allow multiple
    users to share the same frequency and time resources simultaneously allows massive
    connectivity in millimeter wave NOMA systems. In addition, NOMA-enabled millimeter
    wave MIMO communication is capable of fulfilling the diverse requirements of users
    in a 5G network while improving SE by applying SIC [157]. Different solution techniques
    such as, optimization, analytical, game theory and ML [158], [159] have been reviewed
    in great detail to solve these issues [145] for MIMO-NOMA. 4.2.1. Resource allocation
    issues in MIMO-NOMA The addition of multiple antennas at both transmitter and
    receiver sides introduces complex interference in MIMO-NOMA networks especially
    in the case of cluster based MIMO-NOMA (intra and inter-cluster interference).
    The MIMO-NOMA resource allocation strategies including user clustering/user pairing,
    beam forming, PA, effective precoding and detectors and joint UPPA designs are
    appropriately designed to meet the requirements of minimum power consumption and
    maintaining QoS with enhanced SE. Different tools and techniques have been used
    to discuss solutions for these resource allocation issues and summarized in Table
    9. User Pairing: Grouping users in different clusters and beams is an important
    task in MIMO-NOMA designs. Efficient pairing not only investigates the number
    of users allocated to each cluster but also identifies which user joins which
    cluster. These two important problems need to be tackled in the design of MIMO-NOMA
    networks. For optimizing EE and maximizing sum-rate while user clustering different
    optimization, game theory and analytical techniques have been used to propose
    solutions. Table 9. Summary of resource allocation issues and solutions in MIMO-NOMA.

    with NOMA introduces new user clustering issues which have been proposed to be
    solved using different low complexity algorithms based on analytical techniques
    in [143], [160] and [161]. Authors propose a new design [160] for precoding and
    detection matrices using simple fixed set of power coefficients in cluster-based
    MIMO-NOMA scenarios. Since NOMA is implemented for users in smaller groups, therefore,
    MIMO detection can be used to overcome inter-cluster interference. Furthermore,
    the impact of user pairing for a two-user MIMO-NOMA scenario which reduces system
    complexity when compared to conventional MIMO-OMA case is analyzed and found to
    be superior. The authors in [161] study location-based MIMO-NOMA transmission.
    The investigated scenario derives analytical ergodic sum-rate approximations for
    the two user case for NOMA (when users are separated in distance) and space-division
    multiple access (SDMA) (when users have largely separated angle of departure)
    considering Rician fading and using location-based line-of-sight (LOS) beam forming.
    Three distance-based user selection schemes for clustered millimeter wave MIMO-NOMA
    design are proposed to access the impact of path loss on performance [152]. Stochastic
    geometry is invoked to model users as PCP. Closed-form analytical expressions
    are derived for coverage probability and system throughput performance. Game Theory:
    A joint mobile user clustering, beam forming and BS selection problem for a DL
    multi-cell MIMO-NOMA network is proposed in [162]. It considers sum data rate
    maximization and relative fairness and suggests a two-sided coalitional matching
    scheme. It jointly optimizes and derives a win-win strategy between NOMA clustering
    and BS selection. Power Allocation: The issue of PA and power sharing among different
    clusters along with different users of a single cluster is of utmost importance
    in MIMO-NOMA. It affects system performance and inter-cluster and intra-cluster
    interference. We summarize different solution approaches for solving these issues
    using analytical, optimization and game theory techniques and tools [160], [163],
    [164], [165], [166], [167]. Optimization: PA strategies have been solved using
    optimization techniques in [165] and [166]. In both papers the optimization problem
    is non-convex, therefore, alternate ways have been proposed to solve these. An
    ergodic sum capacity maximization solution for a MIMO-NOMA network under the constraints
    of total transmit power and QoS of weak user using statistical CSI at the transmitter
    end has been proposed [165]. Authors propose a two stage multi-cast joint beam
    forming and minimum PA problem [166] that is further applied to NOMA to enhance
    the number of users it can support. Power coefficients for a BIA based NOMA scheme
    are found that maximize the sum-rate or fairness based on a random matrix theory
    in [149]. Cui et al. propose a non-convex joint user scheduling and PA optimization
    problem in [157]. They study designs of PA and user scheduling with beamforming
    that reduces feedback overhead and maximizes sum-rate under the constraints of
    total transmit power and users’ QoS. Beamforming design and PA are interlinked
    in millimeter wave NOMA for directional transmission. Joint beamforming and PA
    optimization problems are investigated in [155], [174], [175]. In [175], the same
    solution approach discussed in [154] is extended to multiple users per cluster.
    A sub-optimal joint PA and beamforming design based on block coordinate descent
    method for EE maximization in a millimeter wave NOMA network using practical channel
    model is proposed [153]. The power consumption increases due to increase in the
    number of RF-chains, therefore, authors in [156], [173] optimize PA by maximizing
    EE under the constraints of users’ QoS. The proposed algorithms outperform the
    existing conventional OMA schemes in terms of EE. The users are paired in groups
    of two on the basis of their channel gain difference and correlation [156]. Since
    the energy maximization problem is non-convex it is solved by using fractional
    programming theory for dividing it into independent convex problems for which
    closed-form expressions are derived using coordinate descent method. Optimum PA
    designs for MIMO-enabled millimeter wave NOMA are studied in [173], [176], [177].
    Jiao et al. propose a DL multi-beam millimeter wave beamspace MIMO-NOMA design
    [176] for solving PA problem while considering user fairness. The inter and intra-beam
    interference makes the problem non-convex which is solved by achieving max–min
    rate by allocating same rate to all users. Further, a bisection search method
    is applied to find optimum max–min rate and PA coefficients. A joint beam selection
    and PA problem that enables mass connectivity is proposed in [177], which is non-convex
    in nature due to large number of antennas and users. The joint sum-rate maximization
    problem is decomposed into two sub-problems of beam selection and PA. Equal power
    is allocated for finding out the optimum active beam set, this result is fed to
    find out optimum PA. Intelligent searching algorithms such as PSO, genetic algorithm
    and simulated annealing are used to find optimum results that maximize rate. Analytical:
    Fixed PA and CR-inspired PA strategies have been proposed for use in solving the
    PA problems in a few MIMO-NOMA networks [160] and [164]. The authors propose a
    new design for precoding and detection matrices using simple fixed set of power
    coefficients in cluster-based DL MIMO scenarios [160]. CR-inspired MIMO-NOMA has
    been proposed to allocate different power coefficients under two different constraints
    of predefined fixed QoS and dynamic QoS. A more generalized signal alignment based
    MIMO-NOMA framework is studied in [164]. It is applicable to both UL and DL transmissions
    and to scenarios where the number of antennas at the BS are more than the number
    of antennas at the user receiver. Thus, achieving a larger diversity gain by efficiently
    exploiting the spatial degree of freedom. Stochastic geometry has been applied
    to model the impact of random users and interferers. The application of MIMO-NOMA
    to an IoT network is discussed in [163]. A new design of precoding matrix and
    PA policy for a DL MIMO-NOMA scenario for small packet transmission in the IoT
    is proposed. The precoding matrix is designed such that even if the users’ channel
    conditions are quite similar, a distinct channel gain difference can be maintained
    thus, making the use of NOMA highly desirable in such a MIMO network. The effective
    channel gain at the near user is improved and the effective channel gain at the
    far user is degraded which makes it ideal to be used as an IoT user that operates
    at low data rates. Game Theory: A joint interference alignment and PA approach
    for DL MIMO-NOMA HetNets has been investigated in [128]. A two phase PA-IA-CB
    scheme is proposed that achieves enhanced sum-rate and reduces signaling overhead
    as a consequence of CSI sharing between small cells and macro cells. Joint User
    Pairing and Power Allocation: Most of the research in resource allocation of MIMO-NOMA
    require two phase sophisticated designs called joint UPPA. These approaches involve
    two phases of user pairing as well as PA for users in different clusters of a
    MIMO-NOMA network. We have reviewed different solutions for joint UPPA using optimization  [145],
    [167], [168], [169], [170], [171], ML  [178] and game theory  [172] techniques.
    Optimization: Authors in [167] and [168] investigate dynamic user clustering PA
    optimization problems for MIMO-NOMA scenarios. Liu et al. propose a two-step dynamic
    user clustering PA optimization problem considering user fairness for a DL clustering-based
    MIMO-NOMA system [167]. Optimal results can be achieved by applying an exhaustive
    search method, however, it is computationally complex. Therefore, the authors
    in this paper take a suboptimal approach that numerically proves that the proposed
    method is computationally less complex and gives acceptable degradation of throughput
    of the weak user. Further the authors investigate [168] a DL multi-user MIMO-NOMA
    system that considers a case where the total number of receive antennas at the
    UE are more than the number of transmit antennas at the BS. The performance superiority
    of the proposed system is achieved by performing comparative simulations for different
    MIMO-NOMA and MIMO-OMA models considering different cluster sizes and transmit
    antennas under correlated and uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. The application
    of NOMA to a MIMO system increases inter-cluster interference which is discussed
    in [145], [168], [170] and [171]. It has been solved by proposing a new multi-cluster
    zero-forcing beamforming technique and a low complexity dynamic user clustering
    algorithm [168]. The authors proposed a cluster-based structure [145] in which
    two users shared a single beamforming vector in power domain. The proposed approach
    resulted in intra and inter-beam interference from other users and beams. Therefore,
    in order to overcome this issue a user clustering and PA algorithm is presented
    that reduces interference and ensures enhanced sum capacity by pairing users that
    have highly correlated channels but very distinct channel gains. The inter-cluster
    interference issue is discussed for multi-cell MIMO-NOMA scenarios in [170] and
    [171]. The authors proposed a joint user clustering and multi-dimensional resource
    allocation problem [170] for a multi-cell DL MIMO-NOMA network taking effective
    capacity under consideration. A user clustering algorithm is proposed that groups
    users into different clusters and applies zero-forcing beamforming to overcome
    inter-cluster interference. Then, a joint channel allocation and PA NP-hard problem
    is formulated that maximizes the effective capacity of all users. In the second
    phase the optimal PA with fixed channel allocation is achieved by convex optimization
    using Lagrange duality problem. Furthermore, Chinnadurai et al. proposed a robust
    beamforming design under imperfect CSI that deals with weighted sum-rate maximization
    (WSRM) under transmit power constraints for a DL multi-cell MIMO-NOMA system [171].
    Since it is an NP-hard problem, therefore, it is solved by applying a MM approach
    to achieve optimal beamforming matrix. Also, a joint user clustering and PA algorithm
    is proposed that overcomes the inter and intra-cluster interference that are present
    due to WSRM problem. The users in this algorithm are clustered on the basis of
    minimum distance factor and channel correlation to improve overall sum-rate. A
    joint beamforming and PA problem for a MIMO-NOMA scenario where the users to be
    paired together belong to two different groups depending upon their QoS instead
    of location information is proposed in [169]. The sum-rate of the users requiring
    high QoS is maximized under the constraint of ensuring minimum rate for the low
    QoS user group. Optimization and Machine Learning: In [178], a joint non-convex
    optimization problem of user clustering, PA and beamforming for maximizing sum-rate
    is divided into sub-problems to make it tractable. ML is applied to solve the
    user clustering problem. K-means clustering algorithm is used to group millimeter
    wave NOMA users into different clusters on the basis of channel correlations.
    Furthermore, an online k-means user clustering algorithm to reduce complexity
    for a practical dynamic approach is proposed. Optimal power is allocated to users
    within a cluster on the assumption that all clusters are allocated equal power
    using optimization techniques that exploit successive decoding feature. Game Theory:
    Ding et al. present a joint optimization problem of beamforming cluster vector
    and PA coefficient for mobile users targeting the reduction in power consumption
    for a MIMO-NOMA network [172]. An optimal decoding order is derived. The proposed
    approach is found to avoid peer effect by grouping mobile users in different clusters.
    To further minimize the power consumed an improved coalition game approach is
    applied to optimize mobile user clustering by forming a flexible cluster size
    for a large scale MIMO network. 4.2.2. Signaling issues in MIMO-NOMA Although
    the use of multiple antennas in MIMO-NOMA results in increased sum capacity and
    SE but it also leads to increased signaling issues and high overhead due to design
    complexity (e.g., SIC, transmit precoding and detection matrices, imperfect CSI).
    Therefore, low complexity and robust designs are desirable. Table 10 gives a summary
    of recent papers that cover these issues and are explained below. SIC Issues:
    SIC is applied for decoding superimposed messages at the receiver end of both
    UL and DL NOMA communications. SIC faces the issues of receiver complexity and
    error propagation. Performance degradation of the system can be caused if the
    signals for the weak users are decoded incorrectly leading to incorrect cancellation
    or even if the signals are decoded perfectly they might not be canceled correctly
    due to hardware issues. Authors in [159] and [179] give solutions for this issue
    using the ML tool. Table 10. Summary of signaling issues and solutions of MIMO-NOMA.

    UL Analytical Maximum EST and coverage probability. Machine Learning: Kang et
    al. propose a deep learning-based solution to imperfect SIC decoding for a practical
    DL MIMO-NOMA system [179]. The authors in this paper propose a joint precoding
    and SIC decoding design in non-linear manner using deep learning. Since this problem
    is non-convex and non-linear therefore, it is difficult to solve it numerically
    and analytically. The precoder and SIC decoder constructed using deep feed forward
    neural networks are trained to minimize total minimum mean square error (MMSE)
    between users’ desired signal and decoded signals. The numerical results and computer
    simulations of the deep learning based design clearly outperforms the existing
    schemes. Since SIC faces the issues of receiver complexity and error propagation.
    In order to overcome these issues a deep neural network based algorithm for DL
    MIMO-NOMA is proposed by authors [159] for estimating CSI and signal detection
    for a Rayleigh fading channel. Extensive simulations verify that the performance
    of the proposed neural network method for finding optimum results is comparable
    to the existing SIC method for signal detection. Further, authors study the impact
    of PA, modulation type and mini batch size to prove the superiority of the proposed
    approach under all testing scenarios. CSI Issues: Partial CSI using only path
    loss information and using limited feedback for precoding matrices can be possible
    solutions for reducing overhead and signaling issues related to CSI [158]. Optimization:
    Chen et al. investigate the impact of partial CSI on design, analysis and optimization
    of a general framework of multiple antenna NOMA system for multi-user DL transmission
    applicable to both time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD)
    modes [180]. 4.2.3. Security issues in MIMO-NOMA The broadcast nature of wireless
    transmission in NOMA makes it prone to attacks by potential eavesdropper(s) along
    with the security threat of SIC. The use of multiple antennas can help enhance
    the performance of physical layer security in MIMO-NOMA. In addition, the multiple
    antennas can help in creating an artificial distinct channel difference between
    the paired users in NOMA which helps overcoming attacks by eavesdroppers [158].
    Different authors have proposed analytical [183], [184] and optimization techniques
    [167], [181] to improve physical layer security for UL and DL MIMO-NOMA networks.
    These techniques are summarized in Table 11 and discussed below. Optimization:
    For secure DL MIMO-NOMA transmissions physical layer security techniques using
    non-convex optimization problems having total transmit power as a constraint have
    been discussed in [181] and [182]. A SSR maximization problem that considers a
    single BS communicating with multiple legitimate users and an eavesdropper under
    the constraints of successful SIC and total transmit power has been investigated
    [181]. Inspired by the relationship between mutual information rate and MMSE the
    non-convex optimization problem is transformed into a biconvex problem using alternate
    optimization approach. Jiang et al. propose secure beamforming as a physical layer
    security technique for DL MIMO-NOMA system comprising of multiple antenna BS,
    cell-center (legitimate user) and cell-edge user (potential eavesdropper) [182].
    To maximize achievable secrecy rate of the strong user under the constraints of
    BS transmit power and minimum transmission rate requirement of weak user a secure
    beamforming optimization problem is formulated. Analytical: A physical layer security
    approach to propose a secure DL MIMO-NOMA system comprising of multiple legitimate
    and ill-legitimate users experiencing Nakagami-m fading channel has been proposed
    in [183]. Multiple antennas and max–min transmit antenna selection scheme are
    used to improve security while considering both users of a user pair simultaneously.
    It is observed that the SOP can be improved by increasing number of antennas at
    BS in the max–min transmit antenna selection scheme. In contrast to the aforementioned
    research on DL physical layer security, Gomez et al. propose a physical layer
    security approach for an UL multiple antenna aided NOMA network [184]. It comprises
    of multiple legitimate users with an eavesdropper exclusion area around them and
    eavesdroppers whose CSI is unknown at BS. The proposed design takes a stochastic
    geometry approach for analyzing EST and coverage probability for cases of fixed
    or adaptive transmission rate. Analytical expressions are derived for EST which
    help compute wiretap code rates, optimum transmit power and optimum eavesdropper
    exclusion area that achieve maximum EST. Key Insights into MIMO-NOMA • Most of
    the existing work regarding application of MIMO to NOMA considers full rank channel
    matrices which shows ideal improved performances whereas there is a need to consider
    designs with rank-deficient matrices in future. • Exploring and combining other
    advanced interference avoiding schemes such as interference alignment, BIA to
    enhance system reliability can be a new research direction. • Multi-carrier and
    multi-cell frameworks combined with MIMO-NOMA lead to increased parameters which
    can be prohibitively complex to solve with traditional model driven techniques.
    Therefore, such designs can be solved using ML where the large amount of data
    such as CSI required for user pairing, PA and SIC ordering collected in one iteration
    can later on be used to train unsupervised learning algorithms with reduced implementation
    complexity. • When further design variables are added to a system deep learning
    can be a more powerful form of ML to be used. • With complexity associated with
    increasing number of dynamic users for user pairing and PA the tools of deep reinforcement
    learning, unsupervised learning and game theory need to be researched more as
    they give less complex, energy efficient and spectral efficient solutions for
    such dynamic scenarios. Table 12. Summary of resource allocation issues and solutions

    efficient, reliable, energy efficient and capacity enhancing technology capable
    of handling the explosive demands of data traffic by aggressively implementing
    spatial multiplexing. Massive MIMO-OMA has been researched to show that it performs
    well for under-loaded systems, i.e., when the number of users is less than or
    equal to the number of antennas at the BS, but is unable to support overloaded
    systems. The integration of massive MIMO with NOMA overcomes this issue and gives
    superior performance with the capability of mass connectivity [193]. Extremely
    high frequencies of millimeter wave communication not only allow usage of unused
    spectrum above 3 GHz to meet the ever growing connectivity, resources and data
    rate demands of 5G but also decreases the antenna size requirements deployed at
    the transceivers. This paves way to the combination of millimeter wave with extremely
    large antenna arrays or simply massive MIMO. The combination of these two dominant
    5G technologies promise the potential benefits of increased throughput and system
    performance by making use of huge vacant bandwidth in millimeter wave and high
    multiplexing gain attainable with massive MIMO [151]. Due to power consumption
    constraints and hardware cost limitations the number of RF-chains used in such
    scenarios are limited which reduces the number of users being served. In order
    to resolve these issues recently the integration of NOMA, massive MIMO and millimeter
    wave communication as NOMA with Millimeter wave Massive MIMO has been an active
    research area. This combination is envisioned to improve SE, system throughput
    and achievable capacity gains [194]. The different resource allocation issues
    and their solutions using different techniques for NOMA with massive MIMO and
    millimeter wave massive MIMO systems have been discussed below. 4.3.1. Resource
    allocation issues in massive MIMO-NOMA Resource allocation issues and solutions
    for massive MIMO-NOMA have been summarized in Table 12 and discussed in detail
    below. User Pairing: To enhance the spectrum efficiency and connectivity of a
    network analytical, optimization and ML techniques have been used to solve the
    user pairing issue. Analytical: To increase the number of connected devices and
    enhance SE, a user pairing and scheduling algorithm is proposed in [185]. It improves
    sum-rate and outage performance by application of NOMA in massive MIMO. To overcome
    the limitation of using increased number of BS antennas and inter-pair interference
    an interference cancellation combining matrix is designed increasing SINR of users
    in each pair. Optimization: A joint user pairing and beamforming design considering
    users’ positioning is proposed that maximizes outage sum-rate of two paired NOMA
    users [191]. The users are arranged in descending order of estimated distance
    from BS which assures line-of-sight availability. For user pairing, two users
    having minimum pairing angle are expected to lie in the same millimeter wave beam
    width and are paired together using fixed PA. This eliminates the need of CSI
    of users at the BS. The antenna beam is steered towards the paired NOMA users.
    Machine Learning: K-means clustering algorithm using channel correlations of normalized
    channels as a feature selection measure is used for user grouping of different
    NOMA users in [154]. Power Allocation: Efficient PA policies for enhanced performances
    and increased SE in massive MIMO-NOMA using different optimization techniques
    have been explained below in detail. Optimization: Authors in [186], [187] proposed
    optimal PA policies by maximizing EE under the constraints of users’ QoS in millimeter
    wave enabled massive MIMO-NOMA communication systems. In order to reduce the number
    of RF-chains at the BS a hybrid analog-digital beamforming design is proposed.
    NOMA clusters of two users are formed on the basis of users’ gain difference and
    channel correlations. Iterative PA algorithms are developed for attaining global
    optimum results. Different from [187], authors in [186] propose an UL design.
    EE in UL transmission is more important as there is limited power at user devices.
    Further, an enhanced NOMA design is proposed which makes use of the global information
    available at the BS to remove inter-cluster interference. Authors propose non-convex
    joint user scheduling and PA optimization problem in [192]. The ASR is maximized
    and dynamic PA coefficients are found using an iterative optimization algorithm.
    The channel estimation and transmission strategy is also studied. Beamforming
    design and PA are interlinked in millimeter wave NOMA for directional transmission.
    Joint beamforming and PA optimization problems are investigated in [153], [154].
    The maximum ASR for the non-convex joint problems are solved suboptimally by dividing
    them into two tractable sub-problems. The PA problem is divided into inter-group
    and intra-group PA under arbitrary and fixed hybrid beamforming in [154]. Joint
    User Pairing and Power Allocation: Joint UPPA policies derived by using optimization
    techniques for optimal results are listed below. Optimization: Joint UPPA schemes
    have been proposed by maximizing sum-rate in [188], [189]. Authors propose channel
    correlation-based user clustering, pilot assignment and power transmit algorithms
    [188] to maximize ASR for both loaded and under loaded scenarios. A new low complexity
    scheme for massive MIMO-NOMA with receive antenna selection (RAS) in UL over Rayleigh
    fading channel for mass connectivity and increased sum capacity with better user
    fairness is investigated [189]. The users in the proposed design are grouped into
    two multi-user MIMO clusters, high power cluster (HPC) and low power cluster (LPC),
    on the basis of available number of radio frequency channels and propagation channel
    conditions. It is followed by a simultaneous transmission from HPC and LPC using
    NOMA with efficient PA strategies. An optimal sum-rate maximization dynamic user
    clustering, RAS and PA exhaustive search algorithm is formulated. In [190], each
    user group has a cluster head that has the highest channel gain within the group
    with members having high channel correlations whereas there is low channel correlation
    among all cluster heads of different groups. To support simultaneous transmission
    low complexity PA algorithm is proposed in which for a large number of users a
    learning based and adaptive continuous cross-entropy (CE) approach is proposed
    which improves sum data rates. Table 13. Summary of signaling issues and solutions

    Communication. 4.3.2. Signaling issues in massive MIMO-NOMA The signaling issues
    due integration of massive MIMO with NOMA have been listed in Table 13 and discussed
    in the proceeding passages. CSI Issues: Perfect CSI is required for coherent signal
    processing at the BS in massive MIMO-NOMA systems which is difficult to achieve
    practically. The following solutions using different tools and techniques have
    been proposed. Analytical: A limited feedback massive MIMO-NOMA DL design that
    does not feedback channel condition matrices back to the BS is investigated in
    [196]. The proposed approach is decomposed into multiple SISO NOMA channels. The
    design is analytically analyzed from performance perspective in two scenarios,
    that is perfect user ordering and one-bit feedback. Optimization: Chen et al.
    exploit the spatial and power domain features of massive MIMO and NOMA respectively
    [195]. They design a fully non-orthogonal communication framework to overcome
    practical signaling issues and attain benefits of mass connectivity and SE over
    limited available spectrum. The proposed framework consists of non-orthogonal
    channel estimation for shortening the length of training sequence that is not
    longer than the channel coherence time and non-orthogonal multiple access is optimized
    to reduce residual interference due to imperfect SIC. Two low complexity and efficient
    optimization algorithms have been proposed to optimize transmit power for channel
    estimation and multiple access for maximizing weighted sum SE. 4.3.3. Security
    issues in massive MIMO-NOMA The optimization techniques used to enhance the physical
    layer security of massive MIMO-NOMA systems have been summarized in Table 14 and
    elaborated below. Optimization: Two optimization algorithms to maximize secrecy
    rate and EE by minimization of transmit powers are investigated [197], [198] for
    secure massive MIMO-NOMA systems. To improve security in [198], an AN is injected
    in null space of effective channel of clusters in the presence of a passive eavesdroppers
    with imperfect CSI. Fig. 6(a) shows a secure massive MIMO-NOMA network for two
    users per cluster in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Instead of passive
    eavesdroppers, authors in [197] enhance the physical layer security by proposing
    a non-orthogonal channel estimate and multiple access framework with multiple
    legitimate users and active eavesdroppers. Fig. 6(b) shows this scenario with
    two users per cluster along with an active eavesdropper. The fully non-orthogonal
    framework helps to enhance the signal quality of the legitimate users and exploits
    the otherwise detrimental inter-user interference which serves as AN to confuse
    the eavesdropper. Hence improves secrecy performance of the system. Key Insights
    into Massive MIMO-NOMA • Clustering algorithms are a desirable option for user
    pairing and clustering as unsupervised learning does not require training in advance.
    ML-based k-means clustering algorithms have been applied to group users into clusters
    on the basis of channel conditions and correlations. • ML and matching theory
    techniques of moderate complexity need to be analyzed for user pairing. • PA issues
    can be further researched using stable, convergent and inherently self organizing
    solutions using game theory in overloaded massive MIMO systems. • Promising ML
    techniques can be adopted in designs where acquisition of perfect CSIT is very
    important. Efficient CSIT estimation techniques for supporting large number of
    antennas at BS can be solved by applying unsupervised or reinforcement learning
    ML models which can use huge CSI data sets available in the cell for training.
    Big data analytic can be used to help applying ML in such NOMA-enabled scenarios.
    • Millimeter wave massive MIMO-NOMA system can be optimized using deep learning
    techniques capable of extracting the sparse features of millimeter wave and using
    them to learn the whole wireless system. • For secure massive MIMO-NOMA systems
    more scenarios where eavesdroppers or unauthorized users actually forming a member
    of the NOMA user pair can be studied and solved using different techniques. 4.4.
    Cooperative communication and NOMA Cooperative communication and NOMA can be broadly
    divided into two categories namely Cooperative NOMA and CoMP-NOMA which have been
    discussed in detail in the following sections. 4.4.1. Cooperative NOMA Wireless
    cooperative communication is a technology that achieves benefits of capacity gain,
    increased QoS of users, diversity gain, greater coverage area and efficient utilization
    of resources similar to as achieved by MIMO. Different from MIMO, cooperative
    communication uses a single-transmit antenna in a multi-user scenario while using
    the idea of cooperation among participating nodes of a wireless network [212].
    Whereas NOMA is an emerging multiple access technology suitable for 5G communication
    due to its SE, low-latency, increasing connectivity capability, user fairness
    and superior data rates and performance. The combination of NOMA with wireless
    cooperative communication as shown in Fig. 7 is a more favorable approach as NOMA
    has the inherent property of having prior knowledge of the weak user therefore,
    it can perform SIC at the strong user. This availability of information at the
    strong user is leveraged to propose the concept of cooperative NOMA, which allows
    cooperative transmission to the weak user resulting in increased reception reliability
    and performance of the weak user [4], [213], [214]. The cooperative NOMA transmission
    comprises of two phases, direct transmission and cooperative transmission. In
    the first time slot a superimposed message signal of UE-1 and UE-2 is sent to
    both UE-1 and UE-2. SIC is performed at the high gain UE-1 and the decoded information
    of UE-2 is relayed to the weak UE-2 in the second time slot. Therefore, UE-2 receives
    two copies of same signal from two different paths which is used to improve the
    reception reliability of the weak user. Download : Download high-res image (315KB)

    users. The concept of cooperative NOMA was introduced and analyzed for the first
    time by Ding et al. [213] where its performance was analytically shown in terms
    of outage probability and diversity order. The system complexity can increase
    due to coordination of increasing number of users cooperating in cooperative NOMA.
    This can be overcome by implementing pairing of users with distinctive channel
    gains. Users of a cell are divided into multiple groups and OMA is used as multiple
    access technique for inter-group whereas within each group cooperative NOMA is
    implemented. The authors in [215] comprehensively survey NOMA-based cooperative
    communication. They discuss different types of cooperative NOMA structures by
    categorizing them into user relaying and dedicated relaying. They further investigate
    the enhancement in performance of cooperative NOMA by combining advanced transmission
    technologies, such as FD, CR, SWIPT and MIMO. The resource allocation (user/relay
    selection, PA and relay mode selection) performance of cooperative NOMA is analyzed
    in terms of outage probability and achievable data rate. The issues faced by cooperative
    NOMA and their proposed solutions are summarized below. Resource Allocation Issues
    in Cooperative NOMA Resource allocation management is a critical issue in cooperative
    NOMA where multiple users are cooperating in the same time/frequency band with
    different power levels. Issues such as PA and user pairing are mostly formulated
    as user fairness and capacity maximization problems or minimization of transmit
    power or outage probability [200], [213], [214], [216]. Efficient allocation of
    resources can improve the performance of the network. The following approaches
    have been summarized in Table 15 and suggested in text to solve resource allocation
    issues. User Pairing: Different user pairing schemes can help utilize the resources
    more efficiently and can reduce the coordination complexity of the network due
    to cooperation. The following ways can be employed to pair different users together
    by applying analytical techniques. Analytical: Authors in [199], [200] propose
    distance-based user pairing schemes for users randomly located in DL cooperative
    NOMA networks. The coverage probability and average data rate of two different
    types of geometric distance-based user pairing schemes, close to user pairing
    (CUP) and close to source pairing (CSP), is investigated in [199]. The position
    of BS and typical user is kept fixed whereas the candidate users to be paired
    are randomly distributed as a Poisson point process (PPP). The effect of user
    pairing, transmission mode (full-duplex, half-duplex) and PA on the system performance
    is analyzed analytically. The authors proposed two user pairing strategies [200],
    random user pairing where weak and strong channel users are randomly paired on
    the basis of one-bit feedback and distance-based user pairing where the weak and
    strong user are ordered on the basis of their distance from the BS. The outage
    probability, diversity order and sum-rate of paired users is derived for the proposed
    schemes. Power Allocation: Optimal PA is an important issue in cooperative NOMA
    not only due to user pairing in power domain but also due to power consumption
    at relay for signal transmission. The following optimization and game theory tools
    have been used to resolve this issue. Optimization: In [201], [202], [203] optimal
    powers are allocated to users in cooperative NOMA networks with fixed locations.
    A joint sub-carrier pairing and PA non-convex optimization problem for multi-carrier
    scenarios is investigated in [201]. The transmit power minimization of BS and
    relay user is sub-divided into two phases to be solved optimally. Liu et al. proposed
    two ASR maximization problems for optimum PA in full-duplex and half-duplex modes
    for which the optimal results were achieved by a two step process in [202]. The
    authors also study two optimization approaches in [203] to find optimal PA in
    full-duplex mode. A joint optimal power control and relay selection non-convex
    optimization problem that maximizes the system sum-rate in cooperative NOMA network
    is solved using geometric approach in [204]. The number of satisfied users of
    macro and small cells are maximized in a cooperative NOMA HetNet by formulating
    an optimal PA policy. A suboptimal solution is derived by formulating an iterative
    low complexity algorithm based on SCA and MM technique [119]. Game Theory: A PA
    and relay selection framework in a cooperative NOMA-aided spectrum sharing system
    is solved using a Nash bargaining game-based algorithm that maximizes the product
    of utilities of PUs and SUs with a step-by-step approach [205]. Security Issues
    in Cooperative NOMA Conventionally, the broadcast nature of wireless transmission
    makes it more vulnerable to malicious attacks. Although user cooperation in cooperative
    NOMA helps improve reception reliability and QoS there is a possibility of presence
    of an untrusted relay or eavesdroppers in the vicinity of the users. The following
    tools and techniques have been used to enhance the physical layer security of
    cooperative NOMA networks which have been summarized in Table 16 and explained
    below. Analytical: The physical layer security in the presence of passive eavesdropper(s)
    for DL cooperative NOMA systems is studied in [217], [218]. Exact SOP for both
    strong and weak users is derived analytically, where the closed-form expression
    for the weak user is derived in high SNR due to intractability of exact analysis
    [218]. Authors investigated the secrecy outage performance of uniformly distributed
    legitimate users and passive eavesdroppers modeled as PPP [217] while considering
    two scenarios; firstly, while considering security of only strong user and secondly
    while considering security of both users. The exact SOP is analytically derived
    for the first case where all power of the strong user is allocated in transmitting
    message to the weak user and in the second case the strong user acts as a relay
    and friendly jammer. A portion of the power is used in transmitting noise and
    the rest is used in relaying message to the weak user. Instead of passive eavesdropper,
    the authors in this paper [219] study the physical layer security of a cooperative
    NOMA system in the presence of untrusted relay. In the first slot of transmission,
    the source transmits a superimposed message of information signal and jamming
    signal to the relay and destination where beamforming is used to degrade the signal
    received at relay and to remain unaffected at the destination. Whereas, in the
    second time slot, the source and relay operating in half duplex mode transmit
    signals simultaneously to maximize SSR. Table 16. Summary of security issues and

    CoMP-NOMA NOMA is a promising multiple access technique that achieves higher SE
    when compared to OMA techniques. Most of the research related to NOMA has mostly
    been related to single cell NOMA scenarios where as very limited work has been
    done on multi-cell NOMA networks [5] up till now. Multi-cell networks lead to
    ICI which results in reduced data rates for cell-edge users. In order to mitigate
    interference received at cell-edge users, an existing concept (used in 3GPP for
    LTE-A standard development) is considered which facilitates cooperative transmission
    across multiple cells, called CoMP. The cooperation of neighboring BSs is used
    to provide services to a single cell-edge user and therefore improves its data
    rate. CoMP techniques can be categorized into three types; i.e., coordinated scheduling
    and coordinated beamforming (CS/CB), joint transmission (JT) and transmission
    point selection (TPS) [220]. Recently, the idea of combining both multi-cell NOMA
    and CoMP has sparked lot of interest. It leverages the benefits from both the
    space diversity gains (CoMP) and power domain multiplexing (NOMA) while further
    improving SE and extending coverage within the network [221], [222], [223]. For
    NOMA networks considering multi-cell scenarios, the performance of cell edge users
    is of utmost importance. This is important especially for DL NOMA, where the SIC
    receiver is applied at the high gain cell-center user leading to degradation of
    performance of the cell-edge user. This is where the concept of CoMP is introduced
    to take care of the cell-edge users where multiple neighboring BSs coordinate
    with each other to serve the cell-edge user. In single cell scenarios NOMA outperforms
    OMA but it is still unknown for multi-cell NOMA. In multi-cell DL NOMA the cell-edge
    users are more impacted by ICI from neighboring BSs than intra-cell interference.
    On the other hand in UL NOMA, the interference is received at the BS is proportional
    to the number of users in each NOMA user pair of the neighboring cells. Since,
    the interference is received at the BS which is a centralized entity, it is equally
    experienced by all users of a given NOMA cluster [23]. A network NOMA (N-NOMA)
    technique in UL CoMP transmission is designed [224] in order to improve system
    throughput and SE. Unlike, typical CoMP-OMA multiple BSs not only serve a single
    cell-edge CoMP user but also opportunistically multiplex multiple NOMA users on
    the same RB leading to increased SE. To analyze the impact of N-NOMA on UL CoMP,
    authors use a stochastic geometry approach to model the N-NOMA techniques. JT,
    CS, dynamic point selection and CB CoMP schemes have been investigated in [225]
    to overcome ICI and give spectral efficiencies in DL multi-cell NOMA systems by
    using distributed PA in each cell. SE comparisons on the basis of numerical analysis
    and simulation results prove CoMP-NOMA to be better than CoMP-OMA. Moreover, specifically
    JT-CoMP NOMA is found to perform in the most spectrally efficient manner, as same
    RB is shared among different CoMP users of a particular CoMP set forming NOMA
    clusters at different coordinating cells. Furthermore, authors in [226] propose
    the integration of JT-CoMP and cooperative NOMA by considering a two-cell system
    with 3 UEs. Each BS serves a near non-CoMP NOMA user cooperating with a common
    cell-edge CoMP user. Resource Allocation Issues in CoMP-NOMA Efficient allocation
    of resources is of significant importance for CoMP-NOMA where multiple BSs cooperate
    to serve cell-edge CoMP users and near NOMA users simultaneously on the same RB.
    The very limited work in existing literature regarding issues of user pairing
    and PA in CoMP-NOMA and their solutions using analytical, optimization and matching
    theory techniques have been summarized in Table 15 and discussed below. User Pairing:
    The user pairing issue is shown to be solved using analytical and matching theory
    techniques. Analytical: For solving the user pairing issue same authors extend
    their work on virtual pairing for single cell NOMA [28] to multi-cell NOMA scenarios
    [206] with JT-CoMP. Different from existing work on multi-cell NOMA where each
    BS serves a pair of near NOMA user paired with a common far CoMP user that is
    served by neighboring BSs. This user pairing approach uses analytical techniques
    to propose a virtual pairing (VP) method by considering a 3 cell NOMA network
    with each BS serving a near NOMA user and a far CoMP user. Therefore, considering
    a more practical scenario where multiple cell-edge users are served by CoMP-JT
    instead of a single common user. It is proved that the proposed design achieves
    better ergodic sum capacity than OMA, NOMA and VP-NOMA. Further improved results
    can be achieved if both the allocated power to the near user and the distance
    between the paired near and far user is increased. Matching Theory: Authors in
    [207] consider a mobile NOMA network using CoMP to improve cell-edge user throughput
    and SE performance. A maximum weight-based matching theory technique is proposed
    for user pairing that aims at maximizing well served users with minimum rate requirements
    and maximizes weighted sum-rate of the two paired users. Power Allocation: Efficient
    PA policies using analytical and optimization techniques have been described as
    follows. Analytical: For improving SE of a mobile NOMA network using CoMP, a simple
    low complexity PA method is proposed in [207]. Furthermore, a closed form expression
    is derived for optimal power transmission that maximizes the pairwise utility
    for a given NOMA pair. Authors in [208] investigate a selective-transmission DL
    CoMP-NOMA design. With given channel gain and SNR, adaptive PA is analytically
    derived to guarantee perfect user fairness. Optimization: Authors in [209], [210]
    propose energy efficient dynamic PA optimization methods for DL CoMP-NOMA scenarios.
    A low complexity distributed power optimization approach for each coordinating
    BS is adopted in [209], which is found to be independent of solutions calculated
    at other coordinating cells. The numerical results show significant gains in SE
    and EE when compared to conventional CoMP-OMA. Liu, et al. maximize EE with a
    dynamic PA method under the constraints of users’ QoS and maximum BS transmit
    power [210]. Since, the optimization problem is non-convex, therefore, it is solved
    by proposing an iterative, sub-optimal, fast converging and low complexity approach
    that jointly applies fractional programming and difference of convex programming.
    For a generalized CoMP-NOMA system in which JT-CoMP is applied to all cell-center
    and cell-edge users, a low complexity clustering algorithm with an optimal PA
    method for each cluster is investigated in [211]. Key Insights into Cooperative
    Communication and NOMA • User pairings having more than 2 number of users under
    dynamic environments need to be investigated. Matching theory should be analyzed
    for such improved solutions as it is an emerging and promising technique for resource
    allocation of combinatorial problems giving stable and self-organizing solutions.
    • Since coordination among users is required in cooperative NOMA and among BSs
    in CoMP-NOMA both which increases the time delay and signaling overhead, therefore,
    methods should be devised to reduce the complexity and latency. • Addition of
    more users in a user pair improves SE but it increases the power consumption,
    hardware complexity for decoding and channel estimation issues at SIC too. Therefore
    energy efficient resource allocation solutions need to be designed to strike a
    balance between the signaling overhead, minor performance loss and SE of such
    systems. Such complex joint optimization problems are usually non-convex and it
    is a common practice to solve the problem by dividing them into a set of sub-problems.
    ML can be applied in tandem to conventional optimization by applying it to one
    or more sub-problems. • As the number of design variables increase with multi-cell
    and cooperative scenarios making the complexity difficult to be solved with ML,
    deep learning techniques can be investigated as a future research direction. •
    For mobile PA scenarios game theory needs to be part of future research for more
    energy efficient solutions. • Deep learning techniques can be applied for enhancing
    secrecy performance for such systems as it can be a comparatively less complex
    approach to the traditional iterative ones. 4.5. Cognitive radio networks NOMA
    With the increase in number of wireless connected devices there is an increase
    in demand of spectrum usage, CR is one such concept that can be applied to NOMA
    to further enhance the SE of the network. The concept of CR was first time introduced
    by Mitola [227]. Spectrum sharing is the simultaneous usage of a specific radio
    frequency band among multiple users in a specific geographical area. CRs are intelligent
    wireless devices that sense the radio environment and dynamically change their
    radio parameters. CR is considered as a solution to overcome the spectrum scarcity,
    where unlicensed SUs opportunistically access the frequency spectrum of licensed
    PUs. The CRs typically operate in three modes; the interweave mode, overlay mode
    and underlay mode. Interweave is an interference controlling technique in which
    SU transmits when there is a vacant frequency hole in the PU spectrum. In overlay,
    the SU helps PU relay its information in a cooperative fashion and in exchange
    as a reward transmits in the licensed user’s spectrum. Also, the PU’s information
    is used in mitigating interference. In underlay mode, PU and SU transmit simultaneously
    but are limited by interference power constraint and hence is an interference
    avoiding technique [8], [132]. Download : Download high-res image (382KB) Download

    is a potential 5G enabling technology that enhances spectrum reuse and allows
    increased connectivity of devices. The combination of NOMA and CR networks enhances
    the SE as well as increases capacity gain by maximizing the number of SUs transmitting
    information using NOMA over the limited licensed spectrum. The CR with NOMA occurs
    in two forms (1) CR-inspired NOMA [4], [9], [31], [111], [160], [228], [229] and
    (2) Application of NOMA in CR [4], [9], [132], [205], [230], [231], [232], [233].
    Fig. 8 shows both CR-inspired NOMA and CR with NOMA (CR-NOMA) forms. The application
    of NOMA to a large scale underlay CR network with randomly located primary transmitters,
    primary receivers and SUs is designed in [230]. In order to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed design, closed-form expressions of outage probability are derived.
    Based on these derived expressions the diversity order of NOMA users for this
    design is analyzed under two different scenarios. Simulation results show that
    the proposed approach outperforms the existing OMA based underlay CR network.
    Although the combination of NOMA and CR gives superior performance compared to
    conventional schemes but it still has some resource allocation and security related
    issues which are shown to be solved using different tools explained below. Table

    in cognitive radio with NOMA Resource allocation issues such as PA policy especially
    in CR-inspired NOMA and joint UPPA for CR-NOMA are solved to improve the throughput
    and SE of the network. The resource allocation related issues and their solutions
    have been solved using optimization and game theory techniques which have been
    summarized in Table 17 and explained in the following passages. Power Allocation:
    PA policy is a critical issue for the performance of combination of CR with NOMA.
    The concept of CR-inspired NOMA [31] and its impact on user pairing was introduced
    by Ding et al. in which they considered NOMA to be a special case of CR. In CR-inspired
    NOMA a strong channel user acting as a SU can opportunistically access the weak
    user’s licensed spectrum. This is possible only if QoS of PU is guaranteed first
    which means that the PA factor for the SU depends on the signal strength of the
    PU. Different game theory and optimization solution approaches have been proposed
    to solve the PA problems in the following CR enabled NOMA networks. Optimization:
    PA problems formulated for underlay CR-inspired NOMA in [228], [234] are non-convex
    and are solved optimally by proposing iterative algorithms. The total system throughput
    maximization problem [228] is jointly optimized for subchannel assignment and
    PA by proposing an iterative algorithm using Hungarian method for channel assignment
    and convex optimization theory for optimal PA solution. In [234], a two-relay
    assisted CR-inspired NOMA network enabled with SWIPT for EE maximization is considered.
    The joint EE problem optimizes the PA, power splitting (PS) ratio and transmit
    power under the constraints of harvested energy and QoS of users. Game Theory:
    The game theory technique is applied to PA problems in NOMA-based underlay CR
    network [205], [231] for enhancing SE by spectrum sharing. In order to solve the
    user grouping issue a non-transferable utility coalition game is used to maximize
    the total sum-rate [231] by spectrum sharing between PUs and SUs. Furthermore,
    a pragmatic distributed coalition formation algorithm is used to form a stable
    coalition structure. The best cognitive user (CU) coalition is chosen to access
    and share spectrum with PU. The optimal PA coefficients for each coalition are
    found by formulating an optimization problem that maximizes total weighted sum-rate
    of all CUs. Wen et al. propose a design that optimizes the PA and relay selection
    in a cooperative NOMA aided spectrum sharing system [205]. A Nash bargaining game-based
    algorithm is used to find optimal solution for maximizing the product of utilities
    of PUs and SUs with a step by step approach. Joint User Pairing and Power Allocation:
    The issues of joint UPPA for CR-NOMA have been proposed to be solved using optimization
    techniques which are summarized below. Optimization: A mixed integer non-linear
    programming joint optimization problem for DL NOMA-enabled cognitive HetNet in
    interweave mode is proposed in [132]. A novel suboptimal user clustering algorithm
    for small cell users is proposed that maximizes small cell throughput by pairing
    users with disparate channel gains. The results of the clustering algorithm are
    used to derive closed-form expressions that meet the KKT optimality criteria for
    optimal PA at cluster level for throughput maximization. To increase overall system
    throughput optimal PA problem across NOMA clusters is solved using difference
    of convex programming. 4.5.2. Security issues in cognitive radio with NOMA Integrating
    NOMA with CR enhances the system performance of the network from SE and capacity
    gain point of view but it is more vulnerable to security attacks. As CRs allow
    unlicensed users to access the PU spectrum which leads to the possibility of unlicensed
    users to act as eavesdroppers or untrusted users. Moreover, the combination of
    NOMA with CR increases the concern of QoS protection of PUs. Overlay CR-NOMA networks
    are more prone to security attacks as they cooperate with untrusted users in the
    unlicensed spectrum for relaying information to the PU. Different optimization
    and analytical tools have been employed, as described below, to overcome the security
    threats to CR-NOMA networks which have also been summarized in Table 18. Optimization:
    The physical layer security issues for CR-NOMA networks are solved using different
    optimization techniques with an emphasis on EE by using EH techniques [235], [236],
    [237], [238]. A practical UL non-linear EH NOMA-enabled CR network with an eavesdropper
    that is capable of enhancing spectral energy as well as EE of the system is investigated
    in [235]. SOP expressions are derived for the proposed design under scenarios
    of two and more than two SUs. The minimum secrecy EE maximization optimization
    problem is solved using a two-step algorithm that gives optimal time slot and
    UL transmit power results. Zhou et al. propose an AN aided cooperative jamming
    design for improving the secrecy performance of the PUs and SUs in a practical
    MISO-NOMA CR network with SWIPT [237]. The optimization problem is modeled as
    a power minimization problem under a non-linear EH model for which suboptimal
    results are achieved using semi-definite relaxation and SCA. The authors extend
    this work in [238] by optimizing the beamforming vectors and covariance matrix
    of jamming signal by minimizing transmission power at the BS with known CSI and
    bounded CSI model. The problem proposed is non-convex in nature, Therefore, it
    is solved by applying a pair of algorithms. Table 18. Summary of security issues

    full-duplex relay assisted cognitive-NOMA design vulnerable to eavesdropping is
    studied in [236]. The self interference (SI) of full duplex is used as an additional
    EH source. Analytical: Different analytical strategies have been applied to CR-NOMA
    scenarios to enhance secrecy performance [111], [229], [232] for underlay and
    overlay modes. The secrecy performance of PUs in an overlay CR-inspired NOMA network
    over Nakagami-m channels with SUs as eavesdroppers is investigated in [111]. The
    proposed design considers interference mitigation and transmission security by
    reconsidering PA and pairing of primary and SUs according to their channel gains.
    By analyzing COP, SOP and EST, it is observed that pairing PUs with better channel
    gain improves secrecy performance, whereas, the secrecy performance degrades with
    increasing number of SUs. Bhattacharjee, S. studied the physical layer security
    performance of a multi-cast communication to cell-edge weak users in the presence
    of a passive eavesdropper and friendly jamming for a cooperative CR-NOMA network
    [229]. Different relay and jammer selection schemes are considered for evaluating
    and analyzing the secrecy performance on the basis of SOP. An eavesdropper exclusion
    zone is considered around the SU transmitter to boost the secrecy performance
    of an underlay millimeter wave CR-NOMA network with randomly located users and
    eavesdroppers [232]. From analysis of COP, SOP and secrecy throughput for each
    NOMA paired user, it is observed that the security and reliability depends on
    appropriate PA factors and eavesdropper exclusion zone. Key Insights into Cognitive
    Radio Networks NOMA • CR-inspired NOMA approach is less complex, flexible and
    offers a good balance between individual user fairness and overall system throughput
    if the SUs have better channel conditions compared to PA schemes following optimization
    techniques that are non-convex,. • More intelligent/distributed resource allocation
    solutions for spectrum conflict and PA need to be investigated using different
    game theory strategies. • For enabling intelligent CR with NOMA and further enhancing
    user pairing and PA schemes different ML, deep learning and reinforcement learning
    techniques can be attractive options. • Deep learning used in addition to reinforcement
    learning known as a deep reinforcement learning can be a future direction where
    CR spectrum selection decisions are made with interacting with the environment.
    4.6. SWIPT and NOMA EE is one of the critical issues under consideration in 5G
    communications, since most of the devices are battery powered and consume a lot
    of energy during transmission, reception and relaying of information. These devices
    are required to run for longer periods of times. One of the possible ways to overcome
    the energy deficiency can be to replace batteries periodically but this will require
    a lot of resources in terms of operational costs, inaccessibility and time which
    will outweigh the benefits of using wireless nodes. Therefore, in order to reduce
    energy consumption and extend lifetime of the devices in wireless network different
    approaches are adopted, such as, developing energy aware algorithms, assigning
    different duty cycle ratios to devices, event-based communication, by transmitting
    compressed data [239] or harvesting energy using wind or solar energy [240]. The
    conventional approaches used to extend lifetime of a network usually result in
    delay, distortion of original data or are dependent on time of the day and environment,
    thus, affecting their efficiency. Instead, SWIPT an emerging technology that harvests
    energy through ambient RF signals is a more suitable and flexible approach for
    powering the energy constrained devices. SWIPT has benefits of allowing extension
    in network lifetime, efficient transmission as information and power is transmitted
    concurrently and utilizing interfering signals as potential EH sources. EE can
    be maximized and sustainability of wireless networks can be maintained by combining
    the concept of SWIPT with other 5G technologies. NOMA supported by SWIPT is an
    upcoming research direction that has received considerable attention in the recent
    past due to its improved performance gains such as EE, throughput and outage probabilities
    [130], [131], [241], [242], [243], [244], [245], [246], [247], [248], [249], [250],
    [251], [252], [253], [254], [255], [256], [257], [258], [259]. A typical SWIPT-enabled
    NOMA scenario is shown in Fig. 9 and its issues and their solutions for SWIPT
    in NOMA are discussed below. Table 19. Summary of resource allocation issues and

    4.6.1. Resource allocation issues in SWIPT with NOMA Since multiple energy constrained
    users access the same resources (time, frequency) in SWIPT with NOMA. The issues
    of joint UPPA, PA and user pairing along with possible solutions using different
    tools and techniques have been described in detail and summarized in Table 19.
    Power Allocation: Efficient PA policies for energy efficient and enhanced performances
    in SWIPT with NOMA using different tools have been explained below in detail.
    Optimization: In SWIPT with cooperative NOMA, the strong channel gain users that
    are near to the BS relay information to the weak user with the help of the energy
    harvested from the BS signals [243], [244]. An energy maximization problem that
    optimizes PA and PS with imperfect CSI under the constraints of minimum user rate
    and transmit power requirement along with circuit power consumption of users and
    BS is studied in [244]. Zhao et al. propose an EE maximization problem for a two-relay
    assisted CR-NOMA network enabled with SWIPT. The joint EE problem optimizes the
    PA, PS ratio and transmit power under the constraints of harvested energy and
    QoS of users [234]. Authors in [130], [131], [245] propose energy maximization
    problems by optimizing PA of SWIPT-enabled NOMA networks where [130], [131] consider
    HetNets. Joint optimization of a PA and time sharing problem under the constraints
    of minimum user data rate requirement, minimum harvest energy per node and maximum
    power budget is carried out in [245]. Since the problem is non-convex it is solved
    by applying a dual layer iterative algorithm using Dinkelbach’s method that solves
    the inner layer for optimum PA and outer layer for optimum time switching assignment.
    The fractional non-convex joint PA and user association problem for a practical
    multi-cell NOMA based HetNet with SWIPT under imperfect CSI is also transformed
    into a convex problem using worst case approach and Dinkelbach’s method [131].
    A joint subchannel and PA problem under the constraints of QoS of users, maximum
    power and cross-tier interference from SBSs and MBSs is sub-divided into smaller
    problems for optimization. A power optimization iterative algorithm using Lagrange
    dual decomposition method is proposed to achieve optimal results [130]. Zhou et
    al. consider statistical CSI for proposing a framework in which EH is taken as
    a non-constant requirement where the number of data packets in each time slot
    is modeled as a Poisson distribution. The non-convex problem is solved by dividing
    the main optimization problem into three sub-problems according to different conditions
    which helps in finding the optimal values for power consumption and PA [248].

    A joint optimization problem for optimizing PA factor, PS ratio, receive and transmit
    beamforming vectors under the constraint of power budget at the source and near
    user and data rate requirement of far user is designed for a DL cooperative NOMA
    based SWIPT network with full-duplex mode [247]. Analytical: Authors investigate
    the impact of PA on the performance of cooperative NOMA with SWIPT network by
    considering NOMA with fixed PA and CR-inspired NOMA as PA strategies for the EH
    scheme [243]. Machine Learning: A joint resource optimization problem of sub-carrier
    allocation, PA and time switching (TS) ratio for EH in a DL multi carrier NOMA-enabled
    SWIPT network is solved with a deep learning approach using the deep belief network
    for getting close to optimal results. User Pairing: Several user selection schemes
    for dynamic user pairing on the basis of their distance from the BS have been
    analyzed and summarized with analytical solution approaches below. Analytical:
    The concept of combining cooperative NOMA and SWIPT was proposed in [241]. The
    users in this network are modeled as a PPP and are divided into two groups as
    near users and far users on basis of distance from the BS. Furthermore, authors
    propose three distance-based user selection schemes [242] for EH with randomly
    spatially located users. The opportunistic user selection schemes, are applied
    to users modeled using stochastic geometric approach and are as follows: (a) random
    near user and random far user selection, (b) nearest near user and nearest far
    user selection and (c) nearest near user and farthest far user selection. The
    performance is characterized analytically by deriving closed-form expressions
    for outage probability and delay-sensitive system throughput. Joint User Pairing
    and Power Allocation: The issue of joint dynamic user clustering and PA solved
    using different techniques has been studied and summarized for NOMA with SWIPT
    in the following passages. Optimization: A joint dynamic user grouping, power
    and time allocation optimization problem with EH to maximize admissible users
    and throughput under the constraints of minimum data rate and transmit power requirement
    for users is proposed in [250]. Since the optimization problem is a mixed integer
    non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and is intractable therefore, it is solved
    by applying mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm for optimal solution.
    Simulations prove that the proposed scheme performs better when compared to an
    exhaustive search method. Machine Learning: An EH maximization problem under the
    constraint of minimum rate requirements of users in a millimeter wave NOMA aerial
    network with SWIPT is investigated in [251]. The maximization problem is solved
    in two phases. In the first phase the tool of ML is applied to develop two user
    clustering algorithms using k-means and k-medoids algorithms based on user locations
    and in the second phase optimal PA is found using the tool of convex optimization.
    4.6.2. Security issues in SWIPT with NOMA The broadcast nature of wireless signals
    in SWIPT-enabled NOMA make them more likely to have security issues as legitimate
    users along with nearby eavesdroppers are capable of hearing the information signals.
    Therefore, not only the required received signal at the intended legitimate user
    needs to be enhanced while degrading the one received at the eavesdropper but
    the power transfer efficiency needs to be considered as well. The security threat
    can be untrusted cooperating and nearby users which receive power along with information
    signals [254]. Several physical layer security issues with their solutions using
    analytical, optimization and ML techniques have been summarized in Table 20 and
    briefly described below. Table 20. Summary of security issues and solutions in
    SWIPT with NOMA: Ref. Solution approach Characteristics [238] Optimization AN-aided

    Cooperative NOMA and friendly jamming. Optimization: The secrecy performance of
    SWIPT-enabled NOMA networks is enhanced using AN in [238], [256]. Zhou et al.
    propose a secure non-linear EH model with the help of AN-aided cooperative jamming
    scheme for CR-NOMA [238]. The secrecy performance of a MISO NOMA SWIPT system
    with a AN-aided beamforming design is investigated [256]. The joint problem is
    optimized to minimize transmission power of the BS. Since the problem is non-convex
    and difficult to solve, therefore, it is suboptimally solved by adopting two algorithms
    based on semi-definite relaxation and SCA. Different secrecy EE problems for a
    MISO CR-NOMA network with SWIPT under perfect CSI, statistical CSI and imperfect
    CSI with bounded channel uncertainties are proposed [257]. The EE of the system
    is maximized by optimizing the beamforming vectors under EH and interference constraints.
    The authors also consider an EE maximization problem [259] with unknown CSI for
    a multi-user multiple antenna NOMA system with the capability of wireless power
    transfer. Power, time and subchannel allocation is jointly optimized in the presence
    of an eavesdropper. Analytical: The secrecy performance of a cooperative SWIPT
    NOMA system is investigated in the presence of an eavesdropper with a non-linear
    EH relay in [258]. A friendly jammer as an additional energy source is employed
    to enhance the secrecy performance of the system. The performance of the proposed
    design is evaluated on the basis of closed-form expression analytically derived
    for SOP, average achievable secrecy rate and average stored energy. Machine Learning:
    A deep learning approach is employed in [255] to solve the physical layer security
    issues in SWIPT-enabled NOMA network. The secrecy performance of multiple near
    and far NOMA users in the presence of an EH relay eavesdropper is analytically
    analyzed by deriving intercept probability expression. The optimal value of PA
    coefficient is found by using the tool of deep learning for optimizing secrecy
    performance of the network. Key Insights into SWIPT and NOMA • Advance deep learning
    techniques need to be explored for efficient resource allocation designs that
    serve both purposes of secure information transmission and efficient power transfer
    as it not only affects the performance of power receivers and information receivers
    but also eavesdroppers. • Deep learning techniques can be applied to solve sub-problems
    of selecting relaying nodes. • SWIPT-NOMA can be a promising technology for future
    green wireless network improving EE of the system. Distributed energy harvesting
    models can be solved using selfish non-cooperative games theory to achieve enhanced
    system performance and harvest energy. • A combined usage of game theory and optimization
    techniques can be an interesting research direction. 4.7. Other emerging NOMA
    and 5G technologies In this section we discuss other new emerging NOMA and 5G
    technologies with a focus on recent technologies such as UAV, VLC, MEC, IRS and
    underwater communication. 4.7.1. UAV assisted NOMA Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
    is a cost effective, reliable and easily deployed emerging technology capable
    of supporting high transmission rates and ubiquitous connectivity to a multitude
    of devices. This interesting technology comes with the benefits of enhancing coverage
    areas, throughput, capacity and EE. It has found applications in military, disaster
    management, traffic control, surveillance, telecommunication and photography.
    UAV assisted NOMA has recently gained interest and is actively pursued. A brief
    summary of resource allocation and security related issues with their solutions
    using optimization, ML and matching theory have been demonstrated in Table 21.

    short range technology promising to be a potential solution for the scarce RF
    spectrum. It uses unlicensed spectrum and is anticipated to be used as a complementing
    technology to RF communication for future indoor applications. Light emitting
    diodes (LEDs) are used as a transmitter and photo detectors as receivers. NOMA
    is combined with VLC to attain high capacity gains and SE. A summary of efficient
    and secure utilization of resources with decreased signaling over head for VLC-NOMA
    technology using different techniques has been given in Table 22. Table 22. Summary

    assisted MEC With the rapid development in the field of mobile wireless communication
    there is an explosive growth in usage of data services to run computationally
    intensive and sophisticated mobile based applications such as interactive online
    gaming, virtual reality and augmented reality etc. Mobile devices are computationally
    and power wise constrained to perform such tasks due to shortage of battery and
    increased latency. In order to reduce latency and increase lifetime of the mobile
    devices the idea of mobile edge computing (MEC) was introduced. The main idea
    of MEC is to support mobile users to offload their high computational tasks for
    processing at the resourceful high computing edge servers present at the edge
    of the network. With the known benefits of increased connectivity and SE of NOMA,
    the amalgamation of these two 5G technologies is a desirable future research direction
    which has received quite attention recently. NOMA assisted MEC further reduces
    energy consumption and network delay hence improving QoS of users. A brief summary
    of the resource allocation and security issues and solutions using optimization,
    game theory and ML techniques has been given in Table 23. Table 23. Summary of

    NOMA Variations in wireless channel often degrade the received signals. A very
    recent emerging spectral and energy efficient technology, intelligent reflective
    surface (IRS) can potentially help in minimizing the radio signal degradation
    due to surrounding clutter. IRS comprises of a collection of intelligent reflecting
    array elements capable of absorbing energy and shifting phase of incident rays.
    This is achieved by controlling the reflecting rays appropriately and therefore
    re-configuring wireless communication. In spite of the benefits of SE, user fairness
    and improved system throughput, NOMA still has several significant challenges
    such as lower received power and critical intra-cell interference compared to
    orthogonal multiple access schemes. To tackle these issues, the intrinsic interplay
    of NOMA and IRS has been a topic of great interest these days [292], [293], [294].
    The stochastic wireless channel may disturb the channel conditions for the NOMA
    users causing outages. IRS can be employed to create desirable distinct channel
    gain between the paired NOMA users. A simple IRS-assisted NOMA design is shown
    to improve SE and connectivity in [292]. The BS uses SDMA to generate orthogonal
    spatial beams according to near user’s channel. Further, cell-edge users are served
    on the same beams by aligning their channel vectors using IRS facilitating the
    implementation of NOMA. The effect of hardware impairment due to low cost antenna
    array comprising of reconfigurable reflecting elements in IRS is also investigated.
    The integration of NOMA and IRS is a new research direction but there is a paucity
    of investigations on resource allocation, signaling and security issues for both
    UL and DL transmissions which has been summarized in Table 24 and needs to be
    considered as a possible new future direction. Table 24. Summary of resource allocation,

    communication Oceanic applications, such as oil and gas exploration, oceanography,
    pipeline or fiber optic monitoring and repairing an oil leakage require underwater
    communication (acoustic, RF or wireless optical communication). It comprises of
    several under water power limited nodes such as unmanned underwater vehicles,
    sub-marines, divers, tracked animals, etc. which need either UL or DL or simultaneous
    UL/DL communication. In order to meet the demands of these future underwater wireless
    applications the limited spectrum resources available underwater are not enough.
    Therefore, new multiple access techniques such as NOMA capable of serving multiple
    users simultaneously with a good system throughput/user fairness trade-off and
    improved EE and SE needs to be explored. NOMA has been extensively researched
    in terrestrial RF communication but very limited work has been done in underwater
    applications [304], [305], [306], [307], [308], [309]. Most of the studies are
    focused on outage performance, BER, coverage probability of underwater assisted
    NOMA whereas the very limited work available on resource allocation [310], [311],
    [312] has been summarized in Table 25. Key Insights into Other Emerging NOMA and
    5G Enabling Technologies Table 25. Summary of resource allocation issues and solutions

    [312] PA DL Optimization PSO and maximize overall data rate. • Resource allocation
    especially user pairing, joint user pairing and PA policies, methodologies for
    reducing signaling overhead and security enhancing schemes using optimization
    and ML techniques need to be considered in future IRS assisted NOMA designs. •
    Although NOMA-VLC has the benefits of increased connectivity and improved data
    rates by using the unlicensed spectrum. Still, mostly designs usually consider
    indoor static environments with perfect LOS. More dynamic environments with increased
    number of users in a NOMA user pairing with dynamic PA need to be considered in
    future research. • As the complexity of the iterative design problem increases
    due to increase in number of devices specifically in NOMA-enabled IRS and MEC
    technologies, managing the variables becomes prohibitively complex even with ML.
    Therefore, deep learning neural network [313] can be applied to find those specific
    parameters that have the largest impact on the performance of the system. Then,
    eventually traditional optimization, analytical or even ML techniques can be used
    to attain desired solutions using those chosen variables. • Due to domination
    of LOS communication in UAV assisted NOMA the high correlation among users’ can
    be exploited by applying k-means clustering (unsupervised learning) algorithms
    for user clustering as it pairs spatially correlated users. Whereas a similar
    approach might not be appropriate for a rich scattering environment such as NOMA
    assisted under water communication for which other techniques or interdisciplinary
    tools need to be explored. • NOMA assisted MEC requires high storage and processing
    powers to manage data at edges of the network in order to reduce latency and increase
    EE. Therefore, Quantum ML [314] techniques in conjunction with big data analytic
    can help in solving such high computational and multi-objective problems involving
    a large number of design variables and constraints. 5. Practical experimental
    implementation of NOMA Although NOMA has been recognized as a spectrally efficient
    radio resource technique for upcoming B5G. Its performance gain has mostly been
    studied theoretically in the recent past. Its practical implementation has not
    been explored much due to many open implementation challenges. This section gives
    a brief overview of the very little practical research that has been performed
    for both UL and DL NOMA in the recent past. Benjebbour et al. performed experiment
    trials on using a 2 by 2 MIMO channel 5 MHz NOMA testbed with real SIC and compared
    its performance with orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) (LTE
    Release-8 framework) [20]. Authors in [315] introduce the practical implementation
    of FDD NOMA on a flexible and reconfigurable general purpose processor-based SDR.
    Real-time and offline experiments are performed to evaluate its performance gains
    and feasibility of practical deployment. DL NOMA prototype is implemented using
    open air interface (OAI) based on existing physical layer LTE specifications.
    The link level simulations and implementation of NOMA suggest to adopt modulation
    schemes and power coefficients according to channel quality. As performance of
    SIC receiver degrades with high order modulation schemes. The biggest challenge
    in practical implementation of NOMA is the complexity of SIC because all processes
    in SIC cannot be performed in parallel. This results in increase of processing
    time. An SDR implementation of DL NOMA system based on physical layer of OAI platform
    is also presented in [316]. While this work is different from previous works in
    NOMA implementation based on the fact that a multi-thread processing method is
    applied to enhance the efficiency of baseband signaling of a code word level SIC
    receiver. With the increasing bandwidth and number of users it gets computationally
    complex as even the basic SIC receiver process involves decoding, reconstruction
    and subtraction/cancellation. A new DL control information (DCI) format is designed
    for the better channel gain cell-center user. SIC is performed to reconstitute
    and decode the cell-edge user’s signal before decoding its own signal. Moreover,
    the upper layers of the protocol stack are modified compared to the LTE system
    so that application services can be supported for the NOMA system proposed. The
    performance gains of NOMA over OMA are validated practically by carrying out indoor
    DL NOMA experiments which suggest a 18.6% system throughput gain and 84.4% cell-edge
    user performance gain. The application layer performance of the NOMA system is
    tested by calculating over-the-air file transfer rate from evolved Node B (eNB)
    to UE. It gives comparable results to the ones achieved theoretically. The first
    practical SDR implementation to prove the theoretical performance of UL NOMA is
    proposed in [317]. The proposed over-the-air implementation of UL NOMA does not
    hold reciprocity as it has different frequency for UL and DL channel. Therefore,
    it is suitable for FDD. The suggested scheme provides solutions to critical practical
    issues of misalignment of sub-carriers in frequency domain due to carrier frequency
    offset (CFO), time misalignment and channel estimation errors at the BS due to
    dynamic nature of wireless channel and spatial distribution of users. The issue
    of CFO is resolved by using reference signal that adopts primary synchronization
    signal (PSS) of LTE. Since multiple users share the same RB (time, frequency and
    code) a unique preamble is designed and appended to every frame being transmitted
    from the UE to BS to overcome the timing misalignment and channel estimation issue.
    For multi-user detection of UL NOMA a low complexity iterative linear minimum
    mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is implemented at the BS. The SDR-based NOMA
    testbed is made portable by transporting the desktop-based NOMA system to mini
    PCs with an increased system bandwidth of 10 MHz for enhanced throughput purposes
    [318]. This processor miniaturization has been made possible due to advances in
    semiconductor technology. It gives an added benefit of being applicable to outdoor
    NOMA environments other than portability. However, the mini-processors operate
    at ultra low voltage consuming less power and hence affecting full performance
    of NOMA testbed. A series of experiments for the practical implementation of portable
    NOMA testbed with increased bandwidth and higher modulation orders are performed.
    The computation complexity of the portable NOMA system increases which results
    in performance loss of 12.79% when compared to the desktop-based NOMA network.
    The throughput further decreases as the system bandwidth increases. As most of
    the existing experiments conducted on NOMA prototypes and testbeds are based on
    cellular networks, a novel DL NOMA testbed over Wi-Fi compatible with legacy devices
    is proposed in [319]. It is expected that this testbed would be more used in practical
    experimentation to validate NOMA performance theories than cellular ones as it
    is cheaper and simple to implement it using Wi-Fi. It uses a universal software
    radio peripheral (USRP)-29444 using 20 MHz bandwidth with a capability to increase
    up to 160 MHz using IEEE 802.11ac. In this implementation CPUs are not required
    for real-time computation as its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is very
    powerful. Table 26 gives a summary of experimental implementations of NOMA. Table

    to be one of the potential multiple access techniques for B5G, however, there
    are still some gaps and challenges that need to be explored more. The key issues
    that need to be tackled have been indicated in the following subsections. 6.1.
    Practical implementation of more than 3-user pairing One of the main attractions
    of NOMA is its capability of serving multiple users in one RB which has theoretically
    been proven too. Still most of the practical implementations and researches consider
    a 2-user pairing concept or at most 3-user pairing schemes have been considered
    in a very few studies. The limitation in the number of users multiplexed in a
    NOMA user pair is possibly due to the requirement of maintaining channel gains
    of users at the BS for performing successful SIC at receivers. With the increase
    in demand of connected devices especially for IoT, machine to machine (M2M) and
    massive machine-type communications (mMTC), these large-scale heterogeneous networks
    need to be supported by devising new multi-user pairing techniques and methods.
    These approaches must practically cluster more number of users in a given RB to
    fully avail the benefits of NOMA in its true sense and hence increase mass connectivity
    fulfilling future wireless network requirements. 6.2. SIC implementation: Receiver
    complexity and error propagation Most of the research is carried out with an assumption
    of perfect SIC in NOMA. Users with distinct channel gains are multiplexed together
    in power domain by allocating different PA coefficients. A SIC receiver detecting
    users according to optimal decoding order is invoked. A large number of users
    are proposed to be paired together, thus, in order to detect information of the
    strong user it first needs to detect all other users information. Then subtract
    it from the superimposed transmitted signal and then finally detect the strong
    user’s information in case of DL NOMA. By increasing the number of users to be
    served together in one RB there is an increase in delay and residual interference
    of users detected earlier due to incorrect demodulation and detection. This can
    result in error propagation and can greatly affect the performance of the NOMA
    system. For efficient and improved SIC implementation fast hardware equipment
    must be designed that reduces the computational complexity and hence greatly decreases
    the latency time and enhances performance. ML techniques may be used for determining
    practical and efficient solutions for the SIC implementation in UL and DL NOMA.
    6.3. Mobility in NOMA Mobility of users in a NOMA system is a significant issue
    which needs to be taken care of in future research especially for vehicular networks.
    Most of the existing work is done considering static environments which makes
    these models and findings irrelevant for mobile scenarios. Mobility causes continuous
    change in channel gains of users and hence affects the optimal SIC ordering and
    user pairing. Due to mobility the quasi-static channel of NOMA requires to be
    reprocessed again for determining the optimal decoding order. Mobility also affects
    user pairing in terms of different number and types of devices accessing a single
    RB. New approaches need to be incorporated in the existing static models to support
    mobile NOMA scenarios. Methods such as caching or using a complementary technology
    with a hybrid approach can be used to propose dynamic user pairing algorithms.
    6.4. Channel state information in NOMA CSI is of utmost importance in NOMA as
    compared to OMA, as it dictates the user pairing and optimal decoding order at
    SIC receivers for correctly decoding and detecting signals of different users.
    In most of the existing contributions, perfect CSI is assumed which is not a practical
    approach to realize. As it reduces the SE of the network due to increased overhead
    in the form of pilot signal transmissions. As a result, it is desired to propose
    more effective techniques for gathering CSI to overcome these issues. Approaches
    like reducing the number of feedback bits to the BS for CSI estimations, reliance
    on partial CSI for modeling systems by considering large scale fading only and
    low complexity near optimal designs that maintain a trade-off between the complexity
    and performance of the NOMA system have been proposed already. ML and game theory
    techniques can be employed to further explore more options to deal with this very
    important challenge for enhancing the overall NOMA network performance. 6.5. Multiple
    cell NOMA systems Most of the research on NOMA is mainly focused on single cell
    NOMA systems whereas very limited work has been done on multiple cell NOMA systems.
    This needs to be considered for real world scenarios. Multiple cell scenarios
    lead to ICI which results in performance degradation of the cell-edge weak users.
    This additional issue along with existing inter and intra-cluster interference
    issues can possibly be resolved using CoMP or small cell cooperation in case of
    multi-cell NOMA-enabled HetNets. 6.6. Uplink NOMA In contrast to DL transmission
    much less attention has been paid to UL transmission in the literature and its
    combination of 5G with other existing and emerging wireless technologies. More
    UL transmission scenarios especially from security, signaling and practical implementation
    point of view should be studied and solutions may be proposed using optimization
    and ML techniques. 6.7. Hybrid NOMA 5G and next generation wireless networks are
    envisioned to work on a hybrid of multiple access techniques instead of complete
    replacement of existing OMA techniques by NOMA. NOMA gives superior capacity gains
    and performances for scenarios only when paired users have distinct channel gains.
    For situations, when users have comparable channel gains few pairing algorithms
    have been proposed in literature but it reduces overall system throughput. Instead,
    leaving such users unpaired and allowing them to adopt OMA is a preferable option
    in terms of capacity and system performance. Game theory and deep ML tools can
    be applied for efficient optimization of bandwidth and other resources in a hybrid
    multiple access approach. 7. Conclusion This paper comprehensively surveys the
    basic concepts, benefits, issues and solutions of PD-NOMA and its combination
    with 5G and emerging wireless technologies including HetNets, MIMO, massive MIMO,
    cooperative communication, millimeter wave communication, CR networks, SWIPT,
    UAV, MEC, VLC, IRS and underwater communication. In particular, this paper presents
    an overview of the resource allocation issues in terms of user pairing, PA, joint
    UPPA, signaling issues in connection to SIC and CSI. Moreover, security issues
    of PD-NOMA and NOMA related 5G technologies are also presented. Furthermore, it
    surveys and explores their solutions using optimization, analytical techniques,
    matching theory, game theory, graph theory and ML techniques with a qualitative
    comparison in terms of applicability and feasibility. Key implementation and deployment
    challenges and issues have also been highlighted and summarized. Lastly, future
    research challenges, opportunities and their solutions have been discussed. Optimization
    techniques have been extensively applied to solve these issues. Therefore, their
    is room to explore and develop while utilizing ML and advance game theory approaches
    to provide even more efficient and viable solutions for user pairing, security
    and signaling issues specifically. In order to craft practical solutions more
    emphasis is required on experimental evaluation of solutions related to NOMA.
    This may help in standardization of NOMA-related techniques for future wireless
    networks (B5G), that have higher spectral and energy efficiency, offer mass connectivity
    and higher capacity. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

    the probability of success (POS) over the different channels that depends on the
    channel-quality and availability. Simulation results verify the significant improvement

    Open access 20 October 2021 1 Introduction As a result of the rapid growth in
    bandwidth-hungry wireless services and multimedia applications, the demand for
    more radio frequency (RF) spectrum has significantly increased [4, 15]. Since
    the majority of spectrum resources have already been allocated to different organization
    and services, the main challenge that needs to be tackled is how to effectively
    utilize the heavily allocated limited spectrum bands [6, 15, 19]. The FCC and
    other organizations (e.g., DARBA XG initiative) have measured the spectrum utilization
    of the licensed spectrum. They reported that the allocated spectrum used only
    in a limited geographical area for a limited period, (low utilization ranging
    from 15% to 85% [10], with average utilization of 17.4%). To satisfy the increased
    demands on spectrum, a reliable communication technology with programmable capabilities
    is needed to effectively exploit the underutilized spectrum. To this end, cognitive
    radio (CR) technology has been proposed to enable dynamic spectrum access, interference
    sensing and environment learning. CR is defined as a smart radio that can adapt
    its operating parameters based on the interaction with the operating RF environment.
    It is an intelligent networking paradigm that can solve the inefficient spectrum
    utilization by allowing the CR users to interact with their surrounding RF environment
    and opportunistically exploit the idle channels to improve network throughput,
    connectivity, and security without affecting the reception of the licensed primary
    radio users (PRs) [10, 18, 19, 27, 28]. With the increasing advances of multimedia
    technologies and mobile devices, the demand of transmitting multimedia streams
    to multiple mobile recipients through single-hop or multi-hop communication has
    increased [16]. This calls for performing efficient multicast routing for multimedia
    transmissions. Multicast routing can support effective multimedia networking by
    dynamically exploiting the available spectrum, reducing network traffic and minimizing
    communication cost [1, 2, 6, 11]. This can be achieved by simultaneously transmitting
    the multimedia data to a group of destinations through single-hop or multi-hop
    paths [13, 20, 30]. In CR networks (CRNs), multicast faces key design challenges
    that are not present in the traditional wireless networks. These challenges caused
    by the channel heterogeneity and the unexpected PR activities make traditional
    multicast protocols less suitable for CRNs. Therefore, novel communication protocols
    and mechanisms are needed to enable efficient multicast networking for multimedia
    traffic over CR links. In this paper, we consider a video on-demand multicast
    routing problem over a multi-hop CRNs. The source node streams video packets to
    a group of receiving nodes over a single session through multi-layer CRN (to save
    spectrum and reduce traffic load on the network). We note here that several routing
    and multi-cast protocols were proposed to support CRNs, but none of these routing
    protocols enables joint data multicasting and channel assignment. Unlike most
    of existing multicast protocols that either based on a path selection process
    (e.g., [3, 5, 13, 17, 20, 23,24,25, 30]), or a channel assignment mechanism (e.g.,
    [12, 14, 22]), our proposed protocol jointly consider the path selection and channel
    assignment problem with the objective of finding the best loop-free path based
    on SPT [7, 29] along with the optimal channel assignment that maximizes the probability
    of success (POS) of each multicast packet transmission. The POS metric considers
    the unique characteristics of CR operating environment, in which link-quality
    and PR activities are considered [12]. Specifically, the main contributions of
    this paper are as follows: We propose a joint path selection and channel assignment
    algorithm with the objective of finding the best loop-free path based on SPT along
    with the optimal channel assignment that maximizes the PoS of each multicast packet
    transmission. We utilize in our design the SPT and POS in order to improve and
    enhance the overall quality of the received video to all CR destinations in the
    multicast group. We evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol through
    extensive simulations. The performance of our proposed protocol is compared with
    that of the POS MST (minimum spanning tree) routing protocol in [5]. The POS MST
    protocol, is based on the MST approach and POS metric [5]. According to the POS
    MST protocol, the MST tree is constructed based on the distance between nodes
    without any consideration of the expected transmission count (ETX). We also compare
    the performance of other two design variant of the SPT-based routing, which they
    differ in theemployed channel assignment mechanism (ETX MDR and ETX RS). ETX MDR
    employs the greedy channel assignment [14] that selects the best operating channels
    without consideration the time availability of the different PR channels. While
    ETX RS randomlyassigns channels to the different CR links in the SPT. Simulation
    results verify the effectiveness of our proposed protocol over the previously
    proposed protocols. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We present
    and explain the network model in Section 2. The multicast routing problem is described
    in Section 3. Section 4 presents our proposed multicast routing protocol. Then,
    in Section 5, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol. Finally, Section
    6 concludes this paper. 2 Network model We consider a multi-hop ad hoc CRN with
    ∣N∣ CR users that coexists with a PR network (PRN) in the same geographical area.
    At a given time, we consider that there is a CR source that attempts to transmit
    multimedia data to Mr destinations (the multicast group) over a subset of the
    available channels. We assume that the PR users are licensed to operate over \\(
    \\mid \\mathcal{K}\\mid \\) channels, each with bandwidth W. A 2-state IDLE/BUSY
    Markov model is used to describe the channel status of each channel. The channel
    i is idle when no PRs are transmitting over that channel and busy when some PRs
    are using the channel. CR users have sensing capabilities to identify the idle
    channels that can be used for their transmissions. We assume a common control
    channel (CCC) is available to coordinate the transmissions and exchange control
    information in the CRN. We note here that providing a reliable mechanism for exchanging
    control information is a challenging problem. To deal with this challenge, many
    techniques for providing such a reliable control channel for CR users have been
    proposed in the literature, including (i) the pre-specified common control channel
    (CCC)-based technique, (ii) the spread spectrum-based technique, (iii) the dynamic
    local control channel-based technique and (iv) the hopping-based control channel
    technique [8, 21]. The transmission power for each CR user over each channel i
    is set to the maximum allowable transmission power set by the FCC \\( {P}_{\\mathrm{max}}^{(i)}
    \\). The determination of \\( {P}_{\\mathrm{max}}^{(i)} \\) is a challenging task,
    which has been previously investigated in many previous works (e.g., [9]). Specifically,
    an adaptive neighborhood-dependent power mask on CR communications is derived
    in [9] such that a soft guarantee on the outage probability performance of PRNs
    is provided. We also use the Shannon capacity formula to compute the achieved
    data rate for each CR user over each channel. Finally, we assume that the fading
    channel gain between any two CR users is Rayleigh fading [14]. 3 MULTICAST ROUTING
    problem USING ETX AND PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS 3.1 Preliminaries 3.1.1 The expected
    transmission count metric (ETX) This metric represents the total expected number
    of packet transmissions (with re-transmissions) needed to successfully deliver
    a packet to a specific group of destinations. This metric should be minimized
    as much as possible. The ETX metric between any two communicating nodes I and
    L over each channel i (\\( i\\in \\mathcal{K} \\)), is given by [26]: $$ ET{X}_{I\\to
    L}^{(i)}=\\frac{1}{\\underset{j}{\\mathit{\\max}}\\left( PO{S}_{I\\to L}^{(i)}\\right)}
    $$ (1) where \\( PO{S}_{I\\to L}^{(i)} \\) is the probability of success between
    any two nodes I and L over each channel i (\\( \\forall i\\in \\mathcal{K} \\)),
    which guarantees that the lifetime of channel i is greater than the required transmission
    time over that channel. The \\( PO{S}_{I\\to L}^{(i)} \\) can be computed as [12]:
    $$ PO{S}_{I\\to L}^{(i)}=\\mathit{\\exp}\\left(\\frac{-{Tr}_{I\\to, L}^{(i)}}{\\mu_i}\\right)
    $$ (2) where \\( {Tr}_{I\\to L}^{(i)} \\) is the required transmission time to
    send a packet from node I to L over channel i. The term μi represents the average
    availability time of channel i (in ms). Note that \\( {Tr}_{I\\to L}^{(i)} \\)
    can be calculated as [12]: $$ {T_r^{(i)}}_{I\\to L}=\\frac{D}{R_{I\\to L}^{(i)}}
    $$ (3) where D is the packet size, and \\( {R}_{I\\to L}^{(i)} \\) is the achieved
    data rate between nodes I and L over channel i (in bit/s), which is given by \\(

    \\), N0 represents the thermal power density in (Watt/Hz), W is the channel bandwidth
    and \\( P{r}_{I\\to L}^{(i)} \\) is the received power from transmitter I to receiver
    L. The received power can be computed as: $$ 5P{r}_{I\\to L}^{(i)}=\\frac{p_t}{d^n}{\\left(\\frac{\\lambda
    }{4\\pi}\\right)}^2{\\gamma}_{I\\to L}^{(i)} $$ (4) Note that \\( {\\gamma}_{I\\to
    L}^{(i)} \\) is the channel power gain between nodes I and L over channel i. For
    Rayleigh fading, \\( {\\gamma}_{I\\to L}^{(i)} \\) is exponentially distributed
    random variable with mean 1 [10]. 3.1.2 The shortest path tree (SPT) The SPT is
    a type of tree that is formed from an undirected graph. The undirected graph contains
    non-negative weights, where a special node is called source or root. SPT finds
    the path with minimum weight from the source to every destination in the network.
    If the source is changed, the tree should be re-built, which increases the complexity
    of SPT. The SPT finds the loop free path with optimized cost function from the
    source (root) to each vertex (node) in thetopology. The SPT can be found using
    Dijkstra’s algorithm, where the total running time complexity for Dijkstra’s algorithm
    is \\( \\mathcal{O}\\Big(m+n\\log\\ n \\)), where m is the number formed links
    in the tree, and n is thenumber of nodes in the undirected graph [7, 29]. Given
    the network model, we consider the problem of video streaming from one CR source
    to a set of destinations in a CRN with the limited available number of channels
    in a multi-hop environment. The objective of our study is compute the best path
    from the source to each multicast destination in the network without forming a
    loop along with the appropriate channel assignment that effectively improves the
    overall network performance by maximizing the delivery ratio for all CR destinations
    belonging to the multicast group. 4 The proposed multicast routing solution The
    main idea of our multicast protocol is to transmit the information from a given
    CR source to a group of destinations (multicast) through multi-hop transmissions
    using the shortest path trees (SPT). The SPT first determines the loop-free paths
    from the source to the destinations. Then, the best available set of channels
    from the set of all available channels will be selected based on the ETX metric
    and probability of success. This improves the quality of reception for all destinations
    in the CRN and attempts to avoid noises and low energy targets and middle hops
    by not selecting the nodes (or operating channels) with low probability of success.
    The proposed algorithm is executed as follows: Step 1. Initially, the CR source
    (or relay) I transmits a Hello packet that contains the source ID, group ID, and
    its available channel list to all CR neighboring nodes. Step 2. When a CR node
    L receives the Hello packet, it finds the common available channel list with the
    source and computes the POS over each channel \\( j\\in \\mathcal{K} \\) using
    (2). Then, node L sends an acknowledgement (ACK) packet to the source I containing
    the POS values for all common channels. Step 3. The source (or relay) I waits
    for a time to receive all ACK packets from the set of multi-cast nodes Mr. Step
    4. After the time-out, the source (or relay) I creates a routing table that contains
    the values of POS for all Mr over all available channels. After that it identifies
    the channel with the maximum POS between each twopair of nodes, computes the ETX
    among nodes using (1), and constructs a multi-layer SPT to all multicast destinations
    using Dijkstra’s algorithm based on the ETX metric. Let Nlayer represents the
    number of layers in the SPT, where each layer l ∈ {1, …Nlayer} consists of \\(
    {N}_{branch}^{(l)} \\) transmission branches, each with its source node and set
    of receivers. Step 5. Given the formed multi-layer SPT, the source defines the
    number of transmission branches in each layer. Step 6. For each branch b along
    each layer l of the tree with the source Sb, l and Gb, l receiving nodes, Sb,
    l computes the achieved POS to all Gb, l nodes (\\( \\left\\{{D}_1,{D}_2,\\dots
    {D}_{G_{b,l}}\\right\\} \\)) over each channel \\( i\\in \\mathcal{K} \\) as \\(
    PO{S}_{b,l}^{(i)}=\\underset{g\\in {G}_{b,l}}{\\min } PO{S}_{S_{b,l}}^{(i)}\\to
    {D}_g \\). Step 7. Then, the source determines the channel with maximum probability
    of success for each branch b of each layer l as \\( {i}_{b,l}^{\\ast }=\\mathit{\\arg}\\underset{i\\in
    \\mathcal{K} PO{S}_{b,l}^{(i)}}{\\max } \\) to perform the multicast at each layer.
    Step 8. Finally, the CR source sends the video packets through the different layers
    in the SPT over the selected channels to the participant nodes. We note here that
    the groups of multi-hop destinations are formed using the SPT algorithm. Given
    the source, the multi-cast destinations, the network topology and node’s connectivity,
    SPT algorithm builds the multi-hop tree and form the groups of multi-hop destinations
    based on Dijkstra’s algorithm, which has a running time complexity of \\( \\mathcal{O}\\Big(m+n\\log\\
    n \\)). Therefore, our algorithm has a computational complexity of \\( \\mathcal{O}\\left(m+n\\log\\
    n\\right) \\). To illustrate the idea of the protocol, we consider the illustrative
    example in Fig. 1. We assume a CRN environment, in which a CR source S wants to
    send a multimedia packets to three destinations (D2, D4, and D7) as shown in Fig.
    1(a). Consider the availability of three PR channels between any communicating
    CR users. Given the POS values over each channel for each communicating pair and
    after executing the Steps 1 to 3, the ETX for each available channel are computed
    and shown in Fig. 1(a). By constructing the SPT tree based on the ETX metric associated
    with the topology in Fig. 1(a) (performing Step 4), the different layers and branches
    of the tree are identified as shown in Fig. 1(b). According, the resulted SPT
    consists of two transmission layers: the first layer with S as transmitter and
    a second layer with R1 and R2 as transmitters. The first layer consists of two
    parts, each with one branch (i.e., S −  > R1 andS −  > R6 transmissions). The
    second layer also consists of two parts: the first part consists of one transmission
    branch R1 −  > D2, while the second part consists of two branches R6 −  > D4 and
    R6 −  > D7 transmissions. Based on the identified layers and branches, Fig. 1(c)
    depicts the POS values, and explains the mechanism of selecting a common operating
    channel for each layer in the network. The values under CH1, CH2, and CH3 represent
    the POS for CH1, CH2, and CH3 over each destination. Fig. 1 Illustrative example
    of the operation details of the proposed protocol Full size image By applying
    Step 5 of the proposed algorithm, the CR source specifies the minimum POS over
    each channel, which appeared in Fig. 1(c). The POS (0.75, 0.3, and 0.4) are the
    minimum achieved POS over CH1, CH2 and CH3 for the first layer. The POS values
    for the first and second transmissions in the second layer of the SPT tree are
    (0.75, 0.45, 0.8) and (0.35, 0.5, 0.55), respectively. After applying Step 6,
    the source selects CH1 with 0.75 probability of success to multicast its packets
    to the first tier users in the tree. On the other hand, CH3 will be used for the
    two tree transmission branches in the second layer of the SPT with POS of 0.85
    and 0.55, respectively. 5 Performance evaluation 5.1 Simulation setup We consider
    a CRN that coexists with several PRNs with 20 frequency channels, where no online
    coordination between them. The CRN consists of 40 CR users that are randomly located
    in a 200 × 200 meter field. We consider one CR sources and Mr = 16 CR multicast
    destinations. For each multicast session, the source and the destinations are
    selected randomly. We set the transmission range to R = 100 meter, and the data
    packet size to D = 4 KB. In addition, we set the bandwidth to W = 1 MHZ and the
    thermal noise No to (10−18) W/HZ. We use the Markov model to describe the status
    of PR channel (e.g., ON /OFF). We set the path-loss exponent to n = 4, which is
    used for indoor applications. The channel fading is Rayleigh model. The transmit
    power of each CR is set to 0.1 W. The average PR busy time is ranging from 2 to
    70 ms for all channels. The idle probability of the different channels are set
    to PI for all channels. Table 1 summarizes the simulation parameters. Table 1
    Simulation Parameters Full size table 5.2 Simulation results and discussion In
    this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol in terms of throughput
    and PDR over different network conditions. We evaluate the performance of the
    proposed protocol by comparing it with the performance of other existing MST [5]
    and SPT-based routing protocols [14]: the ETX MST ETX PDR and ETX RS protocols.
    The last two protocols is SPT-based that only differ on the channel assignment
    mechanisms. In addition, we study the impact of the proposed protocol under different
    PR activities (high activity PI = 0.1, moderate activity PI = 0.5, and low activity
    PI = 0.9). Figure 2 plots the PDR as a function of the number of available PR
    channels under different PR activities for our proposed SPT POS and ETX POS MST
    protocols. This figure shows that our proposed protocol significantly outperforms
    the MST-based protocol. This is because our SPT-based protocol requires less hops
    to the different destinations, resulting in improving the chances of delivering
    the packet successfully. Based on this result, in the rest of the paper, we will
    focus on the performance ofthe SPT-based multicast routing protocols. Fig. 2 Performance
    Comparison versus the number of channels under different PR activities Full size
    image Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the effect of increasing the number of PR channels
    on network performance in terms of throughput and PDR, respectively. It is clear
    that as the number of available channels increases, throughput (PDR) performance
    increases. This is because increasing the number of idle channels provides more
    chances to select the appropriate channels for transmissions. These figure show
    that the proposed protocol outperforms the others protocols under different network
    conditions. Fig. 3 throughput performance versus the number of PR channels under
    different PR traffic Full size image Fig. 4 Network PDR performance versus the
    number of PR channels under different PR traffic Full size image Figures 5 and
    6 respectively show the throughput and PDR performance of our proposed protocol
    as a function of the transmission power under various PR traffic loads. The proposed
    algorithm outperforms the other two SPT-based protocols. It is clear that as transmission
    power increases network performance improves. This is because as the transmission
    power increases, the data rate increases and the required transmission time decreases,
    which maximizes the chances of successfully delivering the video packets to all
    destinations. Fig. 5 throughput performance versus the transmit power Full size
    image Fig. 6 Network PDR performance versus transmit power under different PR
    activities Full size image Finally, Fig. 7 studies the effect of changing the
    packet size on the PDR performance under different PR conditions for 30 PR channels.
    It is clear that as the packet size increases, the PDR decreases for all protocols.
    This is expectedas the transmission time increases with increasing the packet
    size, resulting in more packet dropping due to PR activities. Figure 7 also shows
    that out ETX PoS SPT outperforms the other SPT-based protocol, irrespective of
    the packet size and PR activity level. Fig. 7 Network PDR performance versus the
    packet size D Full size image To summarize, Table 1 shows the performance gain
    achieved by our algorithm over the previous algorithm for 30 PR channel under
    different network conditions. The performance improvement over the compared with
    protocols is computed as follows: \\( \\frac{X_{ETXPoS}{X}_{Ref}}{X_{Ref}}\\times
    100 \\) (%), where XETX − PoS and XRef denote the achieved performance of our
    proposed ETX PoS algorithm and the reference algorithms (ETX-MDR or ETX-RS), respectively
    (Table 2). Table 2 Performance gain with 30 channels Full size table 6 Conclusion
    Designing multicast routing protocols for multi-hop ad hoc CRNs faces a challenge
    in how to perform effective routing and channel assignment such that minimum resources
    are used while guaranteeing the QoS performance for the multimedia services and
    applications. Many multicast routing protocols were designed, but none of them
    did not take into account the unique characteristics of CR operating environment.
    In this paper, we developed a multi-hop multicast routing protocol for CRNs with
    multimedia traffic. The proposed protocol jointly used the shortest path tree
    (SPT) with the ETX metric in the path selection process and the POS approach in
    the channel assignment along the different paths. The proposed protocol aimed
    at improving network performance through employing multi-layer transmission mechanism.
    The proposed protocol constructs a SPT from the original network topology based
    on the ETX metrics between neighboring nodes in the network to find the best path
    from the source to each destination in the multicast group. Then, for each layer
    in the SPT, the protocol selects the best channel for transmission that has the
    maximum POS to all nodes in that layer. Through simulations the impact of the
    different network parameter on (PR activity, number of available channels, etc.)
    on CRN performance were studied. Simulation results showed that our proposed protocol
    provides significant performance gain over traditional CRN routing and channel
    assignment schemes. Our proposed multi-layer routing protocol is intended to deal
    with single-session multi-cast scenarios. As future direction, our algorithm can
    be extended to accommodate the multi-session scenarios instead of single session.
    In addition, other types of multi-cast trees such as Steiner tree can be integrated
    into our ETX-based protocol instead of SPT and MST. References Al-hammouri M,

    is an essential component of the constantly developing wireless technology and
    services. The report from the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology
    (PCAST) in the United States suggested to release 1000 MHz of government-held
    spectrum for mobile broadband usage [1]. To this end, the Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) proposed that a total of 150 MHz in the 3550-3700 MHz band to
    be made available for the commercial usage [1]. In addition, the FCC proposed
    a set of rules for this band to create a new three-tier Citizens Broadband Radio
    Service (CBRS) centred around the Spectrum Access System (SAS). This model enables
    the most efficient and intensive use of the 3.5 GHz spectrum that is critical
    for 5G. Incumbent Access, are the tier-1 users and has the highest authority for
    military use and any organization that is ready to use the spectrum whenever it
    needs the spectrum. PAL and GAA are the two permissions for non-governments use,
    PAL are paid authorized users with permissions slightly lower than the first-tier
    users, once they are able to access the CBRS spectrum, the communication quality
    will not be interfered by the peer or third-tier users. The GAA is the third-tier
    user, and is not subject to any interference control and protection during packet
    transmission [1]. The SAS dynamically assigns and maintains CBRS spectrum use
    in real time, and there will be no fixed spectral location for PA or GAA allocations.
    In the subsequent parts of the work, the CBRS system is modelled by a Cognitive
    Radio (CR) system with PAL users termed as Primary Users(PU) and GAA users as
    Secondary Users(SU). The role of SAS is identical to the Fusion centre in many
    cooperative CR systems. Concept of Cognitive radio by Mitola[2], aims at improving
    spectral efficiency by allowing coexistence of licensed Primary User (PU) and
    unlicensed Secondary User (SU,) with acceptable degradation in services of PU.
    Achievement of higher data rate was realizable within the available bandwidth
    With development of Multi Input Multi output (MIMO) technology. MIMO Cognitive
    radio has been a popular research area as it improves spectral efficiency. Spectrum
    Sensing is the first critical cycle of the CR system. Energy detection based sensing
    is the most common method of local sensing due to the simplicity of its implementation
    and low complexity. Furthermore, it is shown in [3] that if no prior knowledge
    about PU’s signal is available at the SU, except of the received signal power,
    the ED is optimal for detecting zero-mean signals. In systems consisting of multiple
    SUs, cooperative sensing is used by which information from all SUs are jointly
    used to detect spectrum holes, which is more efficient than non-cooperative methods[3].
    CSS may be further viewed as distributed detection problem, with the central coordinator
    to be the fusion centre (FC), i.e. SAS. AND, OR, and MAJORITY combining techniques
    are the commonly used sub-optimal decision fusion rules for ideal SU-FC (reporting)
    channels. Fading characteristics in CBRS enivironment is less investigated, hence
    we have considered a general fading model, nakagami-m. By varying the value of
    the shape factor m, it leads to various models like Rayleigh, Rician, and one
    sided Gaussian, giving the best model for land and indoor mobile applications.
    However, multiple SU scenario, in the presence of Nakagami-m fading with channel
    statistics employing cooperative spectrum sensing is relatively less explored.
    The key contributions of this paper are summarised below: Modelling the CBRS CR
    MIMO system with multiple PUs and SUs Implementation of efficient cooperative
    spectrum sensing system (ECSS), where SAS takes the system level decision based
    on Majority combining technique. Each PU-SU link is under nakagami-m fading and
    each SU uses energy detector with SLS diversity for sensing. Evaluation of both
    individual SU level detection and system level detection by calculating the probability
    of detection, comparison with existing literature, and comparisons between theoretical
    and simulation models. SECTION II. System Model An uplink communication system
    with incumbent users, multiple PUs and multiple SUs is considered with a spectrum
    access system which dynamically assigns and maintains spectrum usage, shown in
    Fig. 1. Fig. 1. System model with single PU multiple SUs Show All A. CSS in Nakagami-m
    fading channels The CR system senses the presence of PU by means of CSS where
    individual SUs make a binary local decision (hard-sensing) using Energy Detector(ED).
    The reporting channel between the SU and SAS is assumed to be ideal. It is assumed
    that each PU and SU has Nr receiving antennas and Nt transmitting antennas 1)
    Frame Structure: Spectrum Sensing and throughput of the system is closely related.
    Larger the sensing time in a frame structure, better is the sensing but lesser
    is the time for data transmission. The probability of false alarm increases for
    lower sensing time. Each medium access control (MAC) frame is divided into two
    subframes [5]: Sensing subframe: τ time units, where SU is in spectrum sensing
    mode. The spectral power remaining in the sensed subband is transmitted only by
    the PU such that all SUs do not transmit during the sensing interval. Data subframe:v(T-τ)
    units for actual data transmission. 2) Local sensing of a frequency subband by
    a SU: SU mechanism for the hard sensing of a particular subband is shown in Fig.
    2. Each Subband is assumed to be independent and non-overlapping and the boundaries
    and centre frequency of each subband is assumed to be known to every SU. BPF is
    used to select a particular subband for sensing. B. Assumption on Incumbent Users
    Among the incumbents is the users which operates radar systems such as shipborne
    naval radars and satellites. The practical deployment of these radars are difficult
    and it’s detection is assumed to be done perfectly. Careful study on the interference
    caused by the communication system which coexists with the incumbent users is
    required to establish a pragmatic protection distance, which not only protects
    the incumbent from harmful interference and increases spectrum oppurtunity to
    the secondary users. Novel power control algorithms to assign operating powers
    to the coexisting cellular devices are also required for perfect implementation
    of the system. Sensor network at the SAS detects the presence of incumbent radar
    and triggers interference mitigation measures when necessary so that military
    radars permit the use of the band in its proximity. Whenever the sensor network
    detects the presence of incumbent radar signal, informs the SAS and SAS controls
    the PU and SU activity to nullify interference to the incumbent federal users.
    In order to operate in the CBRS ecosystem, sensors must be certified to meet specific
    requirements such as ability to detect the in-band incumbent radar signal at a
    minimum received power density and a minimum probability of detection [9]. All
    the aforementioned points have to be implemented and a channel allocation algorithm
    has to run simultaneously such that the sytem adheres to the existing CBRS rules.
    The Incumbent user detection and it’s practical implementation is left as a further
    extension of this work thus limiting this work the PAL and GAA implementation
    and cooperative spectrum sensing. Fig. 2. Structure of a single SU Show All SECTION
    III. Analytical System Modelling Suppose that all SUs monitor the same frequency
    with the PU. Spectrum sensing at the k-th SU can be formulated as a binary hypothesis
    testing problem. The received signal samples at ith antenna of SUk for the two
    hypotheses can be modelled as: yi,k(n) = Hi,kS(n) + wk(n), yi,k(n) = zi,k + wk(n),
    where n = 1, 2, …, N is the no. of samples, k = 1, 2, …, K is the total no. of
    SUs, Hi,k is the ith row of channel matrix between PU and SU. S(n) is the transmitted
    signal at the PU transmitter. AWGN noise sample that is represented by complex
    Gaussian with 0 mean and variance σ2wk is wk(n). zk(n) represents the signal sample,
    received from the PU if active. The signal is modeled as random variable (RV)
    with average power of E[(|zk(n)|)2] = Ωzk, which includes the channel gain. In
    practice, zk(n) and wk(n) are independent. The received primary signal samples
    at SUk are assumed to be independent and identically distributed complex Gaussian
    RVs with zero mean and variance, E[(|zk(n)|)2]. Accordingly the magnitude of the
    complex envelope is expected to be Rayleigh distributed. However, the magnitude
    of envelope is norm of an m dimensional complex vector, where m is the fading
    parameter of the Nakagami-m distribution. In practice, the received signal at
    each SUk is composed of a large number of resolved multipath component [3]. Therefore,
    |zk(n)| sim Nak(m, σzk ), and the average power of the received primary signal
    can also be written as E[(|zk(n)|)2]=Ω zk = 2mσ2zk [3]. The average received SNR
    of the PU -SUk link, measured at SUk, is defined as γ= m σ 2 z k σ 2 w k , m values
    are assumed to be same for every antenna of a particular SU. Noise samples are
    also assumed to be identical for all antennas of a particular SU. The variance
    of received samples at each antenna(Ωzk) is assumed to be same as we consider
    equal power division among all transmitter antennas of a PU. Each SU employs Square
    Law Selection (SLS) diversity technique. Traditional diversity combining techniques
    such as MRC, EGC and SC improve the receiver SNR but they increase the implementation
    complexity because they may need additional knowledge of Channel State Information
    (CSI). Hence in the non-coherent energy detection, having the instantaneous individual
    branch, energy detection along with CSI at the receiver is infeasible. Therefore,
    the non-coherent combining schemes which exploit the diversity gain without the
    CSI is more feasible. In this case square law techniques such as SLC and SLS provide
    better results. In SLS, each antenna the received sample envelope is squared and
    fed to the square law selector which selects the maximum of mod squares out of
    the Nr antennas. Let Ymax(n) denote the output of SLS combiner [7], Ymax(n) =
    max[|y1|2, |y2|2, … |yi|2 … |yNr|2], where |yi(n)|2 is the absolute square value
    for ith antenna. The energy detector uses ymax to calculate the local decision.
    ymax is added over N samples and fed to the threshold comparator, where λk is
    the threshold for kth SU. This now becomes a binary hypothesis problem. T(k)=
    ∑ n=1 N Y max (n)< λ k : H 0 :PU is inactive T(k)= ∑ n=1 N Y max (n)> λ k : H
    1 :PU is active (1) (2) View Source From the test binary local decision uk ∈ ((-1),
    1) is generated, where uk = (-1) and uk = 1 denote absence and presence of the
    PU, respectively. Each SU sends the hard decision uk to the SAS through an ideal
    reporting channel. SAS takes final decision on the presence of PU in the particular
    subband based on the vector of a observations form all the SU. SAS employs MAJORITY
    COMBINING technique. If there are more no of 1’s, the SAS takes decision as PU
    is detected in the subband and if there are more (-1)’s, it takes decision as
    subband is empty. SECTION IV. Performance Analysis of a Single SU A. Analysis
    Under Hypothesis H0 Under H0, the received signal contains only noise, yi,k ∼
    Complex Normal (0, 2σ2wk). The pdf of T(k) under H0 follows Chi-square distribution
    with 2N degrees of freedom, where N is the number of complex samples is considered
    as sensing period. Eventhogh the noise samples are having same variance within
    the same SU, the probability of false alarm is dependent of the diversity. The
    probability of false alarm at SUk is obtained as [3] P f,k = ∫ T(k)> λ k P(T(k)/
    H 0 )d T k =1− ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ 1− Γ(N, λ k 2 σ 2 w k ) Γ(N) ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ L (3) View Source where
    L is the number of diversity branches, L = Nr. Γ(N, x) and Γ(N) are the upper
    incomplete gamma and complete gamma functions, respectively. Assuming that the
    noise variance is perfectly known, the local threshold λk is obtained for a given
    Pf,k as λ k =2 σ 2 w k ( Γ −1 ((1+ log L (1− P f,k ))(Γ(N)),N) (4) View Source
    B. Analysis Under hypothesis H1 Under the hypothesis H1, the received signal contains
    both PU signal and noise. Therefore, the distribution of the test statistic depends
    on distribution of the envelope of the signal which further depends on |zk|. Here
    the envelope of |zk| (signal and channel)(r) follows Nakagami-m distribution given
    as f nak−m (r)= 2 m r 2m−1 Γ(m) Ω m exp(− m r 2 Ω ) (5) View Source Where m is
    the fading parameter and Ω is the signal spread. Ω=E[ | z k | 2 ]=2m σ 2 w k (6)
    View Source 1) Probability of detection under AWGN channel with no diversity::
    For AWGN channel, under hypothesis H1, the test statistics depends upon both signal
    and noise but the signal envelope is constant. The pdf of test statistics T[k]
    will have a noncentral chi-square distribution with N degrees of freedom and a
    non-centrality parameter 2γ, where γ is the SNR between PU –SU link which is a
    constant in AWGN case. Thus the probability of detection with no diversity is
    constant in this case and is given by[4]. P AWGN d,k = Q N ( 2γ − − √ , λ k 2
    σ 2 w k − − − − − − √ ) (7) View Source where Q(a,b) is the generalized Marcum-Q
    function 2) Probability of detection under AWGN channel with SLS diversity L:
    Under SLS diversity combiner, probability of miss detection of the output is the
    product of probability of miss detection of each branch. Probability of miss detection,
    Pmd=1-Pd Thus probability of detection under AWGN with SLS diversity is given
    as[7] P d,SLS,k =(1− (1− P AWGN d,k ) L ) P d,SLS,k = ⎛ ⎝ 1− (1− Q N ( 2γ − −
    √ , λ k 2 σ 2 w k − − − − − − √ )) L ⎞ ⎠ (8) (9) View Source 3) Probability of
    detection under Nakagami-m channel with SLS diversity L: The probability of detection
    depends upon the SNR of the signal in the PU-SU link. In Nakagami-m fading channel,
    the SNR changes instantaneously as the envelope of the signal is a random variable.
    Thus the distribution of the SNR in the given PU-SU link under Nakagami-m fading
    is given as [7]. f γ (γ)= m η γ m−1 Γ(m) exp( mγ η ) (10) View Source where η
    is the average SNR of the PU-SU link. In order to obtain the probability of detection,
    which is a function of SNR of the PU-SU link, average of probabiity of detection
    with respect to the pdf of SNR is calculated. Thus, the average probability of
    detection is given by P d,k = ∫ ∞ 0 P d,SLS,k f γ (γ)dγ=1− [1− P d,SA,k ] L (11)
    View Source where Pd,SA,k is the probability of detection under nakagami-m fading
    in case of single antenna or without any diversity. P d,SA,k = ∫ ∞ 0 Q N ( 2γ
    − − √ , λ k 2 σ 2 w k − − − − − − √ ) f γ (γ)dγ =1−exp( −γ 2 ) 1 Γ(N) ( λ k 2
    σ 2 w k ) (N−1) (exp( λ k 2 σ 2 w k )−1) (12) (13) View Source Since, the precise
    computation of Marcum–Q function is quite difficult, it is represented in the
    new form and the absolute convergence of the series in (12) is considered and
    (13) can be approximated as [7] P d,SA,k =1− ( λ k 2 σ 2 w k ) N−1 (exp( λ k 2
    σ 2 w k )−1) Γ(N) ( m η ) ( m η + 1 4 ) m (14) View Source Finally Pd,k is obtained
    by substituting (14) in (11) SECTION V. CSS Performance Analysis The SAS receives
    the sensing result from all the SUs and takes the overall decision about the sensing
    of a particular subband by majority combining technique. SAS decides on hypothesis
    H1 if at least K/2(If K even) or (K/2)+1 (if K odd) out of K SUs decides on H1.
    The ECSS algorithm result Qd is given as: Q d = ∑ i=ceil(K/2) K ∑ j=i n ∏ ∀a∈S
    P d,a ∏ ∀a∉S (1− P d,a ) (15) View Source where n =K Ci, Pd,a is the local probability
    of detection at ath SU, S is the set of elements of jth row of matrix C. Similarly
    an identical equation can be devised to find the system level probability of false
    alarm Qf,k Most of existing works consider the local probability of detection
    of SUs as identical and find the expression for system level probability of detection
    and false alarm by majority combining technique. But in practice, SUs are located
    at different locations and experience different multipath fading(different m)
    and also the average SNR of the PU-SU link differs from SU to SU. This motivates
    to consider different values of local probability of detection and false alarm
    for different SUs. Algorithm 1: Efficient CSS (ECSS) SECTION VI. Simulation and
    Results Simulation of the system is carried out in MATLAB by taking random nakagami-m
    distributed values. First individual spectrum sensing is carried out for each
    SU with 10000 Monte-Carlo iterations, N =3 and σ2wk=1. The individual sensing
    performance depends on three factors, namely nakagami-m fading factor(m), average
    SNR between PU-SU link and the number of receiver antenna Nr at SUs. These parameters
    are varied accordingly and the trend in detection performance is noted accordingly.
    A. Performance of Local Detection by a single SU In Fig. 3, the detection performance
    increases with increasing average SNR of PU-SU link for m=1, Nr=2. the average
    SNR is varied to 1 db,5 db and 10 db,and the probability of detection for 10 db
    cases is always above.9 all values of probability of false alarm. The trend is
    same for different values of m and Nr. In Fig. 4, the detection performance increases
    with increasing value of m for a fixed average PU-SU SNR and number of receiver
    antennas at SU, Nr=2. the value of m is varied between m=1 and m=2. The trend
    is same for different values of avg SNR and Nr. Fig. 3. Performance with varying
    SNR with m=2, Nr=1 Show All Fig. 4. Performance with varying m with SNR=5db, Nr=2
    Show All Fig. 5. Comparisons of ECSSA with Nr=2 with SISO system in [3] for avg
    SNR=5db and varying m Show All In Fig. 5, the detection performance is compared
    with a SISO model[3] under nakagami-m fading employing cooperative spectrum sensing.
    The detection performance of the MIMO ECSSA is better than SISO model. The performance
    is compared with different values of m, m=1 and m=2. In both the cases, even with
    Nr=2, the individual detection performance is better than the SISO model. On an
    average the probability of detection increases by 6.43% for our MIMO with Nr=2,
    which shows that increase in the number of receiver antenna leads to better sensing
    performance. B. Performance of ECSS with 3 different SUs In Fig. 6, the CSS detection
    performace of a particular subabnd of interest for 3 Secondary users is illustrated.
    Monte carlo iterations=10000 and N=3, i) SU1 - m=1, SNR=1 db, Nr=2; ii) SU2 -
    m=1, SNR=5 db, Nr=2; iii) SU3 - m=2, SNR=5 db, Nr=2. The detection of ECSS is
    better than the best detection in the local level. Similarly the system level
    probability of false alarm is less than the least local level probability of false
    alarm. Thus the proposed algorithm reduces chance of false alarm and increases
    the probability of detection, on a whole increasing the detection performance
    than non-cooperative sensing measures. The ECSS probability of detection is always
    above 0.9 which is a very good improvement considering low probability of detection
    values by SU1. As the number of SUs increases, the detection performance is more
    better. Simulation results show that as the number of diversity branches L increases,
    the detection performance also increases, but this work has been limited to small
    MIMO systems. Fig. 6. Performance of system level detection Show All SECTION VII.
    Conclusion The proposed efficient cooperative sensing system, ECSS, is implemented
    with multiple SUs and PUs. The detection of incumbent users is assumed to be done
    by the radar sensors is SAS and it takes necessary actions to allocate spectrum
    to incumbents as soon as detection occurs. CSS with majority combining under Nakagami-m
    faded PU - SU link was modeled and the simulation results matches with the theoretical
    ones from the derived analytical expressions. Simulation results show that as
    the number of diversity branches L increases, the detection performance also increases.
    As the number of SUs increases, the detection performnace also increases. The
    system level performance is closer to the best individual local performance in
    certain cases and in some cases it is better. Further extension of this work will
    be towards capacity analysis of PU and SU transmission. Authors Figures References

    India SECTION I. Introduction The proliferation of wireless devices and applications
    in daily life demands a huge RF band i.e. very valuable and natural resource.
    The tremendous growth in wireless generation and smart mobile devices cause the
    RF spectrum congestion and arise spectrum scarcity problem. The traditional static
    spectrum allocation policy can not accommodate the requirements of such excessive
    wireless application demands. Dynamic access of spectrum can provide a tempting
    solution of the discussed RF spectrum issues. A new communication paradigm “Cognitive
    Radio (CR)” also named as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) [1] [2] Networks has been
    emerged as a promising key technology to revolutionize spectrum utilization. CR
    technology, a promising communication paradigm enables the reuse of spectrum resources
    without causing harmful interference to legacy users also called primary user
    (PU) and the unlicensed user i.e secondary users (SUs) uses the unused spectrum
    segment of PU. Hence, Spectrum Sensing (SS) is the main function of the CR network
    that plays a vital role in identifying the unused portion of spectrum resources.
    The classical spectrum sensing techniques are Energy Detection (ED), Matched Filter
    Detection (MFD), Cyclo-stationary Feature Detection (CFD), Eigen value based detection
    etc. [3], all have their specific advantages and requirements. However, ED is
    the most used practical sensing method that does not require a prior information
    of the PU. These conventional techniques fail to perform well in multi-path shadowed,
    noisy, highly uncertain receiver conditions because a single node fails in such
    a severe condition. Hence, the sensing performance can be significantly improved
    by cooperation among the users. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) [4] uses joint
    information from multiple CR users with global decision combat the effects of
    such adverse conditions. CSS improves the detection performance by exploiting
    the spatial diversity and also resolve the single node sensing issue i.e hidden
    node problem. Cooperation between multi-user CR networks improves the cooperative
    gain and sensing performance. However, it also includes cooperation overhead that
    requires extra time for cooperation. Therefore, sensing trade-off occur in multi-user
    cooperative CR networks. With the evolving next-generation 5G, the dynamic channel
    gain plus the evolving position of primary user imposes a grim challenge to classical
    sensing techniques. These techniques fail to consider such coupling effects of
    dynamic channel and tracking of moving primary user states. Hence, Deep Sensing
    (DS) [5]–[8] a new detection framework integrated with advanced communication
    techniques is more practicable to use under such severe issues. It enables to
    increase the spectrum efficiency and cooperative gain. In addition to CR, Non
    orthogonal Multiples Access (NOMA) [9] [10] has been introduced as an advanced
    communication technology having the potential to increase the spectrum efficiency
    and massive connectivity in today''s 5G realistic radio spectrum scenario. NOMA
    technique allows the multiple SUs to access the power and code domain non orthogonal
    resources at the same time and frequency [11]. SECTION II. Motivation The static
    spectrum access policy can not allow the spectrum sharing for growing wireless
    application and devices. CR is a promising key technology that provides dynamic
    spectrum access and allows the spectrum sharing. In spite of this, an advanced
    communication technology NOMA enables large number of users simultaneously using
    different power or code domain levels and enhance the spectrum efficiency in 5G
    wireless networks. Thus, the motivation behind the CR integrated NOMA technique
    is to enhance the spectrum efficiency and to deal with overloaded data in future
    5G wireless networks. SECTION III. CR Fundamentals CR is having some specific
    characteristics that differ the CR from the conventional radio. CR characteristics
    are cognitive capability and reconfigurability [12]. Cognitive capability is defined
    as the device ability to sense and intelligent awareness of the conditions related
    to the RF environment and re-configurability is the capability of SUs that make
    decisions and changes in operating parameters such as power transmission, modulation
    scheme and communication protocols accordingly. A. CR Terminology CR terminology
    starts with a spectrum hole or vacant space identification. 1) Spectrum Hole Spectrum
    hole is defined as the vacant space or unused portion of the RF spectrum. The
    unused segments are classified as White spaces (Interference-free segment can
    be available for SU transmission), Gray spaces (partially occupied i.e rarely
    used by PU), Black spaces (having ample amount of interference cannot be used
    for SU transmission). 2) CR Concept CR enables its users to firstly, detect the
    licensed user location and to find out the available frequency band, secondly,
    select the most convenient band, Thirdly, provide coordinate access to this band
    with the other users and finally, free the channel when a legacy user is detected.
    3) Cognitive Cycle The main cognitive functions are spectrum sensing, spectrum
    sharing, spectrum management and spectrum mobility. Spectrum sensing is the main
    enabling CR function. It means to sense the information of radio environment with
    available spectrum segment and detects the unused spectrum at a particular time,
    place and frequency. Spectrum sharing means a fair spectrum scheduling provided
    by the CR networks among the concurring CR users. Spectrum management means to
    capture the best available spectrum as per the requirements of CR users communication
    and spectrum mobility is a process in which a CR user changes its frequency of
    operation and maintains seamless communication requirements when PU needs its
    spectrum. SECTION IV. Classical Spectrum Sensing Spectrum sensing is the main
    cognitive function. The following common terminology is associated with the spectrum
    sensing or detector design algorithm [3]: Fig. 1. Cognitive cycle [2]. Show All
    A. Spectrum Sensing Terminology Binary Hypothesis Testing: Spectrum sensing algorithm
    or signal detection algorithm is formulated as binary hypothesis testing based
    on the observed signal at CR receiver. H 0 :z(n)=w(n),(PUabsent) H 1 :z(n)=αs(n)+w(n),(PUpresent)
    (1) (2) View Source where z(n) = received signal, α =channel gain, s(n) = PU signal
    transmitted, w(n) =AWGN noise with mean 0 and variance σ 2 . Different classical
    sensing techniques such as ED, Matched filter detection, Cyclostationary feature
    detection, Eigen value based detection etc. are used for sensing decision based
    on test statistic. These techniques performance is evaluated using probability
    of detection ( P d ) and probability of false alarm a ( P f ) defined as: P d
    P f =P( H 1 | H 1 ) =P( H 1 | H 0 ). (3) (4) View Source B. Comparative Study
    of Classical/Non Cooperative Sensing Techniques Table I Comparative study of classical
    sensing techniques C. Classical Sensing Issues In practice, the fidelity of single-user/non
    cooperative detection is hard to maintain under severe channel conditions such
    as multipath fading, shadowing, hidden node problem and receiver uncertainty [13].
    A single user may give the erroneous decision in such severe condition. Therefore,
    cooperation among user can improve the spectrum efficiency using sparsely diverse
    users. Table II Comparative study of classical sensing techniques. SECTION V.
    Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Cooperative sensing framework consists of PU, SUs
    and Fusion Center (FC) which is also a CR user and it is a three-step processing
    mechanism. The steps are local sensing, reporting and data fusion. Apart from
    it, the framework has cooperative elements i.e RF environment including licensed
    channel, control channel and remote database. The cooperative spectrum sensing
    techniques are categorized into centralized, distributed and relay assisted cooperative
    spectrum sensing [4]. In centralized cooperative sensing, a common receiver called
    FC plays a significant role. The primary task of FC is the collection of local
    decisions from the secondary users and decides the spectrum availability. Therefore
    FC act as the central controlling entity in performing the three process step
    of the cooperative framework. In Decentralized cooperative sensing, FC is not
    present in the cooperative framework model while the SUs decide the PU signal
    availability as per their sharing information to each other. Relay assisted cooperative
    sensing is the cooperative framework model where a SU serves as relay forwarding
    its information for the transmission purpose. For instance, a particular SUs sensing
    channel may be weak and reporting channel may strong, while for another SU reporting
    channel may weak and sensing channel may strong arises from multipath and shadowing
    consequences. These can be a complement to each other to improve system performance.

    All A. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Issues In recent future next-generation networks
    such as IEEE 802.11n, LTE-A, 5G the time varying modeling is employed. However,
    cooperative spectrum sensing techniques have been investigated to address such
    issues but cooperative overhead and latency limit its performance. It includes
    sensing time and delay, channel impairments, energy efficiency, sensing efficiency
    and security issues [14] [15]. Therefore, a joint spectrum awareness design or
    deeper sensing framework has been investigated as an advanced CR area dealing
    with future next generation design. SECTION VI. Deepsensing Deep sensing techniques
    enables the evolution of the dynamic features using Dynamic State Space (DSM)
    model design [5]–[8]. PU state, real-time evolving location, channel fading and
    doppler effect etc. features can be used in DSM that needs to be estimated jointly
    in future next generation mobile scenario. The next 5G generation network has
    massive connectivity and requires a high data rate. Hence, to implement CR in
    5G some advanced communication techniques need to be developed that can furnish
    the spectrum sensing techniques in deeper cognition mode. To increase spectrum
    efficiency and massive user connectivity in 5G based CR, Non Orthogonal Multiple
    Access (NOMA) technology has been encouraged to use for higher applications. Three
    operation paradigm of CR network i.e Interweave, overlay and underlay paradigm
    can be integrated with power domain NOMA [9]. A. NOMA Concept The basis of NOMA
    concept is to multiplex the power or code domain information at the transmitter
    for signal combination termed as superposition coding (SC) and uses successive
    interference cancellation (SIC) at receiver for signal detection. It provides
    the simultaneous access of multiple users at the same time and frequency using
    non orthogonal resources in power and code domain. In power domain NOMA, power
    is allocated to users as per their channel condition where Code domain NOMA uses
    spreading sequences like as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and it is classified
    as Low Density Spreading CDMA(LDS-CDMA), Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) and
    LDS-OFDM [11]. B. NOMA Integrated CR Operation Paradigm The following table describes
    the three operation paradigm of CR with power domain NOMA. C. Challenges and Future
    Directions NOMA integrated CR has some challenges, discussed in the following
    table [9] [16]–[20]: SECTION VII. Conclusion The Cognitive Radio has the capability
    to address the spectrum scarcity issues. In this paper, we have reviewed the most
    recent advances and challenges of spectrum sensing techniques in next 5G generation
    networks. Ultra high frequency band i.e. use of millimeter wave and massive connections
    in 5G networks are the incentives for efficient energy and spectrum sensing techniques
    development. Spectrum sensing algorithm using advanced communication techniques
    NOMA is likely to be a promising key solution for higher spectrum efficiency and
    massive user connectivity in 5G CR networks. Authors Figures References Citations

  description: The exponential increase in mobile data traffic and ever-increasing
    mobile users has led to a swift rise in the energy consumption and operational
    costs of wireless networks. Spectral Efficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE)
    are considered to be the most important metrics for any wireless network but both,
    SE and EE, usually conflict with each other. In this paper, we have done survey
    of different physical layer technologies like OFDMA, mm-wave, heterogeneous networks
    etc. and various radio resource allocation techniques to simultaneously optimize
    SE and EE in different wireless networks. The various network planning strategies
    such as reduction in cell size, cell zooming and dense deployment of base stations
    (BSs) are investigated to optimize EE besides SE of the wireless networks. The
    findings of survey paper also reveal different power control algorithms to optimize
    EE along with increasing the overall system capacity and number of users in the
    shared spectrum. The survey done in this work provides an essential understanding
    on the deployment of spectral and energy-efficient next-generation wireless networks.

    Location: Dubai, United Arab Emirates SECTION I. INTRODUCTION A CR is a system
    or radio network that senses the electromagnetic environment at any channel''s
    dynamic nature. Due to radio operating networks’ is active sensing, throughput,
    interference, and secondary user accessibility. The 2.4GHz frequency band is offering
    many applications such as industrial, medical and defence etc. The personal wireless
    network is one of the most significant operating spectrums that can interface
    the clients to the server. A. Introduction The 4G and 5G applications mainly reconfigure
    on long term evolution (LTE) and Long-term evolution advance (LTEA) models. Several
    techniques efficiently deal with the wireless communications methods, such as
    autocorrelation, HJB and Eigenvalues. However, many algorithms decrease the complexity
    of sensing performance and spectrum sensing parameters. Hence the primary users
    and secondary users must improve in developing technologies. The Energy Spectrum
    Density (ESD) alternatively varied in selecting a communication system, if this
    ESD must improve for cognitive radio system make proficient. B. CR Network model
    A cognitive radio network is a spectrum; it can operate the primary licensed users
    (PU) and unlicensed secondary users (SU). The CR is conscientious for both PU
    and SU within the available coverage area. The partitioned CR can offer three
    categories of activities such as static, dynamic and decision making. The main
    functionality of Cognitive radio networks supports multi communications, and these
    are as follows. Various information''s available in CR collected from the entire
    system of elements. The network model is acquainted with and corresponds through
    public primary and secondary users to assemble a decision. The routing and communication
    between various nodes have possible, and these are depending on the path among
    the cognitive radio network. Secondary users would be unlicensed elements in CR;
    if any PU presented in the CR, then network maintenance automatically adjusted
    to cover the spectrum. The CR sensing and monitoring has decided the channel utilization
    and updating of sensor nodes. The CR performs to a great extent of functionality
    such as resource utilization, end-to-end equipment, and rooting decision. The
    secondary user''s communication process is mainly depending on the decision of
    optimistic primary users. The mutual understanding between these two has generated
    the QoS (quality of service) by CR. the performance of the selected channel at
    the presence selectivity of frequency. The probability of False alarm and the
    likelihood of detection mainly depend on the primary user''s frequency selectivity.
    The present CR method reduces complexity by 79%, probability of false alarm 29%
    and performance improvement 62% have attained, but further improvement is necessary
    Fig 1.1 describes major aspects of spectrum sensing mechanisms with respects to
    cognitive radios. It is a centralized CR network certainly offering speed of interface,
    accuracy, primary user''s consequence, and secondary user''s approval. The sensing
    of the spectrum is a crucial task, where Cognitive radio is used to improve all
    permission for primary users, without any disturbance of the spectrum channel.
    The cognitive radio receivers continuously sense the availability of channel for
    interfacing the users. The above block diagram progresses the bandwidth, signal
    to noise ratio, bit error rate, throughput, and spectrum efficiency. But essential
    improvements are needed in discussed performance measures. Secondary users sense
    the channel in any absence of primary users. C. Overview of spectrum sensing Wireless
    communication system and their applications are growing exponentially; therefore,
    many spectrum resources are needful. A large portion of licensed bands utilized
    by primary users remaining space allotted to unlicensed secondary users. Now a
    day''s number of companies making their electronic equipment using unlicensed
    bands. A 2.4GHzs ISM band is globally available; simultaneously, these are suitable
    for low-cost wireless applications. The significant problem is that the ISM band
    is non-coordinate the SUs and Pus in the same channel. This non-coordination interference
    was effecting the PU''s and SU''s. For any reliable CR communication is challenges,
    the following parameters. In this mechanism, the spectrum hole is a concept, which
    can identify by frequency terminal slots. Due to whole spectrum power controlling,
    spectrum management and processing time have been increases. Figure 1.1: Multi-carrier
    CR network Show All The above fig. 1.1 clearly explains various parameters involved
    in the spectrum sensing parameters; MIMO is a multi-carrier communication that
    certainly accepts the many deterministic signals. With MIMO, wireless communication
    technology explores the multiple antennas by transmitter and receiver. This expertise
    minimizes the complexity of error and speeds up the performance of the system.
    D Overview of paper In this paper, in introduction section detailed explanation
    is providing for WCN. Coming to section II a brief literature survey is done with
    earlier models. In section III related methods are explained for identify the
    limitations of work and problems facing by current research. Section IV clearly
    explains about methodology of current research with ATLBO algorithm. Section V
    and VI clearly explains about results and conclusions of ATLBO model. SECTION
    II. LITERATURE SURVEY In cognitive radio networks sensing and searching schemes
    are essential to improve for multiple primary users and secondary user determination.
    Therefore, available sensing schemes are cannot be projected with efficient algorithms.
    Therefore, all metric performance constraints have degraded their operation. The
    false alarm rate, detection probability and signal to noise ratio measured with
    various sensing algorithms. If these algorithms do not properly work, then automatically,
    all performance measures and operative competences have been degraded. Moreover,
    the PU''s detection and SU''s re-appearing functionality are very important in
    wireless sensor networks. To reduce the complex spectrum sensing and uncertainty
    of channel has been modified through proposed spectrum sensing methods. A. Introduction
    Cognitive radios are an adaptive intellectual wireless network; users can inevitably
    identify through available channels in this technology''s wireless spectrum. If
    the transmission origins are changed, then concurrently update their available
    channels and their behaviour. So,CR utilizes many techniques, including progressive
    and adaptive communication systems and software-defined approaches. The cognitive
    radios and operations have mainly depended on sensing capability and searching
    accessibility of every element in the network. Problem statement To overcome the
    hidden node interference problems in the cooperative spectrum, secondary users''
    and primary users'' priority assessment and delay in sensing &searching activities
    are exhaustive. But the current wireless communication technology moving forward
    with advanced features. Therefore, for satisfying the 4G and 5G LTE communication,
    innovative sensing algorithms schemes are necessary. The genetic algorithm, differential
    evaluation and partial swarm optimization techniques are very popular, but cognitive
    radios more heightening than existing models. Therefore, progressive and adaptive
    CR optimization techniques designs are necessary. B. CR spectrum sensing The unlicensed
    access and unused spectrum bands analysis is currently ongoing investigation.
    Increasing demand in spectrum usage and efficiency of licensed users and their
    operation cannot be compromised [1]. A. Ghasemi et al. clearly Explains various
    operators are sensing approaches along with unlicensed users. The individual user
    transmission, sensing is responsible for the available CR spectrum. If the Legacy
    license system used by any CR, then mechanically, its procedure moderated. To
    improve its autonomous operation to identify the unused frequency bands in the
    CR by spectrum sensing methods. In this research work, regulatory necessities
    and significant challenges in practical spectrum sensing functionalities are discussed.
    Teaching and learning-based optimization technique has been analysed for CR network
    analysis. V Rao et al. [2] mainly concentrate on sensing error probability, efficiency,
    throughput and blocking error probability in CR networks. The optimal values like
    false alarm rate and detection probability contribute to the enhanced functionality
    of CR. To improve the performance of the CR network, we need to train the parameters
    like Pf, Pd and g, respectively. A detailed analysis of CR networks and their
    detection probability, sensing and searching elements are described in this work.
    OFDM and cognitive radios constantly monitor the available channels in the spectrum.
    The active interference cancellation and extensive coherence cancellation parameters
    are overcome through the variable bias function technique. The inter-carrier interference
    and inter-symbol interference functionalities are controlled by various modulation
    techniques like 64-QAM and mapping techniques. In this work, normalized OFDM and
    QAM techniques enhance the ICI and ISI [3]. Total error probability, false alarm
    rate, missing packet ratio, optimal threshold detection of secondary user’s is
    analyzed through the cooperative sensing method. The theoretical and practical
    spectrum sensing methods required proper accuracy to identify the user''s efficiency
    [4]. In CR networks, secondary users are mainly exploiting the channel available
    in the spectrum. This condition is satisfied: one and only one primary user and
    its frequency bands are not currently being used. The primary users and secondary
    users are most prominent; however, they work with 6 MHz frequency and frame duration
    100ms. The signal to noise ratio of PU''s and SU''s have been achieved -20dB,
    and the detection probability is attained 90.4% at 14.2milli Seconds. Along this
    9.6ms optimal sensing time and 4ms SU''s cooperative sensing adjustment is performed
    using decision rule [5]. To increasing the demand of the CR spectrum due to the
    mass utilization of 5G-LTEA, communication is performed. CR networks are most
    undoubtedly offering low cost and compatible operations. Therefore, an optimization
    spectrum environment and its variations can be controlled by dynamic CR spectrum
    conditions. In this research work, adaptive CR optimization techniques compared
    with many representations [6]. In this work, the CR network has been investigated
    with subordinate Spectrum sensing design. The spectrum of dynamic nature mainly
    depends on sensing activity. The arrangement of radio networks overcomes the local
    singling limitations and challenges. The uncertainty of cognitive radios has solved
    by using argued pre-processor block in the network. At long last, spectrum detecting
    is a complicated issue. It is requesting the facilitation of endeavoursin administrative
    and specialized WSN areas. One specific model is the cooperative position for
    detecting PUs, which requires an adaptable approach for managing dynamic access.
    The classifying range is mainly reliant on the logical CR radio system[7]. The
    spatial and spectral correspondence models are used to detect the transmission
    and reception process in CR. The primary or secondary users exploit their boundaries
    to detect the transmission process in the CR network. The probability of miss
    detection is over esteemed through interference; it is not taken as a major issue
    in interference assessment. Moreover, theoretical and practical channel estimation
    methods are majorly dependent on the improvement of throughput, sensing ratio
    and searching ratio probabilities. The optimized low-level interference, equivalent
    to secondary users, is the major constraint in the cognitive radio network [11].
    The fixed threshold evaluation process in the CR network varies depending on traffic
    in the channel. The primary users and secondary users are evaluated through the
    traditional energy detection method. The dynamic threshold values are easily handling
    the CR spectrum with a conventional mechanism. Various SNR schemes designed for
    future CR purpose in a precise manner. The performance of cognitive radio networks
    can be evaluated through sensing time and searching time. The numbers of cooperative
    users easily tackle the entire operations of cognitive radio networks. Compared
    to past algorithms, present sensing optimizations make the channel efficient.
    C. Research objectives In this research work an advanced WCN model is implemented
    for future CR applications purpose. The main objective this ATLBO technique is
    to implementing for high spectral efficiency and false alarm detection purpose.
    The measures like probability of detection, packet delivery ratio and spectral
    sensitivity. SECTION III. RELATED METHOD CR''s fundamental usage is adopting practical
    applications with accurate random locations in SU''s and PU''s. Generally, upper
    and lower bands of CR has been verified by using the spectrum evaluation process.
    The modern method and conventional methods cannot solve cognitive radio issues.
    The iterative algorithms cannot improve cognitive radio performance. The computer
    simulation based on searching and sensing methods optimizes the channel efficiency.
    The fusion schemes have been maximized the efficiency of secondary users and primary
    users at supplementary traffic. In PU''s and SU''s, CR channels are allowed the
    frequency spectrum is agreeing for network sharing. Spectrum sensing and searching
    is an advanced detection scheme for sensing the secondary users and primary users.
    Cognitive radio channel sensing mainly depends on the probability of error, sensing
    throughput and blocking error probability. If any users affect this parameter,
    then automatically throughput is decreased. The sensing duration and searching
    time decide the throughput of secondary users in the CR network. In this constrain,
    primary users, are adequately protected. The cooperative sensing through multi-channel
    communication using 6MHZ channel. The frame duration 10 mill seconds and the SNR
    of PU''s and SU''s is 20dB. These results are optimal and require 90% maintenance.
    The detection time is 14.2 mills seconds at 0.9 probability. When distributed
    sensing is applied to the spectrum, then inevitably, optimal sensing time has
    been decreased. The spectrum handoff decides the delay of secondary users and
    primary users sensing activity. The recommended channel searching and sensing
    sequences are optimized the handoff delay. The reliability of CR has been constrained
    by using the two following cases. The current frame should be successfully transmitted
    within the spectrum handoff. Secondary users receive the data within spectrum
    handoff through frames. O(∑r(1+ 1 – √ +Σs)2/ρ2rρ2s) View Source Decreasing the
    interference between users such as PU''s and SU''s can be improved through cognitive
    radio networks. Cognitive radios solve the problems of local sensing optimization,
    and these are single-band or multi-band spectrum variables. The maximum throughput
    can be attained through false alarm adjustment. The wideband distributive sensing
    and time slots are depending on the number of users in the channel. The cognitive
    radios are differentiated with a signal to noise ratio measure; SNR is less than
    5dBautomaticly throughput and efficiency. A decreased S. 0.41sec handoff delay
    and 0.3kb noise have decreased through the single band cooperative spectrum-sensing
    model. The recent machine learning models are defining the various frameworks
    for cognitive radios. But necessary improvements are required to attain accuracy.
    The decentralization methods are accomplishing the alternative ways for optimizing
    the cognitive radio network. With map-reduce distribution, the support vector
    machine and genetic algorithms solve cognitive radios'' limitations. The distributive
    cloud computing systems associate modern wireless communications systems; these
    are suitable for channel acceptability. The high dimensional databases are most
    suitable for machine learning-based channel estimation methods. OFDM and cognitive
    radios constantly monitor the available channels in the spectrum. The active interference
    cancellation and extensive coherence cancellation parameters are overcome through
    the variable bias function technique. The inter-carrier interference and inter-symbol
    interference functionalities are controlled by various modulation techniques like
    64-QAM and mapping techniques. In this work, normalized OFDM and QAM techniques
    enhance the ICI and ISI [3]. Total error probability, false alarm rate, missing
    packet ratio, optimal threshold detection of secondary users is analyzed through
    the cooperative sensing method. The theoretical and practical spectrum sensing
    methods required proper accuracy to identify the user''s efficiency [4]. SECTION
    IV PROPOSED METHOD A. Optimization of CR Three problems are affecting the cognitive
    radio networks. Those are sensor error probability minimization, throughput maximization
    and blocking probability maximization. In cognitive radios learning, observations,
    orientation, action, and decision are the optimization techniques. This radio
    communication can be adaptable and reconfigurable with the enhancement of PU''s
    and SU''s. Problem: 1 Minimize: Sensing Error probability In problem 1, sensing
    error probability can be minimized through equation 5. This Markov chain could

    B. ATLBO algorithm The above all parameters are performance estimators at all
    conditions. Earlier algorithms do not follow these. Therefore in this research
    work, teaching a learning-based optimization algorithm is proposed. It is giving
    the solution for the above three problems. Moreover, it can optimize the cognitive
    radio network and make the channel efficient. Problem 1: If optimize the Pf and
    Pd, then it reduces CR sensing error probability. Problem 2: If optimize the Pf
    and Pd, then maximize the CR throughput. Problem 3: If optimize the guard band
    \"g\", then minimize the blocking error probability. In this experiment, consider
    the popular algorithms such as genetic algorithm and differential evolution algorithm
    for comparing the result of ATLBO. John Holland proposed GA in 1970. The significant
    function of the genetic algorithm is selection, crossover and mutation. The differential
    evolution is proposed by \"R. Storn and K. Price\" in 1997. The main operation
    of DE is a mutation, selection and recombination. ATLBO algorithm was proposed
    by Rao et al. [8]. The fundamental idea of ATLBO is the teacher phase and the
    learner phase. The ATLBO algorithm is a teaching-learning process in this inspired
    algorithm influence the learner by the teacher [9]. In this optimization, a group
    of learners are denoted as population, and their subjects are denoted as variables.
    By using the fitness values, ATLBO optimizes the problems. In this, the best solution
    is identified when the teacher is considered as the main element. The common control
    parameters of teaching-learning based optimizations, providing the specific controllable
    parameters [10]. The ATLBO mainly depending on the learning process, i.e. best
    student in the class selected as a teacher in the next upcoming iterations. Therefore
    the remaining student''s cloud learns the information from him and improves the
    knowledge. The group of learners in the class classified as population and subjects
    are variables. Initialization Teacher phase Learning Phase Repeat In the initialization
    random population and size is defined, moreover different variables are selected
    as subject. In the teacher phase, knowledge is sharing with available students
    and getting the result from them. In the third stage of the learning phase, students
    are continuously acquiring the knowledge randomly from others. In the last phase,
    the repeat step is performed between 3&4. Finally, this ATLBO algorithm gives
    the minimum optimization value of sensing error probability. Table 1. 1: Parameters
    used to simulate ATLBO, GA and DE Table 1.1 demonstrates that parameters used
    in the simulation for GA, DE and ATLBO. The 50 values of population size are selected
    and, under several iterations, are collected. In this technique, crossover probability
    mutation, scaling factor, and crossover rate of 0.25, 0.078, 0.8, and 0.9 values
    selected, respectively. SECTION V RESULTS When we simulate the cognitive radio
    network''s objectives with GA, DE and ATLBO, they can optimize the network. Here

    Information: DOI: 10.1109/TCCN.2020.2987799 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction
    Owing to the proliferation of wireless-enabled user equipment and data-hungry
    applications, mobile data traffic is anticipated to multiply exponentially in
    coming years [1]. Such an increase not only demands mobile networks to expand
    their capacities, but also to intensify their power consumption to serve this
    ever-increasing number of user equipment [2]. The total amount of power consumption
    of the telecommunication sector is forecast to reach 1710 terawatt-hours (TWh)
    by 2031, up from 600 TWh in 2011, which will result in unprecedented levels of
    C O 2 emissions by the sector [3]. Moreover, next generation networks are expected
    to manage a seven-fold increase in mobile data traffic by 2021 [4]. For mobile
    network operators, this capacity expansion and huge power consumption call for
    a large operational expenditure (OPEX) [5]–[7]. Green energy, such as wind-based
    energy or solar-based energy, offers an appreciable solution that can be utilized
    to alleviate BS’s power consumption [8]. Many communications companies, such as
    Nokia and Ericsson, have already deployed mechanisms to utilize renewable energy
    sources [9]. By utilizing green energy, network operators can save on-grid power
    and reduce their operational expenditure. However, due to the unsteady green energy
    generation, mixed energy supplies (i.e., on-grid and green) are more advantageous
    for powering BSs [10]. Heterogeneous networks (HetNets), in which mixed types
    of low-power base stations (BSs) (e.g., femto, pico, micro) coexist with large
    macro base stations (MBS), bear good potential in addressing the power consumption
    and capacity challenges. Low-power BSs, known as small cells, are different in
    terms of their transmission power and coverage area [11]. They enable HetNets
    to boost their capacity by employing the frequency-reuse concept intensively within
    contiguous cells and alleviating the spectrum scarcity problem. Additionally,
    owing to their small coverage areas, small cell BSs (SCBSs) require less power
    than traditional BSs [12]. Considering users’ dynamic distribution, SCBSs are
    usually installed in areas that have high user densities to offer better coverage.
    Although a SCBS consumes less power than a MBS, the number of SCBSs in a large
    mobile network is much higher than the number of MBSs. As a result, the total
    power consumption of a network with a large number of SCBSs is likely to be high
    [13]. Additionally, owing to the current fixed-spectrum fragmentation and allocation
    policy, it is still a challenge for HetNets to meet the dramatic increase in mobile
    data traffic. Moreover, as a consequence of their inflexible, constrained, and
    hardware-based configurations, HetNets have major limitations in adapting to fluctuating
    traffic patterns [14]. For instance, due to non-uniform user distribution, some
    SCBSs with bounded capacities may become overloaded, while others become lightly
    loaded which results in a severe resource management problem. For capacity enhancement,
    long-term evolution-licensed assisted access (LTE-LAA) is a promising solution
    that expands LTE to unlicensed bands to boost next-generation network capacities
    to meet enormous traffic demands. As shown in Fig. 1, using the carrier aggregation
    technique, carriers from the licensed and unlicensed spectrum are aggregated to
    increase user throughput [15]. However, two major challenges arise when extending
    LTE-LAA to the unlicensed band. Firstly, how to ensure an interference-free coexistence
    between LTE-LAA enabled devices and WiFi-enabled devices, which are the major
    consumers of unlicensed bands [16]. Secondly, how to maintain a fair channel-occupation
    ratio between the two types of users (LTE-LAA and WiFi) to maintain their throughput
    levels, taking into consideration that WiFi technology employs a contention-based
    channel access mechanism and LTE-LAA employs an orthogonal frequency-division
    multiple access (OFDMA) channel access mechanism [16]. Fig. 1. aggregation in
    LTE-LAA. Show All To overcome these challenges, major telecommunication companies
    (e.g., Ericsson and Huawei) along with the European Telecommunications Standards
    Institute (ETSI) have developed the ETSI EN 301.893 regulation that ensures a
    fair/interference-free coexistence between LTE-LAA users and WiFi users [17].
    Software defined radio (SDR) technology is an enabling tool in this context. SDR
    technology enables BSs to dynamically adjust their operating parameters such as
    frequency bands and transmission power to establish an LTE-LAA-based communication
    link and adapt to variable traffic patterns and network dynamics [18], [19]. Existing
    LTE-LAA systems are constrained by their hardware pre-configurations, which allow
    them to operate only on operator’s fixed licensed bands along with the 5 GHz unlicensed
    band [15]. As a result, only users belonging to the operator enjoy the benefits
    of the LTE-LAA systems. The benefits of the LTE-LAA can be further shared with
    users from other operators if the LTE-LAA can support multiple licensed and unlicensed
    bands, which can be achieved by using SDR technology. This would benefit all operators
    in terms of revenue and spectrum utilization, and users in terms of higher data
    rates, a better quality of service and a better quality of experience. In networks
    that have multi-dimensional heterogeneity with reference to diverse cells, power
    sources (on-grid and green), divergent operating bands (unlicensed and licensed),
    and various traffic densities with different quality of service (QoS) requirements,
    one critical and primary problem is how efficiently can diverse network resources
    be utilized while providing high QoS to customers. In other words, although these
    heterogeneous networks provide valuable opportunities to employ the advantages
    of particular resources or technologies for various services, they likewise result
    in numerous technical challenges to enhance network utilization and user experience
    owing to their extraordinarily dynamic environment and multi-dimensional heterogeneity.
    In this regard, traffic steering, where traffic loads are distributed/steered
    in an optimal manner across various network units and bands with a view to fulfill
    a certain goal, is considered a promising solution for multi-dimensional heterogeneity
    challenges [20]. This enables network operators to manage and control their highly
    dynamic traffic loads across different access entities to maximize their network’s
    resources utilization. For instance, using traffic steering, network operators
    can direct traffic from a lightly loaded on-grid cell to its neighboring off-grid
    (green-powered) cells and turn off the on-grid cell to save more power [21]. Hence,
    traffic steering exploits, in a more productive manner, network multi-dimensional
    heterogeneity. One of the novel traffic steering methodologies is the spectrum-based
    cell zooming, in which various spectrums are selected to enable more agile and
    flexible traffic steering. For instance, as displayed in Fig. 2, the blue cell
    is loaded with multiple users, while the red cell has a light load. Consequently,
    owing to users in the red cell being beyond the blue cell’s coverage area, the
    BS of the blue cell can zoom in (enlarge its coverage area) by selecting an appropriate
    low spectrum band to serve these users. Accordingly, using spectrum-based cell
    zooming, traffic is steered among these two cells more resiliently. Similar spectrum-based
    techniques can be exploited to steer mobile network traffic in a way that achieves
    higher benefits for the operators. Fig. 2. The spectrum-based cell zooming technique.
    Show All A network operator can deploy a centralized controller server to mitigate
    spectrum-based cell zooming technique challenges, such as inter-cells interference
    and optimum resource allocation, within the network to boost network performance.
    This server collects regular updates and has comprehensive knowledge about the
    users and BSs’ locations. In this paper, by leveraging spectrum-based cell zooming
    techniques, the long-term evolution licensed assisted access (LTE-LAA) concept
    and software defined radio technology, we introduce a green traffic-steering approach
    that reduces the overall network’s on-grid power consumption and increases the
    aggregated throughput of all users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
    first work to utilize the spectrum-based cell zooming technique, green energy,
    the SDR, and the LTE-LAA concept all together to provide a green traffic-steering
    approach to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption in an LTE-LAA
    network. The major contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: This
    paper presents a spectrum-based cell zooming approach to steer traffic in an SDR-enabled
    LTE-LAA network to achieve higher energy efficiency while maintaining good throughput.
    The proposed cell zooming approach in this network takes into account idle spectrum
    resources (licensed and unlicensed), application types and available green energy
    in various cells. We formulate the traffic steering problem as a constrained multi-objective
    optimization problem and provide optimum solutions. The objective is to minimize
    power consumption and maximize throughput. Considering the time complexity of
    the optimization problem, we develop a heuristic-based algorithm that achieves
    good sub-optimum solutions. The proposed solutions were benchmarked against existing
    solutions. The obtained results are promising. The rest of the article is structured
    as follows: the following section reconnoiters and discusses previous related
    research and demonstrates how this article covers research gaps in the literature.
    In Section III, we demonstrate and provide an explanation of our system model
    and its various parameters encompassing our communication model, traffic model,
    and energy model. Furthermore, we introduce our heuristic algorithm and its implementation.
    Section IV presents a detailed discussion of our simulation results. Section V
    briefly reviews the concluding remarks. SECTION II. Related Works and Problem
    Statement A. Related Works The concept of HetNets has recently been extensively
    studied, and many research studies have taken hybrid-power supplies into consideration
    to power cellular networks. For instance, the authors of [22] proposed an offloading
    technique that offloads users from a hybrid-powered BS with low levels of green
    energy to other BSs with abundant green energy to improve green energy utilization.
    A hybrid green energy sharing framework is proposed by the authors in [23]. The
    framework is based on an algorithm that determines the optimal electricity and
    green energy quantities to be allocated to each BS based on its traffic loads
    to maximize energy efficiency. In [24], the authors have developed a novel power
    allocation and relay selection technique to minimize the network’s on-grid power
    consumption. To maximize green energy utilization, an algorithm for user-cell
    association is proposed in [25]. Although the above-mentioned research studies
    utilized green energy to power BSs and reduce on-grid power consumption, they
    did not consider the impact on offloaded users’ data rate and overall network
    throughput. In other words, they did not consider the network throughput as a
    performance metric in their offloading schemes while offloading users through
    the networks. Due to considerable disparities in BS coverage areas, HetNets are
    very susceptible to user-cell association rules. Hence, existing literature has
    presented numerous user-cell techniques to ameliorate HetNets’ performance. For
    example, authors in [26] have investigated joint resource allocation and user
    association in HetNets by a fairness network utility factor α that needs to be
    maximized in order to achieve better throughput for users. Authors in [27] presented
    a user-cell association scheme in which users select BSs that accommodate their
    data demands with better QoS. In [28], authors formulated the user-cell association
    problem as a utility maximization problem and developed a user association algorithm
    to solve it and to maximize network utility (i.e., throughput or data rate). A
    congestion game-based traffic balancing model was introduced in [29] in which
    a user is considered as the player and the decision of user association is the
    action. Furthermore, in [30], authors presented a game-theory based solution that
    utilizes a generic algorithm to associate users with BSs that have optimum allocatable
    resources. An extensive overview of various traffic balancing techniques in HetNets
    has been offered by the authors in [31]. Due to its flexibility and numerous benefits,
    SDR technology has attracted numerous researchers to adopt it in their research.
    For instance, in [32], the authors introduced an SDR-based cellular network architecture
    named SoftAir. The aim of this architecture is to effectively manage radio resources
    within the allocated licensed-spectrum to maximize the number of accommodated
    users. Further, in [33], the authors have proposed a platform based on SDR named
    5G-EmPOWER. The proposed platform was assessed by the authors in terms of mobility
    management and load balancing. The authors of [34] have developed an SDR-based
    control plan design called SoftRAN in which all BSs are abstracted in a single
    virtual BS consisting of a single central controller. The main target is to adapt
    to network dynamics in a timely and efficient manner without compromising throughput
    or other QoS metrics. Additionally, in [35], the authors have presented a novel
    SDN-based system, SODALITE, that can integrate with current 4G architectures and
    mitigate the cost and management complexity for small cells dense deployments.
    The above-mentioned solutions and algorithms, although efficiently balancing loads
    of traffic in order to magnify network utilities, did not take into consideration
    the utilization of green energy as a performance metric in the process of balancing
    traffic loads through the network. Almost all of the above-mentioned studies have
    focused on either magnifying the data rate, reducing overall power consumption,
    or adapting to network dynamics. However, from the network operator’s point of
    view, all of these are crucial components that influence operational expenditure
    (OPEX). Hence, by simply optimizing one metric, mobile operators cannot minimize
    their (OPEX) effectively. Accordingly, leveraging the spectrum-based cell zooming
    technique and LTE-LAA, we propose an SDR-based green traffic-steering framework
    that endeavors to minimize the overall network’s on-grid power consumption, maximize
    the aggregated throughput of all users, and adapt to extremely variable network
    dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly optimize
    both aggregated users throughput and on-grid power consumption using spectrum-based
    traffic steering, LTE-LAA, and SDR. It is worth highlighting that many network
    operators, vendors, and service providers have already established industry-driven
    organizations, such as Open Network Foundation (ONF) [36], Telecommunication Standards
    Sector (ITU-T) [37], and ETSI [38], to initiate and develop standards for SDR-oriented
    protocols and mechanisms. This is to overcome SDR-related technical challenges
    and promote the SDR technology [39]. For instance, ITU-T SG13 [40] focuses on
    SDR-based network mechanisms, access specifications, architecture, link-specific
    parameters, and communication protocols. These standards have been used by major
    telecommunications companies such as Huawei [41], Nokia [42], Qualcomm [43], and
    Ericsson [44]. As such, SDR is deemed to be a major enabling technology in next
    generation wireless networks. This paper presents how the SDR technology can complement
    the LTE-LAA system in achieving higher energy efficiency and good throughput.
    B. Problem Statement As discussed in previous sections, LTE-LAA based HetNets
    hold enormous potential for improving the performance of next generation networks.
    However, in existing LTE-LAA based HetNets, due to its current hardware-based
    architectural design, the opportunity to steer users to other BSs (e.g., LTE-LAA
    BSs, BSs belonging to other operators) is very limited. This can be overcome by
    deploying SDR-enabled BSs. Consequently, the research question becomes how to
    steer traffic/users to available BSs so that maximum throughput and minimum power
    consumption can be achieved. In this article, we introduce an architectural design
    approach that exploits the LTE-LAA technique, SDR technology, and the traffic
    steering technique. The carriers aggregation via the LTE-LAA SDR technique allows
    operators to extend their usable frequency ranges to other available bands and
    provide users with more carriers for higher throughput. The available renewable
    energy is utilized to process the BSs load to ease the pressure on the grid and
    minimizes on-grid power. The SDR technology allows users to be steered to nearby
    BSs, not only to their vendor’s BS. This saves more power for BSs that have edge-users
    to serve. SECTION III. The Proposed SDR-Based LTE-LAA Green Architecture and its
    Resource Management Scheme This section introduces a description of our spectrum-based
    traffic steering system model for a software defined radio-enabled heterogeneous
    network with hybrid energy supplies and unlicensed bands (LTE-LAA). This description
    consists of the network model, energy model, SDR-based BS communication model,
    and traffic model. In this article, our aim is to minimize the network’s on-grid
    power consumption along with maximizing overall network throughput. In order to
    achieve this goal, the number of SCBSs that need on-grid power to serve their
    users is minimized by steering their users to other SCBSs with abundant renewable
    energy using the spectrum-based cell zooming technique. However, steering the
    users should occur towards BSs that can provide a higher number of carriers (i.e.,
    throughput) for users to meet their traffic demands. For instance, as shown in
    Fig. 3, SCBS 1 has 1 unit of renewable energy (RE) and the power demand is 2 units
    to serve its users. Accordingly, the SCBS 1 needs to consume on-grid power to
    meet its demand and serve its users. Contrastingly, the SCBS 2 has 7 units of
    renewable energy and needs 3 units only to serve its users. Additionally, in terms
    of load capacity (C), SCBS 2 can still afford three more users and it has abundant
    carriers in the unlicensed band (UL) compared to SCBS 1. Hence, by exploiting
    LTE-LAA technology, it can offer more carriers (i.e., throughput) for its users.
    Thus, the controller server, which is updated with these details periodically,
    steers SCBS 1 users to SCBS 2 by using the spectrum-based cell zooming technique
    and switch SCBS 1 into sleep mode. This saves on-grid power consumption and provides
    users with a higher data rate which translates into higher throughput. Fig. 3.
    A scenario for the proposed spectrum-based traffic offloading. Show All A. Network
    Model The network architecture of our spectrum-based traffic steering system model
    is displayed in Fig. 4. The system is comprised of 3 macro base stations, multiple
    SDR-enabled small cell BSs (SCBSs), a controller sever, and a number of end users.
    We denote users’ set as J={ J 1 , J 2 , J 3 ,…, J N } indexed by j , and denote
    BSs’ set as I= I 1 ∪ I 2 indexed by i , where I 1 ={1,2,3…,m} represents the set
    of Macro BSs and I 2 ={1,2,3…,M} represents the set of small cell BSs. In our
    system model, small cell BSs are SDR-enabled and support spectrum-based cell zooming
    and the LTE-LAA technique where the carrier aggregation concept is utilized to
    combine LTE carriers from both unlicensed and licensed spectrum [45]. In our system
    model, each MBS belongs to a different service provider. Fig. 4. The spectrum-based
    cell zooming system model with a controller server that is responsible for steering
    users load, via the spectrum-based cell zooming, between solar-powered Macro BSs
    and SDR-enabled small cells in the area to achieve the optimum performance. Show
    All The distribution of the small cell BSs around MBSs is in alignment with spatial
    Poisson Point Process (PPP) and at a density of ε 0 , where ε 0 is the small cell
    BSs median number per unit area [22], [46]. Hence, the introduced system model
    presents a two-tier heterogeneous network where the SDR-enabled small cells are
    overlaid by the MBS. B. Application Categories Next-generation wireless networks
    are expected to serve a mixture of users with a diverse range of applications.
    Some of the applications (e.g., critical mission applications) can be adversely
    affected by traffic steering. In order to accommodate the application diversity,
    we consider the following application categories [47], [48]. Category One: this
    includes critical mission applications that are very time-sensitive and cannot
    afford any delay or error during transmission that might be caused during the
    steering process. Category Two: this includes strictly inelastic applications,
    where no extra resources are required beyond a certain amount of data rate. For
    instance, a phone needs a certain minimum data rate to translate a telephone call
    over a network. Consequently, no additional data rate is used/required beyond
    this data rate. Hence, no extra radio resources are required. Category Three:
    this includes strictly elastic applications, where these applications are not
    time-critical such as Internet browsing, social networking, and email applications.
    These applications have no minimum data rate. However, additional resources given
    by the network give users a better quality of experience (QoE). Category Four:
    this includes applications that have a minimum data rate and are based on video
    streaming, such as YouTube and video streaming applications. Unlike voice calls,
    an additional data rate provides greater enhancement and quality for these applications.
    For instance, instead of watching a poor quality movie, the user can stream the
    same movie with HD quality. In this paper, using the application index ϱ j , we
    have categorized user applications. The application index ϱ j takes any value
    from 0 to 1 (i.e., 0< ϱ j ≤1 ), where 0 represents the critical mission applications
    (i.e., category 1) and 1 represents applications in category four. C. Traffic-Steering
    and Sub-Carriers Aggregation Framework This section provides a detailed description
    of how our proposed traffic-steering framework utilizes the SDR and aggregates
    sub-carriers from both licensed and unlicensed spectrums. In our proposed traffic-steering
    framework, the SCBSs sweep the spectral environment regularly to generate and
    update three lists ( L 0 , L 1 , and L 2 ). L 0 consists of idle/unused bands
    in the licensed spectrum. L 1 consists of idle/unused bands in unlicensed spectrums
    in their area of coverage. L 2 contains a list of channels occupied by their nearby
    users. Subsequently, SCBSs forward these lists along with their green energy reserves,
    user application categories, and traffic loads to the controller server, which
    is connected to all BSs through high-speed fiber cables as shown in Fig. 4. Using
    L 0 , the controller server can estimate the total minimum throughput that each
    BS can provide. Using L 1 , the server can calculate the additional throughput
    that each BS can provide to its users through the unlicensed bands. L 2 represents
    the potential traffic that can be steered toward the small cell BSs, using the
    spectrum-based cell zooming technique. Consequently, based on these details, the
    controller server steers users towards the SCBSs that have abundant green energy
    and a high number of unlicensed subcarriers, to minimize on-grid power consumption
    and provide higher throughput to users. The controller server exploits L 0 and
    L 1 to accommodate user demands and conducts carrier aggregation (CA) for the
    LTE-LAA technique. According to the LTE-LAA standard [49], control information
    and signals are sent through the licensed band (i.e., through the radio resources
    in L 0 ) and data flows through the unlicensed band (i.e., through the radio resources
    in L 1 ). Hence, to maintain users’ connectivity to the SCBS, the controller server
    allocates at least a single radio resource (i.e., carrier) from L 0 . However,
    when the controller server assigns radio resources (i.e., carriers) to users from
    L 1 , it attempts to optimize the utilization of available resources depending
    on the category of users’ applications and user demands. Accordingly, the number
    of aggregated carriers that the controller server allocates to each user, from
    L 1 , differs from one user to another depending on the application index ϱ j
    , which reflects the application category of user j . In this context, SDR technology
    plays a key role in providing SCBSs with the ability and capability to regularly
    adjust their transmission parameters to be able to swap radio resources between
    their users to accommodate user needs. It is worth noting that the inter-cell
    interference is mitigated by the controller server when allocating subcarriers
    to BSs, via accurate frequency planning, where the server has a comprehensive
    knowledge of users and BSs locations. Finally, based on the above-mentioned framework
    and received data from small cell BSs, the controller server can determine the
    best user-BS association combination that minimizes overall power consumption
    and maximizes overall network throughput. Accordingly, it generates Π that contains
    the optimum user-BS association matrix along with the number of users’ allocated
    carriers and notifies the SDR-enabled BSs to act accordingly. D. SDR-Based Base
    Stations Communication Model We denote the power of transmission for the BS i
    towards user j at location x as P ij , and the channel gain between both of them
    as g ij (x) . In general, antenna gain, shadowing, and path loss are included
    in g ij (x) . σ 2 denotes the noise power. B i represents the BSs’ set that interfere
    with i th BS’s transmission. B z (x) is the average interference value detected
    by the user at location x from z th BS [50], [51]. Consequently, the signal to
    interference plus noise ratio (SINR) can be expressed as: SIN R ij (x)= P ij ⋅
    g ij (x) ∑ k∈ B i B z (x)+ σ 2 (1) View Source In this paper, we utilize the highest
    throughput channel-state approach, in which the modulation and coding scheme (MCS)
    is adjustable according to the channel attenuation factor γ [52]. This approach
    guarantees the highest throughput by adapting the MCS in accordance with the SINR
    [53]. Consequently, the maximum achievable down-link data rate from the BS i toward
    user j at location x , based on channel condition, can be expressed as: R max
    ij (x)= N(x)⋅ R w ⋅lo g 2 (Θ) T fr (2) View Source where N ( x ) is expressed
    as: N(x)=( N j lc (x)+ ϱ j N j ulc (x))⋅ N symb ⋅ P fr (x) (3) View Source where
    N j lc (x) and N j ulc (x) represents the total number of allocated licensed and
    unlicensed sub-carriers at location x , respectively, to the user j . ϱ j represents
    the application category of user j . ϱ j N j ulc (x) represents that portion of
    unlicensed sub-carriers allocated to user j based on his application category.
    N symb is the total number of symbols, R w denotes the code rate of the used MCS,
    Θ represents the modulation order, P fr (x) denotes the probability of receiving
    an error-free data block at location x , and the frame time duration is represented
    by T fr . Consequently, and according to Shannon theorem, when user j at location
    x is assigned to BS i , the allocated bandwidth can be calculated as follows;
    W ij (x)= R max ij (x) lo g 2 (1+SIN R ij (x)) . (4) View Source E. Traffic Model
    Each user’s traffic, from location x , is assumed to arrive at the BS i with an
    arrival rate of λ j (x) and in line with a Poisson Process. The traffic flow lengths
    have an average value of l j . Accordingly, user j creates an average traffic
    density in BS i equals to δ i (x)= λ j (x)⋅ ρ i (x)⋅ μ ij (x) (5) View Source
    where ρ ( x ) i represents the service rate that BS i provides at location x and
    is expressed as: ρ i (x)= R max ij (x) l j (6) View Source where μ ij is a binary
    decision-variable and takes a value as follows μ ij (x)={ 1 0  if user j is connected
    to BS i  otherwise (7) View Source By consolidating all traffic densities for
    all users who are connected to BS i and distributed across a coverage area of
    A , we can calculate the BS’s traffic load density. Hence, it can be expressed
    as Γ i = ∫ x∈A δ i (x)dx (8) View Source The BS recognizes a sharing queue of
    type an M/G/1 process because the arrival rate of users’ traffic λ j is in accordance
    to the Poisson Process (PP) and traffic load service time for each user imitate
    the general distribution [54]. In such a sharing queue, the average service time
    for user j at location x can be calculated as [55]: T ij (x)= l j R max ij (x)⋅(1−
    Γ i ) (9) View Source However, the throughput for each user is expressed as [56]:
    R t ij (x)= R max ij (x)⋅(1− Γ i ) (10) View Source where R t ij is the throughput
    of user j when it is connected to BS i . Accordingly, BS i ’s total throughput
    is calculated as: α i = ∑ j∈J R t ij (x). (11) View Source F. Energy Model In
    our spectrum-based cell zooming technique, utilizing SDR technology, BSs change
    their pilots’ signal frequency every τ seconds to zoom in/out upon the controller
    server instruction over a period of time that consists of T updates. The controller
    server associates user j at location x to the BS i by requesting the BS to use
    its SDR capabilities to change their pilots signal strength which can be expressed,
    as per Friis transmission formula, as follows: P t ij (x)= P r ij (x)⋅ (4⋅π⋅d(x)⋅
    F o k,n ) 2 G t ⋅ G r ⋅ c 2 (12) View Source where G t , G r , and c are the BS
    transmitter antenna gain, user equipment (UE) receiver antenna gain, and speed
    of light respectively. Distance between the BS and location x is d ( x ). F o
    k,n denotes the pilots signal’s frequency at k th update. Let the pilot signal’s
    power at k th update P k → =( p k,1 , p k,2 , p k,3 ⋯ p k,M ) correspond to pilot
    signal frequencies F k → =( f k,1 , f k,2 , f k,3 ⋯ f i,M ) . Accordingly, the
    users-BSs assignment matrix at the k th update is determined by P k → as follows;
    μ k (i,j)={ 1 0  if user j is connected to BS i  otherwise (13) View Source Then,
    the power consumption of BS i at k th update can be formulated as P k,i = ∑ j=1
    N μ k (j,i)⋅ P t ij + P fix k,i ⋅ y k,i (14) View Source where the BS’s power
    consumption contains two parts: the dynamic power consumption presented by the
    first term and the static one P fix k,i represents the amount of power that is
    required to maintain the BS active with no traffic being processed. y k,i equals
    to 1 if at least one user is assigned to the BS i at k th update and 0 otherwise.
    Hence, it can be formulated as follows y k,i ={ 1 0  ∑ N j=1 μ k (j,i)>0  otherwise
    (15) View Source Assume that the solar power stored amount at BS i at k th update
    is S k,i . This amount depends on the amount of generated and consumed power in
    the previous update. Hence, S k,i can be expressed as S k,i ={ S k−1,i − P k−1,i
    +γ S k−1,i +γ  S k−1,i ≥ P k−1,i  otherwise (16) View Source where γ is the solar
    power generated from the solar cell. By assuming P 0,i as the initial value of
    solar power and the generation rate does not change over the duration T , then
    P on−grid i can be expressed as P on−grid k,i ={ 0 P k,i  S k,i ≥ P k,i  otherwise.
    (17) View Source G. Problem Formulation As shown in Fig. 4, the BSs are equipped
    with hybrid power supplies (i.e., solar panels and public grid supplies). As a
    result of the spatial and temporal dynamics of solar energy generation between
    various BSs and the location of BSs, some BSs’ power demands can be met by their
    renewable energy and others have to rely on the on-grid power supplies to process
    their traffic loads. Accordingly, to fully exploit the available renewable energy,
    users should always be steered to the BSs with abundant renewable energy. Hence,
    the BS i ’s on-grid power consumption can be formulated as: P on−grid k,i =max(
    P k,i − P r k,i ,0) (18) View Source where P i is the total power consumption,
    P on−grid i and p r i represent the BS i ’s on-grid power consumption and solar
    energy generation rate, respectively. In deciding user-BS associations, the steering
    scheme aims to achieve two key targets. Firstly, decreasing BSs’ on-grid power
    consumption. Secondly, to boost the total throughput of the network. For the power
    part, users can be steered in a way that maximizes the utilization of BSs’ available
    solar energy. For the throughput part, driven by the concept of carrier aggregation
    and the LTE-LAA technology, small cell BSs can allocate more sub-carriers, from
    the licensed and unlicensed spectrum, to users to boost their throughput and hence
    boost networks’ overall throughput. Therefore, users should be steered to the
    BSs that have more sub-carriers. Considering both of the above-mentioned targets,
    the steering decisions are based on the total throughput and total on-grid power
    consumption and hence can be formulated as a network utility as follows: z=a⋅
    1 D ⋅ ∑ k∈T ∑ i∈I ∑ j∈J R tk ij −b⋅ 1 E ⋅ ∑ k∈T ∑ i∈I p on−grid k,i (19) View
    Source where D and E are the normalization factors for throughput and power consumption,
    respectively. D represents the maximum achievable network throughput of the system
    as depicted in Fig. 4. E represents the maximum total on-grid power consumption
    of the network. The first term in equation (19) represents the normalized network
    throughput and the second term represents the normalized on-grid power consumption.
    In the objective function, the coefficient associated with the normalized network
    throughput is represented by a while b represents the coefficient for the normalized
    on-grid power consumption. These coefficients are provided/adjusted by the network
    operator according to their operational requirements. A higher value of a allows
    users to be associated with SCBSs with more available carriers whereas a higher
    value of b allows users to be associated with SCBSs with abundant green energy.
    Accordingly, the steering objective function z is written as follows: maximize
    subject to z C1 :  ∑ i=1 I μ ij ≤1,∀j∈J C2 :  ∑ i=1 I P r i ≥ P th i ,∀i∈I C3
    :  P k,i ≤ P i max ,∀k∈T; ∀i∈I C4 :  μ ij ⋅SIN R ij ≥SIN R ijmin ,∀j∈J C5 :  ∑
    j=1 J R t ij ≤ α i ∀i∈I C6 : 0< ϱ j ≤1∀j∈J C7 : 0< ∑ j=1 J ϱ j ⋅ N i ulc ≤ Υ i
    ∀i∈I (20) View Source where, C1 ensures that a user can only be allocated to only
    one BS. C2 ensures that only BSs who have available solar energy amount over a
    specific threshold should be allowed to receive the steered users and process
    their traffic loads. C3 expresses that, at any time k , BS transmit power needed
    to steer any user must not exceed the maximum transmission power, P i max , that
    BS i can afford based on its available power supplies to maintain stable communication.
    C4 ensures that SINR recognized by each user is higher than a threshold, SIN R
    ijmin , for better seamless communication between users and BS. C5 ensures that
    total traffic loads at BS i is less than or equal to the total BS capacity ( α
    i ). C6 ensures that users with critical mission applications are excluded from
    the steering procedures. C7 ensures that the number of allocated unlicensed-carriers
    to a user does not exceed the available unlicensed carriers at each BS. Here,

    for networks that cover great areas with an enormous number of BS and users, we
    prove that it is an NP-hard problem and propose a heuristic solution. Algorithm

    number (24) can be considered as NP hard problem Proof:Assume that two BSs are
    located at a specific point and the capacity of each BS is infinity with SINR
    threshold equal to zero. Thus, all users can be steered to any of them without
    violating any constraint. Additionally, if solar energy generation rate is the
    same for each of them, let us assume it equals to G , and the required network
    power to process the traffic equals to the solar energy, then the problem can
    be expressed as: min subject to ∑ i=1 2 max( P i −G,0) ∑ i=1 2 P i =2G (22) (23)
    View Source Hence, the optimal solution for the above-mentioned optimization problem,
    which minimizes the power consummation of the on-grid type, is to allocate loads
    into both of the BSs equally. In other words, it becomes a partition problem,
    which is considered as an NP-hard problem [54]. Accordingly, this optimization
    problem is an NP-Hard one. H. Heuristic Solution In order to alleviate the computational
    complexity of the optimal solution, we present a heuristic-based algorithm. Our
    proposed algorithm considers both on-grid power consumption and overall network
    throughput. Accordingly, the user’s utility can be formulated as follows: z ij
    =a⋅ 1 D ⋅ R t ij −b⋅ 1 E ⋅ p on−grid ki (24) View Source The controller sever,
    which has an overview regarding all BSs and their status in terms of traffic loads,
    solar energy generation rate, and available size of unlicensed/licensed spectrum,
    executes Algorithm 1 in order to steer the traffic loads to BSs with high renewable
    energy generation rate and more unlicensed/licensed spectrum availability to be
    able to maximize the overall network throughput and minimize network on-grid power
    consumption. As shown in Algorithm 1, the proposed algorithm begins with a preliminary
    users-BSs association matrix, a flag F equals to zero, and all users are set to
    be members of a group j ′ named unmarked. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm
    iteratively adapts the association matrix to reduce the network’s consumption
    of the on-grid power via steering traffic loads to BSs with abundant solar energy
    and higher available bandwidth (i.e., BS with a high number of licensed and unlicensed
    sub-carriers). During each iteration, the proposed algorithm locates the BS with
    the highest on-grid power consumption i ∗ . Thereafter, the algorithm finds, within
    BS i ∗ , the unmarked user that requires the highest transmission power to be
    serviced j ∗ and steer the user to a new BS that can serve the user using less
    on-grid power and yet increase the overall network utility. In case a BS is found,
    the algorithm allocates the user to that BS and starts the new iteration. Alternatively,
    it marks the user and starts the new iteration until all users are marked and
    then it terminates. Algorithm 2 tries to locate the best BS for user j ∗ . Thus,
    the algorithm finds the BSs that surround user j ∗ , and sort them in descending
    order in terms of their utility. Thereafter, the algorithm checks them in order.
    If a BS is found, the user is allocated to it and the algorithm updates the matrix.
    The last step is to mark the BS to avoid the computational complexity problem.

    the algorithm checks if the total on-grid power consumption, after connecting
    the user to the new BS, is less than the current one or not. If yes, is the overall
    new network utility is higher than the current one or not. If yes, then the BS
    is a suitable one. Otherwise, the algorithm locates the unmarked users in the
    new BS and checks if they can be re-allocated to another BS to alleviate the traffic
    load in this BS. Hence, there is a better chance for the user j ∗ to be assigned
    to the BS. Algorithm 3 ( Π ^ ,F)=suitability_check i ∗ ,Π, z t ) 1: Set F = 0

    Complexity Analysis In this section, we investigate the computational complexity
    of our proposed heuristic. In Algorithm 1, we start with a preliminary users-BSs
    association, a flag F equals to zero, and all users are set to be members of a
    group j ′ named unmarked. Then, we find the BS with the highest P on−grid from
    the M BSs, and in this BS i ∗ , we need to find the user j ∗ , from N/M users
    connected to this BS, that requires max transmission power to be serviced. Hence,
    computational complexity, up to this stage, is O ( M+ ( N/M )). Consequently,
    using Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3, this user is steered to a new BS that can serve
    him using less on-grid power and yet increases the overall network utility to
    meet the objective function. As mentioned previously, Algorithm 2 tries to locate
    the best BS for user j ∗ , and the algorithm has one finding procedure, one sorting
    procedure, and one for-loop procedure. However, it uses other procedures in Algorithm
    3 to check the suitability of the new BS. Algorithm 3 has one finding procedure
    and one for solution. Hence, the computational complexity of both Algorithm 2
    and Algorithm 3 can be expressed as O ( 2M+M log M ) and O( N 2 ) , respectively.
    Finally, assuming that the heuristic searches all users and BSs in the worst case
    scenario, the complexity of the whole heuristic can be expressed as O( N 3 M 2
    Log(N+M)) , where M represents the BSs number and N represents the users number.
    Accordingly, our heuristic algorithm is the type of pesudo polynomial time algorithm.
    SECTION IV. Simulation Results and Discussion To benchmark our proposed approach,
    we implemented a hypothetical deployment shown in Fig. 5 which shows our system
    model in the business district area of Perth. The hypothetical deployment was
    implemented in MATLAB R2015b with the simulation parameters listed in Table I.
    We made comparisons between our proposed approach and best SINR user-BS association
    approach, named as Best-SINR [57], and also with load aware users-BS association
    approach proposed in [58]. In the best SINR approach, users are allocated to the
    BSs with the strongest SINR. In the load-aware approach, users are allocated to
    lightly loaded BSs. TABLE I Parameters Used in the Simulation [2], [54], [59],
    [60] Fig. 5. Hypothetical SDR-based system deployment - Perth, Western Australia.
    Show All As shown in Fig. 5, our simulation model consists of 3 macro BSs and
    9 SDR-enabled BSs. The macro BSs have a radius of 1000 m and SDR-enabled BSs have
    a radius of 200 m [61]. In our simulation model, all SDR-enabled BSs (i.e., small
    cells) have a circular shape coverage, and are uniformly distributed across the
    coverage area. All BSs allocate/distribute the resource blocks of a component
    carrier (CC) equally across CC’s users [62], [60]. The users’ arrival was presumed
    to follow the Poisson Process [54]. Additionally, we adopted the COST 231 Walfisch
    Ikegami [63] as our propagation model with 5 dB shadowing fading and 9 dB Raleigh
    fading [64]. We presumed a standard condition for the weather with a temperature
    of 24 °C and an air mass of 1.5 [64]. In our simulation, the green-energy generation
    rate depended on the size of BSs’ solar panels, listed in Table I. Furthermore,
    all BSs were assumed to be equipped with a Radio Remote Head (RRH) unit attached
    to their antenna via fiber optic link to produce zero feeder loss. The controller
    server had a comprehensive knowledge of users and BS locations and is responsible
    for allocating subcarriers to cells via adequate frequency planning to mitigate
    the inter-cell interference challenge [12], [32], [54]. Thus, the interference
    between all BSs and the inter-cell interference were well controlled/managed by
    the controller server. In our simulation, the coefficients associated with the
    network throughput and power consumption in the objective function of the optimization
    model were set as one (i.e., unbiased). The normalization factors used for normalizing
    the on-grid power and user throughput were 5320 watt and 2350 Mbps, respectively.
    Fig. 6 shows a comparison between our proposed approach SBTS and the other approaches
    (i.e., LAUA and Best SINR) in terms of total network on-grid power consumption
    and user numbers influence on it. The vertical axis in Fig. 6 shows the instantaneous
    power consumption that is required to accommodate the varying number of corresponding
    users presented along the X-axis. Based on the results shown in Fig. 6, it is
    evident that our proposed approach required less on-grid power compared to the
    other two approaches. This occurs because, as the number of users grows, our proposed
    approach always aims to alleviate on-grid power consumption by steering users
    from overloaded BSs toward BSs that have abundant solar energy to optimize the
    usage of existing green-energy resources. However, unlike our proposed approach,
    the Best SINR approach and the LAUA approach associate users to BSs that have
    pilot signals with the best SINR, irrespective of the amount of green-energy available
    at these BSs. This results in a situation where some BSs become overloaded with
    users, where green-energy alone cannot power these BSs, hence more on-grid power
    is required. Fig. 6. On-grid power consumption. Show All Fig. 7 compares the total
    network throughput of the three different approaches (i.e., our proposed approach,
    Best SINR, LAUA) with a different number of users. From Fig. 7, it is evident
    that our proposed approach presents a higher total network throughput. Due to
    the utilization of carrier aggregation concept, our SDR-LTE-LAA-enabled BSs can
    allocate sub-carriers to users from both licensed and unlicensed bands (i.e.,
    more resource blocks). As a result, our proposed approach steers users towards
    BSs that have a higher number of sub-carriers in order to optimize the usage of
    available sub-carrier resources in the network. This leads to more resource blocks
    allocation per user and this maximizes user throughput. However, in the other
    two approaches, users are either allocated to the BS that has the highest SINR
    or to those that are lightly loaded, irrespective of the available number of sub-carriers.
    This leads to some BSs becoming congested with users which degrades user throughputs
    at these BSs. Fig. 7. Total network throughput. Show All Fig. 8 compares the total
    power consumption in the three approaches accounting for a different number of
    users. It is apparent, in the figure, that our proposed approach consumes less
    power, compared to the other approaches, whilst serving the same number of users.
    In other words, from Fig. 8, it is evident that our proposed approach is more
    energy-efficient than the other approaches. This power reduction happens because
    our proposed approach, in meeting its objective function (i.e., Eq (24)), tends
    to steer users towards SDR-LTE-LAA enabled BSs which consume less power, compared
    to Macro BSs. It also provides higher throughput owing to the LTE-LAA technology.
    Thus, in our proposed approach, the majority of users are served by low-power
    SDR-LTE-LAA enabled BSs. On the other hand, the other approaches tend to allocate
    users to BSs with the highest SINR, which in many cases are Macro BSs. This results
    in more users being served by high-power Macro BSs. Hence, less total power is
    consumed in our approach. Fig. 8. Total power consumption. Show All Fig. 9 shows
    the total on-grid power consumption under different green energy generation rates.
    The figure also compares on-grid power consumption in the case where users are
    assigned to BSs based on the best SINR approach, load of the BS, and our proposed
    approach. From Fig. 9, it is evident that, for all approaches, increasing green
    energy generation rate decreases on-grid power consumption because BSs can now
    rely more on green energy to process their traffic loads. However, unlike the
    best SINR and load aware approach, our proposed approach offers lower on-grid
    power consumption, as it steers users in a way that can balance user loads between
    BSs according to BSs’ available green energy amounts. This leads to less on-grid
    power consumption. Moreover, in case of utilizing the sleep mode, in which BSs
    without any loads are put into sleep mode, the amount of on-grid power will be
    even lower. Fig. 9. Total on-grid power consumption with different green energy
    rate. Show All Fig. 10 illustrates the total on-grid power consumption costs per
    hour under different green energy generation rates and compares the cost values
    of the three different approaches. It is worth noting that the 1 kilowatt-hour
    (kWh) cost is 28.8229 cent, as per Perth’s electricity company, Synergy [65].
    As shown in Fig. 10, our approach costs less compared to the other two approaches
    as our proposed approach tends to steer users towards the SCBSs with a larger
    amount of green energy to minimize on-grid power consumption. However, the other
    two approaches tend to allocate users to BSs with the strongest SINR or their
    traffic load, irrespective of the BSs’ green energy available amounts. This proves
    that our proposed approach can reduce the operators’ OPEX by alleviating the network’s
    on-grid power. Fig. 10. Total on-grid power consumption costs with different green
    energy rate. Show All Fig. 11 presents a comparison of the overall utilization
    of the network’s allocated spectrum with a different number of users. From Fig.
    11, it is evident that our proposed approach increases the utilization of the
    network’s allocated spectrum. Due to the utilization of our traffic steering technique,
    users are offloaded to those BSs with unused spectrums and abundant green energy
    available. This balances the users’ loads between BSs and increases the overall
    utilization of the network’s spectrum. Unlike our proposed approach, other approaches
    (i.e., load-aware and best SINR) allocate users to the BS that have either a lighter
    load or best SINR. This results in some BSs becoming overloaded and other BSs
    having no loads at all. This has severe implications on network spectrum utilization.
    Fig. 11. Overall network’s allocated-spectrum utilization. Show All In order to
    benchmark the benefit of utilizing the traffic steering concept and LTE-LAA technology,
    we measured the average overall network throughput for our network under different
    strategies: No traffic steering, with traffic steering, and with traffic steering
    plus LTE-LAA. Fig. 12 shows the obtained results for these scenarios with different
    numbers of users. Based on the results in Fig. 12, it is apparent that utilizing
    traffic steering along with LTE-LAA technology maximizes the overall network throughput.
    This is because our traffic steering approach steers the users to BSs with a high
    number of available sub-carriers for higher throughput and the LTE-LAA adds even
    more carriers from the unlicensed band to increase user throughput even more by
    extending the sub-carriers frequency range to the unlicensed bands. Fig. 12. Average
    overall network throughput. Show All Fig. 13 displays the impact of unlicensed
    carriers’ availability on the average power consumption per macro BS (MBS). Additionally,
    it shows this impact under a different number of small cell BS (SCBS) per Macro
    BS (i.e., 2, 4, 6). From Fig. 13, it is evident that increasing the number of
    sub-carriers in the unlicensed band at small cell BSs, has a genuine impact on
    power consumption per macro base station. High unlicensed band availability means
    more sub-carriers can be utilized in this band and hence more sub-carriers are
    allocatable to users. Thus, our proposed algorithm steers users toward these SCBSs
    instead of Macro BSs leading in less load at the MBS and consequently less power
    consumption. Further, as shown in Fig. 13, increasing the number of SCBSs, decreases
    the MB’s power consumption. This occurs because increasing the number of SCBSs,
    increases the number of options that our algorithm can steer users to owing to
    their LTE-LAA and SDR operability, SCBSs can provide users with a larger number
    of carriers. Thus, our algorithm always tends to steer users away from the MBS
    and towards SCBSs. This alleviates, even more, the load on MBSs and saves their
    power. Fig. 13. The impact of unlicensed carriers availability on the macro BS’s
    power consumption. Show All Fig. 14 presents the impact of the number of small
    cell BSs per Macro BS on the utilization of the network’s allocated-spectrum.
    Additionally, it presents a comparison of this impact under three different scenarios:
    no traffic steering, with traffic steering, and with traffic steering plus LTE-LAA.
    From Fig. 14, owing to the configuration flexibility of the SDR-enabled BSs, it
    is apparent that increasing the number of SDR-enabled BSs per macro BS increases
    the utilization of the allocated network spectrum. This occurs because the controller
    server can detect which bands are not used and re-allocate them to the SCBSs which
    adapt accordingly, using SDR technology. Moreover, Fig. 14 shows that this utilization
    percentage increases by using our proposed traffic steering algorithm along with
    the LTE-LAA technology. Our traffic steering algorithm balances the user loads
    between BSs and the LTE-LAA technology allows BSs, using carriers aggregation
    concept, to exploit all idle bands in the allocated licensed spectrum along with
    the unlicensed spectrum. Fig. 14. The impact of number of SCBS per MBS on the
    network spectrum utilization. Show All Fig. 15 presents the impact of the number
    of small cell BSs per Macro BS on the saved amount of on-grid power per macro
    BS. Additionally, it presents a comparison of this impact in three different scenarios:
    no traffic steering, with traffic steering, and with traffic steering plus LTE-LAA.
    From Fig. 15, it is evident that increasing the number of SDR-enabled BSs per
    macro BS increases saved on-grid power per MBS. This happens because the controller
    server can detect which bands users are using while communicating with MBS and
    re-allocate them to the SCBSs, exploiting their SDR capabilities, and steers users,
    leaving MBSs, to these SCBSs which already consume less power than MBS. Hence,
    having more SCBSs means more users are steered to them and steered away from MBSs.
    Thus, more on-grid power is saved per MBS. Fig. 15. The impact of number of SCBS
    per MBS on the saved on-grid power per Macro BS. Show All In addition, Fig. 15
    shows a comparison of the impact on this amount of saved power in case of using
    our proposed traffic steering algorithm along with the LTE-LAA technology and
    in case of not using it. From Fig. 15, it is evident that our traffic steering
    algorithm saves more power. This is because our proposed approach balances user
    loads between the BSs according to their solar energy amount and the LTE-LAA technology
    allows the BSs, using carriers aggregation concept, to exploit all idle bands
    in the allocated licensed spectrum along with the unlicensed spectrum. In this
    article, we have investigated the impact of changing users’ application categories
    on total power consumption and total throughput. Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 show this
    impact, respectively. Additionally, while the total number of users is set at
    100, the two figures compare this impact using our proposed approach and the other
    two approaches (i.e., LAUA and best SINR). Fig. 16. Application categories impact
    on total power consumption. Show All Fig. 17. Application categories impact on
    total throughput. Show All In the above two figures, Category 2 Apps represents
    inelastic applications (e.g., voice calls). Category 3 Apps represent applications
    that have no minimum data rate requirement, but higher data rates provide better
    quality of experience for these applications, for example, Internet browsing,
    social networking, and email applications. Category 4 Apps represent data-hungry
    applications that require a minimum data rate to ensure quality of service (e.g.,
    YouTube, Video streaming). From Fig. 16, it is evident that our proposed approach
    consumes less power compared to these other approaches. This occurs because as
    our proposed approach steers users to SCBSs it can provide the optimum number
    of carriers according to user’s application categories, whilst alleviating on-grid
    power consumption by steering users from overloaded BSs toward BSs that have abundant
    solar energy to optimize the usage of existing green-energy resources. Unlike
    our proposed approach, the Best SINR approach and the LAUA approach disregard
    the green-energy factor and simply steer users to BSs that have the best SINR,
    which leads to some BSs becoming overloaded with users and requiring more power
    to serve users. From Fig. 17, it is evident that our proposed approach achieves
    higher throughput compared to the other approaches. This occurs in our approach
    as the controller server tends to steer users to BSs that can offer more carriers
    to their users. However, unlike our proposed approach, the other approaches tend
    to steer users to BSs with higher SINR, irrespective of the number of available
    carriers at these stations. This results in less throughput compared to our approach.
    In addition, it is noticeable from Fig. 17 that our proposed approach provides
    higher throughput for category 3 applications, compared to the other approaches.
    This is because our approach, unlike the other approaches, provides a higher number
    of carriers for these typed of data-hungry applications. We also investigated
    the performance of our proposed approach without considering the different application
    categories, discussed in the Section III-B. Fig. 18 shows that when the traffic
    steering process is influenced by the category an application belongs to, the
    total throughput of the system increases. This occurs because classifying applications
    into various categories in our model tends to steer users requiring higher data
    rates to BSs that have a higher number of carriers, which ultimately leads to
    higher throughput. Fig. 18. Performance with and without considering different
    application categories data requirements. Show All Figures 19(a) and 19(b) present
    a comparison between our heuristic and the ILP solution, generated using CPLEX,
    in terms of overall network throughput and total power consumption. The maximum
    achievable throughput with several numbers of users is presented in Fig. 7. Based
    on the results in Fig. 19(a), it is apparent that our proposed heuristic provides
    marginally lower throughput than ILP with a difference within the range of 5%
    to 7% and accuracy up to 93%. Accordingly, it can be used to attain near-optimal
    results. Fig. 19(b) illustrates the total power consumption with a various number
    of users. Based on the results in Fig. 19(b), it is notable that our proposed
    heuristic consumes slightly higher power than the ILP with a difference within
    the range of 4.5% to 8% and accuracy up to 92%. Hence, our heuristic can be exploited
    to attain near-optimal results. Fig. 19. Heuristic simulation results: (a) a data
    rate comparison between the optimum results and our heuristic results (b) a power
    consumption comparison between the optimum results and our heuristic results.
    Show All A summary of our work findings is listed in Table II. Moreover, it presents
    a comparison between our proposed approach and other approaches. As shown in Table
    II, our proposed SDR-enabled and spectrum-based approach consumes lower power,
    by up to 15%, compared with the other approaches. Furthermore, our LTE-LAA supported
    approach achieves higher throughput for users and, hence, for the whole network,
    by up to 23%. TABLE II Summary of the Findings Owing to the carrier aggregation
    concept and our spectrum-based traffic steering mechanism, our proposed approach
    is able to aggregate more carriers, from different bands, and allocate them to
    users to achieve higher throughput. Following such a strategy increases the utilization
    of the allocated network spectrum and allows the SDR-enabled BSs, with the help
    of the controller server, to exploit idle bands of idle BSs. Accordingly, unlike
    the other approaches, Table II shows that our proposed approach has the highest
    spectrum utilization. During the process of performance evaluation for our proposed
    approach, we checked the impact of utilizing SDR and LTE-LAA technologies on overall
    system performance in terms of power consumption and total throughput. As shown
    in Table II the utilization of unlicensed bans increases the total throughput
    and allows our proposed algorithm to steer users to the SCBSs, leaving Macro BSs,
    for higher throughput and less Macro BSs power consumption. SECTION V. Conclusion
    In this article, exploiting the spectrum-based cell zooming technique for traffic
    steering, we presented a flexible software defined radio (SDR)-based architecture
    for heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The proposed architecture utilizes green
    energy and long-term evolution licensed assisted access (LTE-LAA) along with SDR
    technology to promptly adapt to ever-changing network dynamics to minimize the
    total grid power consumption and maximize user throughput. The relevant resource
    management problem was formulated as a constrained optimization problem. The solution
    was found to surpass other current approaches by considerable margins. As illustrated
    in Table II, our presented approach consumed up to 15% less power. Additionally,
    it also provides up to 23% higher throughput compared with the other approaches.
    Moreover, in terms of allocated spectrum utilization, our proposed approach achieves
    higher utilization than others. We showed that the problem of optimization to
    be an NP-hard and to reduce the time complexity, we introduced a heuristic solution
    that was found to achieve a good near-optimal solution. Authors Figures References

    Introduction Next generation wireless networks will be characterized by larger
    volume, faster information transfer, and diversity. Wireless industry has been
    altering conventional license-based spectrum access policies through approaches
    utilizing unlicensed spectrum. This leads to dynamic spectrum access (DSA), where
    unlicensed use of a spectrum should avoid harm to licensed users, or should ensure
    a fair share of spectrum with other unlicensed users. DSA places an additional
    burden on business operations because revenue needs to be generated over dynamically
    changing resources, while providing expected quality of service to potential users.
    To address the challenges of spectrum, pricing, and privacy in the next-generation
    DSA solutions, it is necessary to utilize testbed capable of emulating realistic
    networks to model the complex behaviors of radio networks and environments. Meanwhile,
    as today’s Internet of Things applications bring new requirements to the evolving
    wireless standards, tomorrow’s advanced use cases will derive these innovations
    through Internet of Advanced Things. Heterogeneous wireless technologies in public
    safety, infrastructure, smart agriculture, and rural broadband connectivity require
    a seamless wireless continuum across underground and over-the-air and urban and
    rural settings to bridge the digital divide. As a result, a variety of environmental
    configurations and experimental tools are required, which would be burdensome
    and sometimes prohibitive for many researchers to build. Open testbeds [1], [2],
    [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] would facilitate innovations by providing researchers
    experimental platforms. Moreover, the emergence of data-driven wireless technologies,
    such as Radio Frequency Machine Learning (RFML), are shifting the ways of work
    towards ones that emphasize realistic radio environments, standardized and/or
    open datasets for repeatability, and intense computations. RFML is envisioned
    to replicate the success of deep learning in computer vision in which rapid advancements
    are achieved from repeatable and comparable experiments based on open datasets.
    To facilitate researches in RFML, testbeds need to have realistic radio environments,
    standardized experimental configurations, reusable datasets, as well as advanced
    computational resources. To address aforementioned requirements, a city-wide testbed,
    Cognitive Secure Cloud-Radio Access Network (CoSeC-RAN), is developed through
    the collaboration with the City of Lincoln. CoSeC-RAN covers 1.1 square miles
    across two campuses of University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a public street in the
    city of Lincoln. It contains 5 high-end software-defined distribution units (SD-DUs)
    at the edge of Cloud-Radio Access Networks (C-RAN). Each SD-DU is equipped a sub-6
    GHz Software-Defined Radio (SDR) transceiver and a 4 × 4 MIMO antenna array and
    connected to cloud-based central unit via 20Gbps fronthaul network. Additionally,
    two SD-DUs are equipped with underground (UG) MIMO antennas for researches of
    underground wireless sensors. The CoSeC-RAN has rich computational resources.
    High performance computing clusters with arrays of Central Processing Units (CPUs)
    and Graphics processing units (GPUs) are provided by the cloud at Holland Computing
    Center (HCC) [8], Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are available at the
    SD-DUs (edge) and fronthaul network. Projects at various scales and stages could
    be supported by a variety of general cloud computing resources, such as dedicated
    virtual machine and computing clusters. 2. Related work Notable early initiatives
    of cognitive radio testbeds include ORBIT testbed [2] from Rutgers University,
    WARP platform [9] from Rice University, and CORNET [3] and LTE-CORNET [4] from
    Virginia Tech. The ORBIT consists of an indoor radio grid with 400 nodes supplemented
    by a number of outdoor and vehicular nodes deployed on or around the Rutgers campus
    for end-user evaluations in real-world settings. The nodes include WiFi, Zigbee,
    WiMAX and SDR radios USRP [10]. WARP provides a collection of hardware, software,
    and reference designs for users to build their own testbeds. The CORNET [3], [4]
    is a campus-wide open testbed with over 48 SDR transceivers and a number of experimental
    spectrum licenses. According to [11], typical SDR hardwares are USRP [10], WARP
    [9], and popular software are GNURadio [12], LabView, and Matlab, where the combination
    of USRP and GNURadio is most popular. FIT [5] is an initiative of large-scale
    open testbed in France. FIT has three components: FIT-Wireless is for indoor WiFi,
    5G, and cognitive radio includes 4 open testbeds from 4 sites, each with tens
    of WiFi and SDR nodes. FIT IoT-LAB is for IoT research, with testbeds located
    at 6 sites for a total of 2728 nodes. FIT Cloud has three platforms and is for
    cloud design, which provides synergy with FIT-Wireless and FIT-IoT. Platforms
    for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) [13] is another initiative of large-scale
    open testbeds supported by National Science Foundation in the U.S.. Currently,
    three testbeds are granted: POWDER-RENEW [6], led by University of Utah and Rice
    University, covers a total of 3.3 square miles in University of Utah campus and
    downtown Salt Lake City, and offers data-driven researches for dynamic spectrum
    sharing and massive MIMO capabilities. Another testbed, COSMOS, led by Rutgers
    University, Columbia University, and New York University, covers 1 square mile
    in a densely-populated neighborhood in West Harlem, New York City. COSMOS is for
    millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio communications and dynamic optical switching technologies
    [7]. The third one, AERPAW [14], is led by North Carolina State University in
    partnership with Wireless Research Center of North Carolina, Mississippi State
    University, RENCI, Town of Cary, City of Raleigh, North Carolina Department of
    Transportation, Purdue University, University of South Carolina, and many other
    academic, industry and municipal partners. AERPAW aims to enable new advanced
    wireless features for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and accelerate the integration
    of UAS into the national air-space. The CoSeC-RAN testbed [1] shares the open
    access policy and some SDR hardware and software with ORBIT [2] and CORNET [3],
    but is focused on outdoor real-world settings. Moreover, the CoSeC-RAN testbed
    also adopts an architecture of Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN), with Software
    Defined Radio (SDR) transceivers, and a cloud with CPU, FPGA, and GPUs available
    at both edges and the core, which is similar to the first two PAWR projects [6],
    [7]. CoSeC-RAN testbed targets sub-6 GHz frequencies, and is currently focused
    on sub-1 GHz. Additionally, this testbed supports underground wireless researches
    in UHF band, and can be extended to mmWave radio communications. Download : Download

    are components to be added in the near future. 3. Testbed architecture 3.1. Hardware
    architecture The architecture of CoSeC-RAN testbed, as illustrated in Fig. 1,
    is composed of Software-Defined Distribution Units (SD-DU), fiber Ethernet-based
    fronthaul network, and cloud-based central unit. The SD-DU, also called Cognitive
    Remote Radio Heads (CRRHs), contains a high-end 4 × 4 MIMO Software Defined Radio
    (SDR) transceiver that can be tuned to any sub-6 GHz frequency. Currently, there
    are 5 SD-DUs on 4 campus sites and 1 street site. All the SD-DUs are connected
    to the cloud-based central unit at HCC [8] via fiber Ethernet-based fronthaul
    network. HCC is a high-performance computing cloud where data processing and storage
    take place. GPS-based clock distribution provides the SD-DUs capability of coherent
    sampling. This architecture allows wireless experiments at multiple levels. With
    the 4 × 4 MIMO SDR transceiver at each SD-DU, researchers could conduct a host
    of experiments, such as point-to-point MIMO communication, mesh network, and single
    site with base-station and mobile devices in realistic environments. With multiple
    synchronized SD-DUs and cloud-based central unit, the testbed further support
    network experiments, such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP), Cooperative MIMO (CO-MIMO)
    and distributed spectrum sensing. With the flexibility of the SDR transceivers
    and high-speed fronthaul network, the testbed could also be configured with existing
    protocols and standards to interface with off-the-shelf wireless devices so that
    application-level experiments could also be conducted. The 5 sites of SD-DUs are
    selected strategically to support experiments of heterogeneous wireless technologies.
    These five sites covers 2 campuses of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a
    public street of the city of Lincoln. The 3 sites on the city campus provides
    typical urban environments with buildings and streets as well as other co-located
    wireless networks. The site located on the public street could support wireless
    experiments for vehicular to infrastructure (V2I) with speed limit of 65 . Moreover,
    the site on public street also includes an extra SDR transceiver connected to
    an underground(UG) MIMO antenna, which could support UG-to-AG wireless experiments.
    The site on Nebraska Innovation Campus is on the rooftop of a building in an open
    environment. Furthermore, a manhole next to the building is also included to provide
    wireless experiments of wastewater sensors. In the future, mmWave and Terahertz
    communication devices will also be included. The fiber Ethernet-based fronthaul
    network provides 2 lines of 10Gbps connectivity for each SD-DU to the central
    unit. An FPGA card with 400Gbps throughput at the core site could not only support
    experiments for the fronthaul network itself but also allows interfacing with
    commercial base-stations based on eCPRI protocol. The cloud-based central unit
    hosted by HCC provides researchers rich computational resources, including array
    of CPUs and GPUs as well as data storage space. HCC already supported several
    RFML projects with offline training [15], [16]. In this testbed, SD-DUs are directly
    connected to and controlled by CPUs and GPUs, which allows online experiments
    of Radio Frequency Machine Learning. Frames of IQ data from/to the SDR transceiver
    could also be saved in the distributed file systems of HCC for further analysis
    and replication. 3.2. Software architecture CoSeC-RAN’s software components will
    be developed incrementally by software engineers with a layered architecture as
    illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The components of radio resources will be developed
    from scratch, while the rest through reusing or customizing existing components
    in HCC platform. The resulting system is a composition of stateless/state-aware
    systems that enable scalability, testability, and a high degree of service re-use.
    The first layer of CoSeC-RAN will contain the Authentication system. The second
    layer will include the user facing front end. The third layer will include resource
    management serving as the gatekeeper to all the resources of HCC and the matrix
    of radios as described in Section 3.1. The user facing front end will be a cloud
    hosted web portal that orchestrates the various aspects of CoSeC-RAN. The mission
    of the Researcher Portal is to abstract away the underlying infrastructure (radios,
    virtual machines, resource scheduling) in such a way that a user can very quickly
    log in, configure an experiment, and run the experiment. Users will generally
    only need to know the goals and objectives of their experiments to use CoSeC-RAN.
    The Administrator Portal will allow for administration of CoSeC-RAN. At the resource
    management layer, the most notable HCC resources are shown in Fig. 2(a). Virtual
    machines will be available to be configured as servers or workstations. High performance
    short term storage will be available for use during live tests. Long term archival
    storage will be available for maintaining libraries of past experiment Profiles
    as well as their results. The Scheduling Service will provide the proper allocation
    of slices for all resources across all levels. The CPU and GPU arrays are available
    to provide either real-time or post experiment analysis. Radios will include at
    minimum the resources specified in Fig. 2(a), each of which is required to support
    the wireless exemplary use cases of CoSeC-RAN. This administration system provides
    researchers tutorials and procedures to reserve radio and computational resources
    of the testbed according to their individual needs. Once scheduled, the system
    will configures the testbed and run the experiments at scheduled time slots. 3.3.
    Research user workflow Users will primarily perform four key activities: staging
    tests, scheduling tests to be executed, monitoring in-progress tests, and retrieving/viewing
    test results. CoSeC-RAN brings a unique and interactive on-site experimentation
    capability (the staging phase), which is similar to the early phases of a simulation
    development, where short scripts are tested to understand and evaluate the simulation
    platform before a full-blown simulation is run. Translating this to experimentation,
    during staging, the sandbox environment will support real-time workflow development
    by allowing users to interact in real-time with the radios and other equipment
    in the Experiment Slice (Fig. 2(b)). Logged in users will see a dashboard outlining
    their experiments that are awaiting execution, live, or completed. In the Sandbox,
    a user will scan through experiments that are available for editing and see high
    level statistics about them. A user can manage an experiment through Slice Designer
    or Live Slice Operations if a slice has already been brought online. Slice Designer
    helps allocate and set up experiment resources, upon which the Design Wizard optimizes
    configuration of experiments related to specific exemplary use case applications
    called CoSeC-RAN Profiles. CoSeC-RAN Profiles will cover typical use cases. Profiles
    will include definitions for the network topology, disk/radio images, research/analysis
    software, and data files. The definitions can be stored collectively as a file,
    or a researcher can upload individual devices and FPGA image files. The wizard
    will continue to evolve through CoSeC-RAN’s lifetime and Profiles will be enhanced
    and added. The Advanced User Interface will allow a user to tweak any individual
    component of the experiment that was automatically generated as part of a wizard
    built slice. An advanced user could build the entire slice from scratch, defining
    each component and feature. Once the experiment workflow is fully defined, it
    can be scheduled for deployment at scale and the slice will be locked in the Sandbox.
    An experiment with its designed resource slice will be promoted into the live
    testbed. Previous experiments on CoSeC-RAN testbed can be reproduced either online
    or offline. For online reproduction, users first reserve the same resources through
    administration portal, then replay the previous experiments on the testbed based
    on their profiles and input data files. For offline reproduction of experiment,
    users only reproduce the computational process based on the published data files
    (e.g. raw IQ data) and research/analysis software. New ideas can be quickly tested
    and compared to the old ones. For RFML, open radio datasets from the testbed can
    simplify the development similar to open image datasets for computer vision. To
    preserve the large amount of raw radio data, HCC promises up to five years of
    backed up storage for regular archival data, and large datasets (e.g. several
    Petabytes) will be kept best effort but not backed up. Users can choose standardized
    or customized data storage plans accordingly. 4. Testbed implementation In this
    section, detailed implementation of the testbed are introduced to provide a clear
    picture of the technical capabilities of the testbed on different layers of wireless
    networks. 4.1. Software defined distribution unit The SD-DU is a SDR transceiver
    that converts digital baseband IQ data from/to radio frequency electromagnetic
    waves. The schematic of the SD-DU is illustrated in Fig. 3. The core of SD-DU
    is a high-end Software Defined Radio (SDR) transceiver, Universal Software Radio
    Peripheral (USRP) N310 [17]. The N310 has 8 RF ports: 4 transmit (Tx) and 4 receive
    (Rx) channels. Each channel provides up to 100 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth,
    and covers a frequency range from 10 MHz to 6 GHz. The maximum output power of
    Tx port is 12–18 dBm [17]. Download : Download high-res image (259KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Software defined distribution unit schematic.
    The 8 RF ports of the SDR transceiver are connected to an UHF antenna array with
    8 elements (4 Tx and 4 Rx) via ultra low loss coaxial cables. Without reusing
    Tx and Rx antenna, the extra loss and leakage of a RF circulator are eliminated.
    LMR-400/600 grade coaxial cable is selected, of which the insertion loss is 1.2/0.6
    dB at 600 MHz and 3.2/1.6 dB at 2.4 GHz for a length of 50 ft. For each site,
    the 8 coaxial cables are made with the same length. At different sites, the cable
    length varies from 25 to 50 ft. A 3.3 V active GPS antenna [18] is connected to
    the SDR transceiver for clock synchronization. Since the UHF antenna array and
    GPS antenna are placed outdoor, lightning arrestors are added before the RF and
    GPS ports to protect the transceiver. Broadband RF amplifiers could be further
    added between the lightning arrestor and RF port to increase the Tx power. It
    is impossible for a simple antenna array to cover the entire sub-6 GHz. Therefore,
    an UHF antenna array for sub-1 GHz band is designed, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The
    antenna element is an off-the-shelf omnidirectional monopole antenna with a gain
    of 6 dBi, which is originally used in USB TV dongles. The UHF antenna array, as
    shown in Fig. 4(a), contains two 2 × 2 uniform rectangular arrays mounted on both
    sides of a reflective plane, and placed in a weatherproof enclosure. The distance
    between 2 nearest antenna elements is 175 mm, which is of 428 MHz radio wave,
    of 856 MHz, where denotes the wavelength of electromagnetic wave in the atmosphere.
    Thus, this UHF antenna array is capable of beamforming from 428 to 856 MHz without
    grating lobes. Download : Download high-res image (363KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. UHF Antenna array: 2 × 2 uniform rectangular array. The
    street site contains an additional SD-DU with UG antennas to support proof-of-concept
    experiments of UG wireless sensor. The UG SD-DU is based on USRP E312, which is
    a 2 × 2 MIMO SDR transceiver with an embedded ARM processor and 1Gbps Ethernet
    port. The underground 2 × 2 MIMO antenna head, as shown in Fig. 4(b), contains
    4 patch antenna elements. The center of each element is placed on a square with
    side of 22.8 cm (9 inch) placed in parallel to the ground plane. The UG antenna
    head is enclosed by waterproof materials and berried at a depth of 30 cm. 4.2.
    Fronthaul network The fronthaul network is based on private high speed Ethernet
    network running over optical fiber lanes dedicated to the testbed. Dedicated fiber
    guarantees the bandwidth, latency, as well as security required by the testbed.
    Ethernet protocol is selected for the convenience of sourcing and management.
    The fronthaul network contains an aggregation switch, dedicated fibers, and an
    FPGA pre-processor. Each SD-DU is connected to the aggregation switch to via 2
    pairs of 10 Giga bit Ethernet (GbE) fiber. The aggregation switch is also connected
    to HCC and Internet 2 [19] through 100GbE fibers, respectively. Internet 2 furnishes
    a 100 Gbit/s network backbone to more than 210 U.S. educational institutions,
    70 corporations and 45 non-profit and government agencies, which allows both radio
    and computing resources of CoSeC-RAN testbed to be directly connected to other
    testbeds. The aggregation switch is a Mellanox SN2410 [20], which has 48 × 10/25GbE
    SFP28 downlink ports and 8 × 100Gbps QSFP28 uplink ports, and is capable of Layer
    2 and/or Layer 3 forwarding at 4 Tbps full duplex. This switch can support a total
    throughput of 100Gbps for the 5 SD-DUs, and is capable of up scaling to more SD-DUs.
    The model of FPGA pre-processor is BittWare XUPP3R [21], which is a PCIe 16x FPGA
    card hosted on a rack-mount 4U form server. The FPGA pre-processor is featured
    with 4 QSFP28 cages, a Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU9P FPGA, and is capable of
    expanding up to 512GB DDR4 SDRAM. The host server is equipped with a 3.1 GHz Intel
    Celeron Dual Core CPU, 8GB DDR4 SDRAM, 250GB SSD hard drive, and most importantly,
    a 850 Watt power module to power the FPGA card. The 4U server is based on operation
    system of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS), with Xilinx Vivado Design Suite being installed
    for FPGA programming. The aggregation switch and FPGA server are mounted on a
    rack shelf located in Walter Scott Engineering Center (WSEC) as shown in Fig.
    5. Download : Download high-res image (403KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 5. Fiber Hub: aggregation switch and hosting server of FPGA pre-processor
    mounted on the rack shelf of networking room at WSEC. The FPGA program of USRP
    N310 in SD-DU is based on Radio Frequency Network-on-Chip (RFNoC) [22], which
    is an architecture that connects various modules such as ADC and DAC interfaces,
    Ethernet core, and other optional Digital Signal Processing modules via AXI bus,
    as shown in Fig. 6 (left). The paths of digital baseband signal (IQ data) between
    those modules can be configured from host computers via GNURadio [12]. The native
    protocol of IQ data over the fronthaul network is UDP-based Virtual Radio Transport
    (VRT), which is based on VITA-49 [23]) with compressed header (CHDR). To be further
    compatible with the fronthaul standard of Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN),
    customized modules could be added to the FPGA image of USRP N310 to translate
    the VRT protocol into Common Public Radio Interface over Ethernet (eCPRI) [24].
    The FPGA pre-processor co-located with the aggregation switch could then translate
    eCPRI back to VITA [23] so that the IQ data could be processed by high-performance
    computing clusters with UHD and GNURadio, as shown in Fig. 6. Moreover, the FPGA
    pre-processor could also perform high speed digital signal processing (DSP), such
    as filtering, FFT/iFFT, to offload the baseband processing workload at HCC. Download

    baseband processing and data storage of the CoSeC-RAN take place at the Central
    Unit (CU) as high-performance computing (HPC) services provided by HCC [8]. Through
    Virtual Private Network (VPN), researchers could access all the SD-DUs as well
    as a variety resources including dedicated virtual machine (VM), SLURM [25]-based
    HPC cluster, Open Science Grid (OSG) [26], and distributed file systems for data
    and code storage. For small-scale projects or early prototyping, dedicated VMs
    on HCC’s Anvil private cloud offer researchers full control of the computing resources
    and software environment. However, connectivity between each SD-DU and VM is limited
    to a total throughput of 3Gbps and a latency of 2 ms due to current capability
    and locations of the facilities involved. Direct layer 2 connectivity to each
    SD-DU is required for certain functions and is achieved by the use of a VPN to
    which each cloud VM maintains a connection. The use of a VPN is not required in
    cases where HCC resources can be placed directly on the testbed network segment.
    For application that requires online baseband processing and/or high radio bandwidth,
    the local HCC clusters offer thousands of computing cores with connectivity of
    up to 10Gbps. The latency between SD-DU and compute nodes is lower than 1 ms with
    the Rhino cluster co-located with the testbed aggregation switch in WSEC. Researcher
    could launch applications with tens to hundreds of jobs running in parallel for
    accessing the air-interfaces of SD-DUs, and online baseband processing based on
    UHD, GNURadio and/or Matlab. Via the OSG, researchers could run off-line processing
    in massive parallel (in the order of tens of thousands jobs) with each job limited
    to 2 h. For Radio Frequency Machine Learning, the Crane cluster allows researchers
    to develop applications with jobs accessing the air-interfaces of SD-DUs and CUDA
    or OpenACC jobs running on GPUs ranging from Tesla K20 to V100S [8]. Moreover,
    the raw IQ data and/or processing results from user experiments can be stored
    on HCC for immediate or future usages. The CoSeC-RAN would also become a market
    of RF data with detailed information of test configurations, where various researchers
    could publish their data and/or access published data from past experiments for
    comparing and reproducing existing results. Detailed description of the operation
    is ignored since it is just standard cloud computing on HPC clusters. Download

    5 radio sites and 2 data sites as well as line-of-sight (LoS) distances between
    them are illustrated in Fig. 7, the 3D map of CoSeC-RAN testbed. Four radio sites
    are deployed on the rooftops of UNL properties. They are Old Father Hall (OFH),
    Walter Scott Engineering Center (WSEC) and Andersen Hall (AH) on City Campus (light
    green area), and Food Innovation Center (FIC) on Nebraska Innovation Campus (light
    blue area). Antelope Valley Corridor, marked as pink area in Fig. 7, is designated
    for the road test of vehicular to infrastructure (V2I) communications. The street
    site is located at the intersection of the Antelope Valley Pkwy and Vine street
    (AVC stands for Antelope Valley Corridor), which belongs to city of Lincoln. The
    two data sites are the fiber hubs in the basement of WSEC and the office of HCC
    in Schorr Center. The locations of radio sites are selected with sufficiently
    separation to reduce the correlation of their spectrum sensing results. On the
    other hand, the LoS distance between nearest sites is kept below 1km as much as
    possible so that it is possible to establish a wireless link between two sites.
    The link budget at a distance of 1km at 600 MHz is illustrated in Table 1. Moreover,
    an LoS channel within 1km could enable a mmWave link between two sites, to support
    future mmWave researches. The choice of radio site locations is limited by the
    availability of penthouse, power supply, fiber connectivity, as well as administrative
    approval. The installations of SD-DU at campus and street sites are illustrated
    in Figs. 8. For campus sites, the antenna head is mounted on a steel pole installed
    on the rooftop of selected building, and the SDR transceiver is mounted on rack
    shelf or cabinet in the penthouse. As a result, SDR transceivers of campus sites
    are indoors with climate control. The deployed antenna head and rack-mounted SDR
    transceiver are illustrated in Fig. 8(b). For the street site, the aboveground
    antenna head is mounted on the top of road light pole (Fig. 8(c)), and SDR transceivers
    are placed inside a weatherproof enclosure mounted on the traffic signal cabinet
    next to the pole, as shown in Fig. 8(d). Coaxial cables are running through a
    conduit mounted outside the pole. The power supply and fiber connectivity of SDR
    receivers come from the traffic signal cabinet. The UG antenna head is berried
    5 ft next to the cabinet. Additionally, temperature sensors, Ethernet-switched
    power outlet, heaters, and edge switch are installed inside the weatherproof enclosure
    for climate control and remote power cycle. Download : Download high-res image
    (472KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Installations of campus and
    street sites. It is worth to mention that the 5 SD-DUs are all deployed at representative
    sites of cellular base-stations. In fact, the 4 campus radio sites are co-located
    with existing cellular base-stations, and the SD-DU on street site is deployed
    in a similar way of small cells in other streets of downtown Lincoln. Between
    radio sites, there are a variety of wireless channels. For example, the wireless
    channels between AH and WSEC, FIC and WSEC, and OFH and AH are LoS or almost LoS.
    The channels between WSEC and AH is a typical street canyon (17th Street). The
    channels between AVC and WSEC, and AVC and AH are blocked by many buildings (NLoS).
    The LoS distance between sites on/near city campus are from 450 to 940 m, with
    an exception of FIC to WSEC which is 1.16km. In general, this planning enables
    the CoSeC-RAN testbed to support experiments of 5G network, and sub-6 GHz point-to-point
    communications. The distance between neighboring sites would allow CoSeC-RAN to
    further support mmWave communications given corresponding upgrades. For underground
    to above-ground communications, the street site provides a wireless channel with
    a short, LoS distance of about 12 m. On the FIC site, the underground antenna
    is located inside a wastewater manhole next to the building. Thus, the FIC site
    provides a UG2AG channel that is NLoS and of greater distance of about 100 m.
    5. Scalability 5.1. Frequency domain The developed testbed can be scaled up in
    both frequency and spatial domains. To cover more sub-6 GHz frequency bands, it
    needs to replace the sub-1 GHz antenna head of SD-DU with antennas of other bands.
    For higher frequencies, additional broadband amplifiers would be required to compensate
    the larger insertion loss of cable and path loss of wireless channel. Currently,
    sub-1 GHz broadband transmit amplifiers with output power of dBm at 500 MHz are
    ready to be deployed. With broadband power amplifiers being installed before the
    transmit antennas of the SD-DU, it is also possible to enable reliable site-to-site
    links, thus support the configuration of mesh network topology. In the future,
    an additional SD-DU site at Military Tower (the blue radio site in Fig. 7) will
    be deployed for experimental mobile mmWave communications and long-distance THz
    wireless backhaul (X-Haul) between Military Tower and Food Innovation Center.
    5.2. Spatial domain The existing fiber network infrastructure available at UNL
    and the City of Lincoln could allow more sites to be directly added to the testbed.
    The current capacity of the core site of the fronthaul network is 200 Gbps which
    can support another 5 SD-DUs. Additional Ethernet switches would need to be purchased
    to scale beyond that. There are 12 pairs of fibers between the core site and HCC
    which could support up to 1.2 Tbps fronthaul capacity for a total of 60 SD-DUs
    without the installation of new fiber lines. The City of Lincoln provides 3 pairs
    of extra fiber lines at its traffic signal cabinets on the public street of Antelope
    Valley Corridor (AVC). One pair of fiber lines can support up to 10 sites equipped
    with SDR transceivers of 1Gbps connectivity along side AVC for vehicle to infrastructure
    experiments. 5.3. Spectrum licensing For the spectrum license, an experimental
    zone for the coverage of this testbed has been granted by the Federal Communication
    Commission. For experiments with low transmit power and on the TV white space
    channels, no license is required. If higher transmit power or in other frequency
    bands is required, the University of Nebraska’s Department of Information Technology
    Services has helped to obtain an experimental spectrum license, call sign WA3XCD.
    With this, we can register each project through the FCC’s experimental project
    registration website. 6. Testing and demonstration 6.1. Antenna element performance
    The transmit and receive performance of the monopole antenna element of the aboveground
    UHF antenna array are tested with Keysight Vector Network Analyzer N9923A, and
    Keysight Spectrum Analyzer N9912A, respectively. the antenna element has the main
    frequency band of 452–572 MHz, and higher order bands of 1.33–1.52 GHz and 2.05–2.23
    GHz. As a result, the antenna is suitable for transmission in TV white space.
    The reception band of the antenna element covers most of the sub-1 GHz. As shown
    in Fig. 9, even being placed at the ground floor of an office building, the antenna
    element is able to pick up all the major sub-1 GHz radio signals, including FM
    signals (88–120 MHz), terrestrial TV signals, and cellular signals (700–900 MHz),
    and aircraft transponder signals (1030–1090 MHz). Download : Download high-res

    rectangular array, H-plane scan of 4 local TV channels with 6 MHz bandwidth, polar
    axis unit: dBm. 6.2. Receive beamforming Next, a receiver beamforming scanning
    on the H-plane is demonstrated. The digital baseband signal (IQ data) of the 2
    × 2 uniform rectangular array of the SD-DU at OFH are first collected and saved
    as files. Then the IQ data files are processed off-line by Matlab MVDR beamformer,
    and the signal power on H-plane are plotted. The scanning results on 4 local TV
    channels with 6 MHz bandwidth are illustrated in Fig. 10. The results show strong
    signal components from multiple directions indicating that the antenna array is
    placed is a rich multi-path environment. Moreover, the variation of receive signal
    strength on H-plane is up to 4–6 dB, which shows a good directivity of the UHF
    antenna array. 6.3. Distributed spectrum sensing In this demonstration, a GNURadio
    program simultaneously receives IQ data from the first antenna of all the 5 sites,
    and displays the spectra-temporal patterns of the spectrum via waterfall plot.
    The frequency band of the sensing is from 433 to 435 MHz, which covers a ISM band
    divided into many narrow channels. The real-time distribute spectrum sensing results
    with a duration of 4 s is presented in Fig. 11 as waterfall plot (above) and instantaneous
    spectrum (below). The result shows several strong narrow-band signals between
    433–433.6 MHz that are picked up by all the 5 sites with different strengths.

    sites. 6.4. Underground to above-ground communication Wireless underground communication
    is an enabling technology for emerging application including environment and infrastructure
    monitoring [28], border patrol [29], and precision agriculture [30], [31]. With
    the SD-DU of the street site, we demonstrate the Wireless underground to aboveground
    (UG2AG) communication in UHF band. A wideband underground patch antenna is buried
    at depth of cm in the soil and connected to a USRP E312 SDR transceiver in the
    nearby cabinet. The AG antenna head is about meters aboveground, and connected
    to USRP N310 SDR transceiver. The distance between the UG and AG antennas are
    about meters. Download : Download high-res image (294KB) Download : Download full-size

    to aboveground communication test. OFDM signal with BPSK modulation, 500 kHz bandwidth,
    transmit power of 15 dBm, and center frequency of 433 MHz is transmitted from
    the UG antenna to the AG antenna head, as shown in Fig. 8(d). The spectrum of
    received signal on 4 receive antennas are shown in Fig. 12. The soil causes high
    attenuation to the signal such that the receive signal strength is only 30 dB
    above the noise floor, which is too weak to synchronize and demodulate. This experiment
    shows that UG2AG channel is more challenging than over-the-air channel. Higher
    transmit power, advanced modulation and waveform design, and processing techniques
    such as receive beamforming could be employed to improve the performance. 6.5.
    Vehicle to infrastructure communication Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication
    plays a key role in improving the safety of smart transportation system. With
    a sedan car, we carried out a V2I communication test at the intersection of Antelope
    Valley parkway and Vine street using the SD-DU at the street site. A wideband
    UHF antenna and a 5.8 GHz antennas are mounted on the rooftop of the sedan vehicle,
    as shown in Fig. 13(a), and a SDR transmitter USRP B200 is placed inside the vehicle.
    OFDM signal with 30 dBm power, 500 kHz bandwidth, FFT size of 64 and cyclic prefix
    of 128 is transmitted from the vehicular antenna to the SD-DU at the street site
    during driving by. The driving by route and location of receiver are shown in
    Fig. 13(b). OFDM signals are transmitted on center frequencies of 915 MHz and
    5.8 GHz in two experiments, in which the vehicle travels in four different directions
    at the intersection. Download : Download high-res image (408KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. V2I communication test setup: (a) vehicular antennas
    (b) test routes. During the test, the vehicle was stopped for a red light signal
    at the intersection before passing by the receiver. We use least squared channel
    equalizer at the receiver and got the bit error rate (BER) and RSS for 90 s in
    Fig. 14, Fig. 14, respectively. The time 0s marks the moment the vehicle passing
    by the receiver antenna. The gaps on the BER curves stand for frames being dropped
    due to unable to synchronize. Due to the higher noise figure of the amplifier
    for 915 MHz as well as higher noise floor, the average BER of 5.8 GHz is 0.0079,
    which is better than BER of 0.0262 at 915 Mhz. On average, the RSS at 915 MHz
    is about 50 dB stronger than that at the 5.8 GHz, which is mainly due to the fact
    that the receiver antenna is for UHF band other than 5.8 GHz band. The vehicle
    stopped for red light from s to s for the 915 MHz test, and from s to s for 5.8
    GHz test. RSS is related to the distance between the transmitter and the receiver.
    Compared to earlier results of V2I test in [32], in which the receiver antenna
    is placed at lower height of 80 cm and 180 cm, the receive antenna height in this
    test is 7 m. The BER results of this test and in [32] both fall in similar range
    between 10−2 and 10−1. This experiment demonstrate the capability of this testbed
    in vehicular to infrastructure communications. Download : Download high-res image

    the CoSeC-RAN testbed is being used in Wireless Communication Networks class for
    senior and graduate students for education in wireless communication principles,
    network experimentation, and spectrum sensing during their course projects and
    labs. The students created several innovative projects, such as: using the testbed
    to collect aircraft transponder signals, identifying mobile device locations,
    collection of weather broadcast data, etc. 7. Conclusion In this paper, a city-wide
    testbed, CoSeC-RAN, equipped with latest high-end SDR transceivers and cloud computing
    facilities, is presented. Its functionalities are demonstrated via basic spectrum
    sensing operations, including receive beamforming and distributed spectrum sensing.
    This testbed is based on an architecture of Cloud-Radio Access Network, with advanced
    computational resources, rich environmental variety, and scalability. It could
    facilitate researches in Dynamic Spectrum Access, 5G, Internet of Advanced Things,
    Vehicular Networks, and Radio Frequency Machine Learning for the next generation
    wireless networks. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

    Energy efficiency [1]–[3] and spectrum efficiency [4], [5] are the two most important
    parameters for next-generation beyond-5G communication networks which have primary
    focus on green communications. These two parameters are also linked to the capacity
    and the power requirements of the communication network [6]. In conventional wireless
    networks, the energy and spectral efficiency issues have been mostly dealt with
    separately; there is a need to provide an integrated approach to the same. Further,
    with the advent of a multitude of services on wireless devices and the greater
    proliferation of these devices, there is an urgent need to have energy as well
    as spectral efficient solutions. The diverse energy requirements for various physical
    objects such as sensors are proliferating due to the advent of technologies like
    the Internet of things (IoT) and its variants, such as the Internet of medical
    things. These nodes need sufficient bandwidth and energy to communicate reliably
    and efficiently. There are various sensors, devices, and physical objects that
    are powered by batteries. However, in several remote applications, the frequent
    replacement of batteries is not a feasible option. Therefore, energy harvesting
    from ambient energy resources [7] is an excellent alternative to enhance node
    lifetime, and hence, the network lifetime. In recent years, the Internet has proliferated,
    connecting humans and systems worldwide so that uniquely recognizable devices
    can interact wirelessly with each other, supporting various kinds of applications
    and people on a wide scale. Thus, the conventional Internet has evolved into another
    intelligent network infrastructure called the IoT [8], [9]. A recent survey by
    Cisco [10], projected a 2.4-fold increase in machine-to-machine (M2M) connections
    from 6.1 billion in 2018 to 14.7 billion by 2023, and 5.3 billion users, which
    is 66% of the global population, will be connected to the Internet by 2023. IoT’s
    highlights include hard and fast observation, dependable transmission, and smart
    functioning; “hard and fast observation” alludes to gathering and obtaining data
    anywhere and anytime by utilizing the recognition and estimation strategy, “dependable
    transmission” implies to have devices connected through a data network, such that
    accurate information is interchanged and transmitted by combining communication
    networks, and “smart functioning” corresponds to investigating the broad set of
    information and data from various industry sectors and businesses through different
    smart technology applications, such as big data, machine learning, etc., to improve
    visibility into the practical world and economic and social activities to realize
    smart decision-making and measures. As IoT continues to grow rapidly, it is becoming
    a massive network that links almost every element of our activities [11]. IoT
    devices are usually powered using batteries. This results in high maintenance
    costs, with the replacement of batteries being difficult and expensive. Additionally,
    in certain environments such as industrial sensor nodes, sensors are installed
    in areas that are challenging to access or unreachable. Therefore, energy efficiency
    is critical in these applications. Further, for IoT devices, optimal energy storage
    and management frameworks [12], [13] are designed to realize the long and routine
    functioning of devices. The advent of cognitive radio (CR) technology has been
    perceived as a productive strategy to tackle spectrum shortages and low utilization
    scenarios using optimum sensing techniques. Security is also an important aspect
    to be considered in IoT [14]. Energy sources are of two types: non-renewable and
    renewable [15]. Examples of the former are nuclear, oil, coal, and natural gas,
    which are limited and would eventually be exhausted. On the other hand, the latter
    type of resources is readily available or replaceable within a short time, such
    as solar, wind, and biomass. Note that these renewable energy sources, though
    environment friendly, are not very efficient, and their performance depends on
    several factors. However, green research communities believe that green or renewable
    energy resources are useful for several next-generation green communication systems
    and networks. Techniques that use these renewable energy resources to harvest
    energy are called energy harvesting techniques [16], [17]. As discussed earlier,
    energy harvesting provides an opportunity with unique features for IoT and next
    generation wireless communications that conventional battery operated devices
    cannot provide. According to [18], the energy harvesting market amounts up to
    USD 440.39 million in 2019, which will increase to USD 817.2 million in 2025.
    Further, according to [19], the cognitive radio market is expected to reach USD
    8.31 billion by 2024. In the electromagnetic spectrum, the useful frequencies
    suitable for communications are limited and licensed, such as 5G radio-frequency
    (RF) spectrum, TV frequency bands, and RF bands. However, most of the electromagnetic
    spectrum is underutilized. Therefore, for efficient utilization of the precious
    EM spectrum, the cognitive devices or radios need to be smart enough to sense
    and acquire the unused spectrum accurately. Spectrum harvesting (SH) [20] involves
    techniques that make the scarce spectrum resources available for various applications.
    The motivation behind using EH and SH in next-generation communication networks,
    in general, can be summarized as follows: Achieving energy efficiency: In next-generation
    communication networks, one of the main concerns is to increase the battery life,
    which powers the wireless devices. Cognitive radio (CR) [21]–[24] assisted energy
    harvesting techniques are discussed in the literature, which can be combined with
    different energy harvesting techniques to provide energy-efficient solutions.
    The energy harvesting can be done from natural sources like wind and solar energy
    or radio frequency sources, also called RF energy harvesting. The important consideration
    is optimizing device operations, which may lead to extending the life of the devices
    on battery. Achieving spectrum access: Spectrum access in next-generation communication
    networks can be classified as priority-based, i.e., based on the reliability and
    latency considerations, or as tier-based, i.e., based on the location of wireless
    devices in the different tiers of the heterogeneous network [25]. The switching
    of wireless devices between different spectrum resources based on the device usage
    requirements is an important parameter. Achieving interference management: Next-generation
    heterogeneous networks are highly dense, and interference needs to be taken into
    account for reliable communication to take place. The inter-cell and the intra-cell
    interference are in the next generation networks like the device-to-device (D2D)
    communication networks [26], [27] make power management an important consideration
    along with interference management. Energy harvesting solutions using cognitive
    radio have been reported in literature and are helpful in reducing the interference.
    Achieving high data rate and low latency: The use cases envisioned for the next-generation
    communication networks are based on higher data rates and low latency, which are
    the typical characteristics of these communication networks. Efficient spectrum
    utilization is possible by using EH cognitive radio, which, along with the capability
    of energy harvesting providing higher energy, will help in achieving high data
    rates and low latency. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the energy
    and spectrum harvesting technologies and protocols for next-generation wireless
    networks. The major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We
    present a detailed overview and comparison of the different EH techniques in next-generation
    wireless networks and discuss various EH techniques like the RF, ambient energy
    harvesting techniques. We provide an overview of SH techniques in next-generation
    wireless networks including CR based and cooperative sensing techniques and provide
    a detailed summary of the various narrowband and broadband sensing techniques.
    We give the future research areas and challenges for the EH and SH techniques
    along with the technology readiness level (TRL) description. The remainder of
    the paper is organized as follows. Section II gives a review of the EH in next-generation
    wireless networks. Section III provides a review of the SH in next-generation
    wireless networks. Section IV discusses the hybrid systems and applications of
    EH and SH in these networks. Section V gives an overview of the future research
    areas, and finally, Section VI concludes the paper. Fig. 1 describes the brief
    outline of the paper. FIGURE 1. EH and SH in next generation wireless networks:
    A schematic flow showing the flow/salient sections covered in the survey. Show
    All EH has several appealing benefits and distinctive characteristics for next-generation
    wireless communications that are not offered by traditional battery or grid-power
    dependent communication systems. These include self-sustainable capacity, lower
    carbon footprint, and no requirement of battery replacement in wireless sensor
    nodes, with simple implementation in most of the complex scenarios. Thus, EH in
    wireless networks [28]–[33] is being studied extensively by the research community
    and being implemented in wide range of applications. Energy efficiency [34]–[36]
    and EH [37] are two ways to attain green communications [38], [39]. Different
    energy sources can be utilized, which can supply us with ambient renewable energy
    sources such as wind, solar [40], [41], motion, electromagnetic (EM) waves, water
    [42], [43]. In the past few years, there has been a lot of research on ambient
    EH [44]–[48]. The limitations of batteries such as leakages, limited storage capacity,
    charging, and discharging along with harvesting and management frameworks to optimize
    transmission are discussed in [49]–[52]. Designing the dimensions of photovoltaic
    (PV) panel and capacity of batteries for energy storage for solar-powered systems
    is discussed in [53]–[56]. Some studies have focused on radio frequency (RF) energy
    harvesting, which is capable of carrying both energy and information in wireless
    communication. A detailed study of RF energy harvesting using the ambient backscatter
    communication (AmBSC) system for passive IoT is done in [57]–[61]. Simultaneous
    wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is used to recover both information
    and energy from RF signals as detailed in [62]–[65]. Two architectures: power
    splitting [66]–[68] and time switching [69]–[71], are proposed which help to overcome
    the difficulties arising from practical circuit design constraints. Scheduling
    of energy is also a primary method to manage the harvested energy to maintain
    energy neutrality constraint EH in wireless sensor networks; various offline [72]–[77]
    and online [78]–[80] methods have been discussed in the literature. In [81], the
    authors presented information-theoretic limits and scheduling policies, and medium
    access control (MAC) protocols are presented in [82], [83]. In addition to it,
    the authors discuss simultaneous information and power transfer. Further, the
    authors state that the challenges lie in various layers as well as in the integration
    with the development of circuits and systems that harvest energy and transfer
    information. In [84], the authors focus on RF-EH and summarize advances in EH
    wireless communications and networks. The authors cover a wide range of topics
    viz., physical layer information-theoretic limits, and MAC protocols. The authors
    emphasize the development of efficient protocols for EH networks with energy and
    information transfer capabilities. Another survey paper on EH in IoTs [85] gives
    a classification of approaches to optimize harvested energy, their comparisons,
    analysis along with the proposed solutions. Furthermore, it also presents standards
    for interoperability. Sharing of spectrum in the context of cognitive radio (CR)
    is discussed in [86], [87], and spectrum assignment in cognitive radio based IoT
    is studied in [88]. Routing mechanisms for cognitive sensor networks are proposed
    in [89]. A collaborative spectrum sensing mechanism with energy shortfalls is
    proposed in [90]. Spectrum sensing in CR is discussed in [91]–[93] where the radio
    senses the spectrum and transmits information simultaneously in the whole time
    slot. Opportunistic spectrum access with modelling using Markov chains is presented
    in [94]. A collaborative CR to schedule for energy efficiency and increased throughput
    for secondary users is framed in [95]. A MAC protocol for use in spectrum sensing
    is demonstrated in [96]. In existing literature, narrowband spectrum sensing [97]–[99]
    and wideband spectrum sensing [100], [101] techniques have been extensively described
    for CR. Narrowband spectrum sensing is used to verify the presence of primary
    users and is further categorized into various techniques such as energy detection
    [102]–[105], matched filter detection [106]–[108], feature detection [109]–[112],
    and eigenvalue based detection [113], [114]. Similarly, wideband spectrum sensing
    is used to detect the available spectrum holes which is classified based on Nyquist
    and sub-Nyquist sampling [115], multiband sensing [116]–[119], wavelet-based sensing
    [120]–[122], filter-bank based sensing [123]–[127], compressed sensing [128]–[135],
    and multi-coset sensing [136]–[139]. Cooperative spectrum sensing [140], [141]
    enhances sensing performance by using the spatial diversity feature of wireless
    communications [142]. Fusion algorithms are proposed for centralized topology
    based cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) using directional antennas in [143].
    A reliability-based cooperative decision fusion [144], and integration of belief
    propagation with fast detection framework [145] for CSS has also been proposed
    in the literature. A reputation based CSS that is robust against attacks is discussed
    in [146]. Spectrum opportunities are found using clustering in heterogeneous CR
    networks in [147]. To suppress the malicious interference in CR networks, various
    frameworks are modelled in [148], [149]. Cluster based cooperative spectrum sensing
    has been studied by the authors in [150]–[152]. Green powered cognitive networks
    or green networks [153]–[159] have motivated research on energy efficiency and
    EH to capture and store ambient energy. In [160], the authors provide a summary
    of energy management techniques in IoT. In [161]–[163], scheduling for EH and
    spectrum sensing based heterogeneous CR sensor networks is discussed in the context
    of green communications. Physical layer security is also a primary concern in
    EH based CR, which is studied in [164]. Time scheduling for backscatter-aided
    RF powered CR networks is discussed in [165]. To overcome the shortcomings due
    to spectrum and battery resource allocation, EH-based cognitive M2M communication
    is proposed in [166]. Resource allocation in wideband sensing-based CR considering
    various constraints are provided in [167]–[169]. CR technology offers the ability
    to maximize spectrum usage as much as possible under the resource assignment and
    EH schemes. In [170], the authors present a technique where the CR does EH from
    RF signal. Resource allocation in wideband CR with SWIPT is studied in [171].
    Optimal resource management and allocation for CR based sensor networks with EH
    are proposed in [172]. EH from the ambient environment is studied in [173], where
    slot mode based CR is proposed to increase throughput. A hybrid CR having sleep
    mode is considered in [174] to harvest energy from the primary users. In [175],
    a dynamic spectrum sensing mechanism with energy efficiency using a power assignment
    framework is proposed. A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted
    overlay spectrum sharing for multi-user CR networks for improved spectrum utilization
    with two scheduling schemes is proposed in [176]. Relay assisted CR for EH is
    proposed in [177], [178]. Interference-aided energy harvesting with decode-and-forward
    relaying (DF) in CR is studied in [179]. SWIPT based EH and DF relay-based cooperative
    spectrum sharing is proposed in [180]. In [181], [182], CR with EH is proposed.
    In [183], [184], the secondary and primary users cooperate for EH and to maximize
    the throughput. Cooperative spectrum sensing with RF energy harvesting employed
    for a multi-channel CR is proposed in [185]. A collaborative spectrum sensing
    with clustering of CR nodes is studied in [186], where spectrum sensing, EH, and
    information transmission is studied in a time slot. Relay based cooperative spectrum
    sensing is studied in [187]–[189] where RF and SWIPT-based EH schemes have been
    proposed. Cooperative sensing using clusters is proposed by the authors in [190],
    [191] for spectrum sensing and energy efficiency. In [192], cognitive wireless
    powered communication networks have been proposed for both underlay and overlay
    CR for wireless energy and information transfer. SECTION II. Energy Harvesting
    in Next Generation Wireless Networks The interest in green communication has prompted
    a tremendous amount of research in related areas due to the significant rise in
    energy utilization by the communication and information sectors [39]. Green communication
    may be attained from two primary methods. The first one is consuming less energy
    with more information transmission, classified as energy efficiency [34], [35].
    The second is by extracting and then transforming the energy from ambient environments,
    such as solar energy, wind energy, thermal power, etc., as shown in Figure 2,
    which is termed as energy harvesting [37], [2]. EH, also known as energy scavenging,
    focuses on obtaining clean energy from ambient renewable energy sources. Historically,
    researchers investigated harvesting energy from windmills, waterwheels etc. [42].
    Figure 3 shows the ‘power’ waves of innovation [43]. In it, renewable energy is
    shown as the sixth power wave. Among its seventeen goals, climate action is one
    of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) listed by the United Nations (UN).
    The generation, transmission, and distribution of green and clean energy could
    alleviate the carbon footprint problem and contribute to achieving the critical
    SDG. Given its eco-friendly nature and other advantages such as improved network
    lifetime, researchers, industry, and academia worldwide are working on novel energy
    harvesting technologies and their integration with various systems and networks.
    FIGURE 2. Popular renewable energy resources for scavenging clean and green energies.
    Show All FIGURE 3. ‘Power waves’ of innovation [43]. Show All For several decades,
    researchers and EH enthusiasts have explored EH methods, such as thermal and vibration.
    There are two motivating forces behind the quest for novel EH techniques: I) Desire
    to design autonomously powered sensor networks or mobile devices without batteries;
    II) Motivation to address climate change or global warming issues due to C O 2
    emissions. Figure 2 shows some popular renewable energy sources to scavenge energy
    via EH techniques. Each of these EH technologies has some merits and some limitations
    in terms of place and environment conditions. Furthermore, these EH technologies
    can find their place in big cellular communication network entities (e.g., green
    gNodeBs) and also in micro-scale low power nodes, for example, IoT sensors in
    cyber-physical systems. It is possible to integrate two or more of these renewable
    energy resources to harvest more energy [40] at a larger scale, depending on the
    application and requirements. For instance, a cellular network could use a hybrid
    solar and wind base station (BS) [41], [53] to serve its subscribers or mobile
    users. If the energy harvested by a BS is below a certain threshold, the BS could
    switch to an alternate non-renewable energy source. Similarly, it is also possible
    to exploit other renewable energy sources for powering various physical objects
    or sensors in cyber-physical systems. The research community has extensively published
    papers focusing on different techniques and applications of energy harvesting.
    Many recent green technology developments have attracted researchers to recognize
    a new change in the power supply framework due to fossil fuel usage in wireless
    network infrastructure. If the IoT sensors are deployed in a remote area for monitoring
    of the environment (e.g., forests), frequent replacement of batteries is infeasible.
    EH technologies are entirely appropriate for these applications. The low power
    sensors could harvest energy from ambient sources such as solar and wind. Some
    of these applications are shown in Figure 4. Not all EH technologies are appropriate
    for these heterogeneous systems and networks. For instance, wind-based EH is reasonable
    to power up a road-side vehicular infrastructure where air-flow is abundant. On
    the other hand, RF-based EH is suitable for low power IoT devices. Therefore,
    the green EH communication system designer should apply these EH techniques optimally.
    FIGURE 4. EH wheel consisting of various technologies and applications. Show All
    A. Ambient Energy Harvesting Conventional communication systems that function
    using an abundant energy-efficient cell and those communication systems for which
    energy from environmental resources is accessible to communication nodes for energy
    harvesting, are irregular and vary with time. Energy-efficient base stations in
    green cellular networks where energy is drawn from the grid is also considered
    in [3]. However, an unlimited quantity of energy is theoretically available, by
    using the wireless sensor system’s energy-neutral operation, the node’s energy
    consumption is always lower or equal to the energy obtained from the environment,
    so energy is stored in storage devices of limited capacity, leading to energy
    overflow or leakage. Figure 5 shows a wireless power scavenger consisting of a
    receiver antenna, a matching network, a radio frequency to direct current (RF
    to DC) converter or rectifier, a unit to manage power, and store energy. After
    complete charging of battery power is supplied to sensors. Generally, transmission
    power is a specific cause of energy usage; however, in some situations, alternative
    means of energy usage at the transmitter can influence radiated power. These design
    concerns, particularly energy considerations, are circuit processing power, battery
    leaks, and charging/discharging faulty batteries’ ineffectiveness. In [54] for
    a base station, tolerable outage probability with constraints on photo-voltaic
    (PV) panel size and number of batteries is proposed. Similarly, in [55], necessary
    battery capacity, and PV panel sizing based on resource availability and detailed
    design of solar powered base stations [56] is formulated. Maximizing transmission
    rate and offline throughput using adaptable rate strategies with various energy
    impacts on costs such as currents due to battery leakage and storage shortfalls
    are considered in [49], [50]. The effect of the incompetence of battery charging
    / discharging upon the optimum transmission power strategy with throughput is
    examined in [51]. A framework for models on single-user and distribution channels
    is found to collect, extract, and use the battery’s harvested energy. In [52],
    throughput efficient transmission mechanisms that consider non-ideal circuit power
    are considered for wireless energy harvesting with unlimited battery storage space
    for energy. A two-phase transmission framework is followed in offline strategies,
    where in the first step, the optimum transmission is on-off, the continuous transmission
    is best during the second step. Ultimately, a closed-loop online algorithm is
    suggested based on an offline solution. FIGURE 5. Block diagram of a typical power
    scavenging module powering a communication transceiver [65]. Show All In general,
    three protocols for ambient energy harvesting and usage have been suggested [44]–[47],
    namely: 1) Harvest-Use (HS): The correspondence node is driven directly by systems
    for extracting resources with no buffer for storage, 2) Harvest-Store-Use (HSU):
    Here, the harvested energy is used only after storage and 3)Harvest-Use-Store
    (HUS): It is instantly possible to use extracted energy which is briefly contained
    in a super-capacitor, and residual energy after processing is completed is stored;
    The HUS and HSU schemes are less efficient than the HU scheme. A harvest-then-cooperate
    (HTC) protocol is proposed in [48] where the downlink source and relay harvest
    energy from the access points, during collaborative work in the uplink for information
    transmission from the source. However, EH using naturally occurring sources gas
    not been as productive as they were anticipated since ambient sources are abnormal
    and unpredictable. There are however, specific environments and circumstances
    where they are relevant and appropriate. B. RF Energy Harvesting Recently, some
    studies have suggested energy harvesting in wireless networks via RF signals.
    A distinct feature of RF energy harvesting is that RF signal carries both information
    and energy, which enables energy harvesting nodes to forage energy and receive
    information. RF energy harvesting is also suitable for long-distance and mobile
    environments. Among the various EH technologies, we mainly focus on RF-EH for
    IoT. The choice of RF-EH-IoT in this survey is because, for low-power IoT sensors,
    RF-EH seems more promising and feasible. A passive IoT device in a symbiotic radio
    system is referred to as the backscatter device (BSD). The most popular paradigm
    for the symbiotic radio is the ambient backscatter communication (AmBSC) system.
    AmBSC system uses ambient energy harvesting BSDs that harvest energy using ambient
    RF signals such as TV, Wi-Fi (ISM bands), FM, and RF radiated from other ambient
    sources. These BSDs backscatter the information signals by switching the impedance
    of the antenna. Two illustrations of AmBSC systems with single and multi-antenna
    tags are shown in Fig. 6, and Fig. 7, respectively. FIGURE 6. An illustration
    of the AmBSC system having a single antenna ambient EH tag, with Tx denoting the
    primary transmitter, and Rx representing the primary receiver with the backscatter
    link via tag. Show All FIGURE 7. An illustration of the AmBSC system having a
    multi-antenna ambient EH tag, a subset of antennas is used for ambient RF-EH while
    the other subset of antennas participates in backscattered communication. Show
    All AmBSC system with multiple tags: In a large-scale passive IoT system, there
    could be many tags equipped with a single antenna or multiple antennas. Partial
    or best tag selection could be a practical solution that helps mitigate the problem
    of synchronization and RF chain complexity. However, the larger the number of
    tags, the higher the complexity of channel state information (CSI) and energy
    management. Specifically, acquiring accurate CSI is challenging because of limited
    pilot transmissions due to energy constraints. These issues lead to more technical
    challenges and open research problems in EH-SH passive IoT. In [57], the authors
    proposed multi-antenna tag AmBSC where the backscatter system uses a K>2 antenna-equipped
    tag; among these, K−M antennas are used for RF energy harvesting and M antennas
    for backscatter communication and the difficulty due blind detection of ambient
    backscatter signals from a multi-antenna tag via generalized likelihood ratio
    test (GLRT) is also addressed. In [58], [60], the authors considered a single
    semi-passive BSD. These tags (i.e., the BSDs) have constraints on energy, which
    is a precious resource and should be utilized and managed efficiently where signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) constraint for successive interference cancellation (SIC) is also
    considered for effective backscatter transmission. In [59], the authors proposed
    a spectrum sharing AmBSC system. In the works mentioned above and the references
    therein, authors analyzed PHY performance measures such as channel capacity and
    bit error rate, and also addressed detection and resource allocation problems.
    Table 1 shows a comparison of various studies on AmBSC systems in passive IoT.
    There exists a fair amount of literature on EH-tags assisted backscatter communication
    in passive (or semi-passive) IoT. The analytical results in the literature on
    AmBSC include detection, channel estimation, performance analysis, channel coding,
    EH, and transmission mechanisms (e.g., wireless power transfer) or protocols,
    to name a few. However, there are still several open problems in PHY, MAC and
    layers above. For instance, these include space-time block coding, non-orthogonal
    multiple access, joint spectrum and energy management, optimization, etc. TABLE
    1 Comparison of Various AmBSC Models Remarks on AmBSC-enabled passive IoT: Single
    antenna versus multiple antenna tags: Unlike a single EH and transmitting antenna
    tag, a multi-antenna tag can simultaneously perform both EH and information transmission.
    However, this multi-antenna tag increases the AmBSC system complexity and cost.
    Furthermore, the issues of synchronization problems in multi-antenna tag-assisted
    AmBSC are higher. Antenna selection is a useful solution to address these timing
    issues. However, for the tag-antenna selection, partial or full CSI is essential.
    Thus, there is a tradeoff between AmBSC system complexity and performance. C.
    Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Receivers can recover both
    information and energy at the same time from wireless RF signals, described as
    SWIPT [63], and this approach has been suggested to distribute RF energy in sensor
    networks. SWIPT offers the benefit of providing configurable and reliable energy
    and information upon request. Nevertheless, it is unrealistic to perceive simultaneous
    energy harvesting and data transmission as entropy rate accounts for the amount
    of data. At the same time, RF signal’s average squared value determines its power.
    Consequently, information transmitted and the energy harvested cannot be maximized
    simultaneously, which triggers requirements to redesign wireless networks with
    relevant constraints [64]. In reality, most of the methods are based on time switching
    or power splitting. In time switching architecture, time for information processing
    and RF energy harvesting is harmonized while power splitting focuses on the optimal
    division of received power into two parts: EH and information filtering. In [66],
    a relay distributed power splitting is done using game theory for information
    forwarding and EH. In [67], a novel, SWIPT based cooperative NOMA is discussed.
    The user with a strong channel operates as an EH relay by implementing power splitting
    and optimizing the beamforming vectors while improving QoS for the user with weak
    channel conditions. Both time-switching (TS) and power-splitting (PS) are employed
    in [68], where cooperative DF relaying is used for EH and information processing.
    Energy-limited relays do EH from received and co-channel interference signals;
    after that, the harvested energy is used for forwarding the decoded signal accurately
    to the destination. At high SNR, PS performs better than TS for achieving throughput
    from ergodic or outage capacity, while at low SNR, TS is superior to PS. The authors
    [69] have proposed a dynamic time switching protocol where the switch between
    EH and data transmission is done using AF and DF relaying by smartly tracking
    the level of harvested energy at the relay. It is appealing as CSI is not needed,
    and relays do opportunistic use of harvested energy by charging their battery
    for transmitting the information. In [70], the authors describe a mechanism to
    balance the time duration between wireless power transfer and data transfer by
    employing an optimization to satisfy energy, time duration, and QoS constraints.
    In contrast to the sum usable energy extracted from RF sources, the efficiency
    of communication of the EH method is defined using the harvested free energy at
    disposal effectively. In [71], the authors consider the non-linear features of
    EH circuits by employing a resource allocation algorithm for the SWIPT system
    to maximize total harvested power. D. Offline and Online Energy Scheduling and
    Optimization The performance of an EH system also depends on how efficiently it
    utilizes the harvested energy available [158], [193]–[195]. Unlike conventional
    battery-powered systems, controlling power in EH systems has to be in synchronization
    with energy consumption and the recharging of the battery because of the dynamic
    nature of energy availability in nature. Energy outage and energy overflow create
    problems in harvested energy utilization. Energy scheduling techniques are of
    two types: offline and online, based on availability of knowledge of CSI and energy
    state information (ESI), causally and non-causally before transmission. For offline
    methods, information about complete knowledge of CSI and ESI is known before transmission
    in the energy scheduling period. Reference [72] aims to minimize packet loss rate
    by jointly optimizing energy allocation and scheduling algorithms based on channel,
    battery, and queue state information in industrial wireless sensor networks. In
    [73], the authors investigate the optimum allocation of power to minimize a non-convex
    average outage probability over transmit power in a fading channel. It is shown
    that the ideal power profile is non-decreasing over time and has a conserve-then-transmit
    framework, and a forwarding search algorithm that finds the global optimal offline
    power assignment is proposed with non-causal energy state information (ESI). However,
    an online power assignment strategy also has been proposed for causal ESI by considering
    dynamic programming and inspecting the system of optimal offline solutions. In
    [74], a linear combination of outage probabilities is minimized over a limited
    time period with predefined transmission rates. A piece-wise power assignment
    framework is developed for both cells with limited and unlimited storage capacities.
    A divide-and-conquer algorithm is suggested to find the optimal power allocation
    iteratively. Authors of [75] investigate the concave utility maximization optimization
    problem for EH-wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs) where sum-rate maximization
    and distributed estimation related to water filling algorithm is presented. In
    [76], performance limitations of sensor nodes with finite energy where harvesting
    occurs variably is studied. A concave non-decreasing utility function is analyzed
    while managing the energy locally, achieving performance near to that with unlimited
    energy while keeping the probability of complete battery discharge low and addressing
    the problem of energy management in energy-replenishing nodes with finite battery
    and data buffers. In [77], a reinforcement learning model is proposed to allocate
    resources and schedule users in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with hybrid energy
    supply to power small base stations. Online strategies account for causal ESI
    and CSI as in [78], where a feasible rate maximization task is modeled as a Markov
    decision process (MDP) with continuous battery states having an access control
    structure of the EH transmitter that has maximum power limitations and works in
    a time-slotted fashion. The proposed algorithms produce an optimal continuous
    power allocation and better performance than discrete state MDP. Offline algorithms
    typically outperform online algorithms owing to the presence of non-causal information
    of energy arrivals and channels. For two instances where the harvested energy
    and channel can be causal and non-causal, offline and online power distribution
    structures are devised in [79]. The authors propose an optimal energy scheduling
    algorithm with an objective of sum-rate maximization of energy examined over limited
    time slots for k -user multi-access channels which do ambient EH. Due to the convex
    nature of the optimization problem, an iterative dynamic water-filling algorithm
    is suggested with limitations on cell capacity and energy utilization by transmitters.
    The authors maximize the networks’ performance with the availability of EH sources
    in [80] with two reinforcement learning algorithms Q-learning and speedy Q-learning
    are used to formulate transmission methods in real-time scenarios by using joint
    randomness in arrivals of data and energy produced due to sensors and energy sources.
    Table 2 shows a comparison among different energy harvesting algorithms discussed
    in this survey paper. Several MAC layer protocols have been proposed due to the
    differences in energy between nodes, adjusting to dynamic EH, and maintaining
    network efficiencies such as low latency and high packet delivery probability.
    Cross-layer scheduling structures have been developed between three layers: regulation
    of the source rate at the transport layer, optimizing multipath routing and flowrate
    at the network layer, and optimizing the MAC layer’s duty cycle. In [83], a hybrid
    time division multiple access (TDMA) based medium access protocol has been suggested
    that avoids collisions and effectively uses the energy of the nodes and dynamically
    schedules the sleep/wake-up modes according to variability at the nodes. This
    increase the energy conservation by 40-60% compared to the IEEE 802.15.4-based
    MAC protocol. TABLE 2 Comparison Between Different Energy Harvesting Techniques
    E. Merits and Demerits of EH Technologies In the following subsection, we present
    various EH techniques and their challenges, merits, and demerits. Clean energy
    derived from renewable sources is good for the environment as the energy generation
    process does not contribute to the carbon footprint. With reliable and sustainable
    EH technologies, it is possible to confront this century’s most challenging global
    warming and climate change problems. While EH technologies exhibit several merits,
    they also have demerits such as cost and complexity. The expenses such as CAPEX,
    OPEX, and EH system complexity vary from one EH technology to the other. A discussion
    on the exhaustive list of these features individually on each EH technology is
    beyond this survey paper’s scope. However, we present a brief summary of these
    merits and demerits. Merits: Renewable energy is good for the environment. Specifically,
    in wireless sensor networks, IoT, and cyber-physical systems, it is possible to
    significantly enhance network lifetime using these energy harvesting sensors or
    devices. EH technologies help in waste reduction and management. For instance,
    it is possible to eliminate heavy batteries in complex subsystems. Use of conventional
    non-renewable energy sources cause adverse effects on the environment. Furthermore,
    it is also difficult to power large numbers of IoT devices in the cyber cloud
    doing a wide range of sensing and communication tasks. For obvious reasons, EH
    technologies are an attractive option in these environments. EH technologies are
    mostly reliable and even cost-effective in some applications such as wireless
    sensor networks. Demerits: EH technologies do have demerits. Some of these demerits
    are listed below. Several EH technologies are expensive; for example, in terms
    of initial deployment or infrastructure costs and materials cost. EH technologies
    (mostly) occupy a significant amount of space. However, this varies drastically
    from one EH technology to the other. Though most of the EH technologies are eco-friendly,
    some of them still cause some adverse effects on the environment, for example,
    biomass EH technology. EH technologies suffer from low or medium energy efficiencies.
    There are several open problems and technical challenges associated with this
    demerit of EH technologies. F. Energy Efficient Wireless Network Characteristics
    Wireless networks maybe classified as energy-efficient, or not, dependent upon
    the performance of the network and the energy expenditure. In literature, studies
    on the energy efficiency of wireless networks can be classified based on the following
    definitions [32]: bits per Joule: Maximizing bits per Joule, or in other words,
    bits Joule = capacity of the network throughput per unit of energy (1) View Source
    covers both the performance of the network and the energy expenditure. The optimization
    of this parameter helps in classification into one of the categories under the
    energy-efficient wireless networks, Quality of service: Minimization of energy
    with guaranteed performance needs to take care of the Quality of Service from
    the network point of view and Quality of Experience from the user point of view.
    The energy minimization with the fixed Quality of Service or Experience is one
    of the optimization parameters which helps in classification into one of the categories
    under the energy-efficient wireless networks. Energy constraint: In the cases
    with energy constraints such as battery-operated devices, networks with energy
    harvesting, and networks with limited energy, the energy-constrained optimization
    helps in classification into another category of energy-efficient wireless networks.
    The next-generation networks are heterogeneous and need capabilities to process
    and acquire large amounts of data; this would pose major challenges for the network
    to remain energy efficient. Energy-efficient networks for handling data would
    need to take care of the aspects as described below [32]: Acquiring information:
    Acquisition of information that is relevant out of the large volumes of information
    available is an important consideration. The commonly used devices from which
    data can be sensed are sensors and mobile devices. For instance, in wireless sensor
    networks, the sensor arrays are used to collect data and are deployed, taking
    into consideration factors like the coverage and the energy efficient data collection
    methods. Techniques like those based on compressive sensing have been deployed
    in sensor networks for data acquisition [32] and are found to be efficient in
    energy terms and accuracy. Communicating the acquired information: The important
    consideration after data acquisition is the efficient communication of the information.
    In wireless devices, the primary source of energy consumption can be traced to
    power utilized during device operation, which is further dependent upon the time
    during which the device remains in the active state and resource allocation from
    the network. One possible solution for the offloading of the network traffic and
    making it spectrally efficient, as described in the literature, is the D2D communication
    technique. D2D communication has the advantage of providing spectral and energy-efficient
    communication as the users in proximity communicate directly with each other without
    the involvement of the network infrastructure. Storing the information efficiently:
    The storage of data requires energy-efficient and cost-efficient techniques, since
    the storage costs of data are high and the repeat access of the stored data also
    involves challenges. In wireless devices, one source of network traffic is downloading
    of popular files by different users from the network, thus leading to the download
    of multiple copies of the same file and congestion in the network. A solution
    to this problem is given by D2D communication where the users can directly communicate
    and share the file instead of downloading again from the network, leading to reduced
    congestion in the network; mobile caching is also one of the solutions for this
    problem. Computation of the information: To get analytical insights from the information
    which is acquired and stored, efficient computation of the information is an important
    step. The energy consumption of a typical data center is around the same as that
    consumed by 25, 000 households in [36], which shows massive energy consumption
    and points to the requirements for energy-efficient computations. In literature,
    it has been shown that computation offloading to cloud-based services is more
    efficient; by doing so, the computations are shifted from the mobile devices and
    save their power consumption and battery usage. In [17], the authors demonstrate
    the trade-offs between the costs involved in communication and computation while
    offloading to the cloud computing networks. It is shown that the energy that a
    node can save due to offloading can be expressed as E save =aA− b B C (2) View
    Source where a depends on the nodes power consumption, b depends on the server,
    and both are constants. A denotes the computation instructions, C denotes the
    bytes of information sent by the mobile device for offloading, and B denotes the
    bandwidth for communication. We can see from (2) that whether the energy is saved
    or not by offloading will depend on both A and C values. G. EH: Information Theoretic
    Sense Consider the received symbol in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
    channel to be y=s+n (3) View Source where s denotes the transmitted signal and
    n denotes AWGN with zero mean and unit variance. According to Shannon [81], the
    power constraint on the codewords for very large number of codewords m is given
    as 1 m ∑ k=1 m s k 2 ≤P (4) View Source where P denotes the power. At every channel
    usage, the causality constraint [81] that needs to be satisfied is given as ∑
    k=1 n s k 2 < ∑ k=1 n E k ,n=1,…,m (5) View Source where E k denotes the stationary
    random ergodic process followed by the energy that is harvested at the transmitter
    such that E[ E k ]=P , with E[⋅] being the expectation operator. This condition
    ensures that the codeword is transmitted without any outages in energy. Further,
    to save energy which is harvested for later applications, if battery is not available,
    then the constraint for the codewords is given as s k 2 < E k ,k=1,…,m. (6) View
    Source If the battery is available with a finite size, with a maximum size denoted
    by B max , then we can say that E B k+1 =min( E B k − s 2 k + E k , B max ) (7)
    View Source which denotes that at first s 2 k amount of energy is dissipated and
    then E k amount of energy is harvested in the battery. It has been shown in [81]
    that the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise channel with the constraint
    as given by (5) is expressed as C= lim m→∞ 1 m maxI( S m ; Y m ), (8) View Source
    and further, the upper bound on the capacity can be expressed as C≤ 1 2 log(1+P).
    (9) View Source Energy capacity of the systems having nodes with buffer capability
    to store the energy harvested is larger, as shown in [16]. The channel capacity
    of an system under ideal conditions and having an infinite buffer is given as
    C= 1 2 log( E[ E p ] σ 2 ) (10) View Source where E p is stationary ergodic and
    denotes that the node is replenishing energy by E p at time p and σ 2 denotes
    the noise variance. SECTION III. Spectrum Harvesting in Next-Generation Wireless
    Networks The rising demand for wireless data is due to mobile devices unprecedented
    growth and Internet based applications. Due to the rapid increase in the number
    of IoT products, energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency are two critical concerns
    with IoT development. Machine-to-machine communications are perceived as one of
    the most likely innovations for IoT implementation in the 5G network. The 5G network
    [196]–[198] is flexible enough to allow a broad range of technologies and accommodate
    explosive traffic growth, thereby making headway for IoT development. Later on,
    5G-based IoT can furnish a wide range of IoT systems with big data. As the evolution
    of the wireless communication systems continues, bandwidth requirements are also
    growing, and the increasing demand leaves wireless spectrum capacity even more
    inadequate. Cognitive radio has been recognized as a possible remedy for the scarcity
    of spectrum owing to its primary idea of dynamic spectrum access. Figure 8 depicts
    the three phases of spectrum sensing, spectrum harvesting, and communicating tasks
    that a CR needs to accomplish for communicating opportunistically. Among these
    tasks, spectrum sensing is the unique signal processing task, which is essential
    for acquiring spectrum awareness for CRs in dynamic spectrum sharing networks.
    An overlay mode CR can acquire spectrum awareness via spectrum sensing (SS). SS
    is responsible for deciding on scanning spectrum spaces and is a unique characteristic
    of CR. FIGURE 8. The phases of spectrum harvesting and communicating devices where
    the CR harvests minimum required bandwidth for communication. Show All In the
    following subsections, we describe various spectrum sensing methods for next-generation
    wireless networks. A. Spectrum Sensing Via CR An intelligent wireless communication
    system, i.e., CR, could be a non-energy harvesting smart radio system or energy
    harvesting intelligent radio system. In the former, CR has to sense the unused
    EM spectrum and harvest bandwidth. On the other hand, in the latter, CR has to
    harvest both bandwidth and energy, which is more complex and highly limited in
    terms of its applications. For example, radio frequency (RF)-based EH-CR has to
    sense RF signals and harvest energy that can either be used on the fly or stored
    and then used for later tasks such as sensing and communication. Figure 9 shows
    some of the applications and modes of CR. In the opportunistic mode, a CR, i.e.,
    the secondary user (SU) or unlicensed user, could use the spectrum only when the
    primary or the licensed user is switched off. However, in underlay mode, both
    primary users (PU) and SU could co-exist. However, SU’s transmissions should not
    cause interference at the primary receiver above certain thresholds. There are
    various technical and non-technical challenges in turning these applications and
    modes into reality. There do exist several tradeoffs among the operating modes
    of non-EH and EH CR and their performance. In the upcoming sections, we present
    various protocols developed in the literature on spectrum harvesting systems and
    networks. Later, we describe some exciting insights into EH and SH technologies
    from commercial and economic perspectives. FIGURE 9. Applications (left) and modes
    (right) of CR. Show All Figure 10 illustrates the motivation of spectrum sensing
    to find the spectral holes. A cluster-based wireless sensor networks (WSN) is
    also shown. Three clusters are present where sensor nodes send their information
    to the cluster head (CH), which is then sent to the sink node. In [86], the authors
    presented an overview of IoT-based cognitive radio systems and proposed that CR-based
    IoT systems are a feasible option for reliable and appropriate use of spectrum
    resources, including in the presence of primary users. They also provided a detailed
    survey on various architectures, frameworks, and spectrum-related functionalities
    of each layer in the CR-based IoT system. It is predicted that IoT without cognition
    can only be a strain on current infrastructure networks. The authors of [87] have
    reviewed a detailed study on the frameworks enabling sharing the spectrum in CR.
    Existing SS algorithms are also discussed, such as narrowband sensing, wideband
    sensing, and cooperative sensing, along with advances in various aspects of implementation
    such as power consumption, complexity, throughput, and performance. In [88], the
    optimum spectrum assignment concerning network throughput is examined, and the
    use of spectrum in IoT focused on CR. With mutual interference and resource allocation
    limitations under simultaneous transmission, a genetic algorithm optimization
    is proposed, with links acting as chromosomes, to achieve maximum spectrum utilization.
    Though the dynamic spectrum access mechanism helps the secondary users to access
    the wireless channels licensed to primary users due to high spectrum availability
    variations, it is difficult to establish an effective routing method for secondary
    users in cognitive sensor networks. FIGURE 10. Illustration of spectrum sensing
    and cluster-based WSN [28]. Show All In [89], two cognitive sensor network (CSN)
    routing mechanisms are proposed, which account for spectrum channels’ quantity
    and quality. One way to minimize rerouting is by re-transmission, considering
    the probability of successful delivery through all channels. In contrast, the
    other routing mechanism considers mean delay while transmission over all channels.
    Due to fading and shadowing, single secondary user performance is limited. For
    proper and effective wireless channel sensing, a collaborative spectrum sensing
    is proposed in [90], where the time slot is divided into two stages: spectrum
    sensing and reporting. The results reporting period depends on the number of collaborative
    sensing users, while the time invested in sensing the spectrum determines the
    number of sensing samples. Two scenarios with extra and shortfall of energy are
    considered, and a convex optimization problem is formulated for the overall probability
    of error with time and energy limitations. In [91], a full-duplex cognitive radio
    network (FD-CRN) is used where throughput maximization for SU is done. FD-CRN
    can sense the spectrum and transmit data in the whole time slot. Two algorithms
    based on brute-force search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods to help
    the SU achieve optimal detection thresholds and maximize throughput is proposed
    in SU spectrum sensing and cooperative sensing environments. In [92], SS for multi-antenna
    CR using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms is proposed. The SS problem for
    multiple PUs is modeled as a multiple detection problem with a beamformer-aided
    feature realization method to boost the capacity of the SVM. Sensing of PUs spectrum
    occupancy state by SUs reduces the throughput for SUs. In [93], a simultaneous
    spectrum sensing and information transfer framework with imperfect signal cancellation
    and energy detection technique to detect PU is proposed. An opportunistic spectrum
    access (OSA) model is developed in [94], where SU performs OSA with a dynamic
    PU having a two-state random process modeled using Markov chains. The probabilities
    of detection and false alarm are established using chi-squared distributions and
    acts as test statistics for the energy detector. A colony-based energy-efficient-sensor
    scheduling algorithm is proposed in [95] for a collaborative CR with constrained
    energy source using heterogeneous sensors, where optimal scheduling of sensors
    is performed in order to ensure the necessary output by sensing and increase the
    throughput of the secondary system. For effectively sensing of PUs, synchronization
    of secondary and primary networks is desired to decrease the probability of failure
    while transmission of PUs, but is challenging to achieve. In [96], a full-duplex
    MAC protocol SS framework for a multiple channel non-time slotted CR networks
    (CRNs) is proposed where SUs can sense PUs reactivation time in a timely manner
    while transmitting. The proposed protocol provides high throughput for PUs with
    efficient use of the channel by SUs. As mentioned earlier, depending on the size
    of the band of concern, spectrum sensing approaches can be graded into two categories.
    Narrowband sensing [97] addresses the issue of determining whether a specific
    slice of spectrum is the hole. On the other hand, wideband spectrum sensing [100]
    is focused on categorizing individual wideband slices to be either occupied or
    empty. In reality, we require both the sensing technologies in the cognitive cycle.
    Usually, there exist two separate stages of PU detection in interweave CR. During
    the preliminary sensing process, in order to detect the accessible spectrum holes
    wideband spectrum sensing is used [101]. In compliance with specific requirements,
    the finest possible spectrum band is selected after identifying and examining
    spectrum holes. Nevertheless, due to high variations in mobile scenarios, the
    chosen narrowband may be occupied by the primary user once the communications
    begin. To overcome such difficulties, narrowband sensing by SU is done to verify
    whether PU is present or not prior to communication. Figure 11 shows various techniques
    as available in the literature that have been proposed to overcome the challenges
    in spectrum sensing. FIGURE 11. Classification of spectrum sensing techniques
    based on bandwidth. Show All B. Narrowband Spectrum Sensing In interweave CR,
    before communication, SU must sense and verify whether spectrum is available or
    not, which is carried out by narrowband spectrum sensing. The authors of [98]
    suggest two architectures to perform narrowband spectrum sensing: single-radio
    and dual-radio. Merits of single-radio architecture are low power consumption,
    low cost, and simplicity, but it has less spectral efficiency [99]. Sensing by
    dual-radio architecture has demerits like increased power consumption and hardware
    cost. SU must be efficient in detecting the weak signals of PU so that it can
    rapidly evacuate the occupied spectrum. We present below the various narrowband
    spectrum sensing techniques and recent developments as available in the literature.
    Further, techniques related to narrowband sensing are summarized with its classifications,
    its limitations, and associated references in Table 3. TABLE 3 Summary of Various
    Narrowband Sensing Techniques in Cognitive Radio Networks Energy detection (ED)
    is a non-coherent detection technique where there is no requirement of prior information
    of PU signals and has less complexity. In [103], a kernelized ED scheme is proposed
    for various Gaussian and non-Gaussian impulsive noises, accounting for practical
    human-made noise conditions which comprise of higher-order and fractional lower-order
    moments using non-linear kernel functions for optimal sensing. As the ED method
    for spectrum sensing needs to be aware of noise power, it therefore has performance
    degradation due to noise uncertainty. To overcome this noise uncertainty and achieve
    reliable computing performance with low complexity, a blind ED for spatial spectrum
    sensing using maximum-minimum energy is proposed in [102], where an electronically
    steerable parasitic antenna receptor (ESPAR) is used, which can split the space
    into multiple sectors and switch the receive beam pattern to individual sectors
    in a time splitting approach. Matched Filter Detector (MF) uses coherent detection
    and maximizes the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by applying cross-correlation
    between already known primary user signal and the received signal. Due to coherent
    detection, the SU needs to be completely aware of the characteristics of the PU
    signal, such as bandwidth, frequency of operation, the shape of the pulse, order,
    and format of modulation, etc. Due to its robust performance in low SNR conditions,
    MF detection is employed to detect weak signals. It has been shown that the efficiency
    and sensitivity of the MF detector decline quickly as mean noise power fluctuation
    increases and gets even poorer at low SNR conditions. This occurs due to a specified
    threshold; however, the performance can be enhanced by modifying this threshold.
    In [106], a dynamic sensing threshold is estimated to increase the efficiency
    of sensing detection. In [107], an MF detector is employed to recognize the presence
    of the primary user and its power level. This framework provides great flexibility
    to PU to vary its transmit power according to the situation of the environment.
    Even SU can modify its transmit power to fulfill the interference conditions for
    various power levels of PU. Authors of [108] have implemented a framework where
    SU has multiple antennas, and PU has a single antenna and the primary user’s training
    signal set is known apriori by secondary users by cooperation. Even though MF
    detection has better performance, it requires knowledge about fading of the channel,
    frequency offset, or proper timing, or else the correlation becomes weak, which
    degrades the performance. Feature detection comprises of a comprehensive class
    of spectrum sensing techniques. A subset of feature detectors, referred to as
    waveform detectors, is based on prior awareness of the construction of the PU
    signal. Waveform detection is coherent in nature, so it performs a correlation
    between the real known signal and the received signal. A comparison is then made
    between the output and the threshold for detecting the presence or absence of
    PU. In [109], first, a range decision test is proposed to set the threshold for
    comparison, which does not vary due to the variations in the SNR based on new
    decision criteria. In the second approach, SU senses the availability of channel
    while it is transmitting by using waveform detection so that SU’s rate rises.
    Since PU signal undergoes modulation due to second-order periodicity, PUs have
    cyclostationary feature. These features are used for detecting the presence of
    primary users by PU signals as cyclostationary features are absent in stationary
    noise or interference signal [97]. In [110], using the cyclostationary features
    of the modulated signal, optimized recovery of generalized frequency division
    multiplexing (GFDM) signal is presented. By exploring the sparse property, the
    spectral correlation function (SCF) of the GFDM signal and the covariance function
    of its compressive samples are constructed. Further, a generalized likelihood
    ratio test (GLRT) is employed to find out the occupied spectrum. Numerical results
    prove that the proposed method has good performance at low SNR conditions. Detection
    of the GFDM signal has significantly better performance than detecting OFDM signals,
    so GFDM is a better technique that can be used in 5G and CR. Cyclostationary property
    is used in [111] to avoid the intercell interference in femtocell heterogeneous
    Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) networks. It is shown that employing cyclostationary
    detection has better performance, particularly in the case of noise uncertainty,
    in terms of false alarms, detection probability, and deflection coefficient. Eigenvalue
    based detection: due to constraints of coherent detection and implementation of
    a practical system, various other methods have been proposed, one of them being
    eigenvalue based detection. In [113], [114] to reduce false alarm probabilities
    under noise uncertainty, a Max-Min eigenvalue detection is proposed where the
    ratio between maximum to minimum eigenvalues of the covariance matrix is set as
    a test statistic. This removes the need for PU and the transmission channel’s
    prior information and overcomes noise uncertainty at the receiver. C. Wideband
    Spectrum Sensing Sensing of bandwidth exceeding the channel’s coherence bandwidth
    is done by wideband spectrum sensing, for example, ultra-high frequency (UHF)
    TV band (between 300 MHz and 3 GHz). With respect to the sampling frequency, two
    primary wideband spectrum sensing schemes have been proposed. The first approach
    is to sample the required spectrum using simple Nyquist frequency [115]. The second
    approach advocates the division of the sampling problem into multiple narrowband
    spectrum detection scenarios, or the edge between the occupied and vacant band
    is detected. These methods have large computational complexity and require high
    sampling rates, large sensing time, and processing delay. Algorithms related to
    wideband spectrum sensing with its classification, its brief description, and
    limitations are tabulated in Table 4. TABLE 4 Summary of Various Wideband Sensing
    Techniques in Cognitive Radio Networks Multiband Sensing or FFT-Based Sensing
    is proposed in [116], where sampling of a wideband signal is done by an analog
    to digital converter (ADC) at a high sampling rate. After dividing the samples
    into multiple segments, a Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is applied to estimate
    the power of each segment. Each segment is further divided into multiple narrowbands,
    and spectral occupancy is found out using binary hypotheses tests. Hardware implementation
    of FFT-based spectral correlation and pilot sensing SS framework is implemented
    in [117] on FPGA as per IEEE 802.22 standard. An adaptive multiband SS is derived
    in [118], where the framework incorporates two phases, the exploration phase and
    the detection phase, where several spectral holes are recognized among the surviving
    channels. A multiband SS technique and cross-layer reconfiguration resource allocation,
    i.e., the channel for IoT in cognitive 5G networks, is proposed in [119]. Wavelet-Based
    Sensing is proposed in [120] for 60 GHz Millimetre-wave (mmWave) 5G small cell
    heterogeneous networks. The suggested framework can mitigate leakage in the spectrum
    and interference caused due to other prevailing networks in identical frequency
    bands by modifying the sub-carriers in accordance with cognitive information supplied
    by wavelet packet-based spectrum sensing (WPSS) and by utilizing a wavelet-based
    filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) modulation for reduction of sidelobes. Implementation
    of wavelet-based spectrum sensing is carried out in [121] for low SNR conditions.
    Wavelet transform (WT) is utilized as a tool that produces information about the
    details on the precise frequency transition locations and spectral densities.
    Consequently, the wavelet transform is used to find out singularities in wideband
    power spectral density (PSD), where identification of the anomalies is considered
    an edge detection problem. In [122] an improved WT algorithm is derived in which
    non-linear logarithmic scaling of WT coefficients is carried out after normalization
    of the wideband PSD. In this framework, by carrying out such a process, WT-based
    edge detection achieves better accuracy and is more effective than conventional
    WT-based edge detection. Filter-bank sensing: Fast convolution filter banks are
    studied in [123] for flexible and optimized processing of waveforms and sub-band
    energy detection in professional mobile radio (PMR) used for broadband data communication.
    The designed system shows better robustness to noise uncertainty and interference.
    A dual-stage SS algorithm for CR is designed in [124] using cosine modulated filter
    banks (CMFB), which have a simple design and real coefficients for the filter.
    Compressed sensing is based on the presumption that the sparsity of the wideband
    spectrum is known, but due to the dynamic spectrum environment and dynamic nature
    of PU, the sparsity is unknown. In [128], an adaptive compressed spectrum sensing
    scheme is proposed to find the optimal sampling rate and detect the spectral holes
    when the sparsity of the wideband signal is unknown or varying. The authors in
    [129] use a hybrid model by merging compressive spectrum sensing with geolocations
    to determine spectral holes in a decentralized CR. A dynamic compressive wideband
    SS is proposed in [130], which is based on recovering the channel energy of the
    spectral components, which show varying occupancy status in successive time slots.
    Bayesian compressive sensing with L 1 -norm minimization and with circulant matrix
    is proposed in [131] to improve the speed and efficiency of the recovery stage
    in compressive sensing. Multi-coset sensing (MC) is a periodic non-uniform sub-Nyquist
    sampling method for obtaining sparse multiband signals. In [136], an adaptive
    blind wideband spectrum sensing for CR is proposed where the wideband SS is based
    on non-uniform multi-coset samplers, and the system adapts to variations in the
    number of active bands and input signals. The main advantage of multi-coset sensing
    is that each channel’s sampling rate is much lower than the Nyquist rate. In [137]
    the problem of unknown band position is handled through discrete multi-coset sampling.
    A joint optimization algorithm is developed using an adaptive least coset number
    to recognize various features and choose an appropriate algorithm for signal reconstruction.
    When the primary user’s usage information is unknown to the CR, wideband spectrum
    sensing makes greater use of the frequency spectrum. However, the execution of
    WBSS is quite complicated as it has extensive usage of energy. The spectrum sharing
    stage aims to assign vacant bands to secondary users efficiently, without any
    collisions. D. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Single-node spectrum sensing provides
    us with unreliable performance due to deep fading and shadowing, which increases
    the rate of missed detection. CR receivers require high sensitivity, which in
    turn increases the implementation cost and complexity. Moreover, if primary users’
    SNR is below a certain threshold, increasing the sensitivity would not help in
    improving the detection performance [141]. To overcome these issues, cooperative
    sensing is used wherein the spatial diversity advantages are exploited to strengthen
    sensing performance. It is possible to distinguish cooperative sensing models
    into four categories: centralized, distributed, relay-assisted, and clustered
    [142]. Table 5 classifies various models in cooperative spectrum sensing with
    a brief description, their advantages, and disadvantages. TABLE 5 Classification
    of Cooperative Sensing Models Centralized cooperative sensing consists of a fusion
    center (FC) which controls the stages of cooperative sensing. Omnidirectional
    antennas are used in most of the cooperative sensing techniques. In [143], to
    achieve fine-grained sensing and broader sensing range of PU, a directional antenna
    is used. The fusion center gathers the sensing information from SU and optimizes
    the sensing power, sensing period, and sensing beams for each SU with reduced
    energy consumption and maximized probability of detection. A reliability-based
    decision fusion scheme for cooperative spectrum sensing is proposed in [144],
    where the reliability of each SU decision is considered as a weight factor while
    deciding upon the ultimate decision at the FC. Probabilistic estimation is carried
    out by comparison with the past data about local and global decisions. In [145],
    integration of belief propagation (BP) algorithm with a fast detection technique
    is used for cooperative spectrum sensing in order to attain a better detection
    performance in terms of delay and false alarm rate, where PU actions are heterogeneous
    in space and dynamic in the time. After considering the practical and imperfect
    common control channel (CCC), the authors of [146] suggested a robust reputation
    based cooperative spectrum sensing technique where the impact of imperfect CCC
    on detection of malicious SU is studied and is verified to be resilient against
    attacks. In [147], a Bayesian data mining framework is proposed for clustering
    SU based on their observations in a spectrum heterogeneous CR network. Each SU’s
    reliability and spectrum occupancy are inferred, and a multi-label graph cuts
    method is proposed to find out spectrum opportunities. Cooperative spectrum sensing
    performance gets deteriorated due to the existence of malicious interference in
    CRNs. In [148], to tackle malicious interference, a new cooperative spectrum sensing
    detector is proposed to estimate the local signal-to-interference-plus-noise-power
    ratios (SINRs) at secondary users and then transmit it to a fusion center for
    making the decision. To counter the potential security risks from internal nodes,
    in [149], a location-aware transferring reputation mechanism and dynamic game
    model-based secure collaborative spectrum sensing strategy is presented. This
    helps to solve the reputation loss by user mobility, motivate SUs to provide honest
    information, and increases the precision of spectrum sensing in CR network-based
    cyber-physical systems (CRN-CPS). Table 6 compares various spectrum sensing protocols
    discussed in literature. TABLE 6 Comparison Between Different Spectrum Sensing
    Techniques E. Merits and Demerits of SH and CR CR in opportunistic mode senses
    the unused or underutilized EM spectrum to harvesting bandwidth. These licensed
    frequency bands are allocated to primary users, which include TV, satellite, and
    beyond. While the SH technologies are critical, bandwidth resources are limited,
    whereas communication networks are many. With reliable and efficient SH technologies,
    it is possible to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem. While SH technologies
    do possess several merits, they also have demerits, for example, implementation
    issues. Below, we present a brief summary of these merits and demerits that may
    vary from one SH approach to another. Demerits: SH technologies have certain demerits,
    mainly in terms of implementation issues. Some of these are listed below. In opportunistic
    CRs, accurate spectrum sensing is the most challenging task. The false negatives
    during detection would result in simultaneous communication by primary and secondary
    users, thus interfering with licensed users. SH-enabled CR improves the complexity
    and cost of intelligent systems. This cost and implementation issues vary drastically
    from one cognitive network to another, such as terrestrial and satellite cognitive
    networks and ad-hoc cognitive networks. The complexity of energy harvesting and
    bandwidth conserving CR is even more. For example, the harvested energy has to
    be utilized for spectrum sensing as well as data communication. SECTION IV. Hybrid
    Systems: Perspectives and Remarks This section provides a brief overview of some
    of the hybrid systems that employ the energy and/or spectrum harvesting techniques.
    Next generation EH wireless systems and EH-IoT: We can broadly classify next-generation
    EH communication [38], [159] systems into three categories: non-EH wireless systems,
    EH, or fully autonomous wireless systems, and hybrid or partially autonomous wireless
    systems, including IoT and cyber-physical systems. The first category of wireless
    systems, non-EH systems, needs dedicated and reliable power sources. In the second
    category, EH wireless systems, there is no need for a dedicated power source such
    as a battery. These wireless systems are fully autonomous because they can harvest
    energy from ambient sources and perform sensing and communication tasks. However,
    intermittent communication is a potential risk if the ambient energy sources are
    not available or sufficient to harvest the required energy. Therefore, these wireless
    systems are not useful for some critical applications such as broadcasting. It
    is more practical to design and develop hybrid wireless systems and EH-IoT that
    consists of some fraction of EH nodes. The protocol stack should work in such
    a way that each layer’s protocol(s) is(are) aware of the node or terminal’s energy
    consumption and delivers optimal performance by utilizing power adaptively. Modifying
    the existing protocols such as artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled protocol stack
    can provide superior performance in complex, hybrid, next-generation wireless
    systems. The AI-enabled stack should also include a dedicated environment layer
    (or its equivalent) in addition to layers such as infrastructure, perception,
    computation, storage, and application. The environment layer may consist of protocols
    that could process and communicate data related to the carbon footprint by the
    AI-enabled hybrid cyber-physical system (CPS) or hybrid cyber-biophysical system
    (CBPS) or network. It could also be responsible for communicating useful data
    (environmental conditions, machine health, etc.) to the remote server during emergencies
    (like natural disasters). Furthermore, this layer could improve the AI-enabled
    CPS or CBPS’ protection and security in which the AI stack is mounted. Since AI
    is being applied (and would be applied) in several complex systems in various
    fields of science, engineering, business, and health, the AI stack needs to be
    greener and eco-friendly. Next-generation SS/SH wireless systems and SS/SH-IoT:
    We can broadly classify next-generation communication systems into three categories:
    non-spectrum sharing wireless systems, SS/SH wireless systems, and hybrid or partially
    spectrum sharing wireless systems, including IoT or CPS. The first category of
    wireless systems, non-spectrum sharing systems, needs dedicated bandwidth resources
    always—for example, security and surveillance satellite links. In the second category,
    SS/SH wireless systems, there is no need for dedicated bandwidth. The nodes are
    intelligent and harvest bandwidth opportunistically from the unused EM spectrum
    of primary users. These secondary SS/SH wireless systems also have limited applications
    in which continuous transmission of information is not needed. It seems more practical
    to design and develop hybrid SS/SH wireless systems and cognitive IoT that consists
    of some fraction of primary nodes with dedicated bandwidth allocation and others
    being secondary. The protocol stack of such hybrid cognitive networks should work
    in such a way that each layer’s protocol(s) is(are) aware of the node or terminal’s
    bandwidth consumption and delivers optimal performance by utilizing limited harvested
    bandwidth in the best possible manner. Next-generation EH-SS/SH wireless systems
    and EH-SS/SH-IoT: It is quite challenging to develop a protocol stack for such
    complex wireless systems. With the advent of AI tools and algorithms, it is possible
    to build a protocol stack in which each layer is aware of energy consumption and
    bandwidth utilization. As mentioned before, it is a good idea to first design
    hybrid next-generation EH-SS/SH wireless systems and IoT before making them autonomous.
    Depending entirely on EH nodes whose performance depends on ambient energy sources,
    makes it hard to achieve better reliability, quality of service (QoS), and quality
    of experience (QoE). However, using multi-energy harvesting systems and efficient
    combining of these EH modules could enable the complex EH-SS/SH-IoT to utilize
    more green and clean energy than non-renewable energy. Thus, the hybrid and optimal
    designs would provide a balance while reducing the carbon footprint significantly
    over time. Figure 12 illustrates a CR network with energy harvesting. A fading
    channel with additive Gaussian noise is assumed and data and energy queues are
    present with the transmitters in which data packets and harvested energy or arriving
    energy are stored, respectively. SUs do both information transmission in the unused
    spectrum and RF energy harvesting in the spectrum occupied by PUs. Integration
    of energy harvesting technologies and bandwidth conserving CRs could provide even
    more benefits to the next generation of communication systems, networks, cyber-physical
    systems, etc. For instance, in EH-CR-IoT, the IoT-sensors could leverage ambient
    renewable resources (e.g., RF energy resource) for energy harvesting and the harvested
    bandwidth for communication. However, there are various implementation challenges
    and open problems such as design and development of efficient spectrum, and energy-aware,
    and optimal protocols for dynamic EM spectrum access and harvested spectrum management.
    Furthermore, the cost and complexity of the EH-SH CR system are other significant
    challenges that need to be addressed by researchers and industries. FIGURE 12.
    The model of CR network with energy harvesting [20]. Show All Numerous technologies
    such as cooperative communication and CRs are suggested to resolve the constraints
    of two valuable assets, energy and spectrum, and lack of performance due to wireless
    fading channels. Communication with cooperation has generated a great deal of
    interest because of its ability to minimize the fading due to wireless channel
    and enhance wireless links’ performance by leveraging the spatial diversity benefits
    inherent in multi-user scenarios [120]. As nodes communicate with one another
    to transmit the information, they form an invisible multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
    system. Nevertheless, as we know that wireless nodes are mostly constrained in
    terms of size, these nodes require batteries with longevity and large storage
    capacity, so EH methods have been introduced to enhance the throughput without
    the need for replacement of batteries periodically. Medium access control in cooperative
    and cognitive wireless systems plays a crucial role in sensing the channel, mobility
    of spectrum, allocating the resources, and sharing of spectrum. MAC design is
    affected by sensing duration and precision with an extra burden of optimizing
    the energy consumption for better system performance and QoS. In [156], a cooperative
    MAC protocol or cooperative cognitive TDMA is proposed for cognitive networks
    that does opportunistic EH in SUs. It uses both standard and spectrum leasing
    methods to achieve QoS for PUs and increases throughput. A. Energy Efficient Resource
    Management Energy consumption in wireless CRN is also affected by the radio resource
    management techniques. A summary of the energy management and related IoT problems
    is provided in [160], two types of IoT management are classified. Energy-efficient
    remedies include optimum sleep and idle state scheduling. Repeated scanning of
    the spectrum for efficient protection of PU results in wastage of energy. In [161],
    EH-SS based cognitive radio sensor networks (HCRNs) are proposed to deal with
    the problem of allocating the resources in HCSRNs. Scheduling is done for spectrum
    sensors to maximize the mean accessible time of channels and resource allocation,
    i.e., power, channel, and time for data sensors for minimizing its energy consumption.
    For example, in [162] an energy-efficient spectrum sensing heterogeneous cognitive
    radio sensor network (EH-CSRN) is considered. The proposed technique focuses on
    reducing the implementation cost, ensuring the sensing performance, and detection
    of usable channel time for the transmitting data by using a SS algorithm. It is
    based on cross-entropy to identify channel assignment scheme which reduces the
    deployment cost of network equipment, thereby promoting green communication. In
    [164], physical-layer security for EH-aided CR is proposed. Two scheduling algorithms
    that are advantageous for the users are described as channel-aware user scheduling
    (CaUS) and energy-aware user scheduling (EaUS). In CaUS, a user with maximal channel
    gain is selected for cooperative transmission users. In [165], time scheduling
    for a backscatter-aided RF-powered CR network is proposed, where multiple SUs
    transmit information to the same secondary gateway, which then allocates the time-resources
    in the backscatter mode and the harvest-then-transmit mode. For conducting time
    resource management, two auction-based time scheduling methods have been suggested.
    In [163], a heterogeneous cognitive radio network (CRN) that minimizes energy
    consumption due to sensing, reporting, and channel switching per unit by a joint
    objective function for spectrum sensing and energy efficiency is proposed. An
    energy-efficient resource allocation method is proposed in [166] for energy harvesting-based
    cognitive machine-to-machine (EH-CM2M) communication to control the limitations
    due to spectrum and battery capacity. The joint optimization of channel selection,
    peer discovery, power control, and allocation of time is done to maximize M2M
    transmitters’ energy efficiency. Resource allocation in wireless powered wideband
    CR under a practical non-linear EH model is considered in [167] to jointly optimize
    EH time, transmit power, channel allocation, and maximizing sum throughput of
    SUs. An optimal resource allocation is proposed in [168] to maximize the sum energy
    harvested and max-min fairness harvested energy in a wideband sensing-based CR
    network with SWIPT, subject to limitations on transmit power, rate, sub-channel
    assignment, and interference. A resource allocation in multi-carrier CR is proposed
    in [169], where PUs are powered by SUs in a cooperative manner. In this scheme,
    SU can concurrently transmit both its own data as well as transfer data to PU
    where harvest-then-transmit for synchronizing WPT and WIT. First wireless power
    transfer is done to PU, then two methods, subcarrier sharing and subcarrier exclusivity,
    are used for data transfer and resource allocation algorithms are used to maximize
    the rate of SU under limitations to achieve minimum PU rate and SU transmit power.
    B. Energy Efficiency Via CR In wireless communications, energy availability is
    often a significant problem, and SUs have to expend extra energy to identify several
    channels and continuouly switch between various channels. Thus, energy efficiency
    and spectrum efficiency are key aspects in CR. Currently, the battery is the primary
    energy source. However, limitations of battery life, periodic replacement, and
    environmental pollution have led researchers to look into sustainable, environmentally
    friendly power supply. In [170], the authors propose a CR system that harvests
    energy from the RF signal of PU during sensing time and detection time. An optimal
    sensing time is estimated, which maximizes the harvested energy and average throughput
    of the system. In [171], a wideband CR with SWIPT based EH is proposed, where
    max-min fairness in the allocation of resources between users is studied. Further,
    opportunistic accessing of the spectrum with imperfect CSI with maximization of
    throughput of the worst-case SU by performing a joint optimization of the sensing
    time is studied. In [172], a utility-optimal resource management and assignment
    scheme for cognitive radio based sensor networks (CRSNs) with EH is proposed with
    continuous supply energy for facilitating the power-constrained sensors. An online
    framework for managing the energy and spectrum resources and distribution of resources
    is proposed by Lyapunov optimization. Three stochastic processes are handled by
    this approach: dynamics of energy harvesting, channel utilization inaccuracy,
    and channel fading. The algorithm fulfills two significant objectives: first,
    regulating the harvest and use of energy by sensors while maintaining the queues
    for energy and data, and second, optimization of the use of spectrum which is
    licensed while preserving a bearable collision rate among the unlicensed and licensed
    users. A slotted mode CR system is presented in [173], in which SU is powered
    by EH from an ambient environment. The mechanism considers EH and SS in three
    non-overlapping time-slots using data fusion and decision fusion and focus on
    the “harvesting-sensing-throughput” by considering multi-slot spectrum sensing
    paradigm and maximizing SU’s throughput and finding out optimal sensing duration
    and threshold. Based on the sensing effects, in [174], the SU can work in both
    overlay or underlay mode while transmitting to maximize throughput, and continue
    in sleep mode to preserve energy, or extract energy from PUs. A partially observable
    Markov decision process method is suggested to evaluate the mode of transmission
    with a threshold on energy, and choose between SS or sleep mode depending upon
    actions of PU. With the increase of throughput, there is also an increase in SU’s
    computational complexity, latency, and the system’s energy demand. A two-way information
    exchange dynamic SS framework is proposed in [175] to enhance energy efficiency
    for transmitting data in licensed channels. Also, an energy-efficient optimal
    transmit power allocation scheme is derived to improve dynamic SS and data throughput.
    A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted overlay spectrum sharing
    for multi-user CRNs for improved spectrum utilization is proposed in [176]. Scheduling
    of a SU, which acts as a relay, is done to transmit both its own and PU signals
    using NOMA based cooperative spectrum sharing. Two scheduling schemes: reliability
    oriented secondary user scheduling (R-SUS), which helps in minimizing PU and SU
    outage probabilities, and fairness oriented secondary user scheduling (F-SUS)
    achieves superior user fairness are used, which achieves full diversity order.
    Outage performance analysis is studied in [177], [178] for wireless EH underlay
    Relay-Assisted CR networks with node position taken into consideration. Based
    on stochastic geometry, outage probability with and without relay-assisted transmission
    is derived, and selection of the optimum relay based on the comparisons of above-derived
    probabilities is made. In dominant interference and noise environments, a spectrum
    sharing scenario is considered in [179], where the SUs communicate via an interference-aided
    EH DF relaying with multiple primary transmissions and outage limitations. Relays
    use time-switching to shift between EH and data transfer. In the EH scenario,
    the advantage due to harvesting energy from primary interference, which acts as
    an energy source, suppresses the negative effects of primary interference and
    helps to maximize the secondary throughput. Also, using multiple antennas at the
    secondary relay aides in EH. In [180], an overlay spectrum sharing is considered
    for SWIPT based EH. By employing decode-and-forward relays for assistance during
    PU transmission under Nakagami- m fading channel, outage probability expressions
    for PU and IoT devices are derived. EH is done by IoT devices with RF signals
    from PU with maximizing system throughput and energy efficiency. In [181], joint
    optimization of EH and SS is done with limitations on energy causality, collision,
    and temporal correlation of channel sensing probability and mean channel capacity
    as the realizable throughput. Maximized throughput and optimum detection threshold
    is obtained, where the primary channel state is a discrete Markov process. In
    [182], a green CR that operates in a harvesting-transmitting fashion within each
    time slot is proposed where CR nodes harvest energy first then transmit data using
    the harvested energy. C. EH Using Cooperative Communication CR implementation
    with cooperative communication makes it possible for the SUs to get more chances
    for transmission by acting as a relay for PUs. In [183], the authors consider
    SU with ambient EH and infinite cell capacity that can possibly cooperate with
    PU for EH duration and relaying power to maximize throughput. The authors in [184]
    considered a CR system where SU creates a limited capacity energy and unlimited
    capacity data queues to store its own and PU’s data packets which are not delivered
    successfully. SU uses the Alamouti coding scheme for cooperation with PU, which
    has queuing delay limitations; after that, throughput maximization of SU is carried
    out subject to constraint of all data queues’ stability. In [185], a multichannel
    CR is suggested to improve the performance. At the same time, the transmitting
    SU divides the subchannel into two slots, the first one for sensing the PU by
    cooperative SS and the other for harvesting PU’s RF energy by multichannel EH.
    By jointly optimizing the subchannel set, the time required for sensing and power
    used for transmission, throughput, harvested energy, and effective energy utilization
    by SU is maximized. A collaborative scheme for sensing the spectrum (CSS) in EH-CWCPN
    is proposed in [186]. The clustering of CR nodes is done based on the received
    signal’s power levels for increasing the utilization of the spectrum. The time
    slot is shared between the harvesting of energy, sensing the spectrum, and information
    transmission. The optimization problem aims to maximize the throughput with energy
    and collision limitations under a detection threshold, which is obtained by formulating
    a fictitious cognitive node and number of clusters of cognitive nodes. Cooperative
    sharing model for CWPCNs with both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward
    (DF) protocols to maximize its uplink energy efficiency by using an optimization
    problem and then dividing it into two parts, uplink scheduling and cooperative
    power control, has been proposed in [187]. In [153], the cognitive sensors sense
    licensed channels and find out PU’s availability by computation over multiple-access
    channel (CoMAC) soft-decision cooperative spectrum sensing method. Energy-efficiency
    maximization is done for CSNs by using the time required for sensing, the detection
    threshold, and the length of symbol sequence as variables. In [188], a SWIPT-enabled
    cooperative network is proposed where a relay helps in PU’s transmission. Here,
    SUs acting as relays superimpose their data on PU’s information. SWIPT relay uses
    an energy-assisted decode-and-forward (EDF) protocol. A relay-based spectrum sharing
    protocol in CR is proposed in [189]. SU does RF-energy harvesting from PU in exchange
    for helping out in data transmission. Alamouti coding is used for primary data
    relaying. Superposition coding techniques are adopted for secondary data transmission
    in a continuous manner with joint decoding and interference cancellation methods
    employed at receiver. Finally, optimal power assignment is done to maximize SU
    throughput and guaranteed PU QoS. A dynamic way of accessing the channel has been
    suggested in [190] for clustered CR nodes where maximizing the resource distribution
    by finding out conditions for both inter and intra clusters is proposed, and sensing
    and switching to a licensed spectrum by a sensor is performed to increase energy
    efficiency and maximum utilization. Due to limited spectrum and increasing wireless
    devices and cognitive radio, a new cognitive wireless powered communication network
    (WPCN) is proposed in [192]. In the proposed WPCN, devices are powered via wireless
    energy transfer (WET) by a hybrid access point in the downlink and does wireless
    information transmission (WIT) in the uplink. Sum-throughput maximization is done
    for cognitive WPCN by jointly optimizing the time assignment for the harvest-then-transmit
    protocol and the WET/WIT transmit power. Both underlay and overlay-CR are used
    to maximize the sum throughput for wireless energy and information transfer by
    optimizing different transmission limitations. Figure 13 shows a WPCN network
    where W amount of time in each block is for WET, and the remaining time (T- W
    ) is for WIT. In [191], a double-deck cluster cooperative relay assistance model
    in hybrid spectrum sharing CR networks is proposed where energy efficiency is
    achieved by optimizing SUs for the upcoming 5G networks. FIGURE 13. A cognitive
    WPCN with cooperation between primary and secondary systems with the harvest-then-transmit
    protocol for WPCN [192]. Show All D. Applications in Diverse Fields With the advent
    of 5G, IoT, and its variants such as IoMT, IoBNT so on, there are promising potential
    applications of EH and SH in various cyber-physical systems and nanoscale networks.
    Some of these applications are listed below. First, we mention EH applications
    followed by SH and EH-SH applications. SWIPT-enabled wireless networks: EH radios
    can harvest energy from ambient renewable sources such as RF signals and also
    simultaneously transmit information. The harvested energy can be used instantaneously
    or stored in a supercapacitor for future communication, depending on the application.
    For example, low power sensors-equipped body area network (BAN), and wearable
    devices for smart health could exploit techniques like SWIPT. With proper energy
    management, these networks could be more energy efficient or greener. Ambient
    backscatter communication systems: AmBSC comes under passive IoT. The ambient
    backscatter devices (AmBSD) such as EH tags can harvest energy from ambient RF
    signals such as TV, Wi-Fi, etc. The number of EH rectennas varies from one type
    of AmBSC to another. Intuitively, it is expected that more number of EH rectennas
    can scavenge more ambient energy. However, as the number of rectennas increases,
    the size and complexity of the AmBSC would also increase. Cooperative D2D communications:
    EH relays are useful and can deliver superior performance when compared to D2D
    communication without relays if designed optimally. The performance benefits include
    increased data rates, network throughput, network lifetime. selection of the type
    of relay. Its optimal design depends on various aspects such as power and bandwidth
    constraints, acceptable complexity, to name a few. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)/IoT:
    IoT focuses on making the Internet universal and omnipresent and can impact many
    aspects that affect the standard of living of consumers. Technologies intended
    for IoT cover a broad range of areas comprising cyber-physical systems, automation
    at home, smart healthcare, smart cities, monitoring, intelligent ecosystems, smart
    transportation, and many more. The implementation of IoT devices, therefore, will
    provide substantial savings and revenues through the provision of control and
    management services. This acceleration has forced organizations to implement various
    methods to address this rapid growth and development and the problems connected
    with them. These include: allocation of sufficient spectrum bands in IoT, improving
    transmission efficiency, scarcity of spectrum, sharing of spectrum, interference
    among devices, etc. For example, a wireless sensor network (WSN) usually comprises
    of many affordable sensor nodes. Such nodes have restricted battery power capacity.
    When the node’s battery drains, it should be restored as the network may not function
    correctly if adequate nodes are not properly working. A feasible approach for
    extending the lifespan of wireless energy-limited networks is the energy harvesting
    methodology that has lately gained tremendous attention. It allows wireless nodes
    to scavenge energy from the local environment. In scenarios where the frequent
    replacement of batteries is infeasible, EH technologies are a suitable alternative.
    However, if deploying EH sensors is not feasible, hybrid sensors could be useful,
    which harvest energy whenever available and as a backup, depend on battery energy.
    These hybrid sensors could enhance battery life as well as the WSN life period.
    In wireless sensor networks, nodes typically transmit whenever an event of interest
    occurs. Since the continuous transmission is not required, the cognitive radio-enabled
    nodes can occasionally harvest spectrum and transmit data. This way, no dedicated
    bandwidth is necessary for these networks. Similarly, CR-enabled IoT communications
    over the harvested spectrum will improve spectrum utilization. However, various
    technical challenges and open problems such as spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation,
    dynamic spectrum access and management, modeling, and simulation of complex cognitive
    IoT environments need to be addressed. 5G and beyond: Next-generation 5G/6G mobile
    networks could use EH technologies in some of their network components. For instance,
    the hybrid base station of eNodeB/gNodeB partially depends on harvested energy.
    The inclusion of hybrid EH network entities could make the 5G/6G networks greener
    and reduce their carbon footprint. Applications of spectrum harvesting/sharing
    systems: Though there exist some unlicensed frequency bands (ISM bands), a majority
    of the frequency bands are licensed. As the spectrum is precious, it cannot be
    underutilized. As mentioned before, spectrum sharing/harvesting systems are useful
    in addressing these issues. Below, we present some of the applications of spectrum
    sharing or cognitive radio systems. Collaborative or cooperative spectrum sharing
    systems: The application of cooperative relaying techniques enhances secondary
    user performance for devices that opportunistically sense the primary user’s spectrum
    and harvest it. However, a secondary underlay user can only transmit while satisfying
    the constraints imposed on transmissions. These are interference constraints which
    the limit secondary’s performance. Cooperative relays adaptively adjust the parameters
    (e.g., gain) to optimize the end-to-end secondary performance in terms of error
    probability, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency. Passive IoT of AmBSC:
    In addition to backscatter tags, in non-reliable links, adaptive relays can be
    exploited to improve the AmBSC system performance. Incorporating both battery-less
    tags and efficient relays could enhance the reliability and data rates of AmBSC.
    The optimal placement of these tags and relays is an open problem and can be explored
    by researchers. Emergency communications: Professional mobile cognitive radios
    could sense and exploit the unused EM spectrum for emergency communications and
    public safety communications. These radios are useful for emergency services and
    could be used by ambulance, fire-station staff, and police, to name a few. Limited
    efforts in industry and research have been conducted to use small cell base stations
    installed on drones for emergency communications [199]. It is possible to use
    such flying base stations in disaster zones, emergencies, or in rural areas. Data
    security [200] is the primary obstacle in implementing such flying base stations.
    It is difficult to deploy complex security mechanisms with drones as there are
    resource-constrained devices. Furthermore, in implementing such networks, the
    aspects of user affiliation, drone operation, and bandwidth allocation are major
    bottlenecks. Thus, in such cases, energy harvesting and spectrum harvesting can
    be a very useful tool. The applications mentioned above are also valid for EH-SH
    systems. However, the performance of these systems is highly limited due to harvested
    energy and bandwidth limitations. These systems are more suitable for low power
    IoT applications in which nodes have minimal harvested energy and transmit at
    low data rates. Energy-aware optimal PHY and routing protocols need to be implemented
    to optimize their performance. SECTION V. Future Research Trends In this comprehensive
    survey, we reviewed EH and SH from different perspectives. We now summarize the
    key themes and the lessons. The rapid growth of feasible and implementable ESH
    techniques would lead to their application in various systems and networks from
    an economic perspective. Further, the standardization of these technologies in
    next-generation IoT and cyber-physical systems would enable rapid manufacturing
    and production. Thus, these technologies will eventually appear in the market
    as commercial products for various life needs, such as infotainment, smart health,
    smart transport services, etc. However, several obstacles exist in making this
    a reality due to several critical issues like security, privacy, and other technical
    challenges like poor or low efficiencies. For instance, most green energy harvesting
    approaches can only deliver limited power, limiting their applications. Similarly,
    spectrum harvesting methods’ success is also limited due to the highly random
    and dynamic nature of the primary users, causing dynamic spectrum access and management
    exceptionally challenging. Incorporating automation with artificial intelligence,
    machine learning, or deep learning wherever feasible and applicable would address
    this problem in more complex IoT or cyber-physical systems. Furthermore, the performance
    of EH and SH techniques and protocols implemented in secondary users or terminals
    will drastically vary depending on the mode of the operation and type of communication
    system or network. In addition to this, there are compatibility, interoperability,
    and scalability issues that need to be addressed in more complex systems that
    exploit EH and SH techniques. Some of the EH related challenges and issues may
    find their solutions in the form of smartly controlled energy harvesting, integrated
    storage, and efficient transmission approaches. Similarly, some of the SH related
    challenges could be resolved using hybrid and flexible modes of operation of spectrum
    sensing and sharing systems and networks. Various proprietary technologies (e.g.,
    ZigBee and Bluetooth) should come forward and work together to alleviate issues
    such as interoperability, compatibility, and scalability. This paper presented
    various EH and SH-enabled network architectures, techniques, protocols, and EH
    and SH standards. The optimization and practical implementation of these green
    systems and networks under various power and energy constraints form the lion’s
    share of further research in EH, SH, and ESH communication technologies. This
    paper also discussed various recent investigations in order to highlight technical
    challenges and open problems in areas such as green cognitive IoT and its variants
    such as energy-efficient xG, and M2M communications. Especially for EH and SH
    enabled IoT, there are issues such as privacy and security. Novel algorithms with
    moderate complexity to improve end-to-end performance in energy efficiency, spectral
    efficiency, reliability, and security for various IoT applications are very much
    needed. Smart and hybrid computing and communications techniques and algorithms
    would improve the ESH-enabled IoT and other systems and network performance. However,
    these techniques or algorithms should be feasible and practically implementable.
    Future technologies need to be green as much as possible. Eco-friendly communication
    technologies and IoT systems and its variants should replace power-hungry low
    energy-efficient, and low spectral-efficient systems and networks. Overall, despite
    the growth of EH and SH technologies in research for green communication and networking,
    their visibility in various commercial wireless networks and IoT is not significant.
    There exists a significant gap between analytical EH and SH techniques and protocols,
    and their implementation in practice. This gap needs to be minimized as much as
    possible. This bridging of theory and practice seems possible with out-of-the-box
    thinking and developing next-generation miniaturized electronics, as well as robust
    and secure algorithms based on intra-disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches
    wherever possible. A. Commercial and Economic Perspectives With the advent of
    feasible EH and SH techniques and technologies, manufacturing industries could
    find ample growth opportunities to develop new heterogeneous sensors and cognitive
    devices. These EH and SH enabled sensors and CRs would bring more revenue for
    various sectors related to IoT, 5G, defense, aviation, consumer electronics, etc.,
    Figure 14 depicts the predicted EH electronic devices market scenario [33]. The
    growth of the EH and SH components or devices market will lead to the economic
    development of various autonomous cyber-physical systems and next-generation wireless
    systems and networks. Figure 15 shows the projected SH or cognitive radios market.
    From the bar chart, we can see that there is approximately an increase of 164%
    in the CR market. The CR market may be viewed in two segments, namely, component
    and application. While the former segment includes antennas, RF, or millimeter
    wave (mmWave) electronics, the latter segment includes cognitive radio networks,
    CR-IoT, ad hoc networks, to name a few. Based on [24], the CR market is expected
    to be worth 7.44 billion USD by 2022. In it, the CR market mainly comprises of
    components such as software tools and hardware; the application consists of spectrum
    sensing, spectrum access, cognitive routing, etc. The statistics depicted pictorially
    in Figure 14 and Figure 15 reveal that significant and rapid growth in SH and
    EH devices and systems can be expected in various CPS and communication networks.

    (2017 to 2024) [19]. Show All B. Technology Readiness Level For the energy and
    spectrum efficiency research, in this section, we present a technology readiness
    level (TRL) diagram, as shown in Fig. 16, which maps the output levels of the
    research across different levels of maturity. The TRL is divided into three stages
    with TRLs level 1–2 denoting the fundamental research in the area, level 3–5 denoting
    the technology development, and level 5–6 denoting the technology demonstration
    in practical networks. The research in EH and SH technology has matured significantly
    with the greater push and awareness on the green communication networks and further,
    due to the focus on energy optimization. Many of the present communication networks
    and the future wireless networks are envisaged to be green networks with energy
    efficiency as one of the desired characteristics. On the other hand, due to spectrum
    scarcity and an increase in the number of users and diverse fields of applications,
    spectrum efficiency is a desirable feature. The TRL diagram gives a pictorial
    representation of the development of the EH and SH technology from the fundamental
    research level to the present and future aspects of implementation. FIGURE 16.
    TRL diagram for EH and SH technologies for the next generation wireless communication
    networks. Show All C. Tradeoffs for Green Networks Future wireless communication
    networks, specifically 5G and beyond 5G networks, have a greater push towards
    efficient green communication, which is seen in both academic and industrial research.
    For an AWGN channel, the tradeoff between the spectrum and energy efficiency can
    be expressed as [157], T ES = T S ( 2 T S −1) N o (11) View Source with T S =
    log 2 (1+ P B N o ) (12) View Source where P denotes the total transmit power,
    W denotes the total bandwidth, and N o denotes the noise power density. The present
    communication networks have orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
    as the key enabling technology, which forms the basis for 4G systems: For future
    communication networks, which include 5G and beyond 5G, new technologies which
    are more efficient than OFDM are being explored. The non-orthogonal access technologies
    studied in the literature that are considered as prime candidates for future network
    deployments are D2D and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) [23], with both
    the techniques focusing on inter-user interference. The capacity of non-orthogonal
    access technologies, as described above, can be expressed considering all the
    transmitter-receiver pairs as [154], C= B E h p , h m p ×[ ∑ p=1 N t log 2 (1+
    P p || h p | | 2 B N o +β ∑ N t m=1,m≠p P m || h m p | | 2 )], (13) View Source
    where N t is the total number of transmitter-receiver pairs, h denotes the channel
    gain, and β denotes the equivalent capability of interference cancellation. In
    comparison to the orthogonal schemes, the non-orthogonal schemes are able to achieve
    better spectral efficiency values. Further, the non-orthogonal schemes do not
    require additional costs as they do not need any significant hardware improvements
    over the existing infrastructure [49]. The implementation of energy-efficient
    techniques for future wireless communication networks needs to address several
    challenges, like whether the schemes be applied in a centralized or decentralized
    fashion. The answer to this lies in the way the infrastructure is utilized, and
    how the protocols are implemented. Future networks need to follow an approach
    in terms of maximum infrastructure utilization so that there is less strain on
    the resources For instance, the processing at the baseband level may be centralized,
    and the radio resource functionality may be divided across the whole network.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion The recent past has witnessed the rapid growth of heterogeneous
    sensors in IoT and proposals for architectures for their integration with the
    fifth-generation (5G) networks and beyond. Energy harvesting and spectrum harvesting
    technologies are essential to meet the requirements of two precious resources:
    energy and bandwidth for reliable and efficient communication. This survey paper
    provided a comprehensive overview of the EH and SH techniques for the next generation
    of wireless systems and networks. We presented an overview of the present trends
    of the EH and SH technologies, the implementation challenges, and open research
    areas. Specifically, we covered the techniques like the ambient RF-EH techniques
    and presented the spectrum harvesting techniques like those based on CR and cooperative
    sensing. Further, we introduced the TRL of the harvesting technologies and gave
    an overview of the future trends and challenges in the context of next-generation
    wireless networks. The EH and SH technologies have become an integral part of
    the next-generation wireless communication networks’ design and planning. This
    comprehensive survey provided various themes, perspectives, methods, and protocols
    that would serve as a useful resource for researchers in the field of advanced
    green and energy-efficient cognitive wireless systems and networks. Authors Figures

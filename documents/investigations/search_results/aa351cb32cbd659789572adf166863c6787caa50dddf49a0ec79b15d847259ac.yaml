    there are saturated frequency bands that affect the quality of service for new
    users. Cognitive radio provides an alternative solution to this problem through
    dynamic spectrum access. However, the solutions proposed in the current literature
    are focused on a centralized network and do not allow demonstrating the behavior
    in a multi-user environment, much less the effect that cooperation between secondary
    users can have. This article establishes a decision-making model for the best
    spectral opportunity selection with a cooperative approach in decentralized cognitive
    radio networks and contrasts its results with three multi-criteria decision-making
    algorithms: SAW, TOPSIS, and VIKOR. So, this research suggests a cooperative decision-making
    model based on four main modules. (1) a collaborative module for the exchange
    of information between SU; (2) a module for PU characterization; (3) a module
    of the probability of SU arrival; and (4) the SO feedback selection module. The
    results are obtained through simulations fed with experimental spectral occupancy
    data captured in a measurement campaign. Handoff and throughput were used as evaluation
    metrics, along with five levels of collaboration: 10%, 20%, 50%, 80%, and 100%,
    and eight different scenarios based on the type of network: GSM and Wi-Fi, the
    application type: real-time and best-effort, and the level of traffic: high and
    low. The contribution of this study lies in the fact that no current work includes
    the following relevant aspects for an adequate validation and evaluation of this

    second, the decision-making with cooperative strategies; third, different techniques
    for SO selection; fourth, the validation and evaluation with experimental spectral

    in the spectrum is the core of a cognitive radio network (CRN), made efficiently
    without interference. Through a set of techniques, it is established to choose
    the most suitable spectral opportunity (SO) based on secondary user (SU) requirements
    and conditions of the radio environment. An incorrect decision-making process
    affects network parameters such as the handoff rate. Despite its relevance, this
    function is not as explored as spectrum detection [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]].
    In CRN, the decision-making process is developed depending on the network architecture,
    which can be classified as architecture with infrastructure or no infrastructure
    [7,8]. In general, infrastructure-based CRN can be classified as centralized or
    decentralized. CRN without infrastructure is called distributed or ad-hoc networks
    [9,10]. According to the previous statements, CRN can operate with different approaches
    with advantages and disadvantages, and their usage revolves around the type of
    application [11]. Decentralized cognitive radio networks (DCRN) are a hybrid model
    whose architecture is characterized by using similar properties of centralized
    and distributed networks. Decentralized architectures have a simple implementation
    as well as other advantages [11]. Therefore, the decentralized approach is an
    efficient option for large networks. In CRNs, SUs must make intelligent decisions
    based on spectrum variation and the actions taken by other SUs. Under this dynamic,
    the probability that two or more SUs choose the same channel is high, especially
    when the number of SUs is greater than the number of available channels due to
    the negative externality of the network; the more SUs select the same channel,
    the less utility each SU can obtain, and the number of interferences due to simultaneous
    access will be higher [12]. To model the network under realistic traffic parameters,
    it is necessary to consider the collaboration between SUs. The challenge is to
    carry out the decision-making process for a DCRN, endowing the nodes with the
    ability to learn from the environment and proposing strategies that allow the
    SUs to exchange information cooperatively or competitively. According to each
    of the elements and problems exposed, this paper introduces a collaborative spectral
    decision model to improve the performance of cognitive radio networks based on
    the exchange of spectral information between SU and to comparatively evaluate
    the improvement in decision-making made by the SO selection model. The validation
    of the proposed model is strictly quantitative, with five evaluation metrics (EM)
    that were specified: number of Accumulative Average Handoff (AAH), number of Accumulative
    Average Failed Handoffs (AAFH), Average Bandwidth (ABW), Average Accumulative
    Delay (AAD), and Average Accumulative Throughput (AAT); along with eight assessment
    scenarios that considered two types of networks: GSM and Wi-Fi, two types of applications:
    Real-Time (RT) and Best Effort (BE), and two traffic levels: High Traffic (HT)
    and Low Traffic (LT). The proposed model results were compared with the SAW, TOPSIS,
    and VIKOR algorithms using experimental metering data in two frequency bands:
    Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communications and Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi). The
    effectiveness metrics are obtained based on an assessment methodology that can
    validate the proposed model. Currently, there are many models proposed for the
    selection of a spectral opportunity in cognitive radio networks. However, none
    of them include, in a combined way, the following relevant aspects for an adequate
    validation and evaluation of such a proposal: First, the consideration of a decentralized
    cognitive radio network; second, the decision-making with cooperative strategies;
    third, different techniques for SO selection; fourth, the validation and evaluation
    with experimental spectral occupancy data captured in measurement campaigns; last,
    the performance analysis in diverse networks, traffic levels, and types of applications
    [13,14]. This work is organized and presented in five sections. Section 2 describes
    the related studies. Section 3 describes the proposed model. Section 4 shows the
    simulation of the results obtained. Section 5 displays the discussion. The final
    section gives the general conclusions of the work. 2. Related works In the decision-making
    and cooperative strategies area, two publications are mentioned that work together
    with the two approaches related to this paper. The analyzed studies use heuristic
    and metaheuristic techniques and probabilistic strategies based on Markov chains
    and game theory. Both documents use multi-agent system models to establish or
    analyze common user goals through cooperative techniques. In Ref. [12], we present
    a review of the last five years in applications of intelligent systems, within
    which Cognitive Radio (RC) is included. In Ref. [15] studies the conflict between
    two levels of SU using game theory. A general characteristic of the documents
    is that they do not analyze the consequences of the decisions made, which indicates
    that cooperation strategies are based on the assumption that the utility of an
    SU is independent of the decisions made by other SUs, which is not the most viable
    strategy if scenarios in which SUs share or compete for specific resources are
    considered. In Ref. [15], it is limited to two SU is discussed and one Primary
    User (PU), with a centralized type architecture and traffic emulated by Qualnet.
    Although real traffic does not imply actual validations —since other exogenous
    variables can affect the model performance, such as energy consumption— the fact
    of using real traffic (captured in measurement campaigns) for the tests and validations
    guarantees an approach to more practical scenarios in reality. The research in
    Ref. [15] reviews the most relevant cooperative models for decision-making in
    multiagent systems. It presents models based on Markov decision processes, game
    theory, graph theory, and swarm intelligence. The different techniques are analyzed
    according to their criteria of optimality and application. Notable applications
    include diverse cognitive systems such as telecommunications networks, electrical
    systems, transportation systems, search and rescue teams, object transportation,
    exploration, and mapping. Finally, the document highlights advances and challenges
    for the coming years, the need to include advances in big data and the Internet
    of Things in the decision-making process, and the need to develop evaluation standards
    that allow comparison and facilitate their validation. Bearing in mind [16], their
    article “Optimized Secondary User Selection for Quality-of-Service Enhancement
    of a Two-Tier Multi-User Cognitive Radio Network: A Game Theoretic Approach\"
    uses game theory to study the conflict and cooperation between two levels of SU.
    The comparative analysis shows that the probability of channel blockage drops
    and saturation is reduced by 81%, 79%, and 84%, respectively, and the acceptance
    probability is increased by 91%. In conclusion, it is evident that there are still
    not many studies that jointly relate the spectrum decision approaches and the
    cooperative environment and also guide them towards cognitive radio networks,
    which becomes a contribution of this study. Additionally, working with actual
    spectral occupancy data from a measurement campaign gives the study a greater
    added value and differentiating value than the publications described above since
    they work with randomly generated spectral data. 3. Proposed model The proposed
    research methodology follows the next order. (1) A study was carried out on the
    state-of-the-art, which allows us to identify the most relevant aspects of spectral
    decision-making in CRN and the most pertinent algorithms in the current literature.
    (2) Based on the analysis of the previous information, a methodology was designed
    to assess the mobility performance of CR mobile networks. (3) Captured the spectral
    occupancy data, both in the GSM communications and Wi-Fi bands, to analyze the
    behavior of such bands and the PU. (4) The obtained data was processed to build
    organized databases on the behavior of the PU and the characteristics of spectral
    resources; these databases were classified by type of network (GSM and Wi-Fi)
    and traffic level (HT and LT). (5) The Decision Criteria (DC) were determined
    by the best SO selection, and the historical values were computed based on the
    information from the databases to complement them. (6) The most relevant spectral
    decision-making algorithms in the literature were chosen and developed. (7) Several
    algorithms were designed and developed for each module of the proposed collaborative
    model. (8) The model was created considering the performance of the algorithm.
    (9) Bearing in mind the analysis of the CRN state of the art, five EMs were used
    to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms and those chosen from the
    current literature. Eight assessment scenarios were proposed, as two types of
    networks, two types of applications (RT and BE), and two traffic levels (HT and
    LT) were considered. (10) Based on the previous information, a simulator was designed;
    it can quantitatively assess the performance of the algorithms, given the actual
    behavior of the PU. (11) The results obtained from simulations are used to establish
    a comparative performance assessment for each EM. Finally, (12) the comparative
    analysis allowed adjustments and modifications to the multivariable adaptive model.
    3.1. Proposed collaborative decision-making model This research proposes a collaborative
    decision-making model for multi-criteria decision-making, dwelling on various
    hybrid algorithms. Fig. 1 describes the model based on four main modules: (1)
    a collaborative module for the exchange of information between SU; (2) a module
    for PU characterization; (3) a module for the probability of SU arrival; and (4)
    the SO selection module, which were described in previous sections. The proposed
    model chooses the best SO dynamically, and it is smartly based on the decision-making
    criteria DC, the arrival probability (AP) of the channel, the estimated time of
    availability (ETA), Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and the Bandwidth
    (BW). Download : Download high-res image (345KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Proposed collaborative model. To assess the performance of the developed
    algorithms, a comparative analysis was carried out between them and the most relevant
    alternatives in the current literature. In contrast with the related work, the
    comparative assessment was validated using actual spectrum occupancy data streams
    captured in the GSM communications [17] and Wi-Fi bands [18] intended to model
    the actual behavior of PU [19]. In the performance assessment, the GSM and Wi-Fi
    networks were considered with Real-Time (RT) and Better Effort (BE) applications
    under two traffic levels, HT and LT. Five Evaluation Metrics (EM) were included:
    AAH, AAFH, ABW, AAD, and AAT. 3.2. Collaborative module: information exchange
    between SU One of the main novelties of this research is the collaboration feature
    between SU (secondary users) to determine the best SO. The disadvantages of centralized
    and distributed networks can be mitigated if the information responsibility is
    distributed among different control points, which is the base criterion of DCRN
    [20]. Since information and network management are decentralized in DCRN, collaboration
    between SUs is relevant for decision-making [21,22]. The present research implemented
    and adapted the collaboration feature to the proposed spectrum decision model
    through an information exchange module between SUs, now described. Initially,
    each SU stores information from its radio-electric environment, considering four
    different alternatives. Store as much information as possible, stock only the
    last k data, store the average of all information or store the median of the finished
    k data. To optimize the SU battery use, the first and third alternatives were
    dumped, leaving only the options of storing the last k data or their standard
    to choose which is incorporated in the proposed collaboration model; these store
    options were implemented determining which delivered fewer handoffs while the
    same information it was transmitted for 9 min, using the same decision-making
    algorithm. Results showed that values of k over 180, the last k data, are a better
    option with a difference of 29%. For k under 180, the average offers better results
    by 32%; according to this, we chose the alternative average. An added value of
    the average alternative is the one that carries information from various periods
    before k. 3.3. PU characterization module Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can be
    considered a differentiable function approximation, which is usually trained with
    the downward gradient [23], although a truncated form of Backpropagation Through
    Time (BPTT) was used to approximate the error gradient. In this research, we implemented
    the calculation with BPTT without truncation based on what was proposed by Graves
    in Ref. [24]. The operation of the LSTM neural network uses the notations established
    in Table 1, which are congruent with [23]. Table 1. Notations for the development

    not only the weighted sum of the current inputs but also the outputs at the immediately
    preceding time of the blocks in the hidden layer, and of the states of the other
    cells of the same block (except for the output gate, where the current state of
    the cells is required). In this sense, equations (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6))
    [23] result from the analysis of the LSTM block for each gate and the memory cell
    that makes up the model. For the input gate: (1) (2) For the forget gate: (3)
    (4) For the output gate: (5) (6) In order to describe the behavior of the cell,
    two elements must be taken into account. The first is the propagation function
    , which depends not only on the current inputs but also on the outputs in the
    immediately preceding time of the other blocks in the hidden layer. The second
    is the state of the neuron , which indicates whether the neuron is retaining the
    information or will forget it and depends on the output of the forget gate and
    the input gate. Fig. 2 describes the LSTM architecture used for PU characterization.

    output of the neuron will indicate whether new learning was generated or the stored
    information is retained. With the above clear, it is concluded that the cell state
    and output are given by equations (7), (8), (9)) [23]. Neuron state: (7) (8) Neuron
    Output: (9) For the characterization module, LSTM was used. The training described
    in Fig. 3 starts by initializing each neuron with random values between −1 and
    1. Afterward, the output of each training example is assessed against the expected
    outcome. If the delivered answer does not match the desired one, the algorithm
    computes the error between the output obtained by the system and the expected
    one. Each weight from the gates is corrected (input, output, forget), adding the
    weight in the cells through a weighting-based application, and making tangential
    use and sigmoid functions until all training examples are processed. The model
    output is approximated to the expected one through the error reduction [26]. Download

    Flowchart for LSTM training. 3.4. Module of the probability of SU arrival For
    this module, the Multiple-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) algorithm was
    used. The value of the control weights of the matrices using the backpropagation
    algorithm is set with the following rules. ● Initialize the weights of the matrices
    with numbers between −1 and 1. ● Implement the backpropagation algorithm to obtain
    Am for any x(i). ● Compute the cost J(ɵ) of backpropagation based on Equation
    (10), adapted from Ref. [27], to establish the difference between the expected
    and obtained values; the goal is to approximate this value as much as possible
    to 0. (10) Where J(ɵ) is the cost of backpropagation; is the number of layers
    of the neural network; is the matrix of control weights; is the output of layer
    x. ● Compute the partial seeking derivatives to minimize the maximum error (Equation
    (11)). (11) 3.5. Channel selection module: FFAHP algorithm For the channel selection,
    the FFAHP algorithm was used, and four decision criteria were chosen: AP, ETA,
    SINR, and BW. Their values could be determined taking into consideration the experimental
    occupancy data. The FFAHP algorithm, part of the FAHP algorithm described in Ref.
    [28], increases the accuracy of the SO selection. To achieve this, FFAHP feeds
    back the information from previous SO assessments (see Fig. 4). The SO selection
    is founded on the judgement of the current spectrum information and prior evaluations
    (see Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (266KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Scheme of the proposed FFAHP algorithm. Fig. 4 illustrates the design
    of the FFAHP algorithm. At first, the spectrum detection process gathers information
    on frequency, power, and time. The number of captured data points depends on the
    parameter''s resolution, bandwidth, span, and sweep time set in the spectrum analyzer.
    Then, the data is stored in a database. Repeatedly, the information processing
    unit computes the values of DC: AP, ETA, SINR, and BW and normalizes them over
    a base of 100. The FAHP algorithm receives the updates from each DC and proceeds
    to assess each SO. If the RT application uses Equation (12), and whether the BE
    application uses Equation (13). (12) (13) The range of the assessment score can
    be between 0 and 100, where 100 is the best possible score. The SO with the highest
    score is the target SO. The SO with the second-highest score is the backup SO.
    And, the following SO candidates are SO candidates from higher to lower scores.
    In this part of the process, each SO is ranked based only on the current information
    from the DC. However, the SO best assessment cannot be chosen because this evaluation
    rate is pondered with the previous ones. The feedback process receives the current
    appraisals (PS) of each SO and evaluates them with the value of the most recent
    evaluations (LS) and the average value of the assessments (AS) carried out over
    the past hour. This ponderation delivers, as a result, the definitive SO ranking.
    Equation (14) describes the previous procedure. (14) Where α and β ϵ [0,1], the
    final score is the last assessment value from the ith (in the case of RT) or jth
    (in the case of BE) SO. The SO with the best final assessment is chosen to assess
    the transmission of SU data. Afterward, the feedback block transfers the value
    of the PS to the LS and updates the AS value according to the new LS value. If
    the chosen SO is directly busy, the FFAHP algorithm overwrites the LS value at
    zero for the respective SO. To determine the values of α and β, an autoregressive
    experimental analysis is established with different combinations of α and β for
    a set of predetermined data. Their values offer the highest accuracy in the selection
    of SO. The experimental accuracy was 87% for α = 0.60 and β = 0.35. 3.6. Multi-criteria
    decision making algorithms (MCDM) The three MCDM models with which the results
    obtained by the proposed model are described below are: Simple Additive Weighting
    (SAW), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)
    y Multi-Criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution (VIKOR). 3.6.1. Simple Additive
    Weighting (SAW) This algorithm develops a decision matrix composed of attributes
    and alternatives for each intersection of the matrix. The algorithm assigns a
    weight according to the designer''s criteria; this allows for establishing a score
    for each evaluated Spectral Opportunity (SO) and obtaining a ranking of all the
    alternatives. The SO with the highest score will be the one selected (Cesar Hernández,
    Giral, & Páez, 2015a; Ramírez Pérez & Ramos Ramos, 2010). Alternative Ai is defined
    by Equation (15) (Ramirez-Perez & Ramos-R, 2013). (15) Where ri,j delong to the
    matrix, and the sum of the weights is1. 3.6.2. Technique for Order Preference
    by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) The development of this algorithm is
    based on the determination of two components: the ideal solution of the system
    and the solution that cannot be accepted in any situation. To achieve this, it
    is necessary to compare the results obtained to determine which solution is the
    closest possible to the ideal and which is the farthest away (which will not be
    accepted). Such a metric is obtained from the Euclidean distance (Cesar Hernandez,
    Giral, & Paez, 2015a; Ramirez Perez & Ramos Ramos, 2010). The procedure of the
    TOPSIS algorithm is described in (Cesar Hernández, Giral, & Páez, 2015a; Ramírez
    Pérez & Ramos Ramos, 2010; Ramirez-Perez & Ramos-R, 2013). At first, the decision
    matrix X is constructed and normalized using the square root method; then, the
    ideal and worst solutions are determined. Subsequently, for each alternative,
    the Euclidean distance D is calculated. Finally, the alternatives are arranged
    in descending order according to the preference index given by equation (16).
    (16) Di− is the Euclidean distance for the cost set, and Di+ is the Euclidean
    distance for the benefit set. In (Cesar Hernández, Vasquez, & Páez, 2015), TOPSIS
    is used to select the best SO by evaluating the level of interference per adjacent
    channel and the average number of handoffs performed. The results are compared
    with another algorithm and their respective versions by combining them with three
    prediction algorithms based on time series. 3.6.3. Multi-Criteria Optimization
    and Compromise Solution - VIKOR “The VIKOR method assumes that each alternative
    is evaluated according to each criterion function and the ranking can be developed
    through the comparison of the measures that are closest to the ideal alternative\"
    (Cesar Hernandez et al., 2015; Cesar Hernandez, Vasquez et al., 2015; Tanino,
    Tanaka, & Inuiguchi, 2003). VIKOR was developed to optimize complex systems with
    multiple criteria. Therefore, it is adept at determining the trade-off in a ranked
    list, even with conflicting criteria, which makes it a suitable algorithm for
    decision-making in SA (Gallardo-Medina, Pineda-Rico, & Stevens-Navarro, 2009).
    The VIKOR algorithm follows the steps described in (Cesar Hernandez, Giral, &
    Paez, 2015b; Cesar Hernandez et al., 2015; Ramirez Perez & Ramos Ramos, 2010;
    E. Stevens-Navarro et al., 2012). For each decision criterion, the best and worst
    values are determined based on whether they are benefits or costs. Then the values
    of Qi are calculated for i = 1, 2, 3, …, M, given by equation (17). (17) Where,
    and 0≤ γ ≤ 1. Given the values of Q for all i belonging to M, the candidate SOs
    are ranked from highest to lowest. Finally, the selected SO is given by the optimal
    Q. In (César Hernández et al., 2015), VIKOR is used to select the best SO in the
    GSM frequency band uplink, evaluate the level of handoff blockages, and compare
    the results with two other SA algorithms. 3.7. Evaluation metrics In order to
    assess the performance of the spectrum decision algorithms, five EMs were specified
    as described in Table 2. The table shows the acronym, description, and type of
    EM; the latter refers to whether the metric is beneficial (the higher, the better)
    or costly (the lower, the better). The average word in the EM means that the results
    correspond to the average values delivered by the experiments conducted. Table
    2. ME used in the assessments of the proposed model. Acronym Name Description
    Type of EM AAH Number of Accumulative Average Handoff It is the total number of
    handoffs during the 9 min of transmission. Cost AAFH Number of Accumulative Average
    Failed Handoffs It is the total number of handoffs that the SU could not materialize
    given that the respective targeted SO were occupied. Cost ABW Average Bandwidth
    It is the average BW used by the SU during the 9 min of transmission. Benefit
    AAD Average Accumulative Delay It is the total average time taken by a SU to transmit
    a certain amount of information. Cost AAT Average Accumulative Throughput It is
    the effective data rate transmitted by the SU during the 9 min of transmission.
    Benefit In order to facilitate the comparative analysis of each algorithm, the
    EM relative rates (in percentage) were computed. For the beneficial type metrics,
    the relative value (Rel) of the i algorithm was calculated based on the absolute
    value (Abs) and the maximum value (Max) of the EM, as described in Equation (18).
    For the cost type metrics, the relative rate (Rel) of the i algorithm was computed
    based on the absolute value (Abs) and the maximum value (Max) of the EM, as described
    in Equation (19). (18) (19) For the global scores, Equation (20) describes the
    weighting [29,30]. In this case, the same weight was assigned to each metric (25%),
    assuming AHH and AAFH as one because they describe similar processes. AAFH has
    the lowest weighting because its effect is encompassed within the AAH metric.
    (20) 4. Results simulation Due to the large amount of information obtained from
    simulations and the aim of not combining too many curves that were hard to read,
    it was decided to show the performance of the proposed model for the throughput
    EM. The other EMs are described subsequently in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table
    6, Table 7. The comparison of the performance model was made with the SAW, TOPSIS,
    and VIKOR algorithms; Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 describe those
    results. Each algorithm was assessed individually in all possible scenarios, including
    five different levels of cooperation between SU (10%, 20%, 50%, 80%, and 100%)
    and traces with HT and LT, in RT and BE applications, and in GSM and Wi-Fi networks
    for all five EM. Table 3. Comparative assessment of the collaboration level for

    3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 show the corresponding comparative percentages
    of the algorithm performance in the EM for different levels of cooperation (10%,
    20%, 50%, 80%, and 100%) and traces with HT and LT in RT and BE applications,
    in GSM and Wi-Fi networks. They aim to analyze the collaboration strategy level
    of dependence as its contribution. Table 6 shows the percentages of comparative
    global assessment of the performance of each algorithm in all eight scenarios
    designed for two levels of collaboration (10% and 100%). 5. Discussion During
    the development of the assessment and validation phases of the selected algorithms,
    several parameters (or EM) were included that make the presentation of information
    difficult, even though the resulting assessment provides a more robust and informative
    evaluation. Therefore, the initial assessment phase focused on contrasting the
    collaboration performance between secondary users (SU) to choose the best two
    levels and discard the remaining three. The number of combinations to include
    in the comparison tables has been reduced. The results obtained show that the
    performance is improved for each algorithm by increasing the level of collaboration.
    However, this improvement does not exceed 10% in most cases. Therefore, it is
    worth considering to comparatively assess each algorithm in all scenarios, considering
    the highest and lowest collaboration levels (10% and 100%). The results obtained
    also enable the analysis of the performance of each algorithm (including two levels
    of collaboration) in all eight scenarios designed for each assessment metric.
    Therefore, the comparative assessment is carried out horizontally to compare the
    algorithms in different plots. FFAHP-100 presents better results than the AAH
    in the GSM network for three out of four scenarios. In the GSM network for three
    out of four scenarios, TOPSIS-100 performs FFAHP only in the BE-HT scenario by
    a difference of 6.5%. A similar situation shows up in the Wi-Fi network because
    FFAHP-100 has the best performance except for BE-LT, where SAW outperforms it
    by a difference of 6%. Compared to AAFH, SAW (in BE-LT and RT-HT) and TOPSIS (in
    BE-HT and RT-LT) share the best performance in the GSM network while in the Wi-Fi
    network no algorithm dominates in more than one scenario. On average, the best
    performance is shown by the FFAHP-100 algorithm, closely followed by SAW and VIKOR,
    respectively. FFAHP maintains dominance in three out of four GSM scenarios, as
    observed in the ABW metric. Only in RT-HT, SAW relegates FFAHP-100 to the fifth
    scenario by a difference of 15%, delivering similar on-average performance levels.
    In the Wi-Fi case, VIKOR leads in three scenarios, closely followed by SAW which
    has the same performance as VIKOR on average. In terms of AAD, FFAHP also dominates
    in this metric in three out of the four GSM scenarios. Only in BE-HT, VIKOR relegates
    FFAHP-10 to the second spot, by a difference of 1.7%. However, FFAHP surpasses
    VIKOR by far on average. In the case of Wi-Fi, FFAHP takes, again, the lead spot
    in three scenarios. SAW relegates FFAHP-100 to the fifth spot in BE-LT by a difference
    of 1.6%. However, they both share first place on average. In terms of AAT, the
    same results are evidenced. FFAHP dominates in three out of four scenarios in
    GSM. SAW leaves FFAHP-100 in third place with a RT-HT difference of 1.5%. Both
    alternatives, on average, secure the first place. For the Wi-Fi case, FFAHP once
    again leads in three scenarios. Only in BE-LT, SAW relegates FFAHP-100 to third
    place, with a difference of 1.5%. Nevertheless, both strategies share first place
    on average alongside VIKOR. Finally, the results summarize the global performance
    of each algorithm (including the collaboration levels of 10% and 100%). In terms
    of metrics, FFAHP and SAW share the top performances, both in GSM and Wi-Fi networks
    for most metrics. In the AAFH-GSM case, TOPSIS takes the most prominent spot,
    closely followed by SAW. In ABW-Wi-Fi and AAT-Wi-Fi, VIKOR also shares first place
    with SAW and FFAHP. When the analysis is based on the type of scenario, there
    is no evidence that one algorithm widely dominates over the others in high or
    low traffic or a real-time or better effort. Hence, a weighting is needed to find
    the algorithms with the best performance in each network. According to Tables
    6 and if AAFH is removed from the equation in the GSM network, FFAHP is the leading
    stand-alone option. This quality has no significant effect since the number of
    failed handoffs is much lower than the total handoffs. On the Wi-Fi network, both
    FFAHP and SAW show similar performance levels. However, FFAHP is chosen for the
    Wi-Fi case to reduce the complexity of the model. Then, the question is whether
    to use FFAHP-100 (collaboration level of 100%) or FFAHP-10 (collaboration level
    of 10%). Table 6 shows that, dropping the AAFH metric aside, FFAHP-100 has a 97.87%
    performance, while FFAHP-10 has a 95.50% performance. Hence, this slight performance
    difference of 2% with a 90% difference in collaboration makes FFAHP-10 a better
    alternative. A similar analysis in Wi-Fi reveals that FFAHP-100 reaches a performance
    of 98.94%, while FFAHP-10 reaches 94.90%. This difference of 4% in performance
    and 90% in collaboration makes FFAHP-10 a better alternative. 6. Conclusions Given
    the results obtained in the module for spectral opportunity selection, it can
    be concluded that no algorithm outperforms the others in all assessment metrics
    and the simulation scenarios (type of network, type of application, traffic level).
    Each algorithm demonstrates satisfactory performance for specific assessment metrics
    and particular scenarios. This operation prompts the design of a multivariable
    adaptive module of spectral selection that can change its behavior according to
    the application requirements developed during the communication of the SU. The
    FFAHP algorithm exhibited the best overall performance, followed by SAW. This
    result corroborates the importance of feedback and learning strategies for spectrum
    selection algorithms. In terms of the collaboration module, the collaboration
    level between SU is directly proportional to the algorithm''s performance. Nonetheless,
    the improvement rate is not significantly high. An increase in the collaboration
    level by 1000% (from 10% to 100%) only improves approximately 10% for the algorithm.
    The analysis of results also revealed that the algorithm with the best performance
    during the exchange of information between SU is the average method, which can
    indirectly store the historical data of the previous reports. In future work,
    two guidelines are proposed: the first consists of performing an evaluation and
    validation using the most relevant autonomous learning algorithms in the current
    literature. For instance, support vector machines for classification processes
    and employ reinforcement learning for developing the adaptation component. And,
    the second is to perform an evaluation and validation with cognitive radio equipment,
    that emulates a cognitive radio network instead of simulations, even with experimental
    spectral occupancy data. Funding statement This research was funded by the Centro

    The increasing demand for wireless communication services and the exponential
    growth of mobile devices have led to a critical challenge in modern communication
    networks—the scarcity of available radio frequency (RF) spectrum. Traditional
    spectrum allocation policies have relied on static assignments of specific frequency
    bands to licensed users, resulting in inefficient spectrum utilization. Many frequency
    bands remain underutilized, while others suffer from congestion, leading to suboptimal
    performance and an inability to meet the ever-growing demands of wireless applications.
    Cognitive radio (CR) networks have emerged as a promising solution to address
    the problem of spectrum scarcity and enhance spectrum efficiency [1]. A cognitive
    radio is an intelligent and adaptive device capable of autonomously sensing its
    environment, learning from the observed conditions, and making informed decisions
    to opportunistically access underutilized or unused frequency bands, known as
    spectrum holes [2]. Unlike conventional communication systems, cognitive radio
    networks enable secondary users, also known as unlicensed users, to dynamically
    share the spectrum with primary users, who hold licensed rights to specific frequency
    bands. The primary objective of cognitive radio is to maximize spectrum utilization
    while ensuring coexistence with primary users and avoiding harmful interference.
    To fully exploit the potential of cognitive radio networks, it is essential to
    develop intelligent mechanisms for spectrum sensing, decision-making, and channel
    selection. Spectrum sensing involves identifying spectrum opportunities, which
    can be challenging due to uncertainties arising from noise, fading, and variations
    in the RF environment. Decision-making in cognitive radio entails determining
    whether to access a detected spectrum hole or continue searching for a more suitable
    opportunity, taking into account diverse criteria, such as Quality of Service
    (QoS) requirements and the priority of primary users. Furthermore, selecting the
    optimal channel for secondary user transmission becomes crucial, considering factors
    like signal quality, interference levels, and channel conditions. This paper proposes
    an intelligent approach to dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks,
    leveraging the power of fuzzy logic [3]. Fuzzy logic offers a robust framework
    for handling uncertainties and imprecision in cognitive radio decision-making,
    making it well-suited for optimizing spectrum access. The objectives of this research
    are to enhance spectrum utilization, improve user experience, and enable efficient
    coexistence with primary users. In the following sections, we present our novel
    fuzzy-based algorithms for spectrum sensing, decision-making, and channel selection
    in cognitive radio networks. Additionally, we discuss the integration of fuzzy
    logic with machine learning techniques to enable the cognitive radio system to
    adapt and optimize its performance over time. The effectiveness of our proposed
    approach is evaluated through extensive simulations and comparisons with conventional
    methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of our intelligent dynamic spectrum
    access approach, providing a promising step towards achieving efficient spectrum
    utilization and unlocking the full potential of cognitive radio networks in future
    wireless communication systems. The primary objective of the paper is to propose
    an intelligent approach to dynamic spectrum access by utilizing fuzzy logic, a
    robust tool capable of handling uncertainty and ambiguity in the decision-making
    process. The paper addresses the significant challenges in modern communication
    networks characterized by limited available spectrum and inefficient utilization.
    Traditional static spectrum allocation policies have led to underutilization of
    many frequency bands and congestion in others, resulting in suboptimal network
    performance. Cognitive radio networks offer a promising solution by enabling secondary
    users to access underutilized spectrum bands while ensuring coexistence with primary
    users and minimizing interference. However, effectively addressing these challenges
    and maximizing spectrum efficiency require intelligent mechanisms for spectrum
    sensing, decision-making, and channel selection. The paper proposes to leverage
    fuzzy logic as a powerful tool to handle the uncertainties and variations in the
    radio frequency spectrum for more efficient dynamic spectrum access in cognitive
    radio networks. This paper includes other section such as section 2 discuss about

    Spectrum Sensing and Decision-Making Challenges in Cognitive Radio Networks. Section

    result and discussions describes the Performance analysis and Section 6 is said
    to be Conclusions. 2 Literature review Cognitive radio (CR) networks have gained
    significant attention in recent years due to their potential to address the spectrum
    scarcity problem and improve spectrum utilization in wireless communication systems.
    Several researchers have explored various aspects of cognitive radio, including
    spectrum sensing, decision-making, channel selection, and resource allocation,
    using a variety of techniques, including fuzzy logic, machine learning, game theory,
    and optimization algorithms. In this literature review, we present a summary of
    key research works related to cognitive radio and its intelligent applications.
    Zhao, Tong, and Swami [4] presented a decentralized cognitive medium access control
    (MAC) protocol for ad hoc networks, formulated as a partially observable Markov
    decision process (POMDP). The proposed protocol allows nodes to opportunistically
    access spectrum bands based on learned information, maximizing spectrum utilization
    while considering uncertainty. Chen, Zhang, Li, and Liu [5] conducted an in-depth
    survey on spectrum sensing techniques in cognitive radio networks. They discussed
    the requirements, challenges, and design trade-offs in spectrum sensing, including
    various sensing methods such as energy detection, matched filtering, and cyclostationary
    feature detection. Cabric, Mishra, and Brodersen [6] addressed implementation
    issues in spectrum sensing for cognitive radios. They discussed practical considerations,
    such as sensing time, detection threshold, and energy efficiency, and proposed
    a spectrum sensing architecture to mitigate hardware impairments and uncertainties.
    Ghasemi and Sousa [7] provided an extensive review of spectrum sensing techniques,
    including cooperative spectrum sensing and collaborative spectrum sensing. They
    discussed the performance trade-offs and challenges associated with these techniques
    and highlighted the importance of reliable spectrum sensing in cognitive radio
    networks. Kim and Loo [8] presented a fuzzy logic-based spectrum sensing approach
    for cognitive radio networks. Their method used fuzzy inference to make spectrum
    occupancy decisions, taking into account multiple parameters, such as signal-to-noise
    ratio, interference levels, and signal strength. Haykin [9] published a comprehensive
    book on cognitive radio principles and applications. The book covers various topics,
    including spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and system implementation,
    providing a holistic view of cognitive radio technology. Lu and Li [10] proposed
    a fuzzy logic-based adaptive routing scheme for cognitive radio networks. Their
    approach enables dynamic route selection based on fuzzy reasoning, considering
    factors like channel quality, interference levels, and available spectrum bands.
    Zhang, Birenjith, and Kuri [11] conducted a survey on intelligent decision-making
    techniques for dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. They reviewed
    various approaches, including fuzzy logic, reinforcement learning, and game theory,
    and discussed their applications in spectrum access and management [12]. 3 Methodology
    The primary focus is to tackle the complex challenges associated with spectrum
    scarcity and variability, as well as the need for efficient spectrum utilization.
    Our approach involves empowering secondary users to access underutilized frequency
    bands opportunistically while ensuring minimal interference with primary users.
    Central to our methodology is the application of fuzzy logic, which proves valuable
    in handling uncertainties and fluctuations inherent in the radio frequency spectrum.
    By leveraging fuzzy-based spectrum sensing algorithms, we achieve robust and reliable
    detection of spectrum opportunities by accounting for the inherent imprecision
    and ambiguity present in factors such as received signal strength and noise conditions.
    This framework addresses the crucial aspects of spectrum sensing, decision-making,
    and channel selection, ultimately enhancing the overall efficiency and adaptability
    of cognitive radio networks. 3.1 Spectrum sensing and decision-making challenges
    in cognitive radio networks Cognitive radio networks represent a promising paradigm
    for addressing the pressing challenges of spectrum scarcity and inefficient utilization.
    By allowing secondary users to opportunistically access underutilized frequency
    bands while avoiding interference with primary users, cognitive radio networks
    offer the potential to dynamically allocate spectrum resources. However, the success
    of cognitive radio networks hinges on overcoming the complex spectrum sensing
    and decision-making challenges inherent in these dynamic environments. Spectrum
    sensing involves the detection of available frequency bands for opportunistic
    transmission. However, the radio frequency spectrum is characterized by uncertainty
    and variability due to factors such as fading, noise, and dynamic primary user
    activities. These uncertainties can lead to false positives or false negatives
    in spectrum sensing, impacting the accuracy of decision-making processes. The
    availability of spectrum bands is highly dynamic. Primary users might vacate a
    frequency band at any moment, creating opportunities for secondary users. Efficient
    spectrum utilization necessitates rapid and accurate spectrum sensing to identify
    these dynamic availability windows. However, the time-varying nature of spectrum
    occupancy poses challenges for timely and reliable detection. Cognitive radio
    networks operate in a shared environment alongside traditional wireless systems.
    Ensuring coexistence and minimizing harmful interference with primary users is
    a critical consideration. Spectrum sensing methods must accurately differentiate
    between primary user signals and other sources of noise and interference. Setting
    appropriate decision thresholds for spectrum sensing is a trade-off between sensitivity
    and specificity. A low threshold increases the likelihood of detecting available
    spectrum but raises the risk of false alarms. Conversely, a high threshold reduces
    false alarms but might miss spectrum opportunities. Striking the right balance
    is crucial for efficient spectrum utilization. To address these challenges, fuzzy
    logic emerges as a powerful solution. Fuzzy logic can model imprecision and uncertainty
    in spectrum sensing and decision-making as shown in Fig. 1. By using linguistic
    variables, membership functions, and fuzzy rules, it can enhance spectrum sensing
    accuracy, adaptability, and coexistence while effectively managing trade-offs.
    Fig. 1 Block diagram Full size image 3.1.1 Sensing and spectrum management unit
    This block is responsible for continuously monitoring the spectrum to detect the
    availability of different frequency bands and identifying opportunities for opportunistic
    spectrum access. It performs spectrum sensing, which helps in identifying spectrum
    holes or unused frequency bands. 3.1.2 Fuzzy logic decision making The sensed
    data from the Sensing and Spectrum Management Unit is fed into the Fuzzy Logic
    Decision Making block. Fuzzy Logic is used here to make intelligent decisions
    based on the uncertainty and imprecise nature of spectrum availability and utilization.
    Fuzzy Logic takes input from the spectrum sensing unit and generates appropriate
    control signals for the Spectrum Access and Allocation Controller [13]. 3.1.3
    Spectrum access and allocation controller The Spectrum Access and Allocation Controller
    receive the control signals from the Fuzzy Logic Decision Making block. Based
    on these signals and other factors, it decides which frequency bands should be
    used by the Cognitive Radio Transceiver [14]. The controller dynamically allocates
    and manages the spectrum resources to ensure optimal utilization while avoiding
    interference to licensed users. 3.1.4 Cognitive radio transceiver The Cognitive
    Radio Transceiver is a software-defined radio that can adapt its operating parameters,
    such as frequency, power, and modulation scheme, based on the instructions received
    from the Spectrum Access and Allocation Controller. It utilizes the allocated
    spectrum bands efficiently, making it capable of intelligently accessing available
    spectrum resources without causing harmful interference. The Intelligent Dynamic
    Spectrum Access using Fuzzy Logic in Cognitive Radio Networks allows the cognitive
    radio devices to intelligently access and utilize the available spectrum, making
    CRNs more efficient and adaptive in dynamic and congested wireless environments.
    4 Optimizing spectrum utilization using fuzzy logic Optimizing spectrum utilization
    using fuzzy logic involves a theoretical analysis of how fuzzy logic can enhance
    the decision-making process in cognitive radio networks to achieve efficient and
    effective allocation of spectrum resources. Spectrum scarcity is a critical issue
    in wireless communication networks. Cognitive radio technology allows secondary
    users to access unused spectrum bands without interfering with primary users.
    However, dynamic and uncertain conditions necessitate intelligent spectrum allocation.
    Fuzzy logic is a powerful approach for decision-making in complex and uncertain
    environments [15]. In cognitive radio networks, fuzzy logic enables the representation
    and manipulation of imprecise and uncertain information to make more nuanced decisions.
    Fuzzification converts crisp input values into fuzzy linguistic terms using the
    defined membership functions. The inference engine applies fuzzy rules to determine
    the degrees of compatibility between the inputs and the rules’ antecedents. Aggregation
    combines the results of the fuzzy rules, often using the maximum operator for
    OR-based rules and minimum operator for AND-based rules. Defuzzification transforms
    the aggregated fuzzy output back into a crisp value, which represents the optimal
    spectrum allocation decision. 4.1 Spectrum utilization efficiency Spectrum Utilization
    Efficiency (SUE) measures how effectively the available spectrum resources are
    being utilized. It can be calculated as the average allocated spectrum over the
    total available spectrum: $$SUE = \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} {Allocated\\,Spectrumi/Total\\,Available\\,Spectrum}$$
    (1) Where, N is the total number of samples. Allocated Spectrumi is the allocated
    spectrum for the i-th sample. Total Available Spectrum is the maximum possible
    spectrum that could be allocated 4.1.1 Step 1: Define input and output variables
    In this step, you identify the input and output variables that influence spectrum
    allocation 4.1.2 Step 2: Define membership functions Membership functions quantify
    the degree to which an input value belongs to a linguistic term. In our example,
    we define membership functions for each linguistic term: For input “SignalStrength”:
    μ_Weak(SS) = trimf(SS, [0, 0, 50]) μ_Moderate(SS) = trimf(SS, [0, 50, 100]) μ_Strong(SS)
    = trimf(SS, [50, 100, 100]) For input \"Interference\": μ_Low(IF) = trimf(IF,
    [0, 0, 50]) μ_Medium(IF) = trimf(IF, [0, 50, 100]) μ_High(IF) = trimf(IF, [50,
    100, 100]) 4.1.3 Step 3: Define fuzzy rules Fuzzy rules capture the relationships
    between input and output linguistic terms. The rule matrix ruleList encodes these
    rules: Rule 1: If SignalStrength is Weak and Interference is Low, then Allocation
    is Low. Rule 2: If SignalStrength is Moderate and Interference is Medium, then
    Allocation is Medium. Rule 3: If SignalStrength is Strong and Interference is
    High, then Allocation is High. 4.1.4 Step 4: Evaluate fuzzy logic In this step,
    the actual values for Signal Strength and Interference are evaluated using fuzzy
    logic to determine the optimal Allocation value. Let’s say we have: SignalStrength
    = 80 Interference = 30 We need to fuzzify these values and apply the fuzzy rules
    to infer the Allocation. 4.1.5 Step 4.1: Fuzzification Fuzzification maps crisp
    values to fuzzy sets using membership functions. For our example values: μ_Weak(80)
    = 0 (SignalStrength is not Weak) μ_Moderate(80) = 0.6 (SignalStrength is Moderate
    to some degree) μ_Strong(80) = 0.4 (SignalStrength is Strong to some degree) μ_Low(30)
    = 0.6 (Interference is Low to some degree) μ_Medium(30) = 0.4 (Interference is
    Medium to some degree) μ_High(30) = 0 (Interference is not High) 4.1.6 Step 4.2:
    Rule evaluation Each rule’s antecedent (IF part) is evaluated by taking the minimum
    of the membership function values of its input variables. For example, Rule 1:
    IF SignalStrength is Weak (0) AND Interference is Low (0.6), then the minimum
    value = min(0, 0.6) = 0. Similarly, evaluate all rules based on their antecedents.
    4.1.7 Step 4.3: Aggregation and defuzzification Combine the results of the rules
    using fuzzy operators like MAX (for OR) and MIN (for AND) to obtain an aggregated
    fuzzy output. Then, use defuzzification to convert the aggregated fuzzy output
    into a crisp value for Allocation [16]. 4.2 Interference reduction 4.2.1 Interference
    reduction Interference Reduction (IR) measures the reduction in interference achieved
    through spectrum allocation. It can be calculated as the sum of the reduction
    in interference across all samples: $$IR = \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} {(Initial\\,Interferencei
    - Final\\,Interferencei)}$$ (2) Initial Interferencei is the initial interference
    for the i-th sample. Final Interferencei is the interference after spectrum allocation
    for the i-th sample. 4.2.2 Energy detection Energy detection as a benchmark for
    evaluating the performance of our proposed fuzzy logic-based approach in cognitive
    radio networks. Energy detection has been a fundamental technique in cognitive
    radio systems and is used as a standard method for spectrum sensing in many applications.
    Its ubiquity in the field makes it an appropriate benchmark. Energy detection
    provides a baseline performance level for spectrum sensing. It helps assess how
    well our fuzzy logic-based approach enhances the cognitive radio''s ability to
    sense available spectrum opportunities compared to a traditional method. Energy
    detection is a widely used spectrum sensing technique based on measuring the energy
    of the received signal. It operates on the assumption that the signal energy in
    the presence of a primary user''s signal will be significantly higher than the
    noise energy in the absence of the primary user’s signal. Fuzzy Logic-based Detection
    is an intelligent spectrum sensing technique that uses fuzzy logic to make decisions
    based on imprecise and uncertain information. It models the uncertainty in spectrum
    sensing and decision-making. Fuzzy logic excels in handling imprecision and uncertainty,
    making it suitable for dynamic and uncertain spectrum environments. It can adapt
    to changing conditions and make nuanced decisions, considering multiple input
    parameters. 4.2.3 Comparative analysis Sensitivity to Noise and Dynamic Conditions:
    Energy detection may struggle in noisy environments and when dealing with rapidly
    changing signal conditions. False alarms or missed detections can occur if the
    energy threshold is not appropriately set. Fuzzy logic can adapt to varying noise
    levels and signal conditions, reducing the likelihood of false alarms and missed
    detections. Threshold Setting: The effectiveness of energy detection heavily depends
    on selecting the right energy threshold. Setting this threshold can be challenging
    when noise levels vary. Fuzzy logic does not rely on a fixed threshold but uses
    linguistic variables and fuzzy rules, making it more adaptive to changing conditions.
    Complexity: Energy detection is relatively simple to implement. Implementing fuzzy
    logic-based detection requires defining linguistic variables, membership functions,
    and rules, which adds complexity. Adaptability: Energy detection may not adapt
    well to dynamic spectrum scenarios without frequent threshold adjustments. Fuzzy
    logic excels in adapting to dynamic and uncertain environments. 4.3 Fairness index
    Fairness Index (FI) indicates the fairness in spectrum allocation among users.
    A simple approach is to calculate it as the ratio of allocated spectrum to the
    sum of initial interference and a constant (to avoid division by zero): $$FI =
    {\\text{Allocated}} \\,{\\text{Spectrum}}i/{\\text{Initial}} \\,{\\text{Interference}}i
    + C$$ (3) Where, C is a constant A constant added to the denominator to avoid
    division by zero. The choice of the constant (C) should be made based on the characteristics
    of the network and the desired behaviour of the fairness index. Different values
    of C can influence the sensitivity of the fairness index to changes in initial
    interference 4.4 System stability System Stability assesses the stability of the
    spectrum allocation process. It can be analyzed by evaluating how allocation decisions
    change in response to variations in input parameters. The stability analysis might
    involve assessing how small changes in input variables affect the allocated spectrum
    [17]. 5 Results and discussion In the Fig. 2, we generate synthetic data for signal
    strength and interference levels for a set number of samples. We assume a simple
    allocation process using fuzzy logic for each sample (not implemented here). For
    each sample, we calculate the reduction in interference by subtracting the allocated
    interference from the initial interference. We calculate a fairness index as a
    simple ratio of allocated spectrum to (initial interference + 1). Finally, we
    calculate overall metrics by taking averages or sums of the metrics for all samples.

    The orange line represents the membership function for the linguistic term ''Medium''
    in interference. The yellow line represents the membership function for the linguistic
    term ‘High’ in interference. Allocation Membership Functions (Bottom Subplot):
    The blue line represents the membership function for the linguistic term ‘Low’
    in spectrum allocation. The orange line represents the membership function for
    the linguistic term ‘Medium’ in spectrum allocation. The yellow line represents
    the membership function for the linguistic term ''High'' in spectrum allocation.
    The Fig. 3 displays a histogram that illustrates the distribution of allocated
    spectrum values across different samples. Each bar in the histogram represents
    a range of allocated spectrum values, and the height of the bar indicates the
    frequency (number of occurrences) of samples falling within that range. A wide
    and evenly distributed histogram suggests a balanced allocation of spectrum across
    various ranges. If the histogram is skewed towards one end, it indicates a preference
    for allocating spectrum in that particular range. An extremely narrow histogram
    might imply that the spectrum allocation is heavily concentrated in a specific
    range Fig. 3 Distribution of allocated spectrum values across different samples
    Full size image Moreover, in the above Fig. 3, the following observations are
    inferred as follows. X-axis (Allocated Spectrum): Represents the range of values
    for the allocated spectrum. Y-axis (Frequency): Represents the frequency or count
    of occurrences for each bin. Number of Bins (20 in this case): The histogram is
    divided into 20 bins, providing a granular view of the distribution. In this mapping
    results in a diverse set of allocated spectrum values, the histogram exhibits
    an even distribution, indicating efficient and fair allocation. The histogram
    of allocated spectrum is evenly distributed. As a Consequences, this suggests
    a balanced allocation scenario, indicating that spectrum values are spread uniformly
    across the range. Efficient and fair spectrum allocation, with a diverse range
    of values. The main implication is the Efficient and fair spectrum utilization
    within the cognitive radio network. The most crucial aspect of Fig. 3 lies in
    understanding the pattern of spectrum allocation which indicates efficiency and
    fairness in spectrum allocation. The Fig. 4 uses vertical bars to show the interference
    reduction achieved for each sample through the spectrum allocation process. The
    length of each bar represents the magnitude of interference reduction for that
    specific sample. Taller bars represent greater interference reduction, indicating
    a more effective allocation process in reducing interference. Shorter bars suggest
    less interference reduction, which might indicate that the allocation strategy
    is not effectively mitigating interference. Fig. 4 Interference reduction achieved
    for each sample through the spectrum allocation process Full size image This scatter
    plot in Fig. 5 relates the fairness index, calculated as allocated spectrum divided
    by (initial interference + 1), to the initial interference plus one for each sample.
    Each point in the scatter plot corresponds to a sample. Points distributed closer
    to the upper-right corner represent cases where higher allocated spectrum is achieved
    despite higher initial interference. This indicates a fair allocation process.
    Points concentrated near the lower-left corner suggest that some samples with
    lower initial interference are receiving disproportionately less spectrum. A more
    even dispersion of points across the plot indicates a fairer distribution of spectrum,
    regardless of initial interference. Fig. 5 Distribution of Fairness Index Full
    size image Moreover, in the above Figs. 4 and 5, the following observations are
    inferred as follows. The bars in the plot vary in height, indicating different
    levels of interference reduction for each sample. The distribution of small and
    large bars suggests a diversity in the effectiveness of interference reduction
    across the samples. Some bars are relatively small, indicating lower interference
    reduction, while others are larger, representing higher interference reduction.
    Implications: The variation in bar heights implies that the interference reduction
    strategy has different impacts on different samples. Some samples experience more
    significant interference reduction than others. Further, in Fig. 5, the use of
    unfilled circles in a scatter plot is a common convention in data visualization.
    Unfilled circles, or markers, are often chosen for clarity and to prevent overlapping
    of points, especially when dealing with a large number of data points. Regarding
    the potential oversight of the peak value of the fairness index at signal strength
    99, this highlights a limitation of using unfilled circles. The scatter plot shows
    the distribution of the fairness index across different signal strength and interference
    conditions. The peak fairness index value of approximately 25 at signal strength
    99 is mentioned. This peak indicates a specific scenario where the fairness index
    is notably high. Investigating this scenario can provide insights into conditions
    that lead to a particularly fair spectrum allocation. The line plot in Fig. 6
    shows how the allocated spectrum changes over different samples. Each point on
    the line corresponds to a sample, and the x-axis represents the sample index.
    A consistent and gradual trend in the line suggests stable spectrum allocation
    over samples. Abrupt spikes or drops in the line might indicate sudden changes
    in the allocation process. A gradually increasing or decreasing line could imply
    gradual adjustments to the allocation strategy. Fig. 6 Allocated spectrum changes
    over different samples Full size image As per Fig. 6, the plot reflects the dynamics
    and fluctuations in the spectrum allocation process over the generated samples.
    The abrupt peaks and dips suggest instances of sudden changes in the allocation,
    highlighting the sensitivity of the process to variations in signal strength and
    interference. The plot exhibits several abrupt peaks and dips. These abrupt changes
    in the spectrum allocation values suggest instances where the allocation process
    underwent sudden variations. These variations could be attributed to changes in
    signal strength, interference conditions, or the fuzzy logic. Recognizing patterns,
    such as rising or falling trends, can provide insights into the dynamics of spectrum
    utilization across different samples. The first subplot Fig. 7 displays the allocated
    spectrum for each user using bars. The second subplot shows the reduction in interference
    achieved by subtracting the allocated spectrum from the original interference
    for each user. The third subplot displays the relationship between signal strength
    and allocated spectrum using a scatter plot. Fig. 7 a. Allocated spectrum for
    each user using bars, b. Reduction in interference achieved by subtracting the
    allocated spectrum from the original interference for each user, c. signal strength

    quality, interference, and channel availability, calculates channel scores, and
    plots the channel scores along with the selected channels highlighted in red.
    As per the Figs. 7 and 8, the plot highlights the dynamics and sensitivity of
    the fuzzy logic-based spectrum allocation process. Abrupt peaks and dips suggest
    that the allocation is responsive to variations in signal strength and interference.
    Peaks in the plot indicate instances where the allocated spectrum values rapidly
    increased. These abrupt peaks could be triggered by specific conditions in the
    synthetic data that lead to a significant increase in allocated spectrum. Dips
    in the plot suggest instances where the allocated spectrum values rapidly decreased.
    Abrupt dips may occur in response to changes in signal strength or interference
    conditions, influencing the fuzzy logic allocation process. Fig. 8 channel scores
    along with the selected channels highlighted in red Full size image 6 Conclusion
    In conclusion, our paper provided insights into how fuzzy logic can contribute
    to improving network performance in cognitive radio environments. The combination
    of cognitive radio’s flexibility and fuzzy logic’s ability to handle uncertainty
    offers a powerful paradigm for enhancing spectrum utilization, interference management,
    and overall network efficiency. As cognitive radio networks continue to evolve,
    further research is required to develop advanced fuzzy logic-based approaches
    that can adapt to complex and dynamic scenarios. In the pursuit of harnessing
    the full potential of cognitive radio networks, incorporating intelligent techniques
    like fuzzy logic holds promise for addressing the challenges of spectrum scarcity
    and interference while maximizing network performance. The Average Spectrum Utilization
    (ASU) is given by 26.595, Total Interference Reduction (TIR) is 2245.5 and the
    Average Fairness Index (AFI) is 0.9582. The ASU of 26.595 suggests that, on average,
    about 26.6% of the spectrum is utilized. The interpretation of whether this is
    good or bad depends on the context and specific requirements of the cognitive
    radio network. A higher ASU generally indicates more efficient use of the available
    spectrum, which is desirable in scenarios where spectrum resources are scarce.
    However, the optimal ASU can vary based on factors like network goals, regulatory
    constraints, and the level of interference. The TIR value of 2245.5 indicates
    a substantial reduction in interference, which is generally positive. Lower interference
    enhances the quality and reliability of communications in the network. Reduced
    interference can lead to improved signal quality, reduced packet loss, and better
    overall network performance. The AFI of 0.9582 suggests a relatively high level
    of fairness in spectrum allocation. A fairness index closes to 1.0 indicates an
    equitable distribution, meaning that different users or channels are receiving
    comparable shares of the spectrum. This is desirable for ensuring fair and non-discriminatory
    access to spectrum resources. Given the ongoing advancements in wireless communication
    technologies, exploring the synergy between intelligent dynamic spectrum access
    and emerging paradigms like 5G and beyond, as well as the potential implications
    for IoT (Internet of Things) devices and applications, presents a promising direction
    for future research. Lastly, investigating security and privacy aspects within
    the context of cognitive radio networks using fuzzy logic-based decision-making
    would be crucial. This could involve devising methods to mitigate potential vulnerabilities
    and unauthorized access, ensuring the overall integrity of the system. Future
    research can explore the integration of machine learning techniques with fuzzy
    logic to enhance decision-making in cognitive radio networks further. Deep learning
    models and reinforcement learning algorithms may provide additional insights into
    improving spectrum sensing, allocation, and interference management. Develop adaptive
    fuzzy logic systems that can learn and evolve based on changing environmental
    conditions. This could involve self-optimization and self-learning mechanisms,
    allowing cognitive radios to continually adapt and improve their performance.

    Reservation for Cognitive Radio Networks Article 04 March 2021 1 Introduction
    With speedy development of many wireless devices and its applications, demand
    for spectrum band increases (Masonta et al. 2012). Most of the spectrum bands
    are assigned to licensed users also called Primary Users (PU). Hence, there is
    a scarcity in unlicensed spectrum band because of which unlicensed users also
    called Secondary Users (SU) are starved. Cognitive Radio Network is a wireless
    communication system that uses Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) technique to expand
    spectrum usage (Liang et al. 2011) in licensed spectrum band by opportunistically
    accessing spectrum holes in licensed band and allocating it to unlicensed users.
    The Secondary User in Cognitive Radio Network has the cognitive capability to
    intellect the spectrum and to identify the futile channels (Karthick 2008) and
    cognitive reconfigurability to speculatively access such unused portion of the
    licensed channels in the absenteeism of Primary User. Cognitive Radio Network
    provides four major functionalities (Fakhrudeen and Alani 2014) to secondary users
    (i) detecting unused portion of spectrum (spectrum sensing), (ii) selecting best
    channel among available channels (spectrum management), (iii) cooperating with
    other users to fairly share the available spectrum(spectrum sharing) and (iv)
    performing channel handoff on detecting a licensed user (spectrum mobility). Channel
    Assembling (CA) is a technique used by Dynamic Spectrum Access to improve secondary
    network capacity (Jiao et al. 2010) by combining and providing several idle channels
    to a secondary user. Figure 1 depicts the various Channel Assembling techniques
    like Channel Aggregation and Channel Bonding. Channel Assembling can be employed
    either by aggregation or bonding depending on the location of idle channels on
    the spectrum band. Channel bonding is performed if idle channels are next to to
    each other while channel aggregation is performed when idle channels are far apart.
    Fig. 1 Channel Aggregation and Bonding Full size image Channel Fragmentation (CF)
    is a technique used by Dynamic Spectrum Access to improve secondary network capacity
    (Coffman et al. 2012) by which spectrum holes (fragments) in different channels
    within a maximum aggregation range can be combined and allocated to secondary
    users based on the dynamic need of the users. Figure 2 depicts Channel Fragmentation
    in a spectrum of 6 channels. Primary User 1(PU1) and Primary User 2(PU2) are allocated
    with their channels, channel 2 and channel 4 respectively. Secondary User 1 is
    allocated with channel 1 and a fragmented portion of channel 3. Similarly, Secondary
    User 2(SU2) is allocated with fragmented portions of channel 3 and channel 5.
    Fig. 2 Channel Fragmentation Full size image With Cognitive Radio Network, the
    main research focus is on Quality of Service given to end users. Most of the existing
    works focus on QoS given to licensed users. The proposed algorithm in this work
    mainly focuses on QoS provided to Secondary Users. By providing fair spectrum
    allocation among both primary and secondary users, the QoS for secondary users
    are improved. 2 Related works Zhao et al. (2017) proposed a centralized spectrum
    allocation algorithm with varied slotted structure. The algorithm uses a small-time
    based configuration for unlicensed user data communication and super time-based
    configuration for licensed user data communication. Steady state distributions
    of users in the network are obtained using Markov chain analysis. Uyanik and Oktug
    (2017) proposed a licensed user activity-based spectrum allocation algorithm.
    The system considers various SU traffic burdens at different QoS levels. The channel
    classification is performed based on the load offered by the primary user. Packet
    selection selects packets for transmission from secondary user waiting queues
    and allocates less priority packets for heavyweight use channel and vice versa.
    Wang et al. (2012) proposed a stochastic queuing model approach for delay analysis
    in CRNs. To achieve minimum delay in the secondary network, adaptive algorithms,
    numerous PU channels and numerous SU boundaries were proposed in the queuing model.
    Joshi et al. (2015) proposed a new channel selection scheme for secondary users
    using fuzzy logic. Based on the history of primary user activities a list of backup
    and candidate channels list is created. Using fuzzy logic controller, channels
    are ranked and prioritized so that SU can choose the best channel for its communication
    without interference for primary users. Yao et al. (2015) proposed two algorithms
    for better performance of the system via best channel selection. They are channel
    possession data of the primary user and competition statistics between the secondary
    users. Balapuwaduge et al. (2013) proposed a queuing model for multichannel Cognitive
    Radio Network. The scheme employs channel assembling strategy for channel allocation
    to Secondary users. Two queuing schemes are used in the system to handle heterogeneous
    SU traffic with different priorities. This leads to starvation of low priority
    SUs in the network. One queuing scheme is proposed with a feedback loop and the
    other without a feedback loop. Scheme with feedback loops stores the interrupted
    SU in the queue while the other scheme does not store the interrupted SU. Each
    scheme is suitable for specific types of applications. Hawa et al. (2017) proposed
    a disseminated spectrum sharing algorithm for Cognitive Radio Networks. Algorithm
    enables the secondary users to choose the best channel among available channels
    to reduce the interference problems and to achieve greater degree of fairness
    among the secondary users. Kumar et al. (2017) proposed a scheme for hopping series
    to minimize the channel fading effect. Secondary users are classified into hopping
    groups and perform spectrum sensing to get channels and results sent to central
    controller. These results are used to assign channels to SUs based on its load
    in the network. A feedback bit allocation scheme for CRN is proposed by Lee and
    So (2020) to deliver assured bit rate services for secondary users. An optimization
    problem is developed and the number of required feedback bits between SU and PU
    is derived in closed form to provide minimum guaranteed bit rate. An integrated
    optimization problem is developed that maximizes the sum rates of secondary users.
    A cooperative spectrum sensing method for cluster CRN is proposed in Rajaganapathi
    and Nathan (2020) to progress the performance of hybrid overlay/underlay CRN.
    Two scheme selection methods are done in proposed method. Depending on the cluster
    in which the SU is available and based on the status of primary user the spectrum
    sharing method is chosen. When in underlay scheme, particle swarm optimization
    technique is used to select best relay link. The performance of hybrid cognitive
    radio network is improved because of optimal sharing scheme and relay link selection.
    A spectrum sharing scheme along with Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC)
    technique is proposed in Zhai and Tian (2020). Interference cancellation is done
    either by direct (DIR) method or SIC method at both Primary Receiver (PR) and
    Secondary Receiver (SR). Four sharing schemes are proposed—PR/DIR/SR/DIR, PR/DIR/SR/SIC,
    PR/SIC/SR/DIR and PR/SIC/SR/SIC. The Secondary Transmitter (ST) power is set such
    that it minimizes blocking of secondary users without affecting the performance
    of primary system. Out of these 4 schemes, better spectral efficiency is shown
    when SIC decoding is performed at PR. A Markov Random Field (MRF) cross-layer
    framework is proposed in Kakkavas et al (2020) for resource (channel) allocation
    to SUs in CRNs. The proposed framework is tested in both cases of minimum and
    maximum number of available channels. The framework provides operational transparency
    to primary users and minimizes the collision among secondary users at an acceptable
    level. The resource allocation by MRF framework provides better spectral efficiency
    and fewer collisions than learning based channel selection algorithms. Dhurandher
    et al. (2019) proposed a TDMA-based CRN, where PU transmits data in a time slot.
    SUs competes to occupy the available idle time slots. When multiple SUs competes
    for the same channel using the available time slot, a collision occurs. As a solution,
    Gupta et al. (2019) proposed a contract theory that acts as a tool for interaction
    among SUs. The private information about SUs is available in SU base station.
    The incomplete information of SU is examined using the contract theory. An intelligent
    spectrum resource allocation based on joint optimization is proposed in Liu and
    Jia (2020) to enhance the throughput of cognitive users in heterogeneous CRN.
    The proposed method permits secondary users to access the spectrum with full power
    in overlay networks and with controlled power in underlay networks. A joint resource
    optimization in sub-channel transmission is proposed to increase SUs throughput.
    An Alternating Direction Optimization (ADO) method called joint optimization algorithm
    is also proposed for joint optimization issues. Zhu et al. (2020) has proposed
    the Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) framework using machine learning. The
    algorithm considers occurrence awareness and collision awareness. The authors
    consider two scenarios—single-SU scenario and multi-SU scenario. For single-SU
    scenario, the authors have developed Occurrence Awareness OSA (OA-OSA) framework,
    which is based on only the local information of SU. It performs channel selection
    in 4 stages—Estimation, Sensing, Decision making and Learning. For multi-SU scenario,
    the authors have developed Occurrence and Collision awareness OSA (OCA-OSA) framework
    that provides interactions among SUs and enables SU to get the channels that fit
    best for them. It involves stages like Estimation, Sensing, Matching and Learning.
    The work''s limitations are that it considers only occurrence and collision, and
    it does not work on improvising QoS requirements. An efficient resource management
    algorithm is proposed in Aghababaiyan and Maham (2017) by Keyvan et al. to minimize
    interference in femtocells and to achieve high physical resource block allocation
    in femtocell networks. Resource allocation is dynamic based on QoS considerations.
    The proposed method provides QoS requirements at various QoS Class Identifier,
    increased spectrum efficiency and reduced interference. 3 System model Assume
    a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) with the central control of a Base Station (BS).
    The spectrum crowd is divided into M frequency channels of equal bandwidth. CRN
    has two users namely Primary User (PU) and Secondary User (SU). The primary users
    are called the licensed users and have all privileges to access the channels at
    any time. The secondary users are called the unlicensed users and can access the
    channels only in the nonexistence of the primary user. Primary Users can use one
    channel for their transmission whereas secondary users can combine multiple idle
    channels or combine multiple idle fragments within maximum aggregation range for
    its transmission (i.e.) channels can be allocated to secondary users either by
    channel aggregation or channel fragmentation. The central base station acts as
    a repository and as a central controller of the network. It contains the state
    information of the network and contains the details of Primary User, Secondary
    User and details of channels like which channels are idle and which channels are
    busy being occupied. Base station performs channel allocation to the users in
    the network. The Secondary user’s traffic types can be either real-time or non-real-time
    traffic depending on the type of data communication it is to perform. Real time
    traffic includes live communication like video conferencing, video calls Cheung
    et al. (2010) etc. Non-real-time traffic includes data communications like e-mail,
    file transfer Yaïche et al. (2000) etc. The system maintains 2 queues, one to
    store real-time secondary user (RTS) high priority Real-time Queue (RQ) and the
    other queue to store non-real-time secondary user (NRTS) low priority Non-Real
    time Queue (NRQ). The arrival rates of the users in the network are Poisson process
    and let λP, λRS and λNRS represent the arrival rates of Primary User, high priority
    RTS and low priority NRTS. The service times of each user are exponentially distributed
    and let µp, µrs and µnrs represent the service times of Primary User, high priority
    RTS and low priority NRTS. The channels are homogeneous i.e. all channels have
    same data transfer rate. If data transfer rate of one channel is Tr then aggregating
    n such channels gives data transfer rate of n(Tr) and fragmenting a channel into
    n equal fragments gives data transfer rate of Tr/n for each fragment. 4 Queuing
    model with RRP and reservation channels Whenever a primary user requests channel
    for transmission, the channel is assigned to the highest priority PU. If the user
    is a secondary user, then if idle channels or fragments are available then SU
    is allocated with the channel. If no idle channels are available, the secondary
    users are classified into RTS and NRTS and placed in the corresponding queue.
    The introduction of queues reduces the blocking rate of secondary users in the
    network. The traditional spectrum allocation method uses priority scheduling to
    allocate channels to the users in the network. The primary users have the highest
    priority and since they are licensed users, they are always allocated with the
    channel. After allocating channels to the primary users, if there are unused channels
    available, then real-time secondary user in the high priority queue gets the channel.
    Only after allocating channels to primary user and RTS, the low priority NRTS
    gets the chance for the channel. By such spectrum allocation method, the NRTS
    in low priority queue get starved. Hence, to avoid the stagnation of low priority
    NRTS, a Round Robin Priority (RRP) algorithm along with reservation channel is
    proposed for scheduling the spectrum. The following table depicts the list of
    abbreviations used in the manuscript. PU Primary User SU Secondary USER RTS Real
    time Secondary User NRTS Non Real time Secondary User RQ Real time Queue NRQ Non
    Real time Queue RRP Round Robin Priority LARR Least Allocation Round Robin MAP
    Most Allocation Priority The proposed scheduling algorithm combines round robin
    and priority scheduling algorithm which leads to better performance in job scheduling.
    By incorporating combined RRP scheduling algorithm, the starvation of NRTS gets
    reduced and some are made to progress their transmission and some unlicensed users
    are even made to finish their transmission. 4.1 RRP scheduling algorithm The RRP
    scheduling algorithm is triggered once the NRQ becomes full. The RRP algorithm
    suspends the ongoing secondary users for a predefined time period T. During this
    suspension period, it allocates channels to non-real-time secondary users in NRQ.
    It has 2 algorithms—1. Least Allocation Round Robin (LARR) and 2. Most Allocation
    Priority (MAP). In LARR, each secondary user in NRQ gets W (minimum) number of
    channels in round robin fashion. In MAP, new priorities are assigned to secondary
    users in NRQ based on the remaining amount of information to be communicated.
    The secondary user with least amount of data to be communicated gets the highest
    priority. Based on the priority assigned, the secondary user with highest priority
    gets V (maximum) number of channels for transmission. MAP continues until the
    time period T elapses. Figure 3 depicts the concept of Round Robin Priority algorithm.
    On arrival of SU, if free channels are not available, then based on the type of
    data to transmit, SU is classified as real time SU and non-real-time SU and the
    queue selector places the real time SU in the high priority RQ and non-real time
    SU in the low priority NRQ. If NRQ becomes full, RRP algorithm is triggered. Once
    RRP execution is over, if the service of SU is completed, it leaves the system,
    else it again moves to NRQ and waits for its chance. Figure 4 represents the flow
    of work in a pictorial representation. Fig. 3 Round Robin Priority Algorithm for
    Spectrum Allocation to SU Full size image Fig. 4 Flowchart of the RRP algorithm
    for Spectrum Allocation to Secondary users Full size image Various algorithms
    are used in Round Robin Priority Scheduling—They are Starvation Minimization Algorithm,
    Least Allocation Round Robin and Most Allocation Priority. 4.1.1 Starvation minimization
    algorithm Starvation Minimization algorithm checks whether the number of available
    channels is greater than W (minimum channels to aggregate) and if so, allocates
    W idle channels to the system. If not tries to perform spectrum adaptation. If
    spectrum adaptation is not possible, checks whether the SU is real time or nonreal
    time user and moves to the corresponding waiting queue. If there is no space in
    non-real time queue then it invokes LARR and MAR to provide spectrum to the SU.
    4.1.2 Least allocation algorithm The first phase of RRP algorithm is Least Allocation
    Round Robin algorithm. The algorithm considers each NRSU from NRQ, and divides
    the number of channels released by ongoing RSU by W. It aggregates W number of
    channels and allocates to N number of NRSU from NRQ. In round-robin fashion, the
    algorithm allocates W number of channels to all NRSUs from NRQ for a time quantum
    Tq. 4.1.3 Most allocation algorithm The second phase of RRP algorithm is Most
    Allocation Priority algorithm. It assigns new priority levels to all NRSUs after
    the execution of phase1. The NRSU that has the least amount of data to be transmitted
    gets the highest priority. It selects first N NRSU with the highest priority,
    and allocates V number of aggregated channels for them and allows them to complete
    their transmission. 4.2 RRP with reservation channels The system introduces group
    of reservation channels. The total channels are divided into Reserved Channels
    (RC) and Non Reserved Channels (NRC) in the ratio of 20:80. The traditional spectrum
    allocation methods allocate channels to users only from NRC. The set of channels
    assigned to be reserved is static. The use of having such reserved channels is
    to improve the availability of channels to secondary users and to provide continuous
    uninterrupted services to the users. Figure 5 depicts the flow chart of RRP with
    reservation algorithm. It shows when reserved channels will be allocated to users.
    Fig. 5 Flowchart of the RRP with Reservation algorithm for Spectrum Allocation
    to Secondary users Full size image The main purpose of introducing reservation
    channels are: 1. In case of channel failures, the service in failed channels can
    be handed over to reserved channels. 2. The proposed RRP scheduling algorithm,
    suspends the ongoing secondary users to allocate channels to NRTS in NRQ. During
    this period of suspension, if reserved channels are free, then the suspended secondary
    users can be handed over to reserved channels thus improving the service provided
    by RRP scheduling algorithm. 3. Whenever a secondary user in NRC are made to terminate
    by the arrival of a primary user, then secondary users that are forced to terminate
    can be handed over to free reserved channels. 4.3 Algorithm: channel allocation
    using reservation scheme Channel failures are one of the main reasons for service
    interruption in CRN. The channel failure may arise in the channel used by PU or
    SU. If a SU is using the failed channel, it gets interrupted only when aggregated
    channels become less than W. If not, it can continue its service. If aggregated
    channels become less than W, then SU tries to perform spectrum adaptation in NRC.
    If spectrum adaptation is not possible, it performs spectrum handover to RC. If
    a PU is using the failed channel, then it preempts SU in NRC. The preempted SU
    tries spectrum adaptation. Suppose not successful tries to perform spectrum handover
    to RC. Upon SU arrival, it checks for V to W number of channels from NRC to start
    its service. If channels are available in NRC, then SU can start its service,
    else it tries to occupy the buffers in RQ or NRQ based on its classification as
    RSU and NRSU. Then the SUs gets its channel allocated by RRP algorithm. RSUs suspended
    by RRP, competes and gets channel from RC. Upon PU arrival, it checks for channel
    availability in NRC. If the channel is available, it starts its transmission.
    If the channel is not available, then it preempts a SU in the system. The interrupted
    SU tries for Spectrum Adaptation. If spectrum adaptation is successful, then it
    can continue its service. If spectrum adaptation is not possible, it performs
    spectrum handover and tries to get RC channels. If enough channels are not available
    in RC, then the interrupted SU is forced to terminate from the system. 5 Performance
    analysis The Cognitive Radio Network is simulated with NS2 with various nodes
    as PU and SU. The hardware uses a queuing model with queues to store low priority
    NRTS, NRQ and high priority RTS, RQ. Let jlq and jhq represent the length of the
    queue NRQ and RQ respectively. Let jrq and jnrq represent the available space
    in the queue, NRQ and RQ where jrq ≤ jhq and jnrq ≤ jlq. 5.1 Blocking probability
    Blocking Probability is defined as the rate at which a secondary user gets blocked
    on requesting channels for its communication. The conditions for high priority
    real-time SU to be blocked are. 1. If it is not possible to start the service
    with the available idle channels in NRC. 2. If there are no low priority non-real-time
    SU in the network. 3. If spectrum adaptation is not probable among current high
    priority RTS’s. 4. If there is no free space in high priority RQ. The conditions
    for low priority non-real-time SU to be blocked are. 1. If it is not possible
    to start the service with the available idle channels in NRC. 2. If high priority
    real-time queue is full. 3. If spectrum adaptation is not probable among current
    low priority NRTS’s. 4. If there is no free space in low priority NRQ. $$State\\,
    of\\, the\\, system\\, for\\, high\\, priority\\, SU\\, to\\, be\\, blocked=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}M-b+
    \\sum_{k=w+1}^{v}k{j}_{k}<W.\\\\ {j}_{rq} = 0\\end{array}\\right.$$ $$State\\,
    of\\, the\\, system\\, for\\, low \\,priority\\, SU\\, to\\, be\\, blocked= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}M-b+
    \\sum_{k=w+1}^{v}k{j}_{k}<W.\\\\ {j}_{rq} = {j}_{hq}\\\\ {j}_{nrq}=0\\end{array}\\right.$$
    where M represents the total channel numbers in the system, b represents the channel
    numbers being used in the network, kjk represents the number of channels provided
    by ongoing SUs in the system by spectrum adaptation, w represents minimum number
    of channels to aggregate and v represents maximum number of channels to aggregate.
    $$B{P}_{SU}= \\frac{Number\\ of\\ S{U}^{\\prime}s\\ blocked}{Arrival\\ rate\\
    of\\ S{U}^{\\prime}s\\ and\\ PU^{\\prime}s } ,$$ $$B{P}_{SU}= \\frac{S{U}_{Blocked}}{{\\lambda
    }_{P}+ {\\lambda }_{RS}+ {\\lambda }_{NRS}} .$$ where λP is the arrival rate of
    Primary users, λRS is the arrival rate of real time secondary users and λNRS is
    the arrival rate of non-real time secondary users. 5.2 Forced termination probability
    Forced Termination Probability (FTP) is defined as the rate at which the ongoing
    secondary users are forced to terminate the spectrum by high priority users. The
    high priority RTS is forced to terminate when a primary user preempts it with
    the following condition. 1. When the number of free channels are not enough to
    perform communication. 2. When there are no low priority secondary users to preempt.
    3. When adaptation of spectrum is not probable among current high priority secondary
    users. 4. If there is no free space in high priority RQ. The low priority secondary
    user is forced to terminate when a primary user or high priority secondary user
    preempts it with the following conditions. 1. When the number of free channels
    are not enough to perform communication. 2. When adaptation of spectrum is not
    possible among ongoing low priority secondary users. 3. If there is no free space
    in low priority NRQ. $$FT{P}_{SU}= \\frac{Number\\, of\\, S{U}^{\\prime}s \\,terminated}{Arrival\\,
    rate\\, of\\, S{U}^{\\prime}s \\,and \\, PU^{\\prime}s} ,$$ $$FT{P}_{SU}=\\frac{S{U}_{terminated}}{{\\lambda
    }_{P}+ {\\lambda }_{RS}+ {\\lambda }_{NRS}} .$$ 5.3 Average delay The total delay
    of the secondary user is calculated from the average waiting time of RTS and NRTS
    in RQ and NRQ and average service time of ongoing RTS and NRTS. It is dependent
    on the length of 2 queues RQ and NRQ, the arrival rates of RTS and NRTS and the
    interruption rate of PUs. $$Delay= \\left(\\frac{{j}_{lq}+{j}_{hq}}{{\\lambda
    }_{RS}+{\\lambda }_{NRS}} + \\frac{S{U}_{ongoing}}{{\\lambda }_{RS}+{\\lambda
    }_{NRS}}\\right)*P{U}_{intrate} .$$ 5.4 Spectrum utilization The main aim of channel
    aggregation and fragmentation is to enhance the amount of spectrum utilized in
    the network by the secondary users. Spectrum Utilization can be given as $$SPU=
    \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{a}_{i}*B{W}_{i} .$$ where N denotes the number of SUs in the network,
    ai denotes whether spectrum is allocated to the secondary user, if allocated ai
    takes value 1 otherwise 0. BWi represents the amount of channel allocated to SUi.
    6 Numerical results and discussions The performance of the proposed spectrum allocation
    RRP algorithm along with reservation channels is analyzed with customary spectrum
    allocation methods like constant and dynamic channel aggregation scheme. A Cognitive
    Radio Network with 15 channels and 25 nodes is configured. The value for W set
    as 1 and V set as 3 for dynamic spectrum allocation. Figure 4 depicts the blocking
    probability of secondary user by sustaining the arrival rate of primary user to
    be 5 and varying arrival rate of secondary users. With increase in the arrival
    rates of secondary user, the blocking probability also increases. On comparing
    the blocking probability of the proposed RRP with Reservation scheme along with
    constant and dynamic channel aggregation scheme, the blocking probability of the
    secondary users reduces 22.8% and 19.32% respectively with the proposed RRP with
    Reservation scheme. Figure 6 depicts the forced termination probability of secondary
    user by sustaining the arrival rate of secondary user to be 10 and changing the
    arrival rate of PUs. With increase in the arrival rates of primary user, the forced
    termination probability also increases. On comparing the FTP of the proposed RRP
    with Reservation scheme along with constant and variable channel aggregation scheme,
    the FTP of the secondary users reduces 15.28% and 12.74% respectively with the
    proposed RRP with Reservation scheme. Fig. 6 Blocking Probability Full size image
    Figure 7 depicts the total delay of RTS and NRTS by varying the lengths of queues
    RQ and NRQ. The total delay of NRTS is more than RTS since the PU interruption
    rate is more for NRTS. Also, the delay increases with the increase in queue length.
    Hence a threshold has to be maintained for queue length to avoid more delay. Fig.
    7 Forced Termination Probability Full size image Figure 8 depicts the average
    waiting time of NRTS in NRQ. The average waiting time of secondary users in NRQ
    is less with reservation channels since the secondary users that are forced to
    terminate try to occupy free channels in RC instead of again waiting in NRQ. When
    compared to RRP algorithm the average waiting time of secondary users are reduced
    3% when using reservation channels. Fig. 8 Delay of Secondary Users Full size
    image Figure 9 depicts the total amount of spectrum utilization done by both RTS
    and NRTS in CRN. Due to spectrum adaptation and reservation channels, the amount
    of spectrum utilized by the secondary users increases when compared to constant
    and variable CAS. The graph shows spectrum utilization in interval of 20 s for
    a simulation round of 60 s. On comparing the Spectrum Utilization rate of the
    proposed RRP with Reservation scheme along with constant and variable channel
    aggregation scheme, the Spectrum Utilization rate of the secondary users increases
    by 24.58% and 10.57% respectively with the proposed RRP with Reservation scheme.

    image 7 Conclusion A novel scheduling algorithm has been proposed for spectrum
    allocation to secondary users in Cognitive Radio Network. The proposed RRP scheduling
    algorithm introduces set of reserved spectrums on the total available spectrum
    in the system. The proposed RRP scheduling algorithm minimizes the starvation
    of non-real-time secondary users and by the reservation channels, primary users
    get continuous service during channel failures in NRC and secondary users get
    uninterrupted service when forced terminated by a primary user. The performance
    of the proposed spectrum allocation method is analyzed with various QoS measurements
    like blocking probability, FTP, total delay of secondary users, average waiting
    time of SUs in NRQ and spectrum utilization. The proposed Round Robin Priority
    Algorithm with Reservation Scheme results reveals 22.82% reduction in Blocking
    Probability, 15.28% reduction in Forced Termination Probability, 12.54% reduction
    in average waiting time and 24.58% increase in Spectrum utilization when compared
    with the traditional spectrum allocation method Constant Channel Aggregation Scheme.
    Similarly, on comparing RRP with Reservation scheme and Variable Channel Aggregation
    Scheme, the results obtained reveals better performance. It shows 19.32% reduction
    in Blocking Probability, 12.74% reduction in Forced Termination Probability and
    10.57% increase in Spectrum utilization. On comparing RRP and RRP with Reservation
    Scheme, results are improved when RRP is used along with Reservation channels.
    Reservation scheme shows 4.2% reduction in Blocking Probability, 4.4% reduction
    in Forced Termination Probability, 3% reduction in average waiting time and 1.8%
    increase in Spectrum Utilization. The numerical results shows that the QoS measurements
    are better in the proposed system when compared with the traditional spectrum
    allocation methods. The proposed system considers static number of reserved channels.
    In future, the work can be expanded to vary the number of reservation channels
    by the amount of load offered by the users on the network. References Aghababaiyan

    Abstract—Spectrum is a limited resource, so it must be used effectively. The fixed
    spectrum allocation method currently in operation may not sustain the growth in
    the network access users, which continues to increase over time. Many studies
    have shown that the spectrum deficiency problem can be solved with cognitive radio
    network (CRN) technology. CRN allows flexible spectrum utilization. Spectrum handoff
    is one of the fundamental prerequisites for dynamic spectrum access in cognitive
    radio networks. The ping-pong effect is one of the problems caused by the frequent
    occurrence of unnecessary handoff spectrum. So, in CRN, the right handoff decision
    is needed to avoid the ping-pong effect. The proposed fuzzy system carries the
    concept of a fuzzy tree that uses two fuzzy inference systems (FIS), which work
    in two stages, namely FIS-1 and FIS-2. In the early stages, the FIS-1 controls
    the secondary users (SU) power and prevents interference with the primary users
    (PU). FIS-2 is used to execute precise spectrum handoff decisions. The test results
    show that the amount of handoff spectrum has decreased by up to 43 % compared
    to other methods, which are only 60 %. This results in a decrease of 16.67% from
    the previous method. Thus, the ping-pong effect can be minimized with the right
    handoff decisions.  Keywords—spectrum handoff, ping-pong effect, cognitive radio

    as a service 1. Introduction The large scale deployment of 5G-based IoT systems
    is faced with the challenging scarcity of spectrum resources [1], [2], [3]. Spectrum
    sharing with the help of cognitive radios (also known as software-defined radios)
    is strongly believed to be among the very promising solutions for this problem
    [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Idle spectrum channels can be dynamically
    utilized without affecting licensed wireless users, also known as primary users
    (PUs), to gain more capacity. The viability of this approach, however, relies
    heavily on the accuracy of idle spectrum identification. A false positive, i.e.,
    identifying a given spectrum band as idle while it is not may lead to harmful
    interference caused to PUs by unlicensed wireless users (also known as secondary
    users, abbrev. SUs). On the other hand, a false negative, i.e., identifying a
    given spectrum band as busy while it is not, will deprive unlicensed users of
    some valuable spectrum resources. Therefore, the accuracy and reliability of spectrum
    sensing, the process of identifying idle/busy spectrum bands, is very critical.
    Thus, it received tremendous attention over the past decade [11], [12], [13],
    [14]. Cooperative sensing is one of the favored approaches to carry out the spectrum
    monitoring task [15]. It promises higher sensing accuracy based on the redundancy
    of devices involved in making the sensing decision [16]. Accuracy and energy consumption
    are generally the most investigated issues related to spectrum sensing. In [17],
    the authors investigate how throughput of SUs is affected by the spectrum sensing
    process under different levels of data availability in energy harvesting-based
    CRNs. As SUs use the harvest-then-transmit mode of operation, it is important
    to have an energy efficient spectrum sensing process that maximizes the energy
    left for data transmission. The paper presents Markov Chain models to understand
    how SU throughput is affected by data availability and sensing energy consumption.
    An important conclusion in this work is that, in some cases, non-cooperative spectrum
    sensing can be better, on the average sense, than cooperative sensing in terms
    of SU throughput. Optimizing cooperative spectrum sensing in energy-harvesting
    CRNs is investigated in [18]. The objective is to devise a cooperative sensing
    strategy among SUs so that their achievable throughput is maximized while PUs
    are protected and sufficient energy is harvested. The work in [19] addresses the
    accuracy of cooperative sensing in cognitive radio sensor networks. It proposes
    a clustering-based decision protocol and employs an entropy based weighted method
    to fuse local decisions and produce a global one. Energy efficient spectrum sensing
    in mobile cognitive radio sensor networks is investigated in [20]. The paper presents
    a framework to optimally predict energy consumption of the sensing process given
    node mobility. In [21], Graph Convolution Network model is proposed to solve the
    cooperative spectrum sensing problem. The objective is to construct a model that
    is capable of handling the hidden node problem and adapting to dynamic changes
    in the wireless environment. A different way of handling cooperative spectrum
    sensing in CRNs is presented in [22]. A prediction-based sensing scheme is used
    where the status of a spectrum channel is predicted before actual sensing is performed.
    This prediction is done cooperatively as well, with the purpose of improving energy
    efficiency by avoiding wasteful sensing. Spectrum sensing as a service (SSaS)
    is an emerging paradigm of cooperative sensing [23], [24], [25]. This paradigm
    calls for the use of a dedicated infrastructure wireless sensor network (WSN)
    to monitor the spectrum and then provide sensing results via direct communication
    with the sensors or via cloud services [26]. A sensing cost is imposed upon SUs
    by the sensing service provider according to a given pricing function [23], [27].
    As proposed in [27], SUs can pay in return of the sensing service by cooperating
    with the infrastructure sensor network in the sensing task. Another alternative
    (the one assumed in this work) is money payment where the owner/operator of the
    CRN pays the sensing service provider according to a given per-request pricing
    function. We assume the later option in this work and we explain it in detail
    in Section 2.2. Fig. 1 shows the three coexisting networks; the dynamic spectrum
    access network (i.e., CRN), the spectrum sensing network, and the multichannel
    primary licensed network. SUs receive information about the availability/unavailability
    of spectrum channels from the spectrum sensing network. The spectrum sensing network,
    on the other hand, monitors the activity of PUs on a set of licensed spectrum
    channels and provide results as a service to clients. In this paper, we are interested
    in the problem of allocating spectrum channels along a given route, as shown in
    Fig. 1, in a multi-interface multi-hop dynamic spectrum access network. The objective
    is to minimize the spectrum sensing cost imposed by the sensing service provider
    while maintaining QoS guarantee on the data rate. Download : Download high-res

    Channel assignment and routing in multi-channel multi-interface wireless networks
    has been studied before [28], [29], [30], [31]. In [28], the problem of improving
    the capacity of multi-channel multi-interface IEEE 802.11 wireless networks is
    investigated. An interface assignment algorithm, along with a routing strategy
    were proposed. A distributed joint channel assignment and routing protocol is
    proposed in [29] for IEEE 802.11 multi-channel multi-interface mobile ad-hoc networks.
    The tradeoff between flexibility and switching overhead in multi-interface wireless
    mesh networks is investigated in [30]. A static interface assignment strategy
    is used for heavily loaded nodes, while a hybrid assignment policy is used for
    the rest of nodes. In the hybrid assignment, some interfaces are fixed while others
    are allowed to change their channels. In [31], a routing and interface assignment
    algorithm for multi-channel multi-interface ad hoc networks was proposed. The
    proposed algorithm establishes a route first, and then assigns channels to interfaces
    along the established route. A cost metric that accounts for the number of hops
    and adjacent hop interference is used. In [32], a multi-interface cognitive radio
    node model was proposed for enhancing routing in multihop cellular networks. An
    AODV-based routing protocol is proposed where the proper interface is activated
    on each node according to spectrum availability. The ordinary cellular interface
    is used only when no licensed or unlicensed spectrum resources are available.
    Each node has interfaces to exploit licensed idle channels, as well as unlicensed
    idle channels. 1.1. How is this work different? Despite being a well investigated
    issue in literature, we study the spectrum allocation problem in a unique setup.
    Our problem is to allocate spectrum channels to links of an existing route under
    an SSaS model. The SSaS provider has a location-dependent function to price sensing
    requests. Under this function, requests made by different SUs to monitor the same
    channel may impose different costs by the SSaS provider based on the locations
    of those SUs (see Section 2.2 for details). This problem under this specific scenario
    has not, to the best of our knowledge, been studied before. This work is important
    as a continuation of the ongoing efforts to prove the viability of the SSaS model
    [23], [24], [25] and to optimize network operations and functionalities under
    such model [24], [27]. 1.2. Contributions The main contributions of this work
    are as follows: - We identify and formulate the problem of minimum cost spectrum
    allocation with QoS guarantees along an established route in multi-interface dynamic
    spectrum access network. We also investigate the complexity of the problem. We
    prove the decision version of the problem to be NP-complete (and consequently
    the optimization version to be NP-hard) by a reduction from the well-known Integer
    Knapsack problem. Obtaining the optimal solution for NP-hard problems in polynomial
    time is not, yet, achievable. Therefore, polynomial-time sub-optimal algorithms
    must be proposed. To have a reference baseline against which the performance of
    such sub-optimal algorithms is evaluated, we propose an integer linear program
    (ILP) formulation to obtain the optimal solution. ILPs are usually solved using
    optimization solvers like CPLEX [33]. Keep in mind that such solvers are not guaranteed
    to obtain optimal solutions of NP-hard problems in polynomial time, and thus they
    cannot (in practice) replace the need for sub-optimal algorithms. - Given the
    NP-hardness of our research problem, we propose a sub-optimal algorithm based
    on the idea of ILP relaxation and iterative variable fixing. In ILP relaxation,
    integrality constraints are relaxed allowing variables to be assigned real values
    instead of integer values. Then, successive variable fixing is used to produce
    an integer solution from the solutions of relaxed ILPs solved over a number of
    iterations. The accuracy of the proposed sub-optimal algorithm is evaluated against
    the optimal solution (obtained by solving the ILP formulation) using extensive
    numerical experimentation. Furthermore, the effect of route’s rate requirement
    and number of per-node interfaces on the service cost is also thoroughly investigated
    under various route lengths. 1.3. Organization The rest of this paper is organized
    as follows. In Section 2, we present some preliminary assumptions and outline
    the system model. The research problem is formally defined and formulated in Section
    3. We then propose our sub-optimal algorithm in Section 4. Numerical results are
    presented and discussed in Section 5. We finally conclude the paper in Section
    6. 2. Preliminaries and system model In this section, we present the system model.
    We first explain the network model in Section 2.3. Then, the spectrum pricing
    model is introduced in Section 2.2. 2.1. SSaS model We assume an SSaS model that
    relies on an infrastructure wireless sensor network in which nodes are capable
    of spectrum monitoring (via cognitive radios) [23], [24]. The SSaS provider receives
    requests from client SUs to monitor a given spectrum channel(s) at specific location(s).
    The SSaS provider then optimizes the set of sensors to be activated in order to
    serve the incoming request, and sets a price for the service to be paid by the
    requesting client. We refer the reader to [24] for an idea about optimized sensor
    activation. The price that the SSaS provider sets is expected to be different
    for different requests. We explain this issue in Section 2.2. 2.2. Spectrum pricing
    model The SSaS provider sets service prices according to a given pricing policy.
    It is not within the scope of this work to investigate the design of such a policy.
    However, we need to make a few assumptions that we believe will hold in any pricing
    policy. We assume that service prices vary both temporally and spatially. In other
    words, different service prices may be set by the SSaS provider for sensing the
    same spectrum channel at different geographical locations or at different times.
    Such variation in prices can be justified by the following scenarios. 2.2.0.1.
    Scenario 1: variation in PU density Consider the case in Fig. 2. Assume the SSaS
    provider is requested to monitor a given spectrum channel at the points and .
    The circle around a PU represent the area within which no SU activity is allowed
    whenever the PU is active, i.e., PU’s protection region. Given a sensing request
    , the SSaS provider must monitor the activity of every PU where falls within its
    protection region. This means that only needs to be monitored in regards to request
    , while must be monitored in regards to request . The latter spreads over a larger
    area requiring more sensor nodes, and consequently a higher price. 2.2.0.2. Scenario
    2: variety in available sensors In this case, we are concerned with the scenario
    in which the distribution of available sensors in the SSaS infrastructure WSN
    is not uniform. This could occur due to a non-uniform deployment of sensors, or
    due to non-uniform distribution of sensing requests which leaves non-uniform distribution
    of available sensors. When there is abundance of available sensors in a given
    area, an activation schedule can be calculated to activate sensors in turns to
    save their energy and prolong the WSN’s lifetime. However, when there are fewer
    sensors in the same area, scheduling may not be possible leading to faster depletion
    of those sensor’s batteries. Furthermore, exploiting all sensors in a given area
    means that the service provider may have to reject future requests, affecting
    service availability. Therefore, it makes sense for the SSaS provider to impose
    higher cost for requests around which smaller number of sensors are available.

    Fig. 2. A toy example to illustrate “Scenario 1”. 2.3. Network model We assume
    a multi-interface cognitive radio network (MI-CRN) that consists of a set of multi-interface
    secondary users (MI-SUs). Each MI-SU is equipped with multiple cognitive radio
    interfaces, through which it can opportunistically utilize a set of licensed spectrum
    channels , where . The MI-CRN uses multihop communication, and it relies on a
    SSaS provider to get information about the availability/unavailability of any
    licensed spectrum channel. Throughout this work, we assume that all MI-SUs transmit
    on a fixed transmission power level. We further assume that the number of available
    interfaces may be heterogeneous among nodes in the MI-CRN. Multihop routes are
    established within the MI-CRN using any routing protocol. Our task in this paper
    is to assign spectrum channels to links along such a route so that the total spectrum
    sensing cost is minimized, and a given QoS rate requirement is satisfied. If no
    such assignment exists, a new route should be established. 3. Problem definition
    and formulation In this section, we start by presenting a formal definition of
    the research problem. Then, we analyze the problem’s complexity and prove that
    it is NP-hard. Finally, we propose an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation
    of the problem to be used for obtaining the optimal solution using existing optimizers.
    3.1. Problem definition Given a route that consists of a set of MI-SUs , and a
    set of links . Assume that every MI-SU is equipped with interfaces. We need to
    assign a set of channels to every link so that the total cost imposed by the SSaS
    provider is minimized and the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The expected
    data rate along the route is above or equal to a predetermined threshold . (2)
    The number of distinct channels assigned to every link is no more than the minimum
    of and . (3) The number of distinct channels assigned to links and link is less
    than or equal to for all . Let and denote the mean idle time and busy time of
    channel on link respectively. We assume that and are provided by the SSaS provider
    to its clients in order to facilitate their spectrum decision process. Also, let
    be the capacity of channel along link . Then, the expected data rate on link over
    channel , denoted , is calculated as follows: (1) Then, the expected data rate
    on link , denoted , is calculated as follows. (2) We assume that the SSaS provider
    imposes service prices according to a pricing function for monitoring spectrum
    channel around the coordinates of MI-SU . In order for channel to be used on link
    , it must be monitored by the SSaS provider based on the locations of and to make
    sure that the those two MI-SUs can use channel without harming any primary user.
    Therefore, let us define as the set of spectrum channels that need to be monitored
    around the location of MI-SU according to a given channel assignment. is the set
    of channels assigned to ’s incoming and outgoing links, and it is calculated as
    follows: (3) Now, we can define our research problem formally. Definition 1 The
    Minimum Cost - Bounded Rate (MCBR) Problem Given a route in a multi-interface
    sensor-aided CRN that opportunistically utilizes a set of licensed spectrum channels
    , find a channel assignment such that: (1) (3) (3) The total cost is minimized.
    3.2. Problem complexity Before discussing the complexity of our research problem,
    we need first to clarify some basic terms in computational complexity and intractability
    [34]. A problem is said to be NP-hard if every problem in NP class is reducible
    (i.e., transformable) to this problem in polynomial time. On the other hand, NP
    is the class of all decision problems that can be solved using nondeterministic
    polynomial-time algorithms. A nondeterministic polynomial-time algorithm is one
    that can verify a given solution (to be correct or not) in polynomial time. Finally,
    a problem is said to be NP-complete if it is both in NP and NP-hard. Let us now
    analyze the complexity of the MCRB problem. To do so, we need first define a decision
    version of the MCRB problem and call it MCRB-D. Definition 2 The Minimum Cost
    - Bounded Rate Decision Problem (MCBR-D) Given a route in a multi-interface sensor-aided
    CRN that opportunistically utilizes a set of licensed spectrum channels , and
    given a constant . Is there a channel assignment such that: (1) (3) (3) . It can
    be shown that the MCBR-D problem is NP-complete by a reduction from the Integer
    Knapsack problem [34]. The integer knapsack problem is defined as follows. Definition
    3 Integer Knapsack (IK) Problem Given a finite set , a size and a value for each
    , and positive integers and . Is there a subset such that and ? In other words,
    the Integer Knapsack problem can be described as follows: “Given a set of items
    where each item has a size and a value , and given a knapsack of integer capacity
    . Can we fit a subset of the items into the knapsack such that the sum of their
    values is greater than or equal some integer threshold ?” To prove the NP-completeness
    of the MCBR-D problem, we first need to show that MCBR-D NP, and then prove that
    every instance of the IK problem can be reduced in polynomial time to an instance
    of the MCBR-D problem. Lemma 1 MCBR-D NP. Proof Given a solution for every link
    , we can calculate the rate of link using Eq. (2) and the set of node using Eq.
    (3) and verify them against constraints (1), (2) of Definition 3. This can be
    done in . During this process of calculation, the total cost can also be gradually
    evaluated. Finally, constraint (3) of Definition 3 is verified in . Therefore,
    the total time needed to verify a solution is .  ■ Lemma 2 IK MCBR-D. Proof every
    instance of IK can be mapped in polynomial time into an instance of MCBR-D as
    follows: - Create a route of a single link, i.e., and . - For every element ,
    create a channel and add it to , i.e., . - Set the number of interfaces as , i.e.,
    number of interfaces on every node equals the number of channels. - Set the rate
    of channel on the single link as . - Set the rate lower bound . - Set the sensing
    cost of channel at node as . Therefore, using channel on the single link will
    impose a total sensing cost of . - Set the cost upper bound as . The mapping procedure
    is summarized in Table 1. If a solution is found for the MCBR-D problem instance,
    then there is a solution to the IK problem instance as well. If the total cost
    , then by definition . Similarly, if , then by definition .  ■ Theorem 3 The MCBR-D
    problem is NP-Complete. Proof Given that MCBR-D NP as shown in Lemma 1, and given
    that IK MCBR-D as shown in Lemma 2, then MCBR-D is NP-Complete. ■ Now, given that
    the decision version of the MCBR problem is NP-complete, then the optimization
    version is NP-hard. Table 1. A summary of the mapping procedure to convert an
    instance of IK problem into an instance of MCBR-D problem. Element of IK Mapped
    to in MCBR-D – 3.3. Integer linear program formulation We are now ready to present
    an integer linear program formulation (ILP) of the MCBR in order to obtain its
    optimal solution. The optimal solution will later be used as a reference to measure
    the performance of the sub-optimal algorithm proposed in Section 4. The ILP formulation
    uses two main types of binary variables: - : a binary variable to indicate (if
    equal to 1) that channel is assigned to link . - : a binary variable to indicate
    (if equal to 1) that channel is assigned to ’s incoming and/or outgoing link along
    the route , and it therefore needs to be monitored around the location of . The
    ILP formulation is outlined next in Eqs. (4)–(10). The cost of sensing channel
    at is (i.e., if the channel is used at and 0 otherwise). The objective function
    minimizes the total spectrum sensing cost by summing over all nodes in and all
    channels in . Constraints (5), (6) make sure that variable is equal to 1 if any
    of the two variables and is equal to 1. In other words, these constraints guarantee
    that channel is assigned to one of the interfaces at if is assigned to ’s incoming
    and/or outgoing links. Constraint (7) ensures that the total number of channels
    that node uses does not exceed its number of available interfaces . Finally, constraint
    (7) requires the total rate that a solution offers to link to be at least equal
    to . ILP Formulation of the MCBR Problem (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) 4. Relaxation-based
    iterative fixing (RIF) algorithm As the MCBR is NP-hard, we propose in this section
    a sub-optimal algorithm that is based on a linear program (LP) relaxation of the
    original ILP formulation. The idea of the proposed algorithm is to first relax
    all integer variables in the ILP formulation and make them real variables between
    0 and 1 (inclusive). Therefore, constraints (9), (10) will be replaced with the
    following two constraints respectively: (11) (12) Then, the algorithm works in
    iterations. In every iteration, some of the link channel assignment variables
    (i.e., ) are fixed (i.e., set to either 0 or 1). When the selected variables are
    fixed, the LP is generated and solved again. This process repeats until all variables
    are fixed. This procedure is outlined in Algorithm 1, and we call it the Relaxation-Based
    Iterative Fixing (RIF) Algorithm. As an input, RIF takes the ILP formulation of
    the MCBR problem, abbrev. . It then defines an empty set to hold the variables
    that get fixed during execution. A relaxed version of is then created, abbrev.
    . After that, in a while loop, the following steps take place: - The relaxed program
    is solved using any existing LP optimization algorithm. In our case, we used CPLEX
    optimizer [33]. - If the problem becomes infeasible (due to some improper variable
    fixing that we have already done), we run Algorithm 2 to try to achieve a feasible
    solution or at least one that has the maximum possible rate. - Otherwise, we check
    if there are variables that have the value of 1. If so, we fix them to 1, add
    them to , and update with the needed constraints to enforce the assignment. -
    Otherwise, the variable that has the maximum value among the channel assignment
    variables, excluding the ones in , is selected. If it has a value of 0, then this
    means that all variables are either 0’s or 1’s and we have reached a complete
    integer solution. Thus, that solution is returned. - On the other hand, if , we
    ceil it to 1, and add that to as a constraint (i.e., ). Then, two scenarios are
    possible: (a) Scenario 1: becomes infeasible. In such a case, we replace the “1”
    assignment with a “0” assignment by modifying the constraint to look like . (b)
    Scenario 2: is feasible. In this case, we maintain the “1” assignment. - The variable
    representing the maintained assignment (whether a “0” or “1” assignment) is added
    to set . The outer while loop terminates when all variables have been fixed (to
    either 0 or 1). Download : Download high-res image (431KB) Download : Download

    If Algorithm 1 fails to find a feasible solution, it calls Algorithm 2 to search
    for a feasible solution without worrying about cost minimization. The latter searches
    for an assignment that results in the highest bottleneck data rate. Algorithm
    2 also uses the idea of iterative variable fixing. It creates a relaxed LP version,
    abbrev. , of the original ILP formulation . However, it changes the objective
    function to be “Maximize ” instead of “Minimize ”. Therefore, here is a variable
    and not a given constant. Thus, maximizes the bottleneck rate subject to constraints
    on the number of available interfaces to every node along the route. In every
    round, the algorithm fixes one assignment variable (the one that results in the
    highest objective value). When all assignment variables are fixed (either to 0
    or 1), the algorithm terminates. Download : Download high-res image (399KB) Download

    1 works iteratively. In every iteration, it fixes one link assignment variable
    (representing the assignment of channel to link ). The total number of link assignment
    variables is . Thus, the maximum number of iterations is also . As the number
    of iterations is bounded, convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed. In every
    iteration of Algorithm 1, a linear program is solved twice. Linear programs (LPs)
    can be solved in polynomial time using several algorithms [35]. Let us assume
    that the complexity of the LP solver algorithm of choice is . Assuming that Algorithm
    1 succeeds (and thus does not call Algorithm 2), the worst case computational
    complexity in this case is . Download : Download high-res image (184KB) Download

    , (b) , and (c) . Let us now investigate the complexity of Algorithm 2. Similar
    to Algorithm 1, it executes a maximum of iterations. In every iteration, and in
    the worst case, an LP is solved for every remaining unassigned variable (the foreach
    loop at line 8). Therefore, the total number of times an LP is solved is given
    as follows: Therefore, the complexity of Algorithm 2 is . This makes the complexity
    of Algorithm 1 in case of failure . The complexity varies with different LP solver
    algorithms. For example, the complexity of Karmarkar’s projective algorithm is
    , where is the number of variables and is the number of bits needed to encode
    the problem’s data [35]. Another example is Vaidya’s algorithm that has a complexity
    of [36]. 5. Performance evaluation In this section, we evaluate the performance
    of the proposed RIF algorithm by comparing it to the optimal solution obtained
    by solving ILPs using IBM Cplex Optimizer. We perform extensive experimentation
    with various combinations of parameters to make sure the algorithm is well validated.
    Let us first outline the experimentation setup, and then present the findings.
    5.1. Evaluation setup In every experiment, we generate a route of length MU-SUs
    where the location of every individual node is determined randomly within the
    transmission range of its predecessor on the route. Every node is assumed to have
    a random number of available interfaces chosen uniformly at random form the range
    . To simulate achievable data rates of various channels along different links
    of the route, we need a way to simulate channel statistics and for all . We used
    the same technique proposed in [27] (see Section 6.B) with the assumption that
    all channels have the same capacity. As for the service pricing function , the
    cost of monitoring a given channel at a specific location is drawn uniformly at
    random from the range [1, 10]. In regards to the QoS requirement , we set it as
    a percentage of the upper bound on the achievable data rate along route. To get
    this upper bound, we treat every link individually. For every link , at most channels
    can be assigned to it. Let be the set of best channels (in terms of achievable
    data rates) to be used along link . Then, the upper bound on the data rate of
    link is calculated as follows: (13) Then, we set as follows: (14) where . 5.2.
    Results Now, we are ready to present the results. We ran three categories of experiments.
    The first addresses the accuracy of the RIF algorithm. The second addresses the
    performance of the RM-IF algorithm which is used when RIF fails. The third category
    addresses the effect of rate requirements (i.e., ) on the cost of the solution.
    5.2.1. Algorithm accuracy To evaluate the accuracy of RIF algorithm, we generated
    routes of lengths . For every generated instance, the number of interfaces for
    every node is randomly generated from the range , where . Fig. 3 shows the error
    of RIF algorithm for . The error is calculated as follows: Every point on the
    three subfigures is an average of 1000 randomly generated instances. Fig. 3.a
    shows that RIF is roughly within 15% of the optimal solution when the rate requirement
    is low ( ) for all values of and for all route lengths. When is increased to 0.5,
    the error becomes more dependent on the maximum number of available interfaces
    and weakly dependent on the route length. For low interface availability ( ),
    Fig. 3.b shows that the error is within 15% for very short routes (length of 5)
    to 19% for long very routes (length of 25). The values are roughly around 15%
    for and 14% for for all route lengths. Fig. 3.c shows the case when , i.e., very
    high rate requirements. Here the dependency of the error on both route length
    and is more obvious. For low interface availability ( ), RIF algorithm is within
    6% of the optimal for very short routes (length of 5) to around 31% of the optimal
    solution for long routes (length of 25). This range improves when is increased
    to 4 becoming 6% for short routes to around 23% for long routes. It improves even
    further when allowing more interfaces (i.e., ) becoming 6% for short routes to
    around 19% for long routes. 5.2.2. The failure behavior of the algorithm when
    RIF algorithm fails to find a feasible solution, it calls RM-IF algorithm to find
    a solution with the highest bottleneck rate possible. However, if the rate achieved
    by RM-IF is lower than the required data rate, then we failed to find a feasible
    solution. This is expected to occur in cases of very restrictive circumstances
    (i.e., high and low ). Therefore, we need to quantify the failure rate defined
    as the ratio of the number of instances for which no feasible solution is found
    to the total number of instances (multiplied by 100%). Fig. 4 shows this ratio
    against rate requirement and number of interfaces . Every point on the figure
    is the average of 7500 randomly generated instances. Every 1500 instances correspond
    to a route length from the set . As the figure shows, the failures rate is almost
    zero for . The failure rate with the increase of and the decrease of . However,
    in the most difficult case of and , only 12% of the instances are not solved by
    the proposed algorithm. This number decreases to around 3% when . Even if the
    proposed algorithm fails to find a feasible solution, it tries to find a solution
    with the highest possible bottleneck rate. In Fig. 5, we quantify the ratio of
    the achieved data rate to the required data rate (i.e., ). Similar to the previous
    experiment, every point on the figure is the average of 7500 randomly generated
    instances. Every 1500 instances correspond to a route length from the set . For
    clarity of presentation, we set the ratio ( ) to 1 if . As the figure shows, in
    the worst case ( and ), the achieved rate is around 0.89 of . It improves to be
    around 0.98 of for . Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download : Download

    . 5.2.3. The effect of rate requirement In the last experiment, we want to study
    how the rate requirement (represented by ) affects the cost of the solution (as
    stated in Eq. (4)). To do so, we generate a random route instance of a given length.
    We solve the instance for and find the cost, let that be . Then, we reduce to
    a value from the set and solve the instance again. The cost reduction in this
    case is calculated as: For the same value of , 1500 instances are randomly generated
    with a fixed route length from the set and a fixed number of interfaces from the
    set (i.e., ). The cost reduction is then averaged over all the 1500 instances.
    It is worth pointing out that the optimal solutions (obtained by solving the proposed
    ILP formulation) are used for this experiment. Fig. 6.(a), .(b), and .(c) show
    the average cost reduction for route length 5, 15, and 25 respectively. The findings
    of this experiment can be summarized as follows: Download : Download high-res

    are available. On the contrary, larger values of allow for larger solution spaces
    with more potentially better solutions. - The shorter the route the higher the
    achievable cost reduction. - Roughly speaking, reducing the rate requirement by
    half results in a cost reduction of around 50%. Download : Download high-res image

    the problem of spectrum allocation along an established route in dynamic spectrum
    access networks with the objective of minimizing the spectrum sensing cost imposed
    by a SSaS provider while maintaining QoS guarantees. We formulated the problem
    as an integer linear program. Given the NP-hardness of the problem, we proposed
    a sub-optimal algorithm based on the idea of iterative relaxation and variable
    fixing. Via extensive experimentation, we proved that our proposed algorithm is
    within 19% of the optimal solution. We also studied the relationship between rate
    requirements and cost reduction and showed that around 50% cost reduction is gained
    if the rate requirement is cut by half. Declaration of Competing Interest The

    Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) is the principal component of the new generation (i.e.,
    5G/6G) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) to assist collision avoidance,
    convenient traffic management, and emergent safety warnings [1], [2], [3], [4].
    In the United States, Federal Communication Commission (FCC) allows a 75 MHz spectrum
    band for Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) to support the deployment
    of VANETs [5]. The European Commission approves 30 MHz spectrum in the 5.9 GHz
    band for road ITS services [6]. Several other countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
    such as Japan, Korea, Singapore, China, and Australia, also exclusively assign
    a narrow DSRC band from the 5.9 GHz spectrum for ITS applications [7]. IEEE-1609
    is standardizing IEEE 802.11p, which enables ITS services for Wireless Access
    in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) architecture based on DSRC technology [8]. In
    the ITS-enabled VANETs, DSRC communication takes place in three possible ways,
    such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and in between
    the infrastructures (I2I) [5]. Nowadays, an intelligent VANETs architecture has
    to support smart V2V connectivity among the cars on the road and Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) in low altitudes [9]. The infrastructure in VANTs works as a Road
    Side Unit (RSU), which offers multiple services to the connected vehicles [10].
    Therefore, channel allocation to these VANET-enabled ITS services makes the DSRC
    band easily congested when traffic density remains high, especially in the urban
    area [11]. Meanwhile, the severe spectrum scarcity already emerges as a crucial
    problem concerning the potential deployment of ITS services for vehicular and
    future wireless communications [12]. To deal with spectrum scarcity, on October
    28, 2020, FCC expanded the ability of unlicensed white space devices to deliver
    wireless broadband services in rural areas and areas where fewer broadcast television
    stations are on the air [13]. On March 17, 2021, the commission allowed unlicensed
    TV White Space operations in the 600 MHz band [14]. In 2021, FCC further adopted
    several modifications to the white space device rules to promote the ecosystem''s
    continued development, mainly to supply rural and underserved communities with
    affordable broadband service that can aid in bridging the digital divide while
    safeguarding broadcast television stations in the band from harmful interference
    [15]. In this context, Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have evolved as intelligent
    radios that opportunistically utilize the idle licensed spectrum [16], [17]. The
    promising outcome of CRNs technology is amalgamated with VANET (CR-VANETs) to
    pursue sustainable communication with efficient spectrum utilization, which has
    garnered considerable limelight [1], [2], [3], [4]. Intelligent vehicles and infrastructures
    in CR-VANETs undertake opportunistic data transmission and can exploit the full
    potential of ITSs services using the available underutilized spectrum [1], [2],
    [3], [4], [5], [11], [16], [18], [19], [20]. CRN''s most essential functions are
    avoiding harmful interference with the Primary User (PU) and recognizing the available
    spectrum to improve spectrum efficiency [20], [21], [22]. Therefore, the key to
    adequate opportunistic spectrum access in CR-VANETs is Spectrum Sensing (SS) [21],
    [22]. Along with SS, dynamic channel scheduling for CR-VANETs is essential in
    focusing on vehicles'' mobility modeling to assist reliable data transmission
    among V2V, and V2I [2], [5]. 1.1. Background and motivations Reliable Cooperative
    Spectrum Sensing (CSS) is a difficult task for CR-VANETs due to the mobility of
    the vehicles, dynamic PU activities, multi-path signal propagation, low SNR conditions,
    Doppler effect, misleading sensing information, and so on [2], [20], [21], [23],
    [24]. A few recent significant works from the existing literature on CR-VANETs
    related to spectrum sensing and opportunistic channel allocation/access strategies
    are found in [1], [5], [11], [18], [20], [21], [22], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]
    and [30]. 1.1.1. Access control and security aspects for vehicular network In
    CR-VANETs, multiple wireless devices with varying levels of access rights compete
    for access to the available spectrum, and this creates the need for a robust access
    control mechanism. One way to ensure access control in CR-VANETs is through the
    implementation of CR technology, which enables a device to identify and utilize
    the available spectrum resources. However, the access control mechanism should
    ensure that only authorized devices have access to the spectrum. In addition to
    access control, security is also a critical concern in CR-VANETs, and there are
    several security threats that need to be addressed. For instance, the open nature
    of wireless communication makes CR-VANETs vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming,
    and other types of attacks. To address these security threats, various security
    mechanisms such as authentication, encryption, and intrusion detection have been
    proposed in the literature [31], [32]. Access control and security aspects are
    important considerations in CR-VANETs and need a special look while addressing
    those concerns. However, the present work focuses another two important aspects
    of CR-VANETs i.e., spectrum sensing and spectrum allocation strategy. Gul et al.
    [1] presents Uniforming Random Ordered Policy (UROP) and shows that it achieves
    near-optimal throughput in CR-VANETs. The work [1] mainly focuses on idle channel
    allocation strategy rather than SS. However, a good policy in channel sensing
    increases the spectrum and energy efficiency, which is missing in [1]. Pal et
    al. [5] uses the sensed data received only from the RSUs to estimate the channels''
    state. The spatial variation in the sensed values is lost when the PU channels
    are solely perceived from immobile RSU. Furthermore, the dense deployment of RSUs
    also raises operational costs in rural-urban areas. The stochastic environments
    of CR-VANETs are time-dependent and highly influenced by PU''s temporal usage
    profile, which makes the Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) be modeled as a non-Markovian
    process [11]. The authors integrate the recurrent Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
    layer with a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) network in [11] to improve the vehicle channel
    access policy for the dynamic scenarios. The sensing part is ignored as the work
    [11] considers that Cognitive Base Station (CBS) already has a set of channels.
    After that, all the vehicles blindly compete with each other and with PU to get
    the idle channel allocation from CBS. For practical deployment, such system design
    [11] requires a massive synchronization and dedicated deadlock avoidance and prevention
    algorithms on channel access. A semi-Markov decision process (SMDP)-based channel
    allocation scheme is investigated in [29]. In [18], Li et al. explore the channel
    sensing followed by the OSA model for a multi-hop clustering scenario. The SS
    derives the actual state of the channel using a log-normal shadowing model [18].
    Their work does not analyze the pattern of the PU traffic model, and spectrum
    access is wholly based on the instantaneous channel state. The PU channel state
    can be compared to a stochastic random variable which can be learned and predicted
    through proper time-series data analysis or using the Reinforcement Learning (RL)
    algorithm [20]. The authors employ RL models in the sensing process by RSUs to
    adapt to the unpredictable environment by continually obtaining rewards and penalties
    for every SS decision made [20]. Paul et al. propose a uniform mobility model
    for PU and cognitive vehicles in the SS process [21]. The work in [30] uses random
    matrix theory to examine how well energy detectors (ED) with multiple antennas
    operate in CR-VANETs, where vehicle sensing signals are time-correlated. In [22],
    single-lane and double-lane traffic situations are considered to examine the combined
    effects of PU activity and vehicle motion on SS performance. It also assesses
    how traffic concentrations affect sensing effectiveness by generating analytical
    equations for miss-detection likelihood. Ahmed et al. in [25] use intelligent
    hybrid learning spectrum agents that perform sensing using a deep learning (DL)
    model for the CR-VANETs framework. It effectively forecasts the spectrum occupancy
    in the primary spectrum and allocates the idle channels to the cognitive vehicles
    using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Chen et al. enhances the RL-based
    DQL model to adapt dynamic communication under various reward function situations,
    sensing errors to improve the spectrum access rates [26]. The authors consider
    UAVs'' spatial flexibility and unequal distribution density by suggesting a sequential
    probability ratio test (SPRT) for CSS in CR-enabled UAV networks in [27]. Liu
    et al. [28] examine spectrum sensing problems across the composite Los/non-Los
    channel with impulsive noise and unpredictable arrivals of PU signals. Additionally,
    Wang et al. [33] propose an LMH algorithm for non-parametric spectrum sensing
    that employs learning techniques to improve both the sensing performance and efficiency.
    The authors in [34] include different sensing delay constraints to optimize energy
    efficiency while maintaining CSS performance. Strict constraints reduce sensing
    time when the channel is good, while loose constraints allow more time to guarantee
    performance in poor channels. The authors in [35] propose a cooperative vehicular
    architecture (i.e., not CR-VANETs) with a virtualized RSU which is implemented
    for dense traffic regions. Furthermore, they use an LSTM-based ML algorithm to
    predict traffic flow using a vehicle information table. Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV) is implemented at the top of RSU to assist in expanding the coverage range
    based on predicted traffic density. See Table 1 for relevent discussions on the
    recent works on sensing and channel access in CR-VANETs. Table 1. Significant
    Recent Works on Sensing and Channel Access in CR-VANETs. From the discussions
    mentioned above, it is clear that a small number of good works [5], [18], [25]
    evaluate spectrum sensing and a channel allocation policy in a single framework.
    Here, it is worth mentioning that knowledge of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically
    Machine Learning (ML), is essential to intelligently evaluate real-world autonomous
    CR-VANETs and create innovative and automated vehicular communications [36]. The
    study on opportunistic channel access using ML techniques for CRNs and VANETs
    has been thoroughly investigated separately, but for CR-VANETs, it is still in
    the primary stages [11], [20], [25], [37], [38]. Meanwhile, a joint framework
    is yet to be proposed where an intelligent agent will estimate the channels''
    state for the upcoming timestamps through adaptive learning and create a prioritized
    channel indexing for reliable data communication along with CSS and spectrum access.
    1.2. Scope and contributions of the work Intelligent wireless communications are
    made possible by the advent of AI; ML is a formidable technology that might be
    used to address the OSA issue. DRL combines RL''s autonomous decision-making capabilities
    with deep neural networks'' multidimensional sensory capabilities. The agents
    gain knowledge by interacting with their surroundings and through trial-and-error
    learning. Due to the dimensionality constraint brought on by the state-action
    space''s exponential increase in multiuser settings, most existing research concentrates
    on the OSA of a single user based on the single-agent DRL method. However, due
    to their broad search space, joint optimization problems need precise Channel
    State Information (CSI) and can have a considerable computing cost. The communication
    system cannot correctly predict the CSI in practice due to the stochastic nature
    of PU traffic and sensing errors. RL is a robust decision-making technique, linking
    events to behaviors to optimize a monetary reward function. However, while interacting
    with a stochastic wireless environment, CR-VANETs must consider the PU''s channel
    access characteristics by integrating observations made at specific periods with
    statistical analysis. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
    become a potential strategy for making decisions since they enable optimum performance
    by integrating observations at specific periods [39], [40]. However, the scope
    of the POMDP modeling is not well investigated for the CR-VANETs'' spectrum sensing
    and OSA till now. Present work explores some open issues in CR-VANETs and proposes
    their solution, such as best channel allocation from the pool of idle channels
    to SUs based on the adaptive deep learning model, future channel state estimation,
    and indexing of PU channels to help in selective sensing based on the probability
    of being idle in upcoming time stamps. Furthermore, sensing individual PU channels
    by the multiple SUs at different times includes the temporal characteristics in
    the local SS outcomes. It is worth mentioning that due to the vehicle''s velocity,
    attenuation, Doppler effect, device sensing error, hardware malfunction, and many
    other parameters have significant impacts on local SS as well. Therefore, general
    fusion rules can not effectively be applied in the global CSS decision policy
    at CBS. In this work, we propose a DRL-based CSS solution to deal with the uncertain
    spectrum environment in the CR-VANETs. Meanwhile, blind sensing of every channel
    over a broad spectrum range increases the energy consumption of secondary nodes.
    To get rid of this blind SS strategy, the present work includes a selective spectrum
    sensing policy based on an LSTM-based algorithm. The current technique selects
    those channels for sensing in which the probabilistic chances of PU being active
    are higher than the rest. Finally, the present work proposes the POMDP framework-based
    spectrum allocation strategy to the CR-VANETs using a Deep Q-learning algorithm.

    Fig. 1. Contributions of the present work. The rest of the article is organized
    as follows: Section 2 discusses the system model. Section 3 reports on the formulation
    of the problem and the suggested solution. The simulation results and numerical
    analyses are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the present
    work. 2. System model Fig. 2 depicts the proposed system model for some urban
    areas where the primary network consists of a Primary Transmitter (PUT) (e.g.,
    TV station) and multiple Primary Receivers (PUR). The secondary network, i.e.,
    CR-VANETs, contains multiple Secondary Users (SUs), which include CR-enabled vehicles,
    UAVs, RSUs, and a CBS. All SUs are equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)
    and CR-board (e.g., Ettus USRP B210). Here to mention that all the secondary units
    except CBS participate in the CSS process. CBS, the control unit for CR-VANETs
    in its region, obtains the final CSS decision and performs channel allocation
    to all SUs. All the computational processing for CSS decisions, channel allocation,
    channel indexing with prioritization, and future channel state estimation are
    performed in CBS only. Similar to [11], a vehicle can only subscribe to one channel
    for opportunistic Device-to-Device (D2D) transmission during a specific time frame.
    Let us assume PUT has ‘ ’ number of orthogonal channels, each of which has a fixed
    bandwidth in some specific spectrum band. PU merely accesses all or a few licensed
    channels based on the services and requirements. The CBS has complete knowledge
    of the frequency range of PU channels and stores in a table. The maximum number
    of SUs in CR-VANETs is ‘ ’ where . All SUs are connected to the local CBS through
    a Common Control Channel (CCCH) and Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH). The periodic
    SS is performed by all SU units as discussed in Section 2.1. Download : Download

    model for CR-VANETs. 2.1. Signal modeling for spectrum sensing in CR-VANETs In
    the present work, there are two types of SUs, i.e., mobile and immobile SUs. In
    mobile SUs, all the running vehicles and UAVs are included, whereas immobile SUs
    have RSUs and static vehicles (i.e., car engine on). On a particular time instant,
    the probability of PU being active and idle over a channel is represented by and
    , respectively. The reliability of the CSS process is measured through the probability
    of PU detection ( ) and the probability of false alarm ( ) [41], [42]. Every SU
    inside the PU transmission range is presumed to have the same sensing energy threshold
    (ϵ) for the ED-based CSS process [21]. It is considered that each SU obtains its
    local sensing decision and forwards the same to CBS for global decision. The received
    signal ( ) from PUT to jth SU over a channel can be modeled using the Doppler
    effect and multi-path propagation, which is expressed as (1) where symbols , ,
    p, , , , and represent the binary hypothesis of PU being active (i.e., ) or idle
    (i.e., ), channel gain, a total number of propagation paths, delay of LoS/NLoS
    path, the vehicle''s velocity, transmitted PU signal, and noise at jth SU, respectively.
    The sampling frequency, sample time, and the Number of PU samples are denoted
    with the symbols , t, and , respectively, where . The transmitted PU signal is
    modeled with zero mean and variance . The noise at the jth SU is generated by
    a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) random variable with zero mean
    and variance of . The distance in Euclidean space and the path loss exponent of
    the channel is represented by and in the wireless channel fading coefficient between
    PU and jth SU, which follows . The test statistic for all of the PU samples that
    are received at the jth SU is written as (2) The values of individual and at the
    jth SU are obtained as [17] (3) (4) where Q-function in Eqs. (3) and (4) is defined
    as . The descriptions of important symbols are listed in Table 2. Table 2. List

    of PU channels is , and the number of SUs (i.e., including all secondary vehicles,
    UAVs, and RSUs) is where . In this work, we propose an optimal sensing strategy
    where participating SUs selectively sense the m Number of PU channels. The benefit
    of this selective CSS approach is reducing the energy consumption for the sensing
    and the OSA slot increases for reliable data transmissions. We explain the selection
    process of m channels from number of channels in Section 3. From Fig. 3, it is
    noted that a single time frame (T) is divided into τ and distinct slots for SS
    and OSA, respectively. The SS slot is subdivided into m-Number of Sensing-Reporting
    (SR) sub-slots ( ) as . Each SR slot (e.g., ) is further equally patented in sensing
    ( ) and reporting ( ) slots. The sensing process of m distinct channels by the
    Number of SUs is shown in Fig. 4. At a particular time-instant, distinct spatially
    diverse SUs senses m-number of distinct PU channels where . The variations in
    the received PU signal at independent SUs due to spatial and temporal differences
    improve the reliability of global CSS decisions at CBS. This cyclic sensing process
    by SUs, as shown in Fig. 4, is controlled and synchronized through the Algorithm
    1. It is assumed that after local sensing, each SU forwards its local decision
    along with the GPS data to CBS through CCCH. Finally, CBS collects those local
    SS results and stores them in the matrix for obtaining the global CSS decision.

    solutions one after another in a single framework for CR-VANETs as follows • Reliable

    sensing using LSTM-based time series analysis. • Channel/Spectrum allocation to

    3.1. Reliable CSS for CR-VANETs using DRL technique Spectrum sensing helps to
    identify the idle channels in CRNs. During sensing, CBS selects only m number
    of channels from number of channels to be sensed by SUs. This channel selection
    for SS is based upon the possibility of PU being active over the channels. Each
    channel is indexed according to the probability of PU being active over that respective
    channel on the current timestamp as shown in “CBS Channel Sensing List” in Fig.
    5. CBS maintains and periodically updates that list in each time frame explained
    in Section 3.2. Each element of the matrix in CBS represents the local SS outcomes
    by its respective SUs. It is worth mentioning that the local SS results are forwarded
    to CBS from spatially diverse SUs, where multiple SUs sense individual channels
    at different timestamps (timestamps refer to the exact time of sensing by its
    respective SU, e.g., HH:mm:ss.SSS time-format). There are many influencing parameters
    in CR-VANETs, as mentioned earlier, that impact individual SS outcomes and sometimes
    lead to imperfect sensing outcomes. Therefore logical AND, OR, Majority, etc.
    fusion rules for obtaining global CSS decision are not directly applicable in
    a blind way to CR-VANETs. This requires proper analysis of correlated data and
    adapting intelligent learning policy. The present work employs the DRL algorithm
    using neural networks at CBS for obtaining the global CSS decision. The DRL-based
    algorithm considers the local SS data in and its respective SU''s GPS data and
    timestamps while obtaining the final CSS decision. The input dimensions of the
    data for obtaining global CSS decision become as shown in Fig. 6. There are m
    number of channels to sense, which produces Number of Markov states ( ). To make
    the state-space concept clear, consider this example, suppose there are only two
    channels to sense that can be precisely mapped to one from four possible states
    in space, i.e., and . The state of DRL is generated from the observation space
    ( ) and the applied action ( ) on it. Therefore, . The input data in the DRL algorithm
    looks as shown in Fig. 6. There are two actions ( ) in action space ( ), i.e.,
    assign channel status as either 1 or 0. The DRL agent can intelligently choose
    each channel''s action value based on its adaptive neural computation. Therefore,
    the total possible actions in space for m number of channels is also . Download

    data preparation for DRL-based CSS algorithm (observation (cmt)). Applying the
    RL/DRL algorithm to solve a particular problem requires the formulation of a Markov
    Decision Process (MDP). The general MDP is defined as a collection of five attributes
    where symbols , and γ represent the state (s) space, action (a) space, transition
    probability from the present state to next state through an action, reward (r)
    function and discount factor, respectively [41]. A state-transition probability
    matrix is a mathematical representation of the probabilities associated with transitioning
    between different states. If such a matrix is not available or not fully defined,
    it can make the task of selecting the best next state during exploration more
    challenging. In this context, the ϵ−Greedy policy is a technique used to balance
    the exploration of new states with the exploitation of existing knowledge. The
    policy involves randomly selecting a next state with probability ϵ and selecting
    the current best state with probability . By using this policy, the agent can
    continue to explore new states even when the state-transition probabilities are
    not fully defined, allowing it to learn and improve its decisions over time. Similarly,
    in the present problem, we do not have any defined state-transition probability/matrix,
    so we use ϵ−Greedy policy to select a possible next state during exploration.
    The DRL algorithm is also known as the DQN algorithm because it is the advanced
    extension of the RL-based Q-learning algorithm [41]. The general form of adaptive
    Q-learning to periodically update its Q-value while obtaining a new state ( )
    with a constant learning rate (β) on time instant ‘t’ is written as (5) The mapping
    combination of state-action space (i.e., ) is too large for the present problem.
    For combination, the agent requires excessive memory while calculating future
    Q-state/value through minimizing the Temporal Difference (TD) in Eq. (5). To avoid
    such massive computation and memory requirements, we use a Deep Neural Network
    (DNN) with RL-based Q-learning (i.e., DRL) that predicts the best action to obtain
    the best reward value based on the input ( ). (6) In DRL, the Q-function is modified
    to , where indicates the weight of the neurons in the neural nets. The reward
    calculation is managed by calculating the Spectrum Efficiency (SE) rate in CR-VANETs
    by CBS. The DRL agent receives the SE value through an acknowledgment signal from
    CBS. For successful state prediction/action of a channel, the agent receives a
    positive SE value while the wrong prediction/action SE value becomes negative.
    It is considered that CBS can find data collisions between SU and PU networks
    over the channels. After each time frame T, CBS gets complete knowledge of PU
    traffic from the environment and stores the same in the PU traffic database. The
    inherited property of model-free DRL drives the agent to maximize the total reward
    value. SE value on ith channel is calculated as given in Eq. (6). Therefore, the
    reward ( ) is calculated after each time frame T as (7) In our DRL-based CSS technique,
    TD gets optimized by minimizing Mean Square Error (MSE) as given in Eq. (8), which
    is the difference between Target Q-value and the Predicted Q-value. (8) During
    the DRL training phase as described in Algorithm 2, neuron weights ( ) are updated
    iteratively through the Batch/Stochastic Gradient Descent (GD) technique to minimize
    the loss function in Eq. (8). The is updated here through batch GD and is derived
    with learning rate (ζ) as , where . To reduce the divergence and over-fit issues,
    we use Experience Replay memory ( ). Finally, the in the Eq. (8) is modified as
    (9) The input data is processed in linear form (i.e., each channel transforms
    to a linear array of elements) and fits the same in fully connected neural networks
    for DRL-based processing. Each GPS data holds latitude and longitude information;
    hence the input data dimension becomes . As a CSS decision, DRL produces an outcome
    of an array (ar) of size m, where each element in ‘ar’ holds either 0 or 1, which
    represents PU is either idle or active, respectively over the channel. Download

    2. DRL-based CSS training algorithm for CR-VANETs. The current DRL-based (i.e.,
    Algorithm 2) technique generally takes amount of time to train, where N is the
    number of training iterations and M is the size of the neural network. The size
    of the neural network could be high while we are looking for fast convergence
    in the present DRL algorithm, which can result in a considerable increase in computational
    time complexity. However, the computational efficiency of the DRL could be decreased
    using a number of methods, including experience replay, target network updates,
    and prioritized experience replay. These methods can lessen the number of training
    iterations needed and increase the algorithm''s rate of convergence. 3.2. Channel
    indexing using LSTM model for selective sensing In this section, we discuss channel
    indexing which helps with selective sensing. We aim to index the ‘ ’ channels
    in terms of the maximum possibility (i.e., descending order) of PU being active
    over the channels in the next time frame. The conventional sensing approach senses
    all the PU channels using participating SUs. But, in the limited sensing period,
    acquiring enough PU samples for individual channels increases the channel switching
    cost and energy consumption. Therefore, the proposed technique presents an alternative
    approach, i.e., selective channel sensing. In this technique, out of channels,
    SUs sense the ‘ ’ number of channels where . The selection of ‘ ’ channels is
    governed and periodically updated in each time frame by the current LSTM-based
    deep learning algorithm. For the proposed LSTM-based indexing model, we use the
    historical observations of the PU channel access pattern. As stated earlier, CBS
    gets complete knowledge of PU channel access information after each time frame
    (i.e., T) and stores the same in the PU traffic database (see Fig. 5). LSTM is
    developed on the basic principle of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [43]. In this
    work, we assume that PU accesses a maximum ‘ ’ number of channels at a time where
    . Using the binomial theorem, there is a total number of possible combination
    for selecting ‘ ’ number of channels for selective sensing from the ‘ ’ number
    of PU channels. In the example in Fig. 7, we consider that PU has 10 ( ) licensed
    channels {CH1,CH2,..,CH10}, from that PU accesses a maximum of 4 ( ) channels
    at a time and value is 5. As PU is a legitimate user of the licensed channels;
    hence we could not impose any restriction on the PU channel access pattern. However,
    in a practical scenario, the channel access policy by PU follows a complex pattern
    over time. Although the PU channel access seems random, closer periodic observation
    in a larger duration reveals the hidden pattern in the PU channel access policy.
    Extensive training through the LSTM model using PU time series data helps the
    neural nets to probabilistically estimate the list of channels the PU might access
    in the next time frame [44]. Download : Download high-res image (111KB) Download

    of channels list for next time frame in which a high possibility of PU being active.
    From Fig. 7, we can see that PU gets active over some selected channels in each
    time frame. For example, during Ti+1, PU accesses channel {CH1, CH2} while in
    the next time frame Ti+2, PU accesses the channel {CH2, CH5, CH7, CH1} and PU
    continues channel selection for all the upcoming time frames. This way, PU generates
    the sequence ( ) of channel access in each time frame (t). Just for simplicity,
    we arrange the channel sequence in ascending order (e.g., {CH1, CH2, CH5, CH7}).
    The word becomes similar to sequence of . From Fig. 8, the hidden active state
    ( ) and output sequence ( ) at time-step t are calculated using RNN as (10) (11)
    In the above Eqs. (10), and (12), symbols , , , represent shared weight matrices
    and , denote the bias in the neural networks. There are two activation functions
    and . In the framework of RNNs, the vanishing and exploding gradient anomalies
    occur frequently. They occur because multiplicative gradient, which can exponentially
    decrease or increase concerning the number of layers, makes it impossible to capture
    long-term interdependence. These mentioned problems can be solved using an LSTM
    model [45]. Download : Download high-res image (54KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Basic architecture for predicting channel access sequence at timestamp
    t. A typical LSTM network comprises several memory blocks or cells. The cell state
    and the hidden state are the two states being passed to the subsequent cell. LSTM
    employs three main Gates (see Fig. 9) to manipulate the memory blocks as follows
    (i) Forget Gate ( ) - which determines how much information the memory cell will
    get from the memory cell from the previous step; ii) Update/Input gate ( ) - which
    determines the update possibility of a memory cell and regulates how much information
    the current memory cell will acquire from a possible new memory cell, iii) Output
    gate ( ) – controls the value of the next hidden state. The term “gate” in LSTM
    refers to the Sigmoid (σ) activation function. Along with the structural difference
    between Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, there is another import difference, i.e., the presence
    of variable in Fig. 9 unlike in Fig. 8. The symbol represents the block''s long-term
    state memory at timestamp t. The output of forget gate is computed as . The update
    gate updates and includes the data to the cell state using the following operations
    and , respectively. Therefore, present in the LSTM block becomes . The Output
    gate generates and obtained as . The outcome/hidden state from the present block
    is calculated as . Element-wise addition and multiplication between two vectors
    are denoted by the symbols ⊕ and ⊗, respectively. Here, we apply a activation
    function on to visualize the output sequence from the present LSTM block as .
    However, general LSTM''s performance can be improved by upgrading the LSTM model
    to a Bi-directional LSTM architecture where the input sequence flows simultaneously
    in both directions (i.e., forward and backward) [45]. The present work finally
    employs the typical bi-directional LSTM model, as shown in Fig. 10, to estimate
    the upcoming possible channel sequence accessed by the PU in CR-VANETs. Download

    LSTM algorithm. The experimental setups for LSTM involve preparing the data for
    the model, training the model, and evaluating its performance. We use a simulated
    dataset of 10,000 sequences of values that represent time series data which is
    prepossessed to normalize the data and ensure that it is in the appropriate format
    for input to the present LSTM model. We split the data 70:10:20 ratio for training,
    validation, and testing, respectively. The LSTM model is trained on the training
    set, where the weights of the model are updated iteratively using an optimization
    algorithm such as gradient descent. During training, the model is validated on
    a separate validation set to monitor its performance and prevent over-fitting.
    After the model is trained, it is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance.
    For time-series prediction for possible channel sequence, the model''s output
    is further compared to the actual values in the test set using Root Mean Squared
    Error (RMSE). In the present work, we use 128 LSTM cells and three layers in the
    network where the learning rate is 0.01. For a multi-layer LSTM network, the total
    time complexity is the sum of the time complexities of all the layers. Thus, if
    there are L layers in the present LSTM networks, the overall time complexity would
    be where N is the length of the input sequence and M is the number of LSTM cells
    in the layer. However, it is important to note that the actual time complexity
    of an LSTM algorithm can be affected by many factors, such as the specific implementation,
    the type of input data, and the optimization algorithm used during training. 3.3.
    Spectrum allocation to CR-VANETs in POMDP framework After selective channel indexing
    for sensing (Section 3.2) and decision-making regarding PU transmission state
    over the sensed channels (Section 3.1), spectrum allocation to the CR-VANETs takes
    place in a POMDP framework. In the present spectrum allocation model, the agent
    is not confident about the ith channel''s actual state (idle or busy). There is
    always a possibility of wrong predictions about the channel state through the
    DRL-based sensing process. Furthermore, PU can be active over other channels that
    are not even being indexed for SS by the LSTM-based channel indexing algorithm.
    Therefore, the present spectrum allocation policy is formulated using the POMDP
    model. An MDP becomes a POMDP if the agent does not have exact state information
    (i.e., channel state) but makes observations on the same. In POMDP, we have states
    ( ), actions ( ), state transition probability ( ), observations (Ω), observation
    function (O), reward value ( ), and a discount factor (γ) [46]. The collection
    of all of these seven tuples is presented as and the relation among them is graphically
    represented in Fig. 11. The selection/identification/prediction of the ‘ ’ number
    of active PU channels (see Section 3.2) by the agent helps to allocate ‘ ’ number
    of free channels to CR-VANETs from the pool of number of idle channels at time
    instant t. The Number of PU channels is , and the agent has to choose number of
    active channels from . Therefore, number of channels from number of channels can
    be selected in number of ways. The agent has binary action (a) for each channel,
    i.e., select or not-select; hence the total possible actions ( ) over channels
    become . As PU already starts transmitting over ‘ ’ number of channels at timestamp
    t; hence the actual state (i.e., transmitting over which channels) is hidden from
    the agent. Here comes the role of observation states (Ω) and observations function
    (O). Each state provides an observation that hints at its state rather than simply
    perceiving the present state. The observation hints about the channel''s state
    possibilities, i.e., active or idle. Observations made by the agent rely on the
    current state (see Fig. 11). Based on the collective observations of all channels,
    the agent creates a belief about the possible system''s state. A probability distribution
    across all potential states is used to describe this belief, referred to as a
    Belief State (B). The set of discrete observations ( ) is generated based on analysis
    of historical PU access patterns over the channels, see Eq. (15). The observation
    tells about the possibility of a ‘ ’ channel being active by PU over the time
    stamp t, but the observations might also be wrong. The observation function (O)
    maps the observations in a probabilistic way as . The agent uses the belief vector
    B on the observations to summarize/memorize all the previous state-action sequences,
    which is a probability distribution over all the state space as and . The initial
    belief for each possible state is and periodically gets updated by the agent using
    an action (a) and an observation (o) using the Bayes theorem as follows (12) A
    policy (π) defining the appropriate action for each belief serves as the POMDP''s
    solution. The optimal policy based on the value iteration function ( ) finds the
    highest Q-value with maximum reward (see Eq. (7)) which can be written as and
    Q function is formulated as (13) Now, we can apply the DRL technique as designed
    in Algorithm 3 to solve the above problem with slight modification in Eq. (13)
    by including neural weights and bias . We can update the parameters of the neural
    network by minimizing the loss function (see Eq. (8)) as an alternative to updating
    each Q-value as follows (14) Experience Replay (ERm) supplies the historical data
    records for optimizing the above equation, i.e., state-belief-observation records,
    using the DRL algorithm. The probability of the ith channel being accessed by
    PU is statistically obtained as . The probability of accessing the sequence of
    ‘ ’ number of channels from state space can be defined using chain rule as (15)
    This probability of accessing the channels {CHa,CHb .. CH } from number of channels
    generates an observation at time stamp t. Thus the total number of observations
    becomes . These observations are kept in set Ω and updated periodically. Download

    3. DRL-based spectrum allocation to CR-VANETs. The time complexity of the present
    DRL algorithm in a POMDP framework can be impacted by factors such as the size
    of the state and action spaces, the complexity of the observation model and belief
    update, the number of hidden layers and neurons in the neural network, and the
    optimization algorithm used during training. In general, the time complexity of
    a DRL algorithm in a POMDP framework can be quite high, as it often requires a
    large number of simulations to update the belief state and make decisions based
    on the current observations. However, there are a number of techniques to reduce
    the computational complexity of the POMDP-based DRL algorithm, such as using approximation
    methods to simplify the belief update or reducing the size of the state and action
    spaces. Using the value approximation [47], we can estimate the time complexity
    to solve the present POMDP problem as where is the discount factor and symbol
    C presents a proper cover of all belief space while represents the maximum reachable
    space from a belief. The symbol ϵ denotes the value approximation error in belief
    space and . 3.4. Practical deployment feasibility of the proposed model We discuss
    the time-complexities of above algorithms such as Algorithm 1 has , Algorithm
    2 has . the present LSTM model has the time complexity of . It is difficult to
    frame an exact time-complexity statement for the Algorithm 3 but using the value
    approximation error we can estimate the complexity as mentioned earlier. However,
    in the present scenario, the proposed model is robust and feasible to deploy using
    the help of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and cloud computing. It is worth mentioning
    that MEC is already included in 5G [48] and is a complementary technology that
    can work together to enable new and innovative mobile applications and services.
    By bringing computing resources closer to the edge of the network, MEC can reduce
    network latency and improve the response time of mobile applications, which is
    particularly important for applications that require real-time processing. Furthermore,
    the application of Digital Twins (DT) can be used in the proposed model to enhance
    the performance of CR-VANETs significantly [49]. Together, DT and multi-access
    MEC can help to improve the performance of time-sensitive wireless applications
    by reducing latency and improving the accuracy of data processing. This can help
    to increase the reliability and effectiveness of these applications, leading to
    better outcomes for end-users [50], [51]. 4. Numerical results and analysis The
    simulation results and performance analysis of the proposed method are presented
    in this section. To account for the volatility in the parameters of the wireless
    channels, the results are generated by averaging the results of 10,000 independent
    iterations. The simulation parameters'' values are fixed cautiously and kept almost
    similar to that is used in [20], [21], [22], see Table 3. A few parameters are
    new in our proposed model; we choose their respective values after proper analysis.
    Matlab R2021b and the Anaconda-based Python 3.10 framework are used collectively
    to conduct all the simulations. The computer programs are executed on the X-64
    bit platform using the original version of Windows 11, an Intel 10th-core i7 CPU,
    8 GB of DDR4 RAM, and an NVIDIA 2 GB graphics card (R). Table 3. Simulation parameters

    higher value of , completely converges to value 1. It is worth mentioning that,
    for the simulation purpose, we try to control the PU channel access pattern using
    the Algorithm 4. We employ the proposed techniques in Algorithm 2 to obtain the

    Algorithm 4. PU Channel access pattern generation. Fig. 13 represents the normalized
    reward versus the number of episodes for the proposed Algorithm 2. The standard
    normalization using Eq. (16) is done due to scaling the reward outcomes in the
    range of [0,1] for better graphical visualization. It is noted from Fig. 13 that
    the reward fluctuates randomly between 0 and 1. The reward stabilizes after an
    episode count of 300, although it drops sharply after episode 480. This oscillation
    in reward is a normal phenomenon in the current DRL environment, as the agent
    always tries to explore and exploit the unobserved states with every episode.
    However, we need a stabilized reward with maximum value (if converged, then well
    appreciated) to simulate the environment, and hence, we fix the episode number
    to 350, where the normalized reward value is 1. (16) Download : Download high-res

    sensing from stationary/immobile nodes shows higher accuracy in CSS reliability
    performance. However, the present work investigates the and performance for a
    non-stationary vehicle with a velocity from 2 km/h to 60 km/h, which is moving
    away from PU transmitter. It is noted that with an initial increase in the velocity
    falls slowly (1.e., 2 - 20 km/h), but when crosses 20 km/h, then falls sharply.
    A similar event can also be noted for values. Due to the increase in the velocity,
    the CR vehicle''s PU signal acquisition gets disturbed due to the Doppler effect
    or Doppler shift which impacts overall CSS performance. 95% confidence and prediction
    bands are drawn over the fitted curve on the actual data in Fig. 14 to show the

    and [25]. The value of falls with the decreases in SNR level. This trend in is
    trivial for all the cases as SU cannot acquire much PU signal due to low SNR.
    The presence of high noise in the acquired signal decreases the CSS performance.
    However, the proposed work outperforms the existing works in [5], [20], and [25]
    by , , and , respectively. The present work improves the performance of CSS over
    the work in [5] due to the inclusion of the DRL algorithm in the sensing process,
    which is a more powerful strategy than the clustering technique in [5]. Furthermore,
    the involvement of extra features in the CSS process for the proposed work, like
    the timestamp of PU signal acquisition and GPS of the node (see Fig. 6), provides
    extra information to the agent for more accurate CSS decision, unlike the existing
    works in [20], and [25]. It is worth mentioning that the present work has a completely
    different approach for sensing and channel allocation in CR-VANETs from the existing
    works; hence the comparisons are made only on sensing accuracy and channel allocation
    efficiency (see Fig. 18). Download : Download high-res image (294KB) Download

    technique to select a set of PU channels for minimal SS instead of sensing all
    channels. The proposed work uses 4,000 observations and channel access sequences,
    which are generated using Algorithm 4. The training and testing data split ratio
    is 80:20, respectively. The training loss measures the model''s error on the training
    set. The total errors for each sample in the training set are used to compute
    the training loss computationally. Validation loss, on the other hand, is a statistic
    used to assess the model''s effectiveness. Similar to the training loss, the validation
    loss is determined by adding the errors for each sample in the validation set.
    For a good-fit model, the loss in training and validation must be symmetrical,
    which is exactly observed in Fig. 16. Furthermore, it is also noted that the training
    and validation processes offer a decent score value of ∼0.90. Download : Download

    value against the number of episodes for the proposed Algorithm 3. In the present
    POMDP framework-based spectrum allocation, the DRL algorithm employs an agent
    that periodically learns through its experiences. The reward is meager initially,
    although it increases sharply with increased episodes. In the range (i.e., [250,400])
    number of episodes, the reward value converges and after that degrades or fluctuates.
    This is a trivial nature of any adaptive learning algorithm. To deal with that,
    we require a fixed number of episodes with a steady learning rate. In the present
    work, we fix the number of episodes to 325 for Algorithm 3. Download : Download

    measures the PU collision with SU data transmission over a specific ith channel
    and the total number of times that ith channel is assigned to a SU. This ratio
    value lies between 0 and 1. The lower ratio value indicates minimal data collision
    and the effectiveness of the channel allocation scheme in CR-VANETs. The present

    down the PU collision ratio by , , and , respectively when idle PU channel availability

    SUs in a POMDP environment. The present work finds that including GPS and time
    stamp data and local SS data adds extra advantages for obtaining a reliable CSS
    decision. The impact of the Doppler effect on CSS decisions is also investigated
    for CR-VANETs. Furthermore, the adaptive DRL-based sensing process improves the
    CSS performance over the existing works in [5], [20], and [25] by , , and , respectively.
    LSTM-based selective channel sensing using historical PU channel access patterns
    also helps the CR-VANETs to minimize the sensing overload. Finally, channel allocation
    is made by considering a POMDP framework where the actual state of the channel
    is not observable. The observation and reward functions play an essential role
    in making the agent learn the dynamics of the systems. The proper channel allocation
    reduces hazardous PU data collisions. The present work outperforms the existing
    works in [5], [20], and [25] in terms of lower down the PU collision ratio by
    , , and , respectively. 5.1. Limitations, future scopes, and challenges The present
    work does not include the study of security aspects in CR-VANETs. Furthermore,
    the work does not explore the SU transmission error due to the uncertain reappearance
    of PU over the idle channel. We are currently working on these two aspects as
    our extension of the present work. Apart from that, there are plenty of scopes
    to work on CR-VANETs that need to be addressed to fully realize their potential.
    Here are some existing challenges of CR-VANETs: • Security and privacy: CR-VANETs
    are vulnerable to security threats, including cyber-attacks and unauthorized access
    to the network. As CR-VANETs handle sensitive information such as vehicle locations
    and driver behavior, ensuring security and privacy will be a key challenge in
    the future. • Resource constraints: CR-VANETs are resource-constrained networks,
    meaning that they have limited processing power, memory, and energy. As the complexity
    of the network increases, the demand for resources will also increase. Therefore,
    efficient resource management and allocation will be critical to ensure the smooth
    operation of the network. In the upcoming days, there is a good scope to work
    with digital twins and edge computing to address the aforementioned issues. •
    Interoperability: CR-VANETs will need to be able to communicate with a wide range
    of devices and infrastructure, including other vehicles, roadside units, and traffic
    management systems. Ensuring interoperability between different systems and technologies
    will be crucial to ensure the seamless operation of CR-VANETs. Declaration of

  description: Internet of Things (IoT) devices are widely being used in various smart
    applications and being equipped with cognitive radio (CR) capabilities for dynamic
    spectrum allocation. Our objectives in this work are to achieve higher data rates
    and minimize end-to-end routing delays in CR-enabled IoT communication in order
    to maximize throughput. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based routing
    approach in the cognitive radio network (CRN)-based IoT environment. The idea
    is to add the channel selection decision capability to the network layer in order
    to minimize packet collisions as well as end-to-end delay (EED). We perform a
    comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed RL-IoT routing mechanism
    by simulating the cognitive radio-enabled Internet of Things (CR-IoT) communication
    environment in the cognitive radio cognitive network (CRCN) simulator and comparing
    the network performance achieved by our proposed mechanism with that of the recent
    AODV-based routing mechanism for IoT (AODV-IoT), ELD-CRN, and SpEED-IoT routing
    approaches. Our evaluation results show that the RL-IoT model performs better
    than existing approaches in terms of average data rate, throughput, packet collision,
    and EED.

    I. Introduction With the advances in information and communication technologies,
    the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as one of the key enabling paradigms
    for smart applications in healthcare, smart cities, and smart homes [1]. IoT is
    a network of physical devices having embedded sensors, and software to enable
    device-to-device communication [2]. The continuous evolution of IoT in the fields,
    such as machine learning, embedded systems, wireless networks, sensor networks,
    automation, and others bring forth several concerns related to the Quality-of-Service
    (QoS), security, and privacy. Over 30 billion networked devices are expected by
    the year 2023 as compared to 2 billion devices in year 2008 [3]. While this is
    a remarkable increase, it also poses a critical problem of frequency spectrum
    scarcity. A relatively new but widely recognized and adopted alternative approach
    known as cognitive radio network (CRN) has proved to be helpful in realizing intelligent
    next-generation networks for improved spectrum allocation and utilization for
    the IoT devices [4]. The main idea behind cognitive radio-enabled Internet of
    Things (CR-IoT) devices is to exploit the spectrum holes that are not currently
    in use by the primary devices and dynamically perform spectrum allocation for
    the secondary cognitive IoT devices in order for them to opportunistically avail
    these free holes for their transmission [3], [4]. The dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA) environment for CR-IoT is depicted in Fig. 1 where licensed primary user
    devices called PUDs (e.g., 5G user devices) as well as various unlicensed secondary
    user devices called SUDs (cognitive nodes, e.g., IoT devices equipped with CR
    capabilities) co-exist [5]. PUDs in the CR-IoT environment are authorized to use
    licensed bands and connected with each other through one or more base stations
    forming the primary network. SUDs include the unlicensed IoT devices which follow
    an overlay spectrum sharing model, i.e., using their cognitive abilities, they
    can sense and opportunistically access free channels which are not utilized by
    the PUDs at a given instant of time [6], [7]. In an infrastructure-less secondary
    network, SUDs communicate directly with each other without a central base station
    and employ cooperation schemes to share channel information for spectrum access
    purposes. Fig. 1. DSA environment for CR-IoT. Show All In the environment under
    consideration, the dynamic network topology of the CR-IoT, and frequent changes
    in spectrum availability is the key challenge that affects the connectivity and
    overall transmission rate and throughput of SUDs [2]. An SUD can only utilize
    vacant channels currently not utilized by any PUD for their transmission and always
    respects the priority of PUDs over channel utilization. Whenever a PUD returns
    to its channel to continue its transmissions, the SUD has to pre-empt that channel
    and select another available channel in the spectrum. The channel selection decisions
    involve spectrum sensing and selection, which are made at the MAC layer in the
    current CR-IoT network architecture [8]. Whereas, the routing decisions for the
    SUD’s end-to-end transmission are made in the network layer. Hence, if a channel
    switching event occurs during the transmission of a SUD, then the switching delay
    for the channel selection decision can cause degradation in the SUD’s QoS. While
    higher average data rate and throughput are essential to meet the QoS requirements
    in CR-IoT communication, channel switching events are very frequent in the CR-IoT
    environment due to dynamic spectrum allocation and drastically affect the average
    data rate and throughput in end-to-end routing. In this work, our main contributions
    are listed as follows. We propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based routing
    approach for CR-IoT communications that integrates the channel selection decisions
    with routing decisions in the network layer for improved average data rate and
    throughput. We perform a comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed
    routing mechanism by simulating the CR-IoT communication environment in cognitive
    radio cognitive network (CRCN) simulator and compare the network performance achieved
    by our proposed mechanism with that of the recent AODV-based routing mechanism
    for IoT (AODV-IoT) routing [9], ELD-CRN routing [10], and SpEED-IoT routing [11]
    approaches. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section
    II, we present a review of related approaches. Section III provides our detailed
    approach for RL-based routing for CR-IoT. Section IV provides the performance
    evaluation of our proposed approach in comparison with existing approaches. Section
    V finally concludes this article and provides future work directions. SECTION
    II. Literature Review The use of standard routing protocols in CRNs without taking
    into account the issues inherent in a dynamic spectrum environment may result
    in increased chances of packet loss and decline in data rate and throughput [12].
    As spectrum availability restricts the CRN environment, route maintenance can
    help resolve issues related to best route selection, repeated route-induced delays,
    cross-layer communication/coordination, deafness in control messaging, etc. [13].
    Furthermore, it is important to address the issues inherent in wireless radio
    networks including, radio channel shortages, interference issues, limited battery
    life of devices, device mobility, and issues related to channel characteristics,
    such as the signal-to-noise ratio and error rates [14]. CR-enabled IoT environment
    requires addressing additional challenges as IoT applications typically have higher
    QoS requirements. This requires developing routing protocols for the CR-IoT environment
    addressing issues related to throughput, delay, packet loss, and data rate which
    arise due to device and spectrum mobility, and uncertainty of PUD activity [13],
    [15]. Below we discuss some of the related works on routing approaches in such
    an environment. Zhou et al. [16] proposed the JRCA method for routing and assignment
    of channel with an objective to minimize delay in multichannel multiflow CRNs.
    JRCA relies on delay prediction for transmission and media access for detecting
    channel interference among different PUDs and SUDs. SUD channels are determined
    and changed based on the mobility and appearance patterns of PUDs. JRCA identifies
    routes with minimum delay and performs channel assignment. Mansoor et al. [17]
    proposed the RARE protocol for CRNs for the MAC layer. RARE partitions the network
    into clusters comprising of free common channels to support smooth transitioning
    of devices across channels. RARE considers delay as a routing metric and relies
    on cross-layer information exchange among the network and MAC layer, for selection
    of stable paths while ensuring efficient data delivery from source to destination
    devices. Akter and Mansoor [18] proposed a reactive routing protocol for CR-enabled
    vehicular ad hoc networks. The protocol selects a stable transmission path using
    a Next-Hop Determination Factor that takes into account the dynamic behavior of
    the network, i.e., mobility of the vehicles and changes in spectrum availability.
    The protocol is spectrum-aware in the sense that it also considers the number
    of shared channels and their quality. Kannan and Jeetha [19] proposed the neighbor
    node discovery routing scheme which calculates the various types of delays, such
    as channel switching and MAC layer back-off delays. This research assumes the
    sensing operation at the MAC layer for searching a new available channel and PUD
    activities. It is devised on top of ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing
    protocol-based routing mechanism. Route request (RREQ) and route reply (RREP)
    messages are used without any modifications. In the case of channel switching
    due to unexpected arrival of PUD, it needs to update the routing table by the
    help of MAC layer sensing operation which lemmatize the data rate as per application
    requirement. In another work, Wang et al. [20] used routing metrics, such as channel
    switching delay and the probability of channel availability on the basis of exponential
    distribution of ON/OFF duration to increase data rate and minimize end-to-end
    delay (EED) by fixing the static PUD’s activities. Hence, the probability of channel
    availability is calculated without user interference which can increase packet
    loss due to the unexpected arrival of PUD. Iqbal et al. suggested in [21] a resource
    allocation mechanism for critical links in IoT communication, however the proper
    issue of routing especially for the users with different parameters are not considered.
    Majeed et al. [22] presented an energy-aware deployment for IoT-enabled cellular
    networks. Qureshi and Aldeen [23] highlighted in their survey some new challenges
    for various applications based on IoT communications for future generation networks.
    The authors identified the proper QoS solutions for varying routing parameters
    especially for environments evolving w.r.t. channel and network topology. Learning-based
    approaches have drawn significant attention by researchers to address a variety
    of issues in communication networks [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Mao et al. [24]
    presented a solution for routing in software-defined networks on the basis of
    convolution neural networks (CNNs) for the periodical learning process of network
    experiences. The proposed approach incures high costs in terms of computation
    and storage and hence, not feasible for IoT devices. Another routing solution
    employing multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and real-time Markov
    decision process (RTMDP) is proposed in [29] to control the network congestion
    and network resources for mobile networks. This proposed routing protocol is designed
    for mobile networks in which the participating nodes do not communicate with each
    other. It does not apply to environments with frequently evolving topologies such
    as CRN-based environment due to the retraining requirement of MADRL. In an earlier
    work, Mao et al. [30] discussed the concerns in nonsupervised deep learning-based
    solution for software-defined networks, such as network resource allocation, centralized
    routing, and traffic control on different layers. Yang et al. [31] proposed a
    routing protocol employing global optimization to address QoS issues in CR-enabled
    advanced metering infrastructure networks. Specifically, Yang et al. employed
    the ant colony optimization algorithm for optimal routing. The proposed algorithm
    supports PUD protection while satisfying utility needs of the SUDs. Du et al.
    [25] addressed the EED and power efficiency problems jointly in CRNs by proposing
    a cross-layer routing protocol using quasi-cooperative multiagent learning. In
    CR-IoT routing, the time-varying availability of the channel due to the unexpected
    arrival of PUD, decreases the average data rate due to the increased packet collisions
    and hence, resulted in a decrements in overall throughput during the routing.
    The unexpected arrival of the PUD causes the contention on its channels between
    SUDs in seeking to utilize the available channel. This problem becomes worse when
    one route between two SUDs can be affected by different primary users (PUDs).
    There are some solutions presented to manage the various resources of CR-IoT communication
    as shown in Table I and still there are some issues in which we can use the various
    machine learning techniques for further improvement especially in routing and
    security issues. Hence, the channel selection decisions need to be included in
    the routing parameters to decide the best end-to-end route during the whole transmission
    of IoT communication. These decisions are directly related to the QoS quantitative
    parameters such as packet collision, which must be minimized during the formation
    of the end-to-end routing for CRN-based IoT. Therefore, in the CRN-based IoT the
    routing needs to search the available channels which can be selected for its transmission
    during end-to-end routing to minimize packet collision and maximize the average
    data rate as well as the overall throughput. In the real world, efficient spectrum
    utilization through the use of DSA is very important in formulating the throughput
    of the economic network model especially in the case of IoT communication. Currently,
    by allowing the IEEE 802.22 standard to utilize DSA for cellular networks and
    TV broadcast networks without degrading the QoS for their networks has made it
    challenging to improve the CR-IoT routing performance. Therefore, the RL-based
    routing protocol is very important for better routing decisions to higher the
    average data rate as well as to improve the overall throughput of the CR-IoT network.
    TABLE I Comparison of Related Works Using Learning-Based Methods SECTION III.
    Methodology Fig. 2 shows our proposed RL-based routing approach for CR-IoT devices.
    The proposed approach is built on the existing CR-enabled protocol stack with
    channel selection decision capability added to the network layer for end-to-end
    routing decisions. We employ RL-based approaches to minimize channel switching
    for SUDs (cognitive-enabled IoT devices) caused by unexpected arrival of PUDs.
    Fig. 2. Proposed RL-based routing mechanism for CR-IoT. Show All Essentially,
    our efficient routing approach is supported by including the channel state information
    (channel ID, channel transmission rate, next hop, and all available routes from
    source to destination for each link) in the routing table. The routing table contains
    the multiple paths options from available channels from the entire route. The
    choice of multiple paths and channels is maintained in the routing table. If a
    PUD arrives in its channel, the SUD has to switch from the current channel to
    another free channel based on the prerecorded history of routing choices maintained
    by the learning module. The network layer of each SUD is equipped with a learning
    agent. The learning and decision blocks in the learning agent are the core components
    in our proposed routing mechanism that are responsible for efficiently managing
    the unexpected arrival of a PUD on a channel occupied by the SUD. Essentially,
    the learning block observes the user activities on different channels and maintains
    a history of channel selection in prior routing decisions. The learned knowledge
    is then utilized by the decision block for channel selection decision when a new
    RREQ is received or there is a need to alter an existing route. The decision to
    switch to any available channel or to change an existing route cannot be taken
    just by consulting the regular routing table information which does not include
    any channel history during an SUD’s end-to-end transmission. The QoS parameters
    of a channel, such as error control information, prior channel history, etc. along
    with the traffic type of the application are considered in the channel selection
    decision with an objective to improve the overall QoS in terms of average data
    rate and the throughput of end-to-end transmission. The algorithms of route and
    channel selection in RREQ and RREP during the routing in the network layer is
    shown as Algorithms 1 and 2. We presented a cross-layer approach in which we have
    proposed to incorporate the channel selection as routing parameter at the time
    of routing in the network layer. The proposed routing mechanism is not just offering
    a channel selection using the RL technique rather it is incorporating into routing
    decisions as presented and modified the RREQ and RREP messages in Algorithms 1
    and 2. The channel information should be exchanged through RREQ, RREP, and route
    error (RERR) packets within SUs as well as PUs in the presence of DSA and spectrum
    mobility. The cooperative approach at the MAC layer is used to pass the spectrum-sensing
    information to the network layer to detect PUs’ activities. Moreover, SUs should
    be able to accomplish channel selection from the spectrum mobility provided by
    the CR environment without causing excessive overhead for route formation. One
    advantage of this strategy is the handling of routing loops through the route
    maintenance process for handling PUs’ activities. The route maintenance, due to
    the user mobility and wireless propagation is handled with the traditional RERR
    message. The overall routing flow diagram to elaborate the routing process is
    presented in Fig. 3. Algorithm 1: Route and Channel Selection in RREQ Show All
    Algorithm 2: Route and Channel Selection in RREP Show All Fig. 3. Flow diagram
    covering routing framework for Algorithms 1 and 2. Show All A. Preliminaries and
    Mathematical Notation This section presents the formal modeling to observe the
    effectiveness of RL algorithms for channel selection during routing. We present
    the mathematical model of a noncooperative game which avoids the centralized channel
    management was adopted [33]. The noncooperative game is defined as τ={T,{ S i
    } i∈T } where T is the set of SUDs, and S i ={ s 1 , s 2 ,…, s C } is the set
    of strategies for user i∈T with C vacant channels. The SUDs coexist with PUDs
    over the same network and can access only one single vacant channel from a PUD
    at a time. This work focuses on the channel transmission rate ( R tr ) parameter,
    for the channel selection purpose in the SUD. According to the noncooperative
    game rule, every user i selects the strategy for transmission on the basis of
    a utility function U i  :  S i →T against its opponents S −i . Every user participating
    in this game can select and update its strategy profile at any point of time as:
    S=[ s 1 , s 2 ,…, s T ] but must follow the rule of the game. The strategy profile
    is created for every SUD in the selection of its channel for the transmission
    so that it can be saved in the learning block. The successful strategy of any
    user is selected by searching the Nash equilibrium point (NEP) for its transmission.
    It happens only if the following (1) is satisfied [33]: U i (S)≥ U i ( s a , s
    −a )∀i∈T, s a ∈ S i (1) View Source where s a is the strategy of user i for action
    a and s −a is the strategy of user i according to the action of its opponent.
    Once the strategy (S) of every user (SUD) is chosen based on (1), then no user
    can benefit by changing their strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged.
    As previously mentioned, three RL algorithms are applied for selecting the best
    available channel for transmission such that the packet collision can be minimized
    in case of unexpected arrival of PUDs. These RL algorithms include, No-External
    Regret learning, Q -learning, and Learning Automata. The following sections describe
    these learning algorithms with respect to the channel selection decision. B. No-External
    Regret Learning-Based Channel Selection No-External Regret Learning means when
    the channel selection decision for routing is updated by the exploitation of previous
    channel selection decisions. In this learning technique, every SUD can reserve/save
    the channel availability information for a specific time period and calculate
    future selection of channel using (1) based on past channel utilization [34].
    Regrets are observed in this learning from past channel utilization experiences
    of bad channel selection for routing. Therefore, this technique is used to minimize
    the channel switching regrets and to reduce routing table size for any channel
    selection during routing [34] p i t+1 ( s a )= (1+α ) U i t ( s a ) Σ s a ´ ∈
    S i (1+α) U t i ( s a ´ ) (2) View Source where in (2), U t i ( S a )= ∑ t j=1
    U j i ( S a ) and U t i ( S ′ a )= ∑ t j=1 U j i ( S ′ a ) are used for the complete
    time span of t ; p (t+1) i ( s a )) is used for the probability allocated to strategy
    s a at time period t+1 , while α>0 . Here, α indicates the learning rate and determines
    to what extent the newly acquired information will override the old information.
    In practice, mostly a constant learning rate is used as α=0.1 . In the case of
    the selected channel ID is greater than the available vacant channels, the probability
    of selecting that channel is calculated using (2) and updated the routing table.
    Therefore, it is categorized as exploitation learning through No-External Regret
    Learning. In the case of unavailability of available channels from the existing
    channel list, the exploration learning through Q -learning is used which is discussed
    in the next section. C. Q-Learning-Based Channel Selection Q -learning is a popular
    exploration learning algorithm which is based on the value-iteration model-free
    technique with a computational requirement to empower the SUDs to learn the mapping
    of environment states into actions for the maximum numerical reward. It is mathematically
    assembled as (S,A,T,R) where S denotes a discrete set of environment states; A
    denotes a set of actions; T denotes a state transition function of ON and OFF
    as S→[0,1] ; and R is a reward function S→R . The user get a reward through the
    learning agent from the environment which indicates its state s , and selects
    an action a , for channel selection in case of routing decisions. It changes the
    state of the environment and generating a reinforcement signal once the action
    is performed r . The quality of the decision is dependent on this signal to maintain
    the corresponding Q(s,a) rewards. The Q -rewards/values are updated as follows
    [35]: Q(s,a)=Q(s,a)+α{r(s,a)+γmaxQ( s ´ , a ´ )−Q(s,a)} (3) View Source where
    0<α<1 is the learning rate and 0<γ<1 is the discount rate. The Q(s,a) values are
    estimations of the Q ∗ (s,a) values, which represent the sum of the immediate
    reward obtained by taking action a at state s and the total expected future rewards
    on the basis of its previous success or failure of channel selection. By updating
    Q(s,a) values, the agent eventually makes it converge to the NEP. Secondary users
    (SUDs) maintain a Q -table, and the values of the table are updated using (3)
    based on the actions selected for rewards or punishments [35]. In the current
    study, the action for channel selection is based on the ϵ -greedy exploration.
    This mechanism selects a random action with probability ϵ and the best action
    on the basis of the highest Q -value at the moment with probability 1−ϵ . This
    can be seen as defining a probability vector over the action set of the agent
    for each state. For example, if x={ x 1 , x 2 ,…, x j } is the set of actions
    for one of these vectors, then the probability x i of playing action i is given
    by [36] x i ={ (1−ϵ)+ ϵ No. of actions in Set , ϵ No. of actions in set , if Q
    of i is the highest otherwise. (4) View Source The Q -learning algorithm chooses
    a channel on the basis of ϵ -greedy exploration which has a maximum value of Q
    in the Q -table maintained through Q -learning. Users can start the exploration
    using very a low value of Q and updated after each successful packet transmission
    using (4) [36]. The Q -learning model for the implementation of the multiagent
    is shown below where two agents are composed with two actions each and within
    a single state [36] A=[ a 11 a 21   a 12   a 22 ]B=[ b 11 b 21   b 12   b 22 ]
    View Source where A shows the rewards for the first agent and B shows the rewards
    for the second agent. For this multiagent model, the Q -learning update rule can
    be simplified as follows [36]: Q a i = Q a i +α( r a i − Q a i ) (5) View Source
    where Q a i represents the Q -value of agent a for action i for the reward r a
    i that agent a is receiving for executing action i and α is the learning rate.
    The Q -value for the user s i for an action a is initialized as 0 so that the
    exploration of finding a channel with maximum reward is searched. The average
    reward value is calculated for every channel and the channel reward of every user
    is compared against its opponents as s bj for an action b at time t and t−1 .
    The channel reward is calculated through RL algorithms and compared against its
    opponents through ϵ -greedy exploration so that the selected channel does not
    belong to a same spectrum. The reward value for the action is assigned and updated
    through the Learning Automata which is discussed in the next section. D. Learning
    Automata-Based Channel Selection In this algorithm, users select a channel a∈C
    based on the reward value of an action saved in the learning block. The action
    probability table is updated as in [37] q t+1 (s,a)={ q t (s,a)+αU( s a , s b
    )[1− q t (s,a)], q t (s,a)−αU( s a , s b )[ q t (s,a)], where a=b where a≠b (6)
    View Source where q t+1 (s,a) and q t (s,a) represent action of the user for state
    s at time (t+1) and at time t , respectively, for choosing an action a from the
    available state s using the normalized utility function as follows [37]: U( s
    a , s b )= U( s a , s b ) ma x a∈C E(U( s a , s b )) (7) View Source where s a
    and s b represent the available states of action a and b for two users and max
    a∈C E(U( s a , s b )) indicates the maximum average reward of agent a depending
    on the probability of agent b achieving the action using the learning mechanism.
    E. Convergence Point In this section, the convergence point is proved to achieve
    the balance between all of the learning techniques. The NEP can be defined as
    the function shown in the following [38]: P= ∑ j=1 C ∑ j=1 θ{ C i } U j (θ{ C
    i }) (8) View Source where θ{ C i } denotes the cardinality of channel C i which
    shows the number of SUDs in a channel i∈C . The SUD can make a channel switch
    if (9) works as defined by [37] P= ΔP= = = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ Δ U i [θ{ C i }]= U i [θ{ C j+1
    }]−U[θ{ C k }] if U i [θ{ C j+1 }]>U[θ{ C k }] ∑ i=1 θ{ C j+1 } U i [θ{ C j+1
    }]+ ∑ i=1 θ{ C k+1 } U i [θ{ C k+1 }] − ∑ i=j θ{ C j } U i [θ{ C j }]+ ∑ i=1 θ{
    C k } U i [θ{ C k }] U i [θ{ C j+1 }]−U[θ{ C k }] Δ U i [θ{ C i }]. (9) (10) View
    Source Equation (10) shows that P is an exact potential function. Now, for No-External
    Regret learning, ΔU= 0 happens at the NEP and can be written as follows [37]:
    P={ U t i ( s a )= U (t+1) i ( s a ) U t i ( s ′ a )= U (t+1) i ( s ′ a ). (11)
    View Source Equations (10) and (11) show that, once the network achieves the NEP,
    only then will users have link stability and further channel switching events
    will reduce, in the case of No-External Regret learning, as follows [38]: p (t+1)
    i ( s a )= p (t+2) i ( s a ). (12) View Source Also, for Learning Automata, (6)
    and (11) indicate that after the NEP is achieved, no further channel switching
    happens as [37] q t+1 (s,a)= q t (s,a). (13) View Source Now, for Q -learning
    from (5), the differential equation of Q -values from the Q -table is [37] dQ
    dt ={ Q t+1 (s,a)− Q t (s,a) Δt =α[E(U( s a , s b ))− Q t (s,a)] =α[E(U( s a ,
    s b ))− Q t (s,a)]. (14) View Source The integration of all the Q -values shows
    the differential equation at time t as [37] Q t = K −at e +E[U( s a , s b )] (15)
    View Source where K is integration constant and Q -values at time t→∞ can be written
    as follows [37]: lim x→∞ Q t =E[U( s a , s b )]. (16) View Source Equations (14)–(16)
    show that all three learning algorithms converge at time t for any user i∈T and
    can be written as follows [37]: U t i = U t i ( s a , s b ) p t ( s a )+ ∑ b=a,b≠a
    C U t i ( s b , s a ) p t ( s b ). (17) View Source Hence, all SUDs can converge
    to a pure NEP after the convergence of the learning event. In spectrum mobility,
    multiple SUD pairs can make agreements simultaneously on different channels. SECTION
    IV. Results and Discussion The proposed routing is executed with the help of the
    CRCN simulator, an add-on of the network simulator (NS-2) [39]. We have compared
    the network performance achieved by our proposed RL-based routing for CRN-based
    IoT communications with the recent AODV-IoT [9], ELD-CRN [10], routing, and SpEED-IoT
    routing [11]. SpEED-IoT routing essentially selects a route that ensures the connectivity
    and reachability of IoT devices with data rate optimization of the assigned routes
    in a mesh network-based IoT network. This means that the route encounters the
    one type of users without any effect of PUDs unexpected arrival and, therefore,
    the data rate is optimized on the basis of multichannel routing for device-to-device
    communication in IoT mesh network. The results are compared with the AODV-IoT
    and the ELD-CRN routing protocols which are designed for the CR-IoT environments.
    ELD-CRN is a recent RL-based routing protocol which also addresses energy efficiency
    during the routing process in CRN. Hence, the proposed routing protocol can also
    be compared for the latest energy constrains in future. Moreover, ELD-CRN routing
    conserves the limited battery resources of IoT devices based on CRN and supports
    reliable packet delivery while incurring lower packet transfer latency and being
    energy efficient. This routing mechanism is limited for location-based and operate
    over a single wireless channel using a channel access mechanism that follows the
    IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function. A. Average Data Rate Maximization
    The average data rate achieved from our RL-based routing approach for CRN-IoT
    communications (RL-IoT Routing) is compared for the different network scenarios
    in Figs. 4–6. It is observed that when the numbers of SUDs are low, the average
    data rate for all the routing protocols is also low while, for higher values,
    performance increases reaching almost 90% of delivered packets for the increasing
    standard deviation (sd) of MAR in the RL-IoT routing. The MAR for the activity
    of the PU indicates the availability of PU on the channel for channel utilization,
    channel availability information, channel transmission rate, and channel transmission
    time. The real working of PU on spectrum is not observed due to licensing restrictions.
    Therefore, the PUs are distributed with the fixed allocation on a spectrum in
    a stochastic environment of the CRN within the mean arrival rate of [0, 1]. The
    Poisson process is a very important model in queuing theory which can be used
    when the packets originate from a large population of independent users. It can
    be seen in Fig. 4 that initially the RL-IoT routing has a better average data
    rate compared to the other three routing protocols which have almost the same
    performance at the beginning for 0.0 sd of PUD’s MAR. This is due to the lesser
    number of PUDs at the start of the simulations: as soon as the number of PUDs
    increases, the data rate changes for the AODV-IoT, SpEED-IoT, and ELD-CRN routing
    protocols. At the lowest MAR of PUDs, each SUD is affected by the activity of
    the PUDs and, hence, the user is often isolated due to the unavailability of free
    channels. Therefore, the packets delivered are mainly those sent when most PUDs
    are inactive and those that are directed to destinations very close to the sources.
    On the other hand, when the number of PUDs increases, the routing choices also
    increase and, thus, the RL-IoT routing is able to build routes unaffected by the
    activity of PUDs for most of the flows as shown in Fig. 5. The RL-IoT and ELD-CRN
    routing mechanisms have increased data rates as time elapses. However, the RL-IoT
    routing protocol has a very fast convergence time compared to the ELD-CRN routing
    protocol due to exploitation learning combined with exploration learning. Hence,
    the average data rate is increasing for the 0.4 and 0.8 sd of PUD’s MAR, due to
    the more channel choices for routing as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. On the contrary,
    the other routing protocols are not capable of this technique and due to the increment
    of PUD’s interferences, the average data rate is declining. This enables it to
    improve the average data rate by 69% in comparison with the AODV-IoT routing protocol
    and nearly 39% and 43% in comparison with the ELD-CRN and SpEED-IoT routing protocols,
    respectively. These results are averaged for all the three scenarios of sd of
    MAR as low, medium, and high and applied AWK script which can be applied to process
    the trace file of NS-2 [40]. Fig. 4. Average data rate of SUD at PUD’s sd of MAR
    = 0.0 (user/ms). Show All Fig. 5. Average data rate of SUD at PUD’s sd of MAR
    = 0.4 (user/ms). Show All Fig. 6. Average data rate of SUD at PUD’s sd of MAR
    = 0.8 (user/ms). Show All B. Packet Collision Every channel c ∈ C is configured
    according to the Poisson distribution for the mean arrival rate to monitor the
    activity of PUD. The sd value is calculated on the basis of the Box–Muller transform
    from an interval of mean arrival rate (MAR = [0,1]) for the stochastic environment
    of CR-IoT network. The activity of PUD is predicted using the sd distributed as
    low, medium, and high for the {0.0, 0.4, 0.8}, respectively. Initially, all the
    routing protocols achieve a similar probability of PUD–SUD packet collisions across
    a CRN-based IoT communication (see Fig. 7). There is no activity detected on the
    channel in case of MAR of PUD is 0.0, hence, due to this unavailability of PUD’s
    activity, the graph shows similar trends for all protocols. The effect of PUD
    activity can be observed for the MAR = 0.4 (user/ms) in which the user activity
    has a major role of the channel selection and there is a need to minimizes the
    packet collision between the different types of devices. It can be seen from the
    results presented in Fig. 8. which shows the reduction of packet collisions. This
    reduction in the number of the packet collisions as compared to AODV-IoT routing
    is up to 30%. On the other hand, 19% as compared to the SpEED-IoT routing and
    it is due to the best path selected in it. The proposed routing outperforms in
    reducing the number of packet collision as compare to other routing solutions
    in case of high activity of PUD on a channel. Generally, the RL-IoT routing achieves
    almost better performance in minimizing the packet collision as shown in Figs.
    7–9. Fig. 7. Packet collision between SUDs–PUDs at PUD’s sd of MAR = 0.0 (user/ms).
    Show All Fig. 8. Packet collision between SUDs–PUDs at PUD’s sd of MAR = 0.4 (user/ms).
    Show All Fig. 9. Packet collision between SUDs–PUDs at PUD’s sd of MAR = 0.8 (user/ms).
    Show All C. End-to-End Delay The EED is minimized for the CR-based IoT network
    so that the QoS can be improved for overall network performance. In the start,
    there is a significant increment in EED of the SUD due to the increment in activity
    of the PUD (see Fig. 10). This is because of learning techniques process which
    takes time so that the learning techniques can be reach to the NEP on which the
    channel decisions are maintained. The effect of the availability of the PUD at
    different levels is shown in Figs. 11 and 12) for MAR = 0.4 and 0.8, respectively.
    The proposed routing shows a good performance for increasing activity level as
    compare to other routing solutions. This is because the proposed RL-IoT routing
    selects the routes according to the available channel list at a network layer.
    The EED of the SUD is much minimized for the MAR = 0.8 as compared to the MAR
    = 0.4 (user/ms) because the increment in user activities increases the more routing
    choices of different channels for RL-IoT routing. The proposed routing minimizes
    the EED up to 89% for the MAR = 0.8 (user/ms) as compared to the other routing
    solutions. Fig. 10. EED of SUD for PUD’s sd of MAR = 0.0 (user/ms). Show All Fig.
    11. EED of SUD for PUD’s sd of MAR = 0.4 (user/ms). Show All Fig. 12. EED of SUD
    for PUD’s sd of MAR = 0.8 (user/ms). Show All SECTION V. Conclusion and Future
    Work In this work, we have proposed a novel RL-based routing approach for the
    highly dynamic CR-IoT communication environment. The proposed approach integrates
    channel selection decisions in routing at the network layer to improve average
    data rate and throughput. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed approach
    through simulations by simulating the CR-IoT communication environment in the
    CRCN simulator and comparing the network performance achieved by our proposed
    mechanism with that of the recent AODV-IoT, ELD-CRN, and SpEED-IoT routing approaches.
    A key concern in this spectrum-sharing environment is security and privacy of
    primary as well as secondary IoT users. In future, we intend to address the spectrum
    privacy and security issues through encryption and privacy preservation approaches.

    is rapidly gaining momentum, driven by the ever-evolving industry landscape. Numerous
    startups have embarked on blockchain projects, and investments in this technology
    have surged significantly. Despite blockchain’s ongoing development in terms of
    technological maturity, there is a continuous surge in innovative experimental
    adoption and customization [1]. Blockchain possesses the potential to disrupt
    established innovations and reshape industries or create entirely new ones [1].
    The initial trends in the emergence of cryptocurrencies have already demonstrated
    that blockchain technology is a disruptive force in the banking and financial
    services sectors [2]. Notably, cryptocurrencies have the potential to challenge
    centralized banking systems by eliminating the transaction fees typically associated
    with credit and debit card usage [3]. Recent developments suggest that blockchain
    is transitioning from a disruptive technology to a sustaining one [4]. Its significant
    potential extends well beyond the realm of finance and is poised to have a substantial
    impact on supply chain management, healthcare, the Internet of Things (IoT), education,
    and public services. The commercial feasibility and acceptance of blockchain are
    steadily increasing [3]. The patent landscape further underscores the growing
    influence of blockchain, with more than 3021 patent families associated with blockchain
    applications falling into four sub-categories: payments and transaction systems,
    financial services business, administration, and e-commerce [5]. Blockchain’s
    high level of security is attributed to its extensive use of cryptography and
    decentralization. Concerns about privacy, often associated with public blockchains,
    can be addressed by implementing blockchains in a controlled manner, known as
    permissioned blockchain, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. An overview of the blockchain
    architectures. Blockchain has the capacity to record various types of transactions,
    contracts, data assets, or virtually any information that can be stored digitally
    [6]. Blockchain records possess enduring qualities and are digitally structured,
    transparent, and easily accessible, as shown in Figure 1. Each newly generated
    “block” is appended to the end of an existing “chain,” and the initiation, validation,
    storage, and distribution of each block are governed by a predefined protocol
    [7]. This technology eliminates the necessity for third-party intermediaries,
    as participants within the blockchain network execute complex algorithms to verify
    the integrity of the records within the block. Blockchain presents an intriguing
    alternative to conventional data storage methods [8]. Historically, databases
    have been the primary means of data storage. While databases offer speed and user-friendliness,
    they also come with limitations and challenges, such as the absence of immutability
    [1,9]. Table 1 outlines the key distinctions between blockchain and traditional
    databases. Blockchain databases offer distinct advantages and trade-offs, making
    them suitable for different use cases based on specific requirements for data
    security, transparency, immutability, and decentralization [10]. A blockchain
    system comprises various integral components that collaborate to facilitate business
    transactions and operations [6]. Table 1. Comparison of databases with blockchain
    [1]. Node: A node refers to a computational unit within the blockchain network
    with the capability to initiate, receive, or validate transactions [11]. It operates
    using software applications designed for specific business use cases. Typically,
    blockchains feature two types of nodes. Validator Nodes: These nodes possess enhanced
    capabilities, allowing them to initiate, receive, and validate transactions. Member
    Nodes: Member nodes, on the other hand, are limited to initiating and receiving
    transactions. Transaction: In the context of a blockchain, a transaction is a
    collection of various data items that convey information about the exchange of
    assets, services, entities, events, or anything of value. Block: A block is a
    data structure tasked with storing a collection of transactions. After undergoing
    successful verification, each block is distributed to all the nodes across the
    blockchain network. Block Number: This identifier uniquely identifies blocks within
    the chain of blocks. User Nodes: User nodes are primarily responsible for initiating
    transactions and do not engage in block verification. These components collectively
    form the foundation of a blockchain system, enabling secure, transparent, and
    tamper-resistant transactions and data management. Several well-known consensus
    algorithms are Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (POS), Proof of Activity (POA),
    which combines elements of both POW and POS [12], and Proof of Capacity (POC).
    2. Blockchain-Based CRN Security Technique Blockchain is a basic innovation preoccupied
    via Bitcoin. It is another use of conventional innovation in the web period that
    incorporates conveyed information stockpiling innovation, remote organizations,
    agreement systems, and cryptography [7]. Table 2 A, B represents the block structure
    in a blockchain radio network. As a decentralization public data set, blockchain
    utilizes public keying cryptographical calculations, hashing capacities, agreement
    instruments, and different innovations to fabricate a decentralized non-verification
    framework that could be utilized in internet business to guarantee client data
    security [7,13]. It would additionally advance the course of monetary globalization
    and would enormously affect the current monetary marketing design and, surprisingly,
    social design [5]. Blockchain innovation enjoys the benefits of the lowest exchange
    costs, solid straightforwardness, and the highest securities. Normal issues like
    a significant expense, low effectiveness, and low information stockpiling security
    in the normalized data set give groundbreaking thoughts [13,14]. Blockchain is
    a carefully designed, full history information base stockpiling innovation that
    ordinarily utilizes highlight direct innovation to coordinate every hub. Every
    hub understands the elements of steering, and a new hub distinguishes proof and
    information dispersal via multicast. By utilizing cryptography, it can create
    related information blocks. The created information could look at the legitimacy
    of the data and likewise understand the solid connection via the following information
    [15]. Taking into account the benefits of blockchain innovation, this paper gives
    a psychological remote organization security calculation dependent on blockchains
    [11]. Table 2. (A, B) Block structure in a blockchain radio network summary [1].
    Algo Design Structure Clients speak via the block chain framework in the combination
    place. The particular construction is displayed in Figure 2. The IoT gadget sends
    its hub data to the combination place, and the combination community inquiries
    the blockchain framework for the presence of its hub data. Afterwards, the hub
    sends the information endorsed via the private keying to the combination place,
    and checks when the detecting hub had a relating private keying paired signature.
    Figure 2. Security calculation construction of the intellectual remote organization.
    Assuming is the above, the hub’s solicitation is forwarded to the blockchain framework,
    and the reaction of the blockchain framework is sent back to the detecting hub.
    Some potential research gaps identified in CRN security are in the field of physical
    layer security, machine learning-based attacks and defenses, security in spectrum
    sensing, coexistence with legacy systems, dynamic key management, privacy preservation,
    cross-layer security, resilience against jamming and spoofing, blockchain and
    distributed ledgers, secure localization, and security education and awareness
    [16]. 3. Blockchain Technology Blockchain-Based Secure Spectrum This paper presents
    blockchain innovation and a notoriety system into the range detecting measure.
    Another safe range detecting strategy was proposed. This security detecting strategy
    incorporated the assessment of the client’s immediate standing and suggestion
    notoriety. To stay away from conspiracy assault and malevolent hub conduct, the
    detecting results were more precise. The particular working course of the safety
    range detection dependent on blockchain innovation is displayed in Figure 3. The
    value was determined using Equation (1). 𝑇 𝑖 = 𝑁 𝑖 𝑘 𝜃 𝜔 𝑖 (1) Figure 3. Flow
    chart depicting the security enhancement in CRNs through the blockchain-based
    spectrum sensing algorithm. In Equation (1), Ti addresses the ith detecting period,
    Ni is the quantity of all the detecting periods up to the Ti time frame. The significance
    of k is equivalent to and shows the right number of intuitive detections in the
    history, θ implies the detecting activity force, its worth is determined by ωi,
    which is the impact coefficient of the detecting times in the public record book.
    Its worth is determined by Equations (2) and (3). 𝜃=1− 𝑒 |− 𝑘 𝑚𝑛 | (2) 𝜔 𝑖 = ∑
    𝑛 𝑖=1 | ℎ 1 𝑚 . 𝑙 𝑛 | (3) where h1 is the number of cooperations in l period,
    m is the size of the detecting period in every period, and n is the all-out association
    time frame. It can be seen from the equation that the nearer the cooperation history
    in the public record book, the more prominent the extent, and the effect on the
    trust worth will increment as needed. At the point when the trust worth of the
    hub is not in the front line, with everything being equal, the hub is chosen by
    figuring the extensive trust esteem, and the thorough trust worth of the hub is
    determined by Equation (4). 𝑇 𝑖,𝑐 =∅ 𝑇 𝑖 +𝜑| 𝑇 𝑖 +𝜃 ∑ 𝑖 𝑤 𝑖 | (4) The blockchain
    can contribute to improving CRN security for immutable transaction records, secure
    spectrum allocation, consensus mechanisms, decentralization, secure identity and
    authentication, transparency and trust, and resilience to sybil attacks and data
    integrity. By integrating blockchain technology into CRNs, network operators can
    enhance security, transparency, and trust in spectrum allocation and access. It
    provides a robust foundation for managing spectrum resources and mitigating various
    security threats commonly associated with dynamic and shared spectrum environments
    [17]. The NES algorithm plays a crucial role within the context of dynamic spectrum
    sensing in CRNs. Its primary purpose is to effectively and intelligently evaluate
    and select the nodes that will participate in the spectrum sensing process, ultimately
    improving the overall efficiency and reliability of spectrum utilization [18].
    The NES algorithm aims to address the challenges of dynamic spectrum sensing in
    CRNs, where multiple nodes must collaboratively sense and share information about
    the available spectrum bands. Its core purposes are node evaluation, node selection,
    efficiency enhancement, and reliability improvement. In dynamic spectrum sensing
    scenarios [19], where the availability of spectrum bands can change rapidly, the
    NES algorithm is highly relevant and valuable. The NES algorithm serves as an
    intelligent mechanism for selecting nodes in CRNs, ensuring that spectrum sensing
    is efficient, reliable, and adaptable to the dynamic nature of the spectrum availability.
    It plays a vital role in optimizing resource usage and improving the overall performance
    and trustworthiness of dynamic spectrum sensing in CRNs [20]. Various sectors,
    including satellite services, government agencies, and industries like broadcasting
    and aerospace, also rely on the spectrum [21]. Balancing the needs of these sectors
    with the demand for wireless data can lead to challenges in spectrum allocation.
    The scarcity of available spectrums can limit the ability to conduct experiments,
    trials, and research on new wireless technologies and applications. These trends
    and statistics highlight the pressing need for continued research in spectrum
    management, allocation, and optimization. As technology advances and new applications
    emerge, the urgency to find innovative solutions to address spectrum scarcity
    becomes even more critical. 4. Result Analysis In this section, we conduct a thorough
    analysis of the outcomes derived from the integration of blockchain technology
    within the context of the cognitive radio network. To provide a comprehensive
    understanding of our findings, we reference and elaborate upon the simulation
    parameters, as outlined in Table 3. The simulation area for the network was defined
    as a circular region with a radius of ‘m’. Within this area, primary users were
    positioned at arbitrary locations along the circumference of the circle. In the
    given system, the signal power was 100 MW (megawatts), and the bandwidth was 100
    kHz (kilohertz). There were 15 nodes in the system, with SNRs (signal-to-noise
    ratios) of −18 dB and −14 dB for some of the nodes. The noise used in this system
    was additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The system parameters included an average
    detection time of 10,000 and the presence of three auxiliary nodes. The spectrum
    detection method employed was energy detection. The cognitive radio topology is
    defined in Figure 4. The different number of primary and secondary users was placed
    in a particular geometry. The range of the network was between −500 to 500 m.
    There was one primary user and multiple secondary users. The primary user was
    located at the center of the area while the secondary users were located around
    the primary users within the specific pattern. The total error rate is depicted
    in Figure 5, commencing at 15% within the first second. Figure 5 shows that the
    total error rate progressively rose to 20.05% over a period of 2 s. Subsequently,
    there was a sudden decline, bringing the total error rate down to 10%. Figure
    4. Cognitive radio topology. Figure 5. Total error rate. Table 3. Specific simulation
    parameters. A similar Analysis of Security in Cognitive Radio is displayed in
    Figure 6. It tends to be seen from Figure 6 that when the NES and SSSB calculations
    are utilized in the mix, as expanding the number of associations between the detecting
    hub, combination focus and blockchain the board community, the security file of
    the psychological remote organization rises fundamentally quickly. Figure 7 depicts
    the analysis of the energy consumption in terms of the proposed algorithm vs.
    the NES algorithm. Figure 7 clearly demonstrates that when the number of detection
    cycles exceeded 60, the energy consumption associated with the algorithm presented
    in this study was markedly lower compared to that of the conventional algorithms.
    Increasing the number of detection cycles resulted in longer detection times,
    ultimately leading to greater energy conservation. This significantly benefitted
    the cognitive wireless network by extending its operational lifespan. The reason
    behind this was that the algorithm presented in this paper consistently selected
    the node with the optimal performance for timely participation in cooperative
    detection, thereby saving more energy when the detection performance surpassed
    that of the traditional methods. In comparison to the NES algorithm, the proposed
    algorithm demonstrated superior energy efficiency. The results for the organization
    of traffic are presented in Table 4. Query per second (QPS) assessments offer
    numerous advantages when examining traffic utilization. To illustrate that the
    new algorithm did not increase network overhead, a deliberate organization traffic
    test was conducted. The proposed solution outlined a protocol or algorithm used
    to manage network traffic within a blockchain network. It aimed to maintain optimal
    network performance by routing requests appropriately, monitoring traffic conditions,
    and ensuring timely responses. This test aimed to evaluate the algorithm without
    introducing any variables related to character data in this segment. Figure 6.

    energy consumption: the proposed vs. NES algorithms. Table 4. Network traffic
    test results. Its primary objective was to compare network traffic disparities
    between remote gateways. If the traffic surpassed a certain predefined threshold,
    a specific action was taken, and the query or request was directly routed to the
    blockchain. This approach could be employed to alleviate network congestion or
    ensure that critical queries are handled promptly by the blockchain, bypassing
    any potential bottlenecks in the network. The selection of service nodes was also
    mentioned as a part of this process. Scenarios such as location spoofing, resource
    exhaustion attacks, authentication and key management vulnerabilities, rogue spectrum
    access points, primary user protection attacks, jamming attacks, spectrum sensing
    data falsification and primary user emulation illustrated the potential security
    risks in CRNs, emphasizing the need for robust security mechanisms, such as authentication,
    encryption, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention, to mitigate these threats
    and ensure the safe and reliable operation of CRNs. The basic architecture, as
    discussed above, outlined the key components and processes for integrating blockchain
    into CRNs to enhance security and spectrum access management. By leveraging blockchain
    technology, CRNs can achieve greater transparency, trust, and efficiency in spectrum
    allocation and management while mitigating security risks. It’s essential to customize
    this architecture according to specific CRN use cases and regulatory frameworks.
    Integrating blockchain technology into CRNs can bring several benefits, but it
    also introduces potential overheads and performance trade-offs that network operators
    and architects need to consider. Integrating blockchain into CRNs can significantly
    enhance security and spectrum access management. Blockchain-enabled CRNs can offer
    both advantages and pose challenges in terms of aligning with current spectrum
    regulations and policies. While blockchain-enabled CRNs offer significant potential
    for enhancing spectrum management, there are hurdles to overcome in aligning these
    systems with current spectrum regulations and policies. Collaboration, adaptation,
    and a balanced approach to privacy and transparency are key to successfully integrating
    blockchain technology into the regulatory framework of CRNs. Mitigating security
    vulnerabilities in CRNs requires a multifaceted approach that combines technological,
    operational, and regulatory measures. By implementing practical strategies and
    countermeasures, such as authentication and authorization, spectrum sensing security,
    jamming detection and mitigation, primary user protection, secure spectrum allocation,
    intrusion detection, and response, redundancy and resilience, CRN operators can
    enhance the security and resilience of their networks. 5. Conclusions In real-world
    applications for cognitive wireless networks, it is common to encounter genuine
    errors in data detection through network nodes, leading to deviations from the
    expected range of detection values. Additionally, there are instances where some
    nodes intentionally transmit incorrect data to the central aggregation point.
    In response to these security concerns, this paper presents two key approaches:
    the NES algorithm and the secure spectrum sensing mechanism. The proposed techniques
    incorporate the user’s interaction history and connection distance, which are
    recorded as a public ledger and managed by a blockchain management system. The
    proposed algorithm facilitates the central aggregation point in selecting nodes
    with outstanding performance for cooperative sensing, thus enhancing the network’s
    security against malicious node attacks. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Location: Wuxi, China SECTION I. Introduction Many applications based on Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicle (UAV) appeared in recent years. The UAV communication system can
    efficiently address situations where ground communication is ineffective or in
    emergency rescue scenarios where human resources are unable to reach the location.
    Because of that, researches on UAV communication system have gained popularity
    in the field of radio communications. The wireless spectrum is a key source for
    wireless communication. Nevertheless, due to advancements in communication systems
    such as 5G, the spectrum has become increasingly scarce. Each ground-based system
    requires its dedicated band-width to ensure a high quality of service. In contrast,
    UAV s lack a specific spectrum allocation due to the limited avail-ability of
    radio spectrum. Thus, they have to borrow spectrum to finish their work from primary
    users on the ground. Typically, in a Cognitive Radio Network, a primary user with
    available spectrum can allow secondary users (such as UAVs) to utilize a portion
    of that spectrum in exchange for payment. In the case of UAVs, they can purchase
    spectrum from a Base Station (BS). However, it is crucial to consider the impact
    on the primary user''s communication efficiency if the UAV occupies a significant
    amount of spectrum or employs high transmitting power. Therefore, careful consideration
    should be given to the allocated bandwidth. Additionally, determining the appropriate
    pricing is essential to maximize profits for both UAV operators and primary users
    in the transaction. In past years'' works, researchers introduced lots of methods
    to predict spectrum in cognitive radio systems, like using the Hidden Markov Model
    (HMM). Many papers did the simulation and said it is an effective method to predict
    spectrum [1] [2]. However, HMM method is for stationary situations, UAV system
    is a non-stationary system. It is not proper to introduce HMM into the UAV system.
    In paper [3], Y. Zhao and his team members improved HMM method and they proposed
    a new algorithm named SNS-HMM based on the knowledge of the location of UAVs.
    Besides, there are also some papers proposed how to use neural network model to
    do spectrum prediction [4] [5], and how to use machine learning in paper [6].
    As for using Stackelberg game theory to do spectrum management, the concentration
    was always on how to allocate the transmitting power but not focus directly on
    bandwidth [7]. Paper [8] talks about Stackelberg game theory implemented in spectrum
    portioning but it is focusing on device-to-device (D2D) rather than based on base
    station. T. Fang and her team combine the Stackelberg game and UAV communication
    system together and proposed the algorithm of channel allocation. Although they
    use D2D, they make the system multilayers. Nevertheless, they still fixed the
    benefit function related to transmitting power [9]. In this paper, a novel algorithm
    will be introduced to address the pricing and spectrum allocation for UAVs using
    a Stackelberg game framework. Unlike previous approaches, this algorithm directly
    focuses on spectrum allocation rather than transmitting power. Additionally, we
    consider the interference between UAVs and BS, with the objective of maximizing
    the profits of both UAVs and the BS. SECTION II. Model of UAV Communication System
    A. Spectrum Sharing Model For a UAV communication system, usually, one BS on the
    ground can provide connections with one or lots of UAVs [10] and share spectrum
    with them as Fig. 1 shows. Considering the total amount of spectrum the BS could
    provide is Q and there is a threshold in case of emergency named Q th . The number
    of UAVs which have corresponding missions is M and the bandwidth each UAV need
    is represented by B i where i=1,2,3⋯M . The total amount of needed bandwidth must
    follow the constraint in Eq. 1 to make sure the system could work. ∑ i=1 M B i
    ≤Q− Q th (1) View Source It means the BS will reserve Q th bandwidth in case of
    emergency. Then the total allocated bandwidth borrowed by UAVs could not exceed
    the remainder spectrum that the BS could provide. B. Cost Model of the BS When
    the whole UAVs in the system are working, there must be some disturbance between
    each machine and the BS (the dotted lines in Fig. 1) [11]. The disturbance caused
    by each UAV has co-relationships with the bandwidth it occupies. Let D i represent
    the spectrum unit price where i=1,2,3⋯M . We regard the disturbance as the cost
    of the BS. To borrow B i spectrum, the cost function can be expressed as Cost
    i = D i × B i (2) View Source From Eq. 2 we can see, the wider the bandwidth borrowed
    by the i th UAV, the more cost will be caused to the BS. The influence of all
    UAVs on BS is assembling the total cost. Cost tota1 = ∑ i=1 M Cost i (3) View
    Source Fig. 1. The UAVs communication scenario. Show All SECTION III. Spectrum
    Allocation Algorithm Based on Stackelberg Game A. Stackelberg Game In the realm
    of UAV communication systems, the trans-action between the BS and the UAVs can
    be analogized to a business market transaction, where the duration of UAV payment
    and BS rent can be regarded as a trade. Since the BS has greater power and control
    over the available spectrum, it is considered the leader, while the UAVs, with
    limited or no access to the spectrum, are deemed the weaker followers. As a result,
    the BS, functioning as the leader, will make its pricing choice first, and the
    UAVs, as followers, will decide how to proceed with the trade based on the leader''s
    decision. The leader can then make changes to its pricing strategy to maximize
    its profits, prompting the followers to adapt their behavior accordingly[12].
    This cyclical process continues until the leader and followers reach Nash equilibrium,
    where neither side can improve its position by unilaterally changing its strategy.
    By utilizing the Stackelberg game model, the BS and UAVs can achieve optimal pricing
    and resource allocation strategies, resulting in maximum profits[13] [14]. B.
    Stackelberg Game in UAV Communication System To obtain the optimal pricing and
    bandwidth allocation plan, it is necessary to consider the benefit functions of
    both UAVs'' and BSs. Before discussing the benefit function, suppose the price
    each UAV should pay for each bandwidth is p i (i=1,2,3…M) . 1) UAV''s Profit Function
    To appreciate the advantages of UAVs, it suffices to focus on a single one as
    each UAV is subject to identical game-theoretic interactions akin to the i th
    UAV depicted in Fig. 1. For the i th UAV, the cost function is decided by the
    unit selling price p i and the spectrum B i it plans to borrow. The money it has
    to pay is pay= p i × B i (4) View Source Suppose the coin it can earn by finishing
    its mission is related to its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). earned coin= C i −
    C th i − − − − − − − √ (5) View Source where C 2 is the bit rate of communication
    link, and C th i is the threshold of transforming rate. Usually, a UAV undertakes
    some communication missions, the faster data could be trans-formed, the more missions
    could be completed thus more benefits will be earned. To achieve higher communication
    speed, it is easy at the first time, however, it is impossible to improve the
    data rate unlimited. So, with the increment of C , the profit will increase firstly
    fast and then goes slowly. Thus, it is proper to use the supposed formula in Eq.
    5 to represent the earned coin. The profit function is the earned money minus
    the money it needs to pay. Combining Eq. 4 and Eq. 5, the benefit function of
    the i th UAV could be rewritten as U uav i ( p i ,  B i ,  C i ( B i ))= C i −
    C th i − − − − − − − √ − p i × B i (6) View Source According to Shannon''s Theory,
    the relationship between the data rate and the bandwidth is C i = B i × log 2
    (1+ γ i ) (7) View Source where γ i is SNR of the communication channel between
    the i th UAV and the user device. γ i = P i h i ∑ j≠i P j h j + σ 2 i (8) View
    Source where P i is the transmitting power from the i th UAV to the user device
    and σ 2 i is the noise power in the i th channel. h i = a i d i is the disturb
    parameter for the channel while a i captures path loss and d 2 conforms Gaussian
    distribution, i.e., d i N(0, D i ) . 2) BS''s Profit Function BS generates revenue
    by selling spectrum. If there are M UAVs purchasing spectrum from the BS, the
    total revenue earned can be calculated as follows: ∑ i=1 M p i × B i (9) View
    Source However, interferences generated by the UAVs can have an impact on the
    profit. The benefit function of BS is formulated by subtracting the reduction
    caused by interference from its earned revenue. Let the profit function of the
    BS be formulated as U bs ( p i ,  B i )= ∑ i=1 M p i × B i − ∑ i=1 M D i × B i
    (10) View Source In this equation, we think the parameter of reduction is 1, and
    total reduction is combining all the disturb by UAVs. 3) Solutions To Achieve
    Nash Equilibrium We define the Nash equilibrium point as ( p ∗ i ,  B ∗ i ) .
    The BS and the UAVs achieve the optimal benefit at the Nash equilibrium point.
    It means that U bs ( p ∗ i ,  B ∗ i )≥ U bs ( p i ,  B i ) U uav i ( p ∗ i ,  B
    ∗ i ,  C i ( B ∗ i ))≥ U uav i ( p i ,  B i ,  C i ( B i )) (11) View Source Do
    derivation to Eq. 6, then we have d U uavi d B i = 1 2 ( C i − C th i ) − − −
    − − − − − − √ × d C i d B i − p i (12) View Source From the relationship between
    the data rate and the band-width in Eq. 7, we can figure out that d C i d B i
    = log 2 (1+ γ i ) (13) View Source let d( U u av) d ( B i ) =0 , then we have
    p i = 1 2 ( C i − C th i ) − − − − − − − − − √ × d C i d B i (14) View Source
    Thus, if we have an input matrix B=[ B 1  B 2  ⋯  B M ] View Source The setting
    price could be calculated by corresponding P=[ p 1  p 2 …  p M ] View Source Thus
    U uav =[ U uav1  U uav2 …  U uavM ] View Source and U bs could be computed easily.
    4) Algorithm To Get Most Suitable Price and Spectrum Allocation Scheme Before
    introducing the algorithm, it is necessary to figure out how the U b s changes
    with B . Substituting Eq. 7 and Eq. 13 to Eq. 14, we have p i = 1 2 1 B i log
    2 (1+ γ i )− C th i − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ × log 2 (1+ γ i ) (15) View
    Source To reap the benefits of a single UAV, we derived it with Eq. 10 p i × B

    if B i increases, x will decrease then y will increase, which means the denominator
    will increase. For p i × B i , it will decrease with the increment of B i . As
    shown in Eq. 10, with the increasing of B i , U bs will decrease. 5) The Algorithm
    for The Benefit Function of Uavs in Communication Missions Firstly, pre-setting
    an example allocation scheme B. do the derivation and calculate the corresponding
    F . This F makes sure the benefit function of UAV gets Nash equilibrium. Then
    we try to verify the benefit function of BS . Using B and F to compute U b 5 and
    save it as U bs1 . After doing that, increasing B , get another P and U bs2 .
    Compare the first and second U b∘σ . Since U b − σ exhibits a monotonic decrease,
    if the initial sample of B is deemed the most suitable, we expect U bs2 to be
    smaller than U b S 1 . In the event that U bs2 fails to meet this condition, it
    signifies that the sample is incorrect, necessitating an increase in the value
    of B and subsequent iterations until the correct solution is identified. The specific
    flow chart is shown below: Fig. 2. The specitrum allocation workflow. Show All
    SECTION IV. Numerical Results It is common for a single BS to provide a bandwidth
    of 20M H z for a single connection. In the scenario where one BS is linked to
    four UAVs, the maximum bandwidth that the BS can allocate is limited to Q=10MHz
    , while the remaining 10M H z is reserved for emergency use in the ground communication
    system. Additionally, the spectrum threshold ( Q th ) is typically set at a small
    value, specifically 0.03M H z. In the UAV communication system, each UAV typically
    requires 1.4M H z of bandwidth for data exchange. Thus, in this simulation, we
    assume a minimum bandwidth requirement of 1.4M H z for each UAV to ensure the
    practical implementation of the system ( B min =1.4MHz) . The other parameters
    are set according to the specifications outlined in Table I. Table I Parameters
    setting Table II Data rate results for four UAVs Fig. 3. Allocated bandwidth for
    different UAVs. Show All After conducting the rent-borrow iterations between the
    Base Station (BS) and the UAVs, the results of bandwidth allocation are presented
    in Figure 3. It is evident from Figure 3 that, after thirteen iterations, the
    bandwidth allocation remains unchanged. The optimal bandwidth allocation for each
    UAV is as follows: 1. 64MHz, 1.88MHz, 2.12MHz, and 2. 36MHz. Collectively, the
    total allocated bandwidth for the four UAVs amounts to 8M Hz, satisfying the condition
    stated in Eq. 1, which requires the total borrowed bandwidth to be less than 9.97MHz(Q−
    Q th =9.97MHz) . Then we calculate every UAV''s bit rate and compare them with
    C th i , the results are shown in Table II. From Table II, it is clear to see
    that every channel''s data rate is over the threshold, so the communication speed
    could be ensured. Table III Profit results for uavs and bs Table IV Each bandwidth
    for x legend in Fig. 4 In this situation, the price for each UAV, the profit for
    each UAV and the profit BS made are shown in Table III. According to Stackelberg
    game theory, once the Nash equilibrium is achieved, no matter how to change the
    allocated bandwidth, the profit will never increase anymore. As shown in Table
    IV, scheme 1 is the result we got by using the algorithm. If we change the allocated
    bandwidth for each UAV randomly, as schemes 2 to 4 show, the profit of UAVs and
    BS are worse than that of our proposed scheme. SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper,
    we propose a method based on Stackelberg game theory to assist in making spectrum
    allocation decisions in UAV communication systems. The algorithm is based on allocation
    methods rather than transmission power control, ensuring maximum profit for both
    UAVs and base stations. We formulated a UAV-assisted communication model, consid-ering
    UAV-related costs and introduced a strategic bandwidth allocation model using
    Stackelberg game theory. Analysis of interactions between the base station and
    UAVs led to optimal bandwidth trading strategies. Simulations verify that the
    proposed game''s equilibrium optimally maximizes utility for all entities, maintaining
    communication efficacy. Fig. 4. Changes in profit with the increase of bandwidth.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Cognitive
    radio independently manages radio spectrum utilization. The radio spectrum might
    be utilized while it is not being utilized by the existing radio framework. Such
    unused radio frequencies are known as spectrum opportunity (or) blank area. Joseph
    Mitola III and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr. formally settled with the possibility of
    Cognitive Radio (CR) in 1999. As indicated by Mitola, CR is the new way to deal
    with remote network connection when Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and the
    connected networks are computationally complex. Here, a smart device is proposed
    by considering its environmental factors. Here, the essential goals considered
    are (i) dependable correspondences and (ii) effective utilization of accessible
    assets. These targets are accomplished by checking and changing the inner states
    due to the change in considering the radio frequencies. The objective of a Software
    Defined Radio (SDR) network is establishing a remote “black box”, whose correspondence
    could be altered by considering the requests of the associated devices and the
    accessible data transfer capacity. Figure 1: Block diagram contrasting SDR Show
    All The use of various insights to quickly move to unoccupied channels while bypassing
    congested channels is critical to the advances in cognitive radio. This augments
    the radio frequency spectrum with minimal measure of obstruction among different
    clients. Optional radio frameworks have a huge test for deciding whether they
    are working inside a spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR) comes in two types: spectrum-detecting
    cognitive radio and full cognitive radio. Full CR considers each conceivable boundary
    that might be considered by a remote hub or organization, considering total boundary
    conditions of the remote hub or organization. Spectrum detection in cognitive
    radio considers the channels of the radio frequency spectrum. The power control
    technique ensures trustworthy correspondence between cognitive radio terminals
    and essential clients. The cognitive radio has two key qualities that may be outlined:
    Cognitive ability: Information might be accumulated or seen from the radio spectrum
    on the account of radio innovation. Reconfigurability: Cognitive ability empowers
    the observing of the radio spectrum, and this feature permits the radios to be
    customized to the particular working circumstances. SECTION II. Literature Review
    Jianqing Liu et al. (2016) recommended a novel method to solve unlicensed users''
    energy problems. When allocating spectrum to unlicensed users, the licensed user''s
    channel capacity, channel status information, traffic load, and transmission requirements
    are considered. The proposed strategy increases the unlicensed users'' energy
    efficiency more than the currently used cooperative solutions. Nie Nie et al.
    (2007) employed a game theory technique to enhance the cognitive radio network''s
    performance. The system makes certain nodes to cooperate in order to minimize
    the energy usage. The maximum power transmission was not constrained by any transmission
    power usage in the first technique. Another approach uses an iterative algorithm
    to allocate power and scheduling spectrum, which results in power and channel
    scheduling for all unlicensed users. According to the simulation results, autonomous
    channel and power allocation have increased the system performance. Fang Ye et
    al. (2011) examined the interference restriction in the CR network using a genetic
    approach to perform resource allocation. This author suggests allocating enhanced
    genetic resources. The two sets employed in this approach are the realistic spectrum
    allocation policy and the randomly updated spectrum allocation policy. The limited
    freely available module that is employed after updating the population causes
    computational complexity, which is reduced by this approach. Results from virtual
    experiences uncover that the proposed strategy is more productive than both the
    norm and quantum hereditary ways to deal with spectrum allocation. Deepak Joshi
    et al. (2012) Researchers have recently studied the challenges in cognitive radio
    networks that use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The simulation
    results show an enhanced outcome. Huahui Wang et al. (2010) In CR network, power
    and channel assignments were considered. There are various bands that make up
    the whole electromagnetic spectrum, wherein each band contains a number of channels.
    The proposed system optimizes the total rate for all CR users and ensures balanced
    traffic spectrum allocation. To increase the sum rate, a stable water filling
    technique has been devised. The simulation results demonstrate the improved outcome.
    Wei Wang et al. (2011) proposed a framework for performing a combined spectrum
    allocation and power regulation to make use of the 43 licensed portions of the
    electromagnetic spectrum that are not being used after considering the temperature
    limit and opportunistic spectrum allocation. To achieve the highest throughput
    in a single flow network, a power assignment mechanism is developed based on time
    division multiplexing model. The system must decide how to distribute the available
    spectrum in a cooperative way. The simulation results demonstrate how the author
    achieves effective spectrum utilization with this suggested approach. SECTION
    III. Proposed Method Cognitive radio was first introduced in a conventional setting
    by Joseph Mitola at a gathering held by the Illustrious Establishment of Innovation
    in Stockholm in 1998; he and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr. further on the point in an
    article distributed in 1999. The expression “cognitive radio” is utilized to allude
    to a framework that can recognize and decipher its current circumstance, adjusting
    its radio''s functional boundaries continuously founded on its perceptions of
    its general surroundings. In CR, remote senders and receivers intelligently determine
    which channels are busy and which are not, and switch to the free channel. ➢ Spectrum
    Sensing One of the goals of spectrum sensing/detection, especially obstacle detection,
    is to obtain the spectrum state (empty/occupied) with the goal that the SU can
    reach the spectrum under the impedance pressure. Here, the challenge is in sorting
    out how much disturbance the essential SU signals are delivering at the end. ➢
    Spectrum Decision A selection model is required to perform spectrum allocation.
    The level of refinement of this model is interpreted by enabling the considerations
    used to examine the spectrum. The decision model turns out to be more complex
    when SU has a large number of goals. At the point when there are a few essential
    and optional clients, choices on spectrum access will be impacted by client preferences.
    Users'' access to the spectrum might be cooperative or uncooperative. Each user
    in a non-cooperative environment serves their own purpose, but all users in a
    cooperative environment may cooperate to accomplish a single objective. For instance,
    numerous SUs could compete with one another to access the radio spectrum in order
    to optimize each one''s throughput. ➢ Spectrum Analysis or Sharing The detected
    spectral findings are analyzed to determine spectral quality. The problem here
    is how to assess the type of spectrum. This component might be considered by utilizing
    various measurements, including Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). ➢ Spectrum Mobility
    or Handoff Spectrum Versatility hints at interactions that allow CR clients to
    switch between work iterations. By allowing wireless terminals to operate in the
    most ideal repeat range, CR networks accommodate dynamic frequency usage to meet
    simple communication requirements when transitioning to higher repeat ranges.
    SECTION IV. Results and Discussion Spectrum blockage is a consequence of the quick
    development of remote administrations in the recent years for increasing the interchanges
    among clients. Researchers are more concerned on solving the challenges in static
    spectrum allocation based on the current remote network conditions. This might
    prompt wasteful utilization of the spectrum and the subsequent blank areas. Blocked
    radio frequencies might stay away from the utilization of Dynamic Spectrum Access
    (DSA) by CR network. ➢ Spectrum Access using Auctions Barters reason that purchasers
    and dealers might cooperate to trade labor products. In CR networks, barters are
    principally used to push SUs towards more productive spectrum utilization. Many
    groups are typically engaged with bartering. The following auction types are mentioned
    and are often included in auctions. First-Price Sealed-Bid auction (FPSB): Costs
    are borne by whoever wins the bartering. Contingent upon how much different offers
    exist. Profit and winning percentages are traded off in a game of chance. Second-price
    sealed-bid auction (Vickrey): Highest lost offer will be paid by the winner. Bidding
    one''s value is the best course of action in this type of auction. English auction
    (Open Ascending-bid auctions): The barter starts with a least price offered. Offers
    are raised until no other person will outbid them. Offering up to the worth and
    holding out until the cost in outbid is the ideal methodology in an English closeout.
    Dutch auction (Open Descending-bid auctions): Prices will progressively reduce
    after starting off at a relatively high value, according to the auctioneer. The
    most noteworthy bidder is the one whose bid is acknowledged first. The employment
    of the Dutch auction at Holland''s flower marketplaces is how it got its name.
    Figure 2: Organigram showing types of auctions Show All Not at all like conventional
    sell-offs, twofold closeouts permit bidders and venders to execute on a similar
    thing simultaneously. Since in sell off based frameworks each channel is given
    to a solitary organization, the idea of PU and SU in a similar channel doesn''t
    exist. The controller awards channels to discharge and the discharge deliberately
    share the unused channels with SUs. The regulator assigns the privilege of becoming
    the channel''s PU or SU. ➢ Spectrum Access using Multi Agent Systems Distributed
    Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is predicated on changing from individual to aggregate
    conduct with an end goal to overcome the challenges while managing complex circumstances
    requiring the enormous number of substances. Table 1: Agent-CR comparison ➢ Spectrum
    Access using Game Theory A mathematical framework called “game theory” may be
    used to evaluate the iterative options and behaviors of people, who are concerned
    with their personal gain. Cooperative games and competitive games are the two
    main gaming categories. All players in a alliance game will have more consideration
    about the progress of the group all in all than they do for their own benefit.
    In cutthroat games, players are persuaded to a great extent for monetary profit
    by prompting forcefully individualistic navigation. The sign of the game-hypothetical
    strategy is the idea of Nash Equilibrium (NE). Each player in NE is accepted to
    realize every other person''s harmony procedure, and none can advance their situation
    by changing their own balance methodology. Another crucial idea in game theory
    is Pareto efficiency. If it is impossible to change a condition such that at least
    one person benefits without harming anybody else, it is said to be Pareto efficient.
    Anyone may discover both pure and blended tactics in any game. A mixed strategy,
    on the other hand, combines several different techniques with associated probability.
    An activity and the unadulterated technique that utilizes only that activity are
    both addressed by every cell in the award network. Using a mixed approach, the
    possible actions are randomly chosen using a probability distribution. Let ai
    be any action of Ai and Ai = “all possible actions of agent i”. Si(aj) is equal
    to the probability that action aj is taken when mixed strategy si is used. A pure
    strategy is a special case of a mixed strategy where only one action acts as support.
    The probability of each action in a fully mixed approach is greater than 0. For
    example, support (si) =Ai. A Possible Nash Equilibrium in Game Mixed Approaches
    without Real Strategy. Reenactment results show that the proposed strategy further
    develops execution over the non-helpful standard. It has been shown that the normal
    price per SU per aperture for useful and unhelpful spectral acquisition and access
    decreases as single-channel acquisition time increases and access time is forced.
    In this figure, we can see that the proposed technique of capturing and accessing
    shared spectrum using alliance formation outperforms the unacceptable situation
    in all the measurements considered. This advantage diminishes with = 0.5, or when
    a big part of the space is utilized for detecting a solitary channel, however
    it doesn''t go under an improvement of 54.7% over the non-helpful technique. Figure
    3: When there are N = 10 SUs and K = 14 channels in a network, the average reward
    per SU per slot shifts depending on how much time is needed to perceive a single
    channel. Show All A few less popular issues that emerge when gatherings have disparate
    objectives might be better perceived with the assistance of game hypothesis. It
    offers a worldview for looking at the issue of SU spectrum access in cognitive
    radio organizations with the dependence of specialists in comparative circumstances.
    Because of the difficulty of expecting that players know their own and other players''
    settlements and the trouble of tackling games containing blended strategies when
    there is a major result network, game hypothesis can''t be used to assess every
    single serious concern. ➢ Spectrum Access using Multi Agent Systems An agent is
    a piece of software that can achieve a specific task in an autonomous way (for
    the sake of the user or the application). To run the reenactment, two different
    fixed upsides of time (T 1 and T2), with T1 being what is going on and T2 addressing
    a lengthier time span. T1 permits SU specialists to demand some spectrum inside
    a period imperative of T1 Minutes; this breaking point, as well, is inside a period
    limitation of T1 Minutes. When should be visible in Table 3, in any event, when
    the quantity of specialists develops, the typical number of messages(per specialist)
    remains moderately consistent at around 4. At the point when the time limitation
    is T2, the strategy''s presentation drops far underneath 80%, yet it actually
    stays stable. Table 2: T1 and T2 message success and number SECTION V. Conclusion
    The findings demonstrate that by adding collaboration between main and secondary
    user devices, the suggested solution can accommodate the high spectrum sharing
    needs. Even with several agents, the success percentage for spectrum allocation
    is close to 80%. This research study has covered many techniques for performing
    dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks, where the network''s capability
    is not streamlined due to client behavior, which is frequently used in this field
    because it can satisfy the clients to consider powerful spectrum. This study has
    also demonstrated various research analysis process that utilized Markov models
    to represent the dynamic nature of SUs; thereby improving the outcome when compared
    to the previously discussed procedures. Finally, this study focused on how multi
    -specialist frameworks could be used for performing Distributed Spectrum Allocation
    (DSA). In contrast to game theory, the proposed approach has only been limitedly
    used to address the issue of spectrum allocation. The MAS in the CR is used in
    a variety of ways; some provide interaction exclusively among SUs, while others
    coordinate to establish dynamic spectrum access. SECTION VI. Future Scope In future,
    a higher level of quality will be guaranteed for CR portable terminals and work
    on the dependability of remote network connections by integrating multi-specialist
    frameworks. These frameworks interchange to assist CR portable terminals in selecting
    the best spectrum band for satisfying their requirements (Spectrum Portability).

  description: Cognitive radio is a successful technique for utilizing the unused
    and under-used spectrum, and dynamic spectrum access is one of the major facilitators
    in making this happen. When a secondary user (an unlicensed user) interferes with
    the licensed user, the idea of using unused or under-utilized spectrum offers
    a challenge. Therefore, effective spectrum sensing is necessary to ensure the
    primary user’s protection and the successful transmission of data by the secondary
    user. An Optimal Incentive algorithm is suggested to meet this need. It effectively
    uses the available idle channel based on the joint optimization of sensing time
    and transmission time without interfering with the primary user. The proposed
    work also contributes to a significant increase in energy efficiency with minimal
    interference. Simulation results show an increase in efficiency when compared
    with the algorithms, namely, exhaustive search and sub-optimal algorithms.

    Formulae display:? Abstract Cognitive radio is a successful technique for utilizing
    the unused and under-used spectrum, and dynamic spectrum access is one of the
    major facilitators in making this happen. When a secondary user (an unlicensed
    user) interferes with the licensed user, the idea of using unused or under-utilized
    spectrum offers a challenge. Therefore, effective spectrum sensing is necessary
    to ensure the primary user’s protection and the successful transmission of data
    by the secondary user. An Optimal Incentive algorithm is suggested to meet this
    need. It effectively uses the available idle channel based on the joint optimization
    of sensing time and transmission time without interfering with the primary user.
    The proposed work also contributes to a significant increase in energy efficiency
    with minimal interference. Simulation results show an increase in efficiency when
    compared with the algorithms, namely, exhaustive search and sub-optimal algorithms.
    KEYWORDS: Cognitive radiooptimal incentive algorithmenergy efficiency 1. Introduction
    Spectrum being a valuable resource there is a need to utilize that properly. But
    in most cases, it is evident that a lot of spectrum holes are available. To avail
    these spectrum holes FCC proposes the concept of cognitive radio (CR) coined by
    Joseph Mitola. Cognitive radio deals with the primary and secondary users, giving
    foremost importance to the primary users because they are licensed users. Researchers
    have come up with different concepts for detecting whether the spectrum is occupied
    or not. Most of the work is concentrated on increasing the detection rate but
    it increases the sensing time. If the sensing time is more, then the possibility
    of successful transmission by the secondary users will be small. To enhance throughput
    the need for more transmission time also increases. Increasing the transmission
    time will surely cause interference to the primary user. To keep interference
    within the limit the concept of dynamic spectrum allocation is used. Also, the
    spectrum requirement varies for each and every secondary user available in the
    network hence to maximize the throughput the SU has to sense the appropriate channel.
    This can be done by a cooperative spectrum sensing process. The process of sensing
    and transmission imposes challenges in formulating different optimization schemes.
    Thus several researchers have taken fixed sensing periods to design the transmission
    period accordingly. In some of the works sensing time and reporting time are taken
    into account to keep the success rate maximum. In practice, the SUs don’t have
    the same spectral need. By fixing sensing time there are more changes of increased
    probability of false alarm. In the literature, works have been done to increase
    the detection probability and also throughput maximization is attained. If interference
    trade-off is considered then there is a need for a minimum transmission period
    which turns out to be unaccountable. To overcome this issue, incentive-based optimization
    of sensing and transmission time is proposed. When the SU correctly predicts channel
    availability then the incentive will be given as one ensuring it doesn’t introduce
    any interference with the primary user and accordingly the optimized values of
    sensing and transmission time will be calculated which, in turn, results in energy
    efficiency maximization. 2. Related work Cognitive radio makes use of opportunistic
    spectrum sensing which allows the utilization of underused and unused spectrum
    in an efficient way [ 1, 2]. To ensure proper sensing, cooperative spectrum sensing
    is beneficial, at the same time it is important to pay attention to the overheads
    associated with it [ 3]. Enhancing energy efficiency under different power capacity
    has been studied and numerical results show the impact of transmission power,
    sensing time and transmission time in improving energy efficiency [ 4]. Researchers
    have been working on the joint optimization of transmission and sensing time by
    fixing the probability of detection, probability of false alarm and threshold
    [ 5–7]. To achieve maximum efficiency, joint optimization of different parameters,
    namely, sensing time, transmission time and transmit power are considered in the
    literature [ 8–10] and [ 11]. The primary user protection should not be affected
    by the secondary user data transmission, hence minimum tolerable interference
    is also needed. While increasing the energy efficiency there may be chances of
    interfering with the primary user, hence in this work authors have formed tolerable
    interference limits [ 12–16] and [ 17]. In this work [ 9], the sensing time is
    optimized based on the available transmission power which is explicitly defined.
    The localization algorithm based on priority to the secondary user lying within
    the predefined range of the primary user is used in [ 18] to optimize the sensing
    time. Optimization of different parameters demands priority to perform convergence
    effectively. Hence, the concept of adding weight to each parameter is used to
    enhance the importance of the particular QoS parameter. A weight-based Genetic
    Algorithm is proposed to achieve the QoS parameters, namely, minimum bit error
    rate, minimum power consumption and maximize the data throughput. The priority
    is given to the minimum bit error rate by setting the emergency value of weight
    to 0.8023 [ 19]. For multidimensional optimization in cognitive radio networks,
    weight-based techniques help to maximize the convergence speed [ 20]. In this
    work, the Pareto method is used to optimize the network’s power consumption, global
    exposure and spectrum use [ 21]. In this work, the authors have studied the impact
    of transmission power on energy efficiency by considering a flat-fading channel
    environment [ 22]. The concept of reinforcement learning is proposed by researchers
    to enable multiple users’ environments in a device-to-device communication [ 23].
    In [ 24], the authors proposed a mixed Markov decision process for identifying
    single secondary users in the given time for allocating the spectrum. To automate
    the spectrum sensing process machine learning concepts are utilized to identify
    the spectral availability [ 25]. To enhance energy efficiency, [ 26] proposes
    a time frame split into three slots: two slots for sensing time and one slot for
    transmission. The second slot of sensing time is used to store the details of
    the first slot whether the spectrum is free or occupied. The trade-offs between
    sensing and transmission times are considered for reducing energy utilization
    in [ 27]. The authors have proposed an excellent mathematical framework for maximizing
    the probability of detection by considering the trade-off offered by sensing time
    and throughput [ 28]. By the motivation from the literature, an optimal incentive
    algorithm, which jointly optimizes the transmission time and sensing time without
    violating the interference limit, is proposed. The remaining work is organized
    as follows: The system model for a single PU and CU environment is developed in
    Section 2. Problem formulation is given in Section 3. The solutions for the proposed
    work are discussed in Section 4. The results and their interpretations are detailed
    in Section 5 and the conclusion is given in Section 6. 2.1. System model In this
    work, single PU and single SU are considered for designing the algorithm which
    finds optimal values of sensing time and transmission time, respectively. The
    system model considered for this work is given in Figure 1 and the list of acronyms
    used further is depicted in Table 1. The total time taken is a combination of
    sensing and transmission. The time frame format considered in this work is represented
    in Figure 2. At given Ttotal, Figure 3 demonstrates the following key facts: SU
    predicts the PU activity based on periodical sensing and if PU is absent, then
    SU will start its transmission. Figure 1. System model. Display full size Figure

    Display full size Table 1. Acronyms used. Display Table On the other hand, (ii)
    if SU senses PU is active, then it has to wait and repeat the process of sensing
    and transmission. From the above-mentioned facts, during transmission either PU
    or SU is utilizing the available channel. The total time required for sensing
    and transmission time is calculated using Equation (1) T total = t s n + t t r
    n (1) T total defines the time taken by the system to periodically detect the
    presence or absence of the PU. Based on this detection, there are two possible
    outcomes: If PU is absent at a particular T total , then SU will get an opportunity
    to occupy the channel. If PU is present at the given time, SU has to wait for
    its turn. From the above said factors it is clear that SU will never interfere
    in case (b) hence we need to take case (a) into account and check the possibilities
    of interference that may affect the PU. For example, if PU reoccupies the channel
    then it will cause interference to CU transmission and hence proper knowledge
    about t-sense and t-transmit is needed for successful transmission by CU. The
    maximum allowable interference is given in terms of t t r n P int = 1 − ex p −
    t trn / α idle (2) where P int = interference probability, α idle = the mean value
    of idle time of PU, α busy = the mean value of busy time of PU, both α idle and
    α busy are exponentially distributed. If SU wants to occupy the time frame T total
    it is important to identify the probability density functions when PU is occupied
    or vacant. Equations (3) and (4) are used to facilitate the calculation of the
    probability of idle state, P i ( t ) and the probability of busy state P b ( t
    ) , respectively P i ( t ) = 1 / α idle e x p − t / α idle u ( t ) , P b ( t )
    = 1 / α busy ex p − t / α busy u ( t ) (3) To avoid more complications, the probabilities
    defined in the literature [ 7] are adopted for modelling the PU as busy or idle
    it can be given in terms of individual probabilities as follows: P b = α busy
    / ( α idle + α busy ) , P i = α idle / ( α idle + α busy ) (4) To ensure proper
    sensing of PU’s state by SU two parameters are taken into account, namely, probability
    of detection P d ( t s n , thresh ) = P r ( X sense = 1 | X = 1 ) probability
    of false alarm P f a ( t s n , thresh ) = P r ( X sense = 1 | X = 0 ) both these
    terms depend on t s n and thresh simultaneously where thresh = ( 2 / L ) ∗ ( 1
    + 2 γ P U ) (5) is used to define the threshold for detection. Based on energy
    detection thresh = σ n 2 ∗ ( 2 / L ) ∗ ( 1 + 2 γ P U ) ∗ Q − 1 ( P d 0 ) + 1 +
    γ P U (6) Based on these values of X sense and X, the four different probabilities
    of finding PU’s state are defined. 2.1.1. State 1 In this state, SU correctly
    detects the absence of PU and it has the chance of occupying the channel given
    by P r ( X = 0 , X sense = 0 ) = α idle ( 1 − P f a ( t s n , thresh ) ) 2.1.2.
    State 2 In this state, SU correctly detects the presence of SU and it has to wait
    until the PU leaves the channel. Hence, it does not initiate transmission and
    no interference will be introduced by SU to the PU. P r ( X = 1 , X sense = 1
    ) = α busy ( P d ( t s n , thresh ) ) 2.1.3. State 3 This state defines false
    detection of PU’s state as busy with probability P r ( X = 0 , X sense = 1 ) =
    α busy ( P d ( t s n , thresh ) ) . It does not contribute any reward for transmission.
    2.1.4. State 4 When SU falsely detects that PU’s state is idle with probability
    P r ( X = 1 , X sense = 0 ) = α idle ( 1 − P f a ( t s n , thresh ) ) . This state
    is similar to state 2 and hence no reward for transmission. 3. Problem formulation
    The motivation of this work is to reduce the interference of SU while utilizing
    the channel when PU reoccupies and also to maximize the energy efficiency which
    will result in the successful transmission of SU data. This can be done by adding
    incentives to the correct detection of spectrum availability. To increase energy
    efficiency it is proposed that jointly optimizing the transmission and sensing
    time by considering the importance of t s n and t t r n times over maximizing
    the throughput. 3.1. Data rate In this model, the data transmitted by SU are considered
    to be valid only in state 1 because SU has identified the absence of PU and also
    the data transmission will be initiated whether in remaining states no rewards
    are given for data transmission. The AWGN channel is considered for testing the
    proposed algorithm. Considering this factor, the total number of data bits transmitted
    in the CR system is represented in Equation (7) R total = α idle ( 1 − P f a (
    t s n , thresh ) ) t t r n ( 1 − P i n t ) ∗ R 0 (7) 3.2. Energy consumption The
    energy needs to be considered for all the cases since the transmission is successful
    or not but the amount of energy invested needs to be included. Hence, the energy
    consumed for all four states in the given time frame T t o t a l can be calculated
    using Equation (8). E total = P s n ∗ t s n + P t r n ∗ t t r n ( P i ( 1 − P
    f a ( t s n , thresh ) ) ) + P b ( 1 − P d ( t s n ) ) (8) 3.3. Energy efficiency
    The energy efficiency of the single CRNs can be calculated as follows: E effi
    = R total E total (9) E effi = α idle ( 1 − P f a ( t s n , thresh ) ) t t r n
    ( 1 − P i n t ) R 0 P s n ∗ t s n + P t r n ∗ t t r n ( P i ( 1 − P f a ( t s
    n , thresh ) ) ) + P b ( 1 − P d ( t s n ) ) (10) The maximization problem statement
    for energy efficiency can be formulated as per Equation (11) max t s n , t t r
    n , P i n t , p d ( t s n ) ⁡ E e f f i ( t s n , t t r n ) (11) s . t .   t s
    e 0 < t s n < t s e 1 , t t r 0 < t t r n < t t r 1 , P i n t < α 1 , p d ( t
    s n ) > p d 0 where α 1 = 0.1 and p d 0 = 0.9 are taken as explicit values that
    ensure maximum allowable interference imposed on PU by the SU. The probability
    of a false alarm is denoted by P f a ( t s n ) and its corresponding equation
    is P f a ( t s n ) = Q ( ( 2 ∗ γ P U + 1 ) Q − 1 ( p d 0 ) + γ P U ( t s n f s
    ) (12) where fs = sensing frequency and γ P U = SNR introduced by SU data transmission.
    3.4. Finding limits for sensing and transmission times To ensure P f a ( t s n
    ) below 0.5, t s n  must satisfy the following condition. t s n > ( Q − 1 ( p
    d 0 ) ( 2 γ P U ) + 1 ) γ P U f s ) 2 (13) The lower limit for ts is given by
    t s e 0 = ( Q − 1 ( p d 0 ) ( 2 γ P U ) + 1 ) γ P U f s ) 2 (14) To achieve the
    maximum allowable interference level then the maximum t t r n is given by Equation
    (15) t t r 1 = − α 0 log ( 1 − α 1 ) (15) where α 0 is defined as the interference
    constraint and is explicitly defined. Now the maximization problem for E effi
    can be modified as max t s n , t t r n , P i n t , p d ( t s n ) ⁡ E effi ( t
    s n , t t r n ) (16) s . t .  t s e 0 < t s n < t s e 1 , t t r 0 < t t r n <
    t t r 1 , 4. Proposed system The parameters t s n , t t r n , P t r and P i n
    t are used for solving EE maximization problem. The relationship between sensing
    time and false alarm is crucial to maintain minimum miss detection the p f should
    follow the above equation. To witness lower interference the value of t t r n
    should satisfy Equation (15). By using these values of t t r n and t s n , an
    optimal incentive search algorithm, in turn, maximizes the EE that is proposed.
    4.1. Solving for t s n To solve t s n  we take partial differentiation of E effi
    ( t s n , t t r n ) with respect to t s n and put it to zero by fixing t t r n
    ∂ ∂ t s n E effi ( t s n , t t r n ) = 0 (17) ∂ ∂ t s n ( α idle ( 1 − P f a (
    t s n , thresh ) ) × t t r n ( 1 − P int ) ∗ R 0 P s n ∗ t s n + P t r n ∗ t t
    r n ( P i ( 1 − P f a × ( t s n , thresh ) ) ) + P b ( 1 − P d ( t s n ) ) ) =
    0 (18) For simplicity let us assume P f a ( t s n , thresh ) as P f a , P d (
    t s n ) as P d in Equation (18). Now the equivalent form can be represented as
    P s n P f a − [ t t r n P i ( 1 − P d ) P t r n + P s n t s n ] P f a ′ = 0 t
    s n ∗ = − 1 P f a ′ − t t r n P i ( 1 − P d ) P t r n P s n + P f a P f a ′ (19)
    Hence, for the limits of t s n ranging between t s e 0 < t s n < t s e 1 the value
    of P f a decreases and P f a ′ ( t s n ) increases and negative, hence P f a is
    the convex function and P f a ′ ′ ( t s n ) is positive. 4.2. Solving for t t
    r n To solve t s n we take partial differentiation of E effi ( t s n , t t r n
    ) for t t r n and put it to zero by fixing t s n ∂ ∂ t t r n E effi ( t s n ,
    t t r n ) = 0 (20) ∂ ∂ t t r n ( α idle ( 1 − P f a ) t t r n ( 1 − P i n t )
    ∗ R 0 P s n ∗ t s n + P t r n ∗ t t r n ( P i ( 1 − P f a ) ) + P b ( 1 − P d
    ( t s n ) ) ) = 0 (21) By solving the above equation we get t t r n ∗ = P s n
    t s n − P s n 2 t s n 2 + 4 a 0 P s n t s n [ ( P i ( 1 − P f a ( t s n ) ) )
    × P b ( 1 − P d ) ] t s n − 2 P t r n [ ( P i ( 1 − P f a ( t s n ) ) ) P b (
    1 − P d e ) ] (22) Using Equation (22), the optimal value of t t r n can be calculated.
    Within the range of 0 < t t r n < t transmit ∗ , the energy efficiency attains
    a maximum value which tends to be unique. Further increase in t t r n > t transmit
    ∗ results in the ∂ ∂ t t r n E effi ( t s n , t t r n ) < 0 ; therefore, the value
    of ∂ ∂ t t r n E effi ( t s n , t t r n ) > 0 only for the range 0 < t t r n <
    t transmit ∗ for each fixed value of t s n . 4.3. Optimal incentive algorithm
    To maximize the energy efficiency we propose the sub-optimal weighted search algorithm,
    which makes use of the reward for the correct prediction of PUs’ availability
    under predefined interference levels. This reward is included as weight in Equation
    (10) and the modified equation can be written as follows: E effi = α idle ( 1
    − ( 1 + ω ) P f a ( t s n , thresh ) ) × t t r n ( 1 − P i n t ) R 0 P s n ∗ t
    s n + P t r n ∗ t t r n ( P i ( 1 − P f a ( t s n , thresh ) ) ) + P b ( 1 − P
    d ( t s n ) ) (23) This algorithm starts with the initial values of E effi , t
    t r n as zero and t s n = t s 0 , the energy efficiency is calculated based on
    Equation (22) if rules are violated, reward will be given as ω = 0 . The iteration
    process begins from k = 0 and continues to k + 1 till it meets the stopping criterion
    E effi ( k + 1 ) - E effi ( k ) < Δ E The pseudo-code for the proposed algorithm
    is given as follows: Optimal incentive Algorithm: Step 1: Initialize k = 0, t
    s 0 , Δ E , E effi = 0 , t t r n ( 0 ) = 0 , Δ E e f f i = 0 Step 2: while Δ E
    effi > = Δ E Step 3: Set k = k + 1 Step 4: calculate t t r n ( k ) and corresponding
    P i n t Step 5: Calculate t s n ( k ) and corresponding P f a . Step 6: if P f
    a < 0.5 and P i n t < 0.1 Step 7: Choose a reward as 1. Step 8: else, a reward
    as 0. Step 9: Compute efficiency E effi ( k + 1 ) - E e f f i ( k ) < Δ E Step
    10: Return E effi , t t r n , t s n . The algorithm is implemented in such a way
    that the optimal values of sensing time and transmission time are calculated by
    which the EE value is maximized. 5. Implementation and results In this section,
    the results obtained by making use of the incentive algorithm are discussed. The
    parameters used for optimization are sensing time and transmission time. The need
    for optimization increases when the increase in sensing time results in better
    detection probability but the transmission time becomes so small that may not
    be feasible for successful data transmission. To achieve better transmission time
    trade-off with interference needs to be considered. In this model, a single PU
    and SU are taken to analyse the efficiency of the incentive algorithm. The performance
    of the proposed method by comparing with the methods stated in [ 16] and [ 7]
    by providing numerical results obtained through simulation using MATLAB software
    is demonstrated. The parameters used for simulation are given in Table 2. Table
    2. Simulation parameters. Display Table Figure 4 shows the impact of transmission
    power on energy efficiency by the optimal incentive algorithm. By choosing transmission
    power as 0.1 W, the energy efficiency is 44.25 bits/Hz/Joule. Due to the probability
    of false alarms, an increase in transmission power will reduce the data rate.
    This, in turn, results in increased sensing time. Because of this effect energy
    efficiency falls with an increase in transmission power. Figure 4. Proposed algorithm.
    Display full size Figure 5 shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms the exhaustive
    search method and the sub-optimal iterative search algorithm by yielding the highest
    EE. For comparison the transmission power is chosen as the same as stated in [?],
    P t r n = 0.1 W the E effi for the proposed method is 44.25 bits/Hz/Joule, for
    SOISA is 12.47 bits/Hz/Joule and the exhaustive search method is 6.236 bits/Hz/Joule.
    The optimized values of sensing time and transmission time predicted by this algorithm
    are 0.0025 and 0.0615 s, respectively, which play a crucial role in maximizing
    the energy efficiency to 44.25 bits/Hz/Joule. The probability of interference
    also remains within the specified range ensuring PU protection in the CR system.

    in energy efficiency as well. Table 3. Comparison of the proposed algorithm with

    problem statement is modelled by considering single PU and single SU and multiple
    users’ environments. The solution is derived in such a way that the energy efficiency
    is maximized by taking appropriate values of sensing and transmission times. The
    impact of providing incentives over energy efficiency maximization in the CR system
    is studied. The optimization problem is designed with parameters, namely, sensing
    time, transmission time and probability of interference. This model enables joint
    optimization of sensing time and transmission time contributing to an appreciable
    increase in energy efficiency. It is also witnessed that the proposed optimization
    algorithm protects PU data transmission without enhancing the tolerable interference
    value. From simulation results, the proposed algorithm shows better performance
    than the exhaustive and sub-optimal iterative search algorithms with a remarkable
    increase in energy efficiency. Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest

    1 Introduction Dynamic spectrum allocation has been introduced to the spectrum
    market and has substantially increased SP''s profit [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Implementation
    of advanced spectrum trading techniques has been thriving worldwide. Networks
    are characterized by a limited frequency spectrum, performance requirements, and
    high demand for service. In the spectrum market, an SP hires a spectrum for clients
    in the form of services. In this work, the key objective of an SP is maximizing
    its profit by evicting in-service users who generate the lowest profit. Each client
    can access the spectrum, so there is no client in a queue with a higher bid, in
    which a usage fee is paid under the SP''s pricing guidelines. Based on their needs,
    clients choose their preferred bids. Making the most money is SPs'' main goal.
    As a result, it''s crucial to examine the economic issues that result from clients
    and SPs having competing goals. [7, 8]. To maximize its profit, an SP should consider
    serving the richest clients with a sufficient amount of spectrum, and the SP''s
    trading policy admits spectrum requests based on generated profit. In this work,
    we propose a new game theory-based spectrum trading model where clients are allowed
    to access the spectrum only when the profit generated by serving them is higher
    than the profit of serving clients in waiting queues. The richest clients are
    given priority over other clients. Therefore, the clients must release a channel
    to which each new richest client joins the waiting queue, and the spectrum state
    changes from \"occupied\" to \"free\" for serving the richest newcomer. When a
    client no longer transmits on the channels, these channels can be used again by
    other clients. One purpose of this work is to extract an optimal control policy
    that maximizes a real-valued function of profit by optimizing the client''s admission
    and eviction. Although the optimal user admission control problem has been tackled
    in many studies, these often neglect time-varying spectrum bid prices. Uncertain
    bid prices necessitate joint control of client admission and eviction to maximize
    the SP profit. However, in case the available spectrum is inadequate to serve
    a new richest client, the SP should determine which clients in-service to be evicted.
    The evicted users must receive some sort of compensation, which may vary depending
    on the spectrum needs of individual users and consequently have an impact on the
    SP''s profitability. Because the utility of an SP aims to minimize compensation
    for evicted clients and maximize SP''s profit while users seek to maximize compensation
    amount, we consider the game between SP and clients using a novel multi-stage
    game model. In this model, the utility SP sets the amount of compensation, while
    the clients respond to the compensation by adjusting the spectrum they use (i.e.,
    release the spectrum). The proposed utility functions consider the cost of eviction
    of clients and the satisfaction level of clients. The contribution of this work
    is thus twofold: Firstly, it proposes a new game theory-based spectrum trading
    model, namely, a preemption game for profit maximization. In our model, an SP
    temporarily leases its free channels to clients and charges them for their opportunistic
    usage of the spectrum accordingly. To maximize its profit, SP negotiates with
    clients who paid the lowest spectrum price to release their spectrum in exchange
    for financial compensation. The objective is to utilize the released spectrum
    for serving new, more financially capable clients to maximize the SP’s profit.
    Secondly, a novel game theory-based policy for selecting a set of clients in-service
    that generates the maximum profit has been introduced. The proposed policy decides
    whether a newly arriving client should be served or added to a queue to achieve
    better profit. The policy seeks to sequentially select a sequence of clients to
    optimize the profit function from a waiting set of clients. The profit function
    to be optimized is not static but varies over time based on the offered spectrum
    prices by clients. In such cases, the performance of traditional policy for spectrum
    trading may deteriorate. This is because most of these algorithms continue to
    treat stale data of the spectrum market as being equally important as fresh data.
    Hence, proposing new algorithms for spectrum trading and theory to handle time
    variations in spectrum bids is crucial for profit maximization for SPs. SPs face
    a unique challenge with time-varying profit function due to offered prices for
    spectrum—that necessitates a trading policy that considers client''s in-service
    and clients'' in-waiting. The policy applies joint control of clients'' admission
    and eviction. For-profit maximization, the spectrum that was hired to clients
    (called in-service clients) with lower profit should be relocated to the best
    offers. Upon the arrival of a profitable spectrum request, the SP should select
    the appropriate client to be evicted if the new request generates more profit.
    However, the evicted clients will be compensated with some form of reimbursement,
    where the agreements are reached in bargaining games that reveal the preferences
    of the clients and SP. The remaining section of this paper is organized as follows.
    The associated work is shown in Sect. 2. Then, the system model and assumptions
    are described in Sect. 3. After that, Sect. 4 introduces our new game theory-based,
    the profit-driven business model for optimal admission of spectrum requests. Then,
    In Sect. 5, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model and evaluate the
    adoption capabilities of the proposed model for profit maximization in the spectrum
    market. Finally, the conclusion and remarks of this paper are presented in Sect.
    6. 2 Related work A vast amount of literature places great emphasis on utilizing
    spectrum trading in networks. In this literature, we will focus on the results
    of maximizing SP profit in the spectrum market. In [8], stochastic optimization
    techniques were used to handle the problem of channel availability uncertainty
    and to determine the appropriate collection of channels for each spectrum request
    at the lowest cost. Two distinct limitations on spectrum demand have been proposed.
    The throughput must surpass a particular percentage of the requested one. To address
    the demand deficit, the potential for channel subleasing among the SUs was also
    looked at. In [10], a new spectrum demand model was proposed to maximize SP''s
    profit. Uncertainty for spectrum demand was considered in this model. To maximize
    its profit, SP chooses a more cost-effective spectrum and meets its clients''
    needs. The prospect theory was used in [10] to analyze SP’s optimal decision problem
    in a secondary spectrum market. The trade-off between an operator''s expectation
    of profit and risk preference was investigated. Authors in [1] proposed a new
    algorithm for spectrum renting. The suggested algorithm does not depend on knowing
    market factors and has a finite competitive ratio and low time complexity. The
    proposed algorithm, which maintains a spectrum without knowledge of the characteristics
    of the related random processes, was designed by authors using resources from
    ski-rental literature. In [12], relaxation algorithms were used to model spectrum
    auctions as a valid spectrum trading policy. The proposed method’s main concern
    was maximizing the profit of the SPs while taking into account interference and
    market constraints. In [13], The authors developed a game theoretical analysis
    of the interaction between the SP and clients before putting forth new algorithms
    for data pricing and channel allocation. The results showed that SP loses revenue
    when clients reject the SP''s offer to underweight the service guarantee. As a
    result, a new pricing method was suggested to strengthen the system''s capacity
    for making decisions and enhance spectrum management in the spectrum market. A
    new service provider was suggested in [14] to make it easier for customers to
    access spectrum and harvest an erratic spectrum supply. Using a three-dimensional
    (3D) conflict graph, the authors described the conflicts and competitions mathematically
    among candidates for the spectrum. Under several cross-layer constraints, the
    SP''s revenue maximization problem was stated as the optimal spectrum trading
    problem. To search for workable answers, fresh heuristic methods were also suggested.
    To maximize SP''s profit, high-resolution pricing models were developed in [15]
    to facilitate price adaptation to the spectrum market state dynamically. SP’s
    profit was quantified by using the queuing theory. A wider variety of different
    traffic arrival and service rate distributions were modeled using the Markov model.
    In [16], authors proposed two optimization models using stochastic optimization
    algorithms for achieving either the target Grade of Service (GoS) of clients where
    the budget of SP is unrestricted or maximizing SP’s profit but with a restricted
    budget. Spectrum resources were assumed to be available for SP, and it can borrow
    spectrum under a merchant mode. Two fundamental types of spectrum rental agreements
    were put out by the authors in [17]: short-term opportunistic-access agreements
    and long-term guaranteed bandwidth agreements. Through these agreements, SP can
    achieve the needed flexibility and trade-offs in terms of service quality, effective
    spectrum use, and pricing. Moreover, the authors proposed a new algorithm to help
    SP for adapting the spectrum contract portfolio dynamically subject to satisfy
    customer spectrum demands, to increase SP''s profit in the spectrum market. The
    problem of spectrum trading was presented as a stochastic dynamic programming
    problem, with decision-making taking into consideration the market prices for
    the contracts and the demand for spectrum. The main goal of the Size-Negotiable
    Auction Mechanism (SNAM) tool proposed in [18] is to enable clients to adopt a
    spectrum bidder''s coverage to provide room for further negotiation while auctioning.
    The SNAM''s bidder offers its bid to access spectrum per unit space and a group
    of coverage spans. The auctioneer manages the interference regions to prevent
    interference between bidders to increase the overall coverage region. In [19],
    the service provider negotiates with the spectrum owner to pay less to access
    certain content. The service provider catches content to enable mobile subscribers/users
    to access this content. The interaction among spectrum owners, service providers,
    and clients was modeled using game theory. A sub-gradient-based iterative algorithm
    was proposed to guarantee convergence to the Stackelberg equilibrium. In [20],
    the authors suggested a new spectrum trading scheme. The suggested scheme’s main
    concern was serving the most significant number of clients with the lowest overall
    spectrum cost while considering the time-varying achievable transmit rate and
    level of channel usage across different SPs. The problem was designed as an optimization
    problem to increase the total client number while increasing the SP''s profit.
    To solve an optimization problem, one must initially conceptualize it, describe
    it, and then develop an equation for it to identify the least or highest value
    of the issue the derivatives or exit points to provide a solution. Authors in
    [1] proposed a new practical auction mechanism to solve the problem of spectrum
    redistribution for networks. The scheme achieved high spectrum utilization by
    exploiting channels’ spatial re-usability. In [2021 a new cycle auction mechanism
    was proposed to trade the users with the lowest energy efficiency among the base
    stations for heterogeneous networks. A multi-priority non-cooperative power-control
    game was suggested by the authors in [22]. The proposed game''s primary objective
    is to allow several small cell base stations to utilize available spectrum resources
    simultaneously without impairing the quality of service provided to the spectrum
    owner (QoS). Spectrum price was used as a control parameter in the proposed game
    to prioritize spectrum owners over clients for accessing the spectrum. In [23],
    The authors examined various potential strategies for multi-operator spectrum
    sharing based on 5G terrestrial networks'' dynamic spectrum access. They identified
    the spectrum trading method to be practically the most appropriate candidate for
    efficient spectrum usage. A hybrid cooperative, competitive game was adopted for
    spectrum renting. Authors proposed a new admission and eviction control of cognitive
    radio users (AECCR) in [24]. For this scheme, clients can access the free spectrum
    only when their legacy users are temporarily unoccupied and pay usage to the SP,
    the SP evicts clients upon the return of the legacy users. An ideal control strategy
    for evicting clients was derived using a semi-Markov decision process. The main
    concern of the proposed scheme in [25] was providing data transmissions with QoS
    requirements. In [26], SP leases the licensed channels temporarily from the spectrum
    owner through spectrum auction and rents to the client. Clients use rented spectrum
    opportunistically when the primary users are not using the channels. By enhancing
    admission and eviction controls for the dynamic spectrum market, the SP aims to
    boost profits. [27, 28], the authors proposed new reinforcement learning (RL)
    scheme for profit maximization in spectrum trading where a trading policy was
    extracted using an unsupervised learning paradigm. The extracted policy enables
    spectrum owners to increase profit by adjusting spectrum range in response to
    changes in spectrum market status and conditions. In [29, 30], While the primary
    receiver is used to decode information from both the primary transmitter and the
    backscatter device, the primary transmitter is designed to aid in both the primary
    and backscatter device broadcasts. The authors suggest a new method for getting
    temporary spectrum by keeping an eye out for \"spectrum holes\" in licensed bands
    and dynamically leasing from the SP [31]. This allows an SP to adapt its investment
    strategy and fee structure to the needs of its customers. When considering the
    cost and uncertainty trade-offs, the scheme extracts the optimum sensing and leasing
    spectrum amounts. The authors in [32] investigated how time-division multiple
    access (TDMA] is implemented in Wi-Fi and LTE-U networks. The networks'' access
    protocol was designed using the fairness criterion so that everyone has an equal
    opportunity. The Nash bargaining method was used to decide which of several fair
    protocols was the fairest. The above works discuss the profit maximization problem
    in the spectrum market. The main challenge of spectrum trading is the uncertainty
    of new arrival bids of the spectrum, as the SP does not know the customers’ bids
    beforehand. The majority of earlier studies have simply optimized the admission
    of current requests, ignoring the admission of future deserving spectrum requests
    that can further boost the SP’s profit. When facing the uncertainty of bids, most
    prior studies of spectrum trading compute the profit of SP based on the current
    system state. To maximize its anticipated profit, an SP optimizes the choices
    made in the suggested trading schemes. These models, however, fall short of accurately
    representing the very complex decision-making process found in actual spectrum
    markets. The suggested approach gives SP the ability to assess a choice based
    on anticipated gains or losses compared to the existing profit. Previous studies
    assumed the channels are always available in the spectrum market. Such ignorance
    of the limited spectrum of resources made them inapplicable to real-world problems.
    3 System model In the spectrum market, N clients (bidders) who compete for a total
    spectrum size of W are considered. All clients submit their requests simultaneously
    in a sealed bid manner. Each client knows its bidding quantity and price but does
    not know about other spectrum requests. Each client only rents spectrum from an
    SP. It is assumed that requests for spectrum arrive as a Poisson stream with an
    arrival rate of (i.e., number of requests per unit of time). It is believed that
    each request''s service time will be dispersed exponentially. Poisson arrival
    processes are described as having exponential interarrival times. The quantity
    of arrivals per unit of time has a Poisson distribution in such a process. Request’s
    inter-arrival times are independent and uniformly distributed with exponential
    random variables. These assumptions have been chosen to reflect some of the reality
    of wireless applications, such as mobile call traffic. The exponential distribution
    frequently addresses the duration before a particular event. According to the
    exponential distribution, smaller values happen more frequently than large ones.
    Probability distributions with uniform distributions have outcomes that are all
    similarly predictable. Results are discrete and have the same probability in a
    discrete uniform distribution. Results are continuous and infinite in a continuous
    uniform distribution. Data that are closer to the mean are more common in a normal
    distribution. Figure 1 presents an overview of the system. As depicted in this
    Figure, all clients submit their requests simultaneously in a sealed bid manner.
    Fig. 1 System overview Full size image Let \\(C_{i}\\) denote the unit marginal
    cost of renting the spectrum for ith request, \\(P_{i}\\) denotes the unit rents
    price of the spectrum (i.e. a channel) for ith request, \\(t_{i}\\) represents
    the rental period of spectrum for ith request, and \\(d_{i}\\) indicates the demand
    (number of channels) for ith request in a constant price scenario, \\({\\acute{P}}\\)
    is new spectrum price. The marginal cost is the slope of the total cost, or the
    rate at which it increases with production, and is expressed in dollars per unit
    while the total cost is expressed in dollars. The average cost, which is the overall
    cost divided by the number of units produced, is distinct from the marginal cost.
    A product''s or service''s utility is the functionality it provides to solve a
    certain requirement. The utility may explain \"what the service performs\" or
    determine if it is “fit for purpose”. A service must either support the customer''s
    performance or liberate the user from limitations to be beneficial. The utility
    function of the SP is computed as: $$U = \\sum\\limits_{{i = 0}}^{Q} \\left({P_{i}

    {{\\acute{P}}} \\right)\\) is the cost of varying users'' demand in response to
    time-varying prices, \\(Q\\) represents the number of requests fulfilled, and
    \\(R\\) is the amount of reimbursement for the evicted client in-service. The
    cost of raising spectrum price \\(v\\left( {{\\acute{P}}} \\right)\\) can be expressed
    as: $$v\\left( {{\\acute{P}}} \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{E} {\\left( {P_{i}
    d_{i} t_{i} - C_{i} d_{i} t_{i} } \\right)}$$ (2) where \\(E\\) is the number
    of clients who switch to another service provider due to rising service prices.
    The cost of serving ith request includes the amount of money the client pays for
    renting spectrum and its service satisfaction and it is computed as follows: $$C_{s}
    = P_{i} d_{i} t_{i} + S\\left( W \\right)$$ (3) where \\(S\\left( W \\right)\\)
    is the clients'' satisfaction function with service. This function quantifies
    clients'' satisfaction with the service level caused by the shortage of available
    spectrum. If the size of the free spectrum (\\(W\\)) is smaller than demand (\\(d\\)),
    the client is not satisfied, and the value of the function will be positive. Clients’
    satisfaction increases faster as the spectrum shortage decreases. On the other
    hand, if the available spectrum size is greater than the demand for service, the
    clients will be satisfied, and the function value will be negative. In our work,
    we select \\(S\\left( W \\right)\\) as follows: $$S\\left( W \\right) = \\rho
    B\\left( W \\right)$$ (4) where \\(B\\left( W \\right)\\) is the blocking probability
    [33], and \\(\\rho\\) is the weight of the client satisfaction, which models the
    nature and client behavior. The utility function for the ith client is the negative
    of its cost, which can be expressed as follows: $$U_{i} = - C_{s} = - P_{i} d_{i}
    t_{i} - S\\left( W \\right) + R$$ (5) The system state is defined as: $$Z_{t}
    = \\left( {W,D_{v} ,P_{v} } \\right) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} W \\hfill
    \\\\ {D_{v} = \\left( {d_{1} , d_{2} , \\ldots , d_{N} } \\right)} \\hfill \\\\
    {P_{v} = \\left( {p_{1} , p_{2} , \\ldots , p_{N} } \\right)} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array}
    } \\right.$$ (6) SP should take action when the system state changes. System state
    changes upon customers’ arrival or departure. For a state \\(Z_{t}\\), the action
    space can be represented as follows: $$A(Z_{t} ) = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l}
    {0, \\;reject\\;new\\;request} \\hfill \\\\ {1, \\;add\\;new\\;request\\;to\\;queue}
    \\hfill \\\\ {2, \\;serve\\;request\\;if\\;W > d} \\hfill \\\\ {3, \\;serve\\;request\\;if\\;{\\acute{d}}
    < d} \\hfill \\\\ {4, \\;serve\\;new\\;request\\; by\\;evicting\\;clients\\; in
    - service } \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ (7) SP may evict some clients
    to serve a new higher price request to maximize the profit. Moreover, SP may motivate
    the client to reduce the order size of the spectrum to utilize a small size spectrum.
    Table 1 summarizes the primary notations used throughout the problem description
    for clarity. Table 1 List of relevant notations Full size table 4 Game theory
    based profit optimization To maximize SP’s profit, a new scheduling scheme for
    serving clients based on the reported profit is proposed. Game theory is utilized
    in this scheme for spectrum allocation. 4.1 Game theory for profit maximization
    Game theory is an area of applied mathematics that provides methods for studying
    situations in which parties, known as players, make interdependent decisions.
    A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic strategy that selects the best option at
    each simple step to eventually lead to a globally optimal solution. This dependency
    forces each player to take the other player''s potential actions, or tactics,
    into consideration while constructing strategy. This indicates that the algorithm
    selects the best answer available at the time without considering the effects.
    SP attempts to evict some users'' in-service to serve wealthy clients. This behavior
    of SP is modeled using game theory, where SP offers compensation for evicted users
    to motivate them to release all channels or parts of the spectrum. A game can
    be described by a set of players, which are the evicted users and SP. In this
    game, each player \\(i\\) has the utility function \\(u_{i}\\). The utility for
    each player for chosen strategy quantifies a player’s satisfaction with its decision
    (i.e., releasing spectrum). The game theory places a significant emphasis on utilities.
    They enable the use of real-valued functions in game theoretic analysis by representing
    the preferences that players have for various outcomes in terms of real numbers.
    The same formula that use to determine expected value is also used to calculate
    expected utility rather than adding probability and economic amounts. Let \\(L\\)
    be the number of players in the game and assume \\(Y\\) is a non-empty set of
    \\(H^{L}\\) representing the state of players’ strategies. A game in strategic
    form consists of a group of players, a set of strategies for each player, and
    an outcome for each vector of strategies. Generally, the outcome is determined
    by the vector of utilities that the players get from the result. The strategy
    of each client is a decision on releasing spectrum. The set \\(U\\) denotes the
    set of performance metrics, and it can be defined as follows: $$U = \\left\\{
    {u \\in H^{L} :\\exists y \\in Y} \\right\\}$$ (8) Let \\(u_{l}\\) be the minimum
    performance metrics for players to accept bargain (i.e. minimum requirements)
    with SP for releasing its channels. Definition 1 The utility function \\(u_{l}
    \\in H^{L}\\), is said to be Pareto optimal if \\(\\forall u_{j}\\) \\(\\in H^{L}\\),
    \\(u_{j} \\ge u_{i}\\), then \\(u_{j} = u_{i} .\\) From Definition 1, it is clear
    that there is no solution for the spectrum hiring problem which improves SP’s
    satisfaction without reducing the level of satisfaction for evicted clients. The
    hiring spectrum is Pareto optimal, where the number of solutions is infinite.
    In this work, the game theory will be applied to find the one-of-a-kind and fair
    Pareto optimal solution. Pareto efficiency indicates that resources are allocated
    in the most cost-effective way possible, but it does not imply equality or fairness.
    When no economic adjustment can benefit one person without harming at least one
    other, such a situation is referred to as the Pareto optimal condition of the
    economy. An outcome of a game is Pareto optimum if no other outcome gives every
    player at least as well off and at least one strictly better off. It follows that
    no change to a Pareto-optimal result can be made without harming at least one
    player. Cooperative bargaining is the process through which two individuals agree
    on how to divide a surplus that they may generate together. The surplus produced
    by the two players may frequently be distributed in a variety of ways, enabling
    the players to bargain about how to divide rewards. Due to the potential for external
    enforcement of cooperative conduct, a cooperative game involves competition between
    groups of players in game theory. The cooperative bargaining game theory is summarized
    below. Definition 2 The mapping policy G \\(\\left( {U, u_{j} } \\right)\\) \\(H^{L}\\)
    is said to be a cooperative game theory if: 1. G \\(\\left( {U, u_{j} } \\right)
    \\in U\\) 2. G \\(\\left( {U, u_{j} } \\right)\\) is Pareto optimal. 3. Independent
    for any linear transformation function: for any function \\(T: H^{L}\\) \\(H^{L}\\),
    \\(T\\left( {u_{j} } \\right)u_{i}\\), then G \\(\\left( {T\\left( U \\right),
    T(u_{j} )} \\right)\\) = \\(T\\left( {{\\text{G}}(U, u_{j} )} \\right)\\). 4.
    G \\((U, u_{j} )\\) satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives if for all
    mapping situations \\(U\\) and \\({\\acute{U}}\\) with \\({\\acute{U}}\\) \\(\\subset
    U\\) and G \\(({\\acute{U}}, u_{j} ) \\in U\\) we have G \\(({\\acute{U}}, u_{j}
    ) = {\\text{G}}\\left( {U, u_{j} } \\right).\\) 5. G(\\(U, u_{j} )\\) is symmetric
    and it does not distinguish between the players. If \\(u_{j} = u_{i}\\) then G
    \\((U, u_{j} ) =\\) G \\((U, u_{i} )\\). In the eviction game theory (bargaining),
    each player reveals their preference over the available spectrum. The agreement
    was reached to reveal the preferences of bargainers. The rationality of customers
    is the underlying assumption of the revealed preference theory. In other words,
    they will have evaluated a variety of options before selecting the best investment
    selection for them. As a result, if a customer selects one choice from the available
    options, that option must be the preferred option. Clients’ in-service repetitively
    submit their prices to the SP, which selects the clients with minimum prices.
    A stable state that is a Nash equilibrium solution is reached after several price
    bidding iterations. The following measures are used to stop clients from bargaining:
    Be very explicit about the asking price and the rationale behind it. Never suggest
    that they want their engagement more than they require your solution. Move the
    conversation away from the price and onto other points that are negotiable. Definition
    3 (Nash equilibrium). In game theory, Nash equilibrium is a key idea. According
    to this, each player chooses the payoff-maximizing strategy in an equilibrium
    given the tactics of the other players. However, it loses its benefits in games
    with numerous equilibria and requires substantial assumptions on the understanding
    of the strategies of the other players. The result of a noncooperative game for
    two or more players in which no player''s predicted outcome can be modified by
    altering one''s strategy is also its solution in game theory. The dominant strategy
    equilibrium is a more robust idea in the Nash equilibrium. If a player''s payoff-maximizing
    approach is separate from the other players'' tactics, it is considered to be
    a dominating strategy. Strategy-proof mechanisms exhibit the dominant strategy
    equilibrium. No considerations are made regarding the knowledge that the agents
    have access to about one another in a strategy-proof system, and each bidder determines
    their own best strategy without needing the others to operate rationally. Every
    player in a negotiating game is put in a position where they cannot alter their
    tactics to increase their utility. Theorem 1 Assume that the utility function
    f(u i) for each player in the eviction game is concave, upper bounded, and defined
    on Y, which is a convex function and compact subset of HL. Assume that each player
    can improve the utility function by switching up their approach. Then, a special
    barging solution (u*) is negotiated. The best answer, f(u*), can be written as:
    $$u^{*} = \\mathop {\\max }\\limits_{{\\forall i \\in A_{G} }} f\\left( {u^{*}
    } \\right) - f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right),\\;u^{*} \\in U$$ (9) where \\(A_{G}\\)
    is the set of players in the game. Each player''s weight \\(w_{i}\\) depends on
    the number of bargaining units and the bid of a jth rich client. The weight is
    normalized by scaling its values to fall within the range of 0.0–1.0 as follows:
    $$w_{i} = d_{j} \\frac{{b_{j} }}{{\\mathop {\\max b_{k} }\\limits_{{\\forall k
    \\in A_{G} }} }}$$ (10) Proposition Each ith player in the eviction game weighs
    \\(w_{i}\\). For this game, a unique solution is existing, and it can be considered
    as an optimization problem solution as in the following equation: $$u^{*} = \\mathop
    {\\max }\\limits_{{\\forall i \\in A_{G} }} w_{i} \\left( {f\\left( {u^{*} } \\right)
    - \\mathop {\\min }\\limits_{{\\forall f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right) \\in Y}} f\\left(
    {u_{i} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (11) Proof The set of utility functions \\(Y\\)
    is a convex and compact subset of \\(H^{L}\\). The power function \\(\\left( {f\\left(
    {u^{*} } \\right) - \\mathop {\\min }\\limits_{{\\forall f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right)
    \\in Y}} f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right)} \\right)^{{w_{i} }}\\) is adopted as a utility
    function for each player in the eviction game. Thus, the utility function defined
    on \\(Y\\) is concave if 0 < \\(w_{i}\\) < 1. The optimization problem in the
    bargaining game can be expressed as follows: $$u^{*} = \\mathop {\\max }\\limits_{{\\forall
    i \\in A_{G} }} \\left( {f\\left( {u^{*} } \\right) - \\mathop {\\min }\\limits_{{\\forall
    f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right) \\in Y}} f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right)} \\right)^{{w_{i}
    }}$$ (12) Note that the minimum performance metrics for ith player \\(u_{i}\\) = 0
    if \\(u_{i} = f\\left( {u^{*} } \\right) - \\mathop {\\min }\\limits_{{\\forall
    f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right) \\in Y}} f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right) = 0\\), so the
    optimal solution can be extracted for the bargaining game. Hence, it is reasonable
    to map the eviction game into an N-player multiple bargaining game because of
    the following reasons: 1. Each player requires a minimum number of channels (\\(d_{i}\\)).
    The initial agreement between SP and a client can be set as 0 where a request
    may be rejected. 2. The amount of reimbursement for the evicted client depends
    on the bid of rich clients. More amount of reimbursement is paid to a client with
    having higher weight. Therefore, a weight variable could be constructed with numerous
    parameters to represent the clients’ priority. 3. Clearly, the eviction game has
    the Pareto optimality properties and the optimal spectrum allocation should be
    a Pareto optimal solution. The Pareto optimality standard efficiently and more
    effectively is defined in terms of individuals as follows: If it is impossible
    to transfer resources in a way that benefits one person without affecting at least
    one other person, the allocation is considered efficient. Therefore, efficiency
    in consumption, efficiency in production, and efficiency in both consumption and
    production are requirements for achieving Pareto optimality. Definition 4 A bargaining
    solution \\(u_{i}\\) is Pareto optimal solution where \\(u_{i}\\) ∈ \\(U\\) if
    and only if \\(u_{j} = u_{i}\\) for all \\(u_{j}\\) satisfying \\(u_{j} \\ge u_{i}\\).
    4.2 Optimal profit response to eviction policy To find SP''s optimal profit response
    to the eviction policy, we consider the bids of new clients and the expected profit
    of serving clients in-service. Expected profit for serving a new higher price
    request i is computed as follows: $$E_{p} = P_{i} d_{i} t_{i} - C_{i} d_{i} t_{i}
    - C_{e}$$ (13) where \\(C_{e}\\) is the cost of eviction ith the client and it
    is calculated as: $$C_{e} = R + P_{i} d_{i} t_{i} - t_{e}$$ (14) where \\(t_{e}\\)
    is the eviction time. SP selects a client in-service with the lowest reward and
    starts negotiating with the client to release its spectrum. The performance of
    each player depends on the number of channels allocated to it. Let \\(d_{i}^{min}\\)
    denote the minimum spectrum for the ith client and \\(d_{i}\\) is the rented spectrum
    for the ith client. The optimal allocation for the spectrum can be obtained by
    resolving this optimization problem: $$\\mathop {\\max }\\limits_{{\\forall i
    \\in A_{G} }} w_{i} \\left( {f\\left( {u^{*} } \\right) - \\mathop {\\min }\\limits_{{\\forall
    f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right) \\in Y}} f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (15)
    Subject to $$0 \\le d_{i} \\le W$$ $$d_{i} \\ge d_{i}^{min}$$ $$\\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{N} {d_{i} \\le W}$$ The solution vector for this game is a convex and non-empty
    set. For each player, the utility function can be presented in terms of the spectrum:
    $$f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right) = w_{i} \\ln \\left( {d_{i} - d_{i}^{\\min } } \\right)$$
    (16) Utility function should satisfy the following constraints: $$\\frac{{\\partial
    f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right)}}{{\\partial d_{i} }} > 0$$ $$\\frac{{\\partial^{2}
    f\\left( {u_{i} } \\right)}}{{\\partial^{2} d_{i} }} < 0$$ Thus, \\(f\\left( {u_{i}
    } \\right)\\) is a concave function. SP rents spectrum for clients based on the
    bids. For SP, there is a population of \\(L\\) clients who may release a spectrum.
    SP has the desire to grasp ith client spectrum described by the fowling condition:
    $$D\\left( R \\right) = - R + w_{i} {\\epsilon}_{i}$$ (17) where I is the actualization
    of a randomly distributed random variable with a continuously differentiable density,
    and [a,b] of the extended real line as its support. SP must incur a bargaining
    cost \\(c_{b}\\) to find clients who accept to release the spectrum. Hence, the
    grasping function of the spectrum can be expressed as follows: $$D\\left( R \\right)
    = - R + w_{i} {\\epsilon}_{i} - c_{b}$$ (18) We consider the equilibria at which
    ith client accept \\(s R^{*}\\) which is the minimum amount of reimbursement.
    Assume SP holds the best offer with \\({\\acute{R}}\\), jth client, which differs
    from \\(R^{*}\\). If SP tries with another client, ith client, expecting \\(R^{*}\\)
    to release its spectrum, then SP will prefer ith client''s spectrum if \\(R^{*}
    + w_{i} {\\epsilon}_{i}\\) exceeds \\({\\acute{R}} + w_{j} {\\epsilon}_{j}\\)
    and \\({\\epsilon}_{i}\\) exceeds \\({\\epsilon}_{i} + \\frac{{\\left( { R^{*}
    - {\\acute{R}}} \\right)}}{{w_{i} }}\\). Thus, the added utility for SP can be
    presented as: $$\\left( {{\\acute{R}} - R^{*} } \\right) + w_{i} \\left( {{\\epsilon}_{i}
    - {\\epsilon}_{j} } \\right) = w_{i} \\left( {{\\epsilon}_{i} - y} \\right)$$
    (19) The expected increment in the utility of searching for one more client is
    computed as follows: $$w_{i} h\\left( y \\right) = w_{i} \\int\\limits_{y}^{\\infty
    } {\\left( {{\\epsilon} - y} \\right)f\\left( {\\epsilon} \\right)d{\\epsilon}
    }$$ (20) SP usually tends to search for clients who may accept less amount reimbursement.
    On the other hand, SP stops searching when the utility is not improving anymore.
    Since \\(w_{i} > 0\\), the expected increment in utility from bargaining one more
    client exceeds the bargaining cost if only if \\(y < {\\acute{y}}\\) where \\({\\acute{y}}\\)
    is computed as follows: $$h\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right) = \\frac{{c_{b} }}{{w_{i}
    }}$$ (21) SP should stop bargaining if \\(y < {\\acute{y}}\\). Theorem 2 Given
    the number of clients that SP does not bargain with them and this stopping rule
    is true for \\({\\acute{N}} = 1,\\) After N clients are in service, the likelihood
    that SP will stop bargaining with more clients decreases as a function of both
    the negotiation cost and the client count. Proof For \\({\\acute{N}} + 1\\), if
    \\(y > {\\acute{y}}\\) and SP does not bargain with one more client, then either
    a smaller value of \\(y\\) is revealed or a larger one is. In any case, SP gets
    the best spectrum price (i.e. less amount of reimbursement) corresponding to \\(y
    > {\\acute{y}}\\). Since there is only \\({\\acute{y}}\\) left to bargain and
    it was assumed the stopping rule is optimal, SP would then stop bargaining. Thus,
    when there are \\({\\acute{N}} + 1\\) clients left and \\(y\\) exceeds \\({\\acute{y}}\\),
    SP would not search for more clients in-service since this will decrease SP''s
    profit. Thus, the stopping criteria are valid for \\({\\acute{N}}\\), it is valid
    for \\({\\acute{N}} + 1\\) by induction. The reservation value \\({\\acute{y}}\\)
    determines the probability that SP goes on bargaining more clients. The larger
    value of \\({\\acute{y}}\\), the more likelihood of considering more clients for
    bargaining. \\({\\acute{y}}\\) is a strictly decreasing function of ratio \\(\\frac{{c_{b}
    }}{{w_{i} }}\\) since the function \\(h\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)\\) is strictly
    decreasing. The value of \\({\\acute{y}}\\) goes from \\(b\\) to \\(- \\infty\\)
    as \\(\\frac{{c_{b} }}{{w_{i} }}\\) goes from zero to \\(- \\infty .\\) Thus,
    the probability that SP terminates bargaining more clients after \\({\\acute{N}}\\)
    clients in-service is an increasing function of the bargaining cost and a decreasing
    function of the number of clients in-service. The value \\({\\acute{y}}\\) cannot
    exceed the upper bound, \\(b,\\) of the support of \\({\\mathcalligra{f}}\\) The
    value \\({\\acute{y}}\\) equals \\(b\\) if \\(c_{b} = 0\\) and if SP bargaining
    all clients in-service. However, the value of \\({\\acute{y}}\\) can be less the
    than the lower bound, \\(a,\\) of the support of \\({\\mathcalligra{f}}\\). Therefore,
    we have: $$\\left( {w_{i} h\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right) = w_{i} \\left( {{\\epsilon}_{i}
    - {\\acute{y}}} \\right)} \\right) > w_{i} \\left( {{\\epsilon}_{i} - a} \\right)$$
    (22) this implies that: $$c_{b} > w_{i} \\left( {{\\epsilon}_{i} - a} \\right)$$
    (23) This means if SP expects all clients to seek the same amount of reimbursement,
    the expected incremental of SP''s profit (i.e. SP''s utility) from bargaining
    more clients is less than the search cost. Then, the only motive for bargaining
    for more clients would be the possibility of having the remaining clients seeking
    for less amount of reimbursement. The probability of bargaining ith the client
    is computed as follows: $$\\Pr \\left( i \\right) = \\frac{1}{{{\\acute{N}}}}$$
    (24) Given that the ith client accepts an amount of reimbursement \\({ }R^{*}\\).
    Then, it is optimal for SP to use the previous stopping bargaining rule for bargaining
    with an ith client. Hence, the probability that SP accepts ith client''s offer
    is computed as: $$\\Pr \\left( {y > {\\acute{y}}} \\right) = 1 - {\\mathcal{F}}\\left(
    {{\\acute{y}} + \\Delta } \\right)$$ (25) where \\(\\Delta\\) is the standardized
    reimbursement of ith client and it is computed as follows: $$\\Delta = \\frac{{{\\acute{R}}
    - R^{*} }}{{{\\acute{N}}}}$$ (26) where \\({\\acute{R}}\\) denotes the new SP
    offer for compensating the client in-service. The probability of bargaining with
    an ith client first is \\(\\frac{1}{{{\\acute{N}}}}\\), second with probability
    \\(\\frac{{{\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)}}{{{\\acute{N}}}}\\),
    third with probability \\(\\frac{{{\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)}}{alban}\\),
    and so on. SP pays reimbursement for an ith client if it samples all clients and
    the ith client yields the highest profit. The demand of spectrum for SP to serve
    wealthy clients is the sum of the series that represents clients who accept the
    offer of SP. SP’s demand for spectrum is calculated as follows: $$D\\left( {{\\acute{R}},
    R^{*} } \\right) = \\frac{1}{{{\\acute{N}}}}\\left[ {1 - {\\mathcal{F}}\\left(
    {{\\acute{y}} + \\Delta } \\right)} \\right]\\left[ {\\frac{{1 - {\\mathcal{F}}\\left(
    {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)^{{{\\acute{N}}}} }}{{1 - {\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {{\\acute{y}}}
    \\right)}}} \\right] + \\mathop \\smallint \\limits_{ - \\infty }^{{{\\acute{y}}
    + \\Delta }} {\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {{\\epsilon} - y} \\right)^{n} {\\mathcalligra{f}}\\left(
    {\\epsilon} \\right)d{\\epsilon}$$ (27) The derivative of SP''s demand concerning
    \\({\\acute{R}}\\), evaluated at \\({\\acute{R}} = R^{*}\\), is: $$\\frac{{\\partial
    D\\left( {{\\acute{R}},R^{*} } \\right)}}{{\\partial {\\acute{R}}}}\\left( {{\\acute{R}},
    R^{*} } \\right) = \\frac{1}{{w_{i} }}\\left[ { - \\frac{{{\\mathcalligra{f}}\\left(
    {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)}}{{{\\acute{N}}}}\\frac{{1 - {\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {{\\acute{y}}}
    \\right)^{{{\\acute{N}}}} }}{{1 - {\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)}}
    + f\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right) {\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)^{{{\\acute{N}}
    - 1}} - \\mathop \\int \\limits_{ - \\infty }^{{{\\acute{y}}}} \\left( {{\\acute{N}}
    - 1} \\right) {\\mathcalligra{f}}\\left( {\\epsilon} \\right)^{2} {\\mathcal{F}}\\left(
    {\\epsilon} \\right)^{{{\\acute{N}} - 2}} d{\\epsilon} } \\right]$$ (28) The last
    two terms can be written together as \\(\\int_{ - \\infty }^{{{\\acute{y}}}} {\\acute{{\\mathcalligra{f}}}\\left(
    {\\epsilon} \\right) {\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {\\epsilon} \\right)^{{{\\acute{N}}
    - 1}} d{\\epsilon} }\\). Hence, the symmetric equilibrium amount of reimbursement
    is: $$R^{*} = \\frac{{ - D\\left( {{\\acute{R}},R^{*} } \\right) {\\mathcalligra{f}}\\left(
    {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)}}{{\\frac{{\\partial D\\left( {{\\acute{R}},R^{*} } \\right)}}{{\\partial
    {\\acute{R}}}}}} = \\frac{{w_{i} }}{{\\frac{{1 - {\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {{\\acute{y}}}

    }}$$ (29) The first two terms in Eq. 28 in the bracket are negative and can be
    written as follows: $$- \\frac{{f\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)}}{{{\\acute{N}}}}\\frac{{1
    - {\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)^{{{\\acute{N}}}} }}{{1 - {\\mathcal{F}}\\left(

    D\\left( {{\\acute{R}},R^{*} } \\right)}}{{\\partial {\\acute{R}}}}\\left( {{\\acute{R}},
    R^{*} } \\right)\\) is negative and from (29), \\(R^{*}\\) is nonnegative. We
    assume the function \\({\\mathcal{F}}\\) is logarithmically concave which is an
    increasing hazard rate. Proposition The symmetric equilibrium amount of reimbursement
    \\(R^{*}\\) is an increasing function of the bargaining cost if \\(c_{b} < w_{i}
    \\left( {{\\epsilon}_{i} - a} \\right)\\) and the function \\({\\mathcal{F}}\\)
    is logarithmically concave, and a decreasing of the number of clients in-service
    \\({\\acute{N}}\\). Hence, $$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{{c_{b} \\to 0}} R^{*}
    = \\frac{{w_{i} }}{{{\\acute{N}}\\left( {{\\acute{N}} - 1} \\right)\\mathop \\int
    \\nolimits_{ - \\infty }^{\\infty } {\\mathcalligra{f}}\\left( {\\epsilon} \\right)^{2}
    {\\mathcal{F}}\\left( {\\epsilon} \\right)^{2} d{\\epsilon} }}$$ (31) $$\\mathop
    {\\lim }\\limits_{{{\\acute{N}} \\to 0}} R^{*} = \\frac{{w_{i} {\\mathcal{F}}\\left(
    {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)}}{{{\\mathcalligra{f}}\\left( {{\\acute{y}}} \\right)}}$$
    (32) Higher bargaining cost reduces the profit of SP and if the bargaining cost
    is nearly zero, the bargaining game outcome will be close to optimal value if
    SP knows about clients’ information and matches corresponding values. The proposition
    indicates what happens if their sufficient heterogeneity in weights (\\(w_{i}\\))
    assigned to the clients. The limit in Eq. 31 is the equilibrium amount of reimbursement
    and it can be obtained when the bargaining cost goes to zero where clients in-service
    have the same weights. This does not happen in real life, but rather, for large
    cb enough where the threshold value of bargaining cost increases as the weight
    of client in-service increases. This situation never happens if the distribution
    of the amount of reimbursement is unbounded below (i.e. the amount of reimbursement
    is minus infinity). The proposition stresses that the amount of reimbursement
    falls with the number of clients in service. Furthermore, the amount of reimbursement
    is affected by the number of clients in-service. 5 Performance evaluation To assess
    our proposed Greedy Game Theory scheme (GGT), Profit and network throughput are
    taken into account as performance measures to quantify the performance of the
    suggested solution. Quantifying the advantages and effects of the suggested GGT
    strategy on SP''s profit is the goal of this investigation. In the simulation
    experiments, various scenarios are used to observe the performance metrics. Our
    proposed GGT scheme is compared against the benchmark RL [26], and AECCR schemes
    [23]. Comparative experiments were performed using the proposed GGT to analyze
    the following aspects of the system performance: The effect of optimal admission
    on SP’s profit by comparing the reported profit for the three schemes. The effect
    of our proposed scheme on network throughput. In a city setting, nodes are dispersed
    at random over a (200,200) m2 area. Table 2. presents the simulation parameters
    used to evaluate the algorithms and our proposed approach for simulation. Table
    2 Simulation parameters Full size table 5.1 Impact of spectrum demand on the profit
    This section looks into how spectrum demand affects SP''s bottom line. Figure
    2 demonstrates how profit grows as client demand for spectrum does. This figure
    shows that GGT significantly outperforms both the RL scheme and AECCR scheme,
    under various network conditions. Fig. 2 Profit under different values of spectrum
    demand, where λ is the number of requests per second Full size image Specifically,
    Fig. 2 reveals that under low-to-high spectrum demand, the proposed GGT scheme
    generates more profit compared to other schemes. This increment is mainly attributed
    to the dynamic selection of clients who pay more, and hence, increase the reported
    profit significantly. Figure 2 also shows that the profit enhancement is increased
    with higher spectrum demand. This is expected because the larger values of spectrum
    demand increase the likelihood of finding new and better clients to generate more
    profit. The benchmark RL scheme is only interested in selecting the best offers
    and completes executing these requests in-service regardless of the new arrival
    requests with more rewards. To maximize the profit, the GGT scheme prioritizes
    the new richest clients by attempting to evict some clients in-service and compensating
    them. The licensed frequency band is reserved for the primary user (PU) use. Priority
    Access License is SAS''s term for Licensed Shared Access (PAL). SAS introduces
    a third layer for unlicensed opportunistic spectrum access with General Authorized
    Access, replacing LSA''s exclusion of opportunistic access if persistent protection
    is not given (GAA). Users of PAL are protected from GAA tier interference, but
    not from that of the incumbents. The main concern of the AECCR scheme is protecting
    primary users (PUs) so it enforces clients to release channels upon the Pu''s
    return. The SP is not receiving any reward when SP starts accessing the spectrum.
    Clearly, with the increase in PU’s activities, the reported profit for SP gracefully
    degrades. Our GGT scheme generated the highest profit because it adapts to the
    system state in terms of offered spectrum prices. Adaptation should occur while
    clients are served to maximize SP profit. To show the dynamic behavior of the
    GGT scheme in selecting wealthy clients, we compare the average leasing prices
    for three schemes in Fig. 3. Note that the GGT scheme had the highest collected
    average spectrum price among all remaining schemes. This is anticipated as this
    scheme leases spectrum for the richest clients as much as possible. Furthermore,
    Fig. 3 reveals that under high spectrum demand, the proposed GGT scheme increases
    spectrum prices by up to 60% compared to the AECCR scheme. Figure 4 illustrates
    the throughput performance under different loads (i.e. spectrum demand) for the
    three schemes. The result shows that both GGT and RL schemes significantly outperform
    the AECCR scheme, irrespective of the various network conditions. Specifically,
    Fig. 4 reveals that the throughput enhancement is larger under moderate-to-high
    spectrum demand than the low demand of spectrum for both GGT and RL schemes. However,
    the performance of AECCR is degraded significantly due to primary users (PUs)
    activities. PUs are served immediately and clients are evicted to release their
    spectrum for PUs. The performance of the AECCR scheme is the worst, due to the
    limited number of available channels that are used to serve clients. Fig. 3 Average
    spectrum price under different values of spectrum demand Full size image Fig.
    4 Throughput performance under different values of spectrum demand Full size image
    Figure 5 shows the acceptance rate for clients'' requests under different values
    of spectrum demand for the three schemes. The acceptance rate decreases for all
    schemes as the traffic load becomes higher due to the limited size of the spectrum.
    Moreover, Fig. 5 shows that the proposed method met the demands for most spectrum
    requests and outperformed other schemes. This is anticipated as this scheme vacates
    some requests and compensates them. These requests are classified as served since
    they accessed the spectrum and received reimbursement. This proves the efficiency
    of our proposed scheme and highlights how important it is to make efficient management
    and resource-tuning decisions in the spectrum market. Fig. 5 Requests acceptance
    rate under different values of spectrum demand, where λ is the number of requests
    per second Full size image 5.2 Impact of spectrum demand on eviction cost In this
    part, we investigate the ability of our proposed scheme to exploit the status
    of service demand to select clients for eviction, an omitted issue in existing
    studies. Figure 6 reveals that under different service demands, moderate and high
    levels of spectrum demand, the proposed scheme selects clients who accept the
    lowest amount of reimbursement resulting in reducing the cost of eviction significantly.
    Furthermore, Fig. 6 indicates that as the spectrum demand increases the likelihood
    of finding clients with the lowest eviction cost increases. We investigate the
    impact of bargaining costs on the amount of reimbursement. Fig. 6 Eviction cost
    under different values of spectrum demand, where λ is the number of requests per
    second Full size image Figure 7 demonstrates that the amount of reimbursement
    is smaller at larger bargaining costs due to the increasing number of clients
    that the SP negotiates with. The more clients the SP needs to negotiate with,
    the more options the SP has to offer. In other words, the greater the options
    for SP to reduce the amount of reimbursement, the better chances of closing the
    deal with clients. We report in Fig. 8 the amount of reimbursement under different
    clients’ satisfaction levels. It is worth noting that reimbursement decreases
    at lower satisfaction levels. This is because as the satisfaction levels decrease,
    the QoS requirement becomes stricter so that more in-service clients may reject
    the release spectrum with a lower amount of reimbursement. Thus, the SP increases
    the amount of reimbursement to motivate them for vacating channels. By contrast,
    as the satisfaction level increases, the QoS requirement becomes less strict so
    that more clients accept a lower amount of reimbursement. Fig. 7 Amount of reimbursement
    as a function of bargaining cost Full size image Fig. 8 Client’s satisfaction
    level as a function of the amount of reimbursement Full size image Finally, we
    report in Fig. 9 the amount of reimbursement under different values of clients''
    budgets. Note that if an SP does not offer a suitable amount of reimbursement,
    clients may not release the spectrum. The results show that owning more cash,
    makes clients stop their cravings for reimbursement. Hence, the SP should increase
    the amount of reimbursement to motivate wealthy clients to release the spectrum
    (as shown in Fig. 9). Fig. 9 Client''s budget as a function of the amount of reimbursement

    model is proposed for the dynamic spectrum market in this work. Profit and network
    throughput are considered performance measures to quantify the performance of
    the suggested solution in our proposed Greedy Game Theory scheme (GGT). Further,
    our model exploits the varying charging prices among the submitted requests and
    decides where to place the spectrum and how to prioritize profitable clients.
    Besides, the proposed method shows increased SP profits significantly by optimal
    admission for clients'' requests, considering the collected profits in its allocation
    decisions when compared with the existing RL and AECCR schemes, because the benchmark
    RL scheme is only interested in selecting the best offers and completes executing
    these requests in-service regardless of the new arrival requests with more rewards
    and the main concern of the AECCR scheme is protecting primary users (PUs) so
    it enforces clients to release channels upon PUs return. In future work, an interesting
    direction to pursue is cooperating with other SPs for optimal admission of spectrum
    requests. Managing the spectrum becomes more complex in this case as the SP needs
    to consider the interaction and relations among the different SPs. We will also
    use machine learning and integrate fuzzy-logic and game theory-based optimization
    [34] using deep, and reinforcement learning [35], as well as possible cognitive
    control-theoretic elasticity, approaches [36]. Finally, we intend to test our
    proposed schemes in real-time systems. Data availability All data generated or

  description: 'With the increase in user demand for internet access on move, spectrum
    resource seems to deplete and leads to spectrum crunch. Recent researches reports
    that this spectrum crunch is not due to spectrum scarcity but due to spectrum
    underutilization because of legacy static spectrum allocation of spectrum bands.
    This spectrum utilization and efficiency can be improved by using Dynamic Spectrum
    Access (DSA) techniques, which correlate with cognitive radio technology in one
    way or the other. There are three basic approach of communication for cognitive
    radio technology: Inter-weaved approach, Underlay approach and Overlay approach.
    Extensive researches has been proposed so far based on the inter-weaved approach
    and little or negligible using underlay or overlay approach. Using these modes
    the cognitive users can coexist with the primary users at same geographic time
    and location. In this paper simple and unique Adaptive Power Control (APC) technique
    for underlay approach for cognitive radio mobile network is proposed. This techniques
    introduces a Power Adaptive Transmission (PAT) metric which overcomes three major
    issues. Firstly, this proposed techniques work efficiently over highly active
    licensed networks with marginal increased throughput of 0.2 Mbps. Secondly, APC
    this technique adapts to the requirement of cognitive user and Lastly, primary
    user power is monitored, to prevent interference and maintain the Quality of Service
    (QoS) of primary user. Under simulation testing the proposed APC technique outperforms
    various other underlay as well hybrid techniques for power control under cognitive
    radio environment with 11% increase in throughput and 32% decrease in delay using
    APC.'

    in user demand for internet access on move, spectrum resource seems to deplete
    and leads to spectrum crunch. Recent researches reports that this spectrum crunch
    is not due to spectrum scarcity but due to spectrum underutilization because of
    legacy static spectrum allocation of spectrum bands. This spectrum utilization
    and efficiency can be improved by using Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) techniques,
    which correlate with cognitive radio technology in one way or the other. There
    are three basic approach of communication for cognitive radio technology: Inter-weaved
    approach, Underlay approach and Overlay approach. Extensive researches has been
    proposed so far based on the inter-weaved approach and little or negligible using
    underlay or overlay approach. Using these modes the cognitive users can coexist
    with the primary users at same geographic time and location. In this paper simple
    and unique Adaptive Power Control (APC) technique for underlay approach for cognitive
    radio mobile network is proposed. This techniques introduces a Power Adaptive
    Transmission (PAT) metric which overcomes three major issues. Firstly, this proposed
    techniques work efficiently over highly active licensed networks with marginal
    increased throughput of 0.2 Mbps. Secondly, APC this technique adapts to the requirement
    of cognitive user and Lastly, primary user power is monitored, to prevent interference
    and maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) of primary user. Under simulation testing
    the proposed APC technique outperforms various other underlay as well hybrid techniques
    for power control under cognitive radio environment with 11% increase in throughput
    and 32% decrease in delay using APC. Similar content being viewed by others A

    Networks Article 21 July 2016 1 Introduction Due to the rapid expansion of wireless
    communication over the last few decades, tremendous research is going on in the
    development of certain techniques which provide improved utilization of depleting
    spectrum resources. Wireless spectrum now a days is considered to be scarce resource,
    inadequate enough to fulfil the required demand of the increasing users which
    leads to spectrum crunch. Recent research reports reviels that the spectrum crunch
    is not due spectrum scarcity but due to spectrum underutilization. The spectrum
    under-utilization is because of legacy static spectrum allocation techniques [1].
    In the legacy static spectrum allocation policy, a specific section of the spectrum
    is entirely reserved for a particular type of wireless communication technology.
    In these cases for a particular geometric location and time, all the allocated
    spectrum is not utilized by the licensed user, which introduces the problem of
    spectrum wastage or spectrum under-utilization [2]. According to various reports
    based on surveys, practically over 70% of the traditional allocated spectrum remains
    unutilized over the peak time and approximately 90% over the average time [3].
    Hence, the study concludes that spectrum scarcity has arisen due to spectrum under-utilization.
    To overcome such an issue Cognitive Radio (CR) technology has emerged out as an
    efficient solution based on Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) techniques [4]. Cognitive
    Radio technology allows the non licensed users to opportunistically access the
    licensed spectrum band in the absence of licensed users. The non licensed users
    are referred as Secondary Users (SU) or Cognitive Users (CU), whereas licensed
    users are considered as Primary Users (PU). Based on the various methods in which
    primary spectrum can be utilized by the cognitive users, the CR technology is
    categorised into three approaches i.e. Inter-weave approach, Underlay approach
    and Overlay approach. These three approaches are based on the different methods
    of implementation of DSA techniques for CR technologies. In all these approaches
    secondary user access the licensed channels without interfering the primary users
    [5]. In the interweave approach the cognitive users sense the spectrum holes or
    vacant spectrum band from the available primary spectrum band. The unused spectrum
    bands by the primary users are considered as spectrum holes, also referred as
    spectrum white spaces or TV-White Space (TV-WS) under spectrum range from 54 to
    862 MHz. The cognitive user that wants to initiate the communication, senses the
    spectrum holes and forward the required data packets to the receiving destination
    node over the sensed idle channels. The working of this whole interweave approach
    is divided into four steps: Spectrum Sensing, Spectrum Management, Spectrum Sharing
    and Spectrum Mobility [4]. During the spectrum sensing phase the cognitive or
    secondary user finds the spectrum holes from the licensed spectrum band. Under
    spectrum management best channel as well as the best relay node to send the data
    to the destination node is identified. In spectrum sharing the actual allocation
    of primary band is given to the desired cognitive user. Whereas in spectrum mobility,
    the spectrum bands which are used by cognitive user in spectrum sharing phase
    is accessed by the designated primary user. Further the cognitive users are required
    to shift to another sensed idle channel for an uninterrupted data transmission
    to take place. This Inter-weave approach performs efficiently for the networks
    where primary user activities are lower but fails with higher primary user activities.
    For such networks scenarios underlay or overlay approach performs more efficiently
    as compared to interweave approach [4] (Table 1). Table 1 Symbols and notations
    used in proposer APC Full size table In underlay approach the cognitive users
    and primary users can communicate concurrently. The transmission of primary user
    are separated from the transmissions of the Cognitive users by setting an interference
    threshold [6]. The interference generated during the cognitive users communication
    should not jump over the specified interference threshold. This interference threshold
    is decided by the Primary User Receiver (PU-Rx). The limitation of this interference
    threshold is that it narrows the range of communication for the cognitive users.
    So, to increase the transmission range of cognitive users, an intermediate relay
    nodes are used [7]. The other limitation of underlay approach is that only cognitive
    users are aided as this approach does not benefits licensed users. Under overlay
    approach, the cognitive user node behaves like a relay node, which transfers the
    information from primary transmitter to primary receiver. During this information
    transfer a portion of the primary user transmission power is utilized to transmit
    primary information and the left over transmission power is utilized by the relay
    secondary user to transmit the secondary information. This approach is immune
    from the interference generated by the secondary users. Under this approach both
    the primary users and secondary users can transmit information simultaneously
    with preference to primary users [8]. In this technique both the primary user
    and secondary user are benefited but makes the overall system complex. In this
    paper simple and unique Adaptive Power Control (APC) technique for underlay approach
    is proposed for cognitive radio mobile network. This is based on new metric called
    as Power Adaptive Transmission (PAT) metric. This proposed technique works efficiently
    over highly active licensed networks with marginal increased throughput of 0.2
    Mbps. Moreover, APC it adapts to the requirement of secondary user and monitors
    the primary user transmission power to avoid interference. Thus it maintain the
    Quality of Service (QoS) for primary user as well as secondary user. Simulation
    testing proves that the proposed APC technique is more efficient for controlling
    power in cognitive radio environment. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    In Sect. 2, Research Gaps are discussed, illustrating the few of the most followed
    research based on underlay and overlay approach. In Sect. 3, the working of the
    complete System Model is discussed, highlighting three major steps: Secondary
    User Demand in Sect. 3.1, Transmission Power of Primary User in Sect. 3.2 and
    Secondary User Power Adaptation in Sect. 3.3. Numerical Analysis under Sect. 4.1,
    Simulation Environment under Sect. 4.2 and Simulation Results under Sect. 4.3
    are elaborated under the Sect. 4, Performance Evaluation. In Sect. 5, conclusions
    are discussed. 2 Research Gaps Various power control techniques proposed have
    been studied based on underlay or overlay approach or based on the hybrid use
    of both these techniques. A general comparison table for the same is illustrated
    in Table 2. Some of the important research works [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,57]
    have been discussed below. Table 2 Comparison of different models of cognitive
    radio network Full size table Dall’Anese et al. [9] developed CR power allocation
    algorithms for the problem of small scale fading and shadowing under cognitive
    radio network and primary user channel gain uncertainty. Various types of models
    like Fenton-Wilkison [58] for received interference power at primary user and
    Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) solution [59] for non-convexity issue for successive
    convex approximation technique has been developed which solves these issues efficiently.
    The paper also discusses about the uncertain cognitive radio to cognitive radio
    channel cases by introducing Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR). Durowoju
    et al. [11] modelled power controlled technique, protecting the primary user based
    on spectrum use for cognitive radio network for ad-hoc as well as fixed Cognitive
    Radio Networks (CRNs) using spectrum sensing. This model is designed for time
    invariant systems maintaining QoS for both CUs and interference constraints of
    PUs. Talay et al. [13] proposed RAC: Range Adaptive Cognitive radio network based
    on routing mechanism for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Networks (CRAHNs), maintaining
    QoS of both PUs as well as SUs. This proposed technique is compared with SORP
    [60] and STOD-RP [61] showing improved performance over the both in terms of improved
    throughput and reduces data delivery latency. Sanchez et al. [15], investigated
    the impact of joint rate and power control over the performance of CRAHN using
    overlay mode. The power control of SU is controlled to adjust multiple SU’s over
    the given channel based on two control strategies i.e Rate-Efficient Power Control
    (RE-PC) for increasing SU capacity and Energy-Efficient Power Control (EE-PC)
    for increasing energy efficiency. Zou et al. [19] tried to solve the problem of
    power allocation for relay-assisted cognitive communication on the bases of hybrid
    technique based on the combination of underlay and overlay approach. The network
    considered for this scenario is multi-radio CRNs. However this approach suffers
    from the assumption of perfect sensing as well as no efforts are made to eliminate
    interference between primary and secondary user. Parsaeefard et al. [20] developed
    distributed uplink power allocation algorithm for underlay CRNs. This proposal
    solved the problem of channel gain uncertainty where the interference caused by
    PU’s to the SU’s base station are uncertain. All the simulation testing is performed
    considering the worst case scenario. The tabulated description for major proposed
    techniques is illustrated under the Table 3. Table 3 Different power control techniques
    proposed for cognitive radio Full size table Wang et al. [21] developed hybrid
    overlay and underlay model for statistical QoS guaranteed cognitive radio network.
    A detailed overview about the impacts of delay QoS is also performed. In an other
    research Xu et al. [24] analysed robust power control problem for spectrum underlay
    CRN having diverse number of primary and secondary users under channel uncertainty.
    The prime objective is to reduce the overall transmission power of secondary user
    and maintaining both interference temperature of primary and SINR of secondary
    user. Tang et al. [25] proposed a unique solution to solve the problem of power
    control for underlay CRNs, each equipped with Full-Duplex transmissions. Author
    guarantee to maintain static QoS in term of fixed SINR for each CU. This proposal
    is based on Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller. In addition to
    this a hybrid scheme having the capability to switch between Half-Duplex (HD)
    and Full-Duplex (FD) mode is also proposed. Bradai et al. [34] proposed EMCOS:
    Energy efficient Mechanism for Multimedia Streaming over Cognitive radio Sensor
    networks as a video streaming solution using combination of Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN) and Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). This proposed solution provide improved
    multimedia transmission under channel uncertainty conditions along with energy
    efficiency outperforming other competing researches like SCEEM [28] and SEARCH
    [62]. Ewaisha et al. [37] proposes two policies of power allocation and dynamic
    scheduling which produces minimum delay and at the same time promises improved
    efficiency based on Lyapunov optimization technique. This proposal work extremely
    well for an instantaneous as well as long term interference constraints. This
    proposed solution is dependent on Lyapunov technique. Preetham et al. [39] proposed
    hybrid underlay and overlay approach for spectrum sharing. This approach have
    uniqueness, as the main objective of the proposed technique is increase PU capacity
    by preventing unwanted interference with other active PUs. In addition, this approach
    also holds-off unnecessary switching between overlay and underlay mode as in other
    existing hybrid approach providing resource allocation to the best suited secondary
    node as relay node and best channel for the selected secondary node. Sagar et
    al. [43] presented an ideal for the solution of co-channel interference which
    arises due to same frequency band of both femto-cell (HeNB indoor BTS) and macro-cell
    (eNB outdoor BTS). This paper introduces cognitive femto-cell exploitation in
    the control channel information with location information for the downlink as
    future evolution of femto-cell networks for Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks.
    Soleimanpour et al. [47], developed Multi Objective Optimisation (MOO) technique
    built over amplify and forward relaying technique, improvising the two main issues
    simultaneously i.e enhances data rates and limits the Total Transmission Power
    (TTP). Kalabarige et al. [48] introduces energy efficient routing protocol having
    capability of adaptive power transmission named Reactive Energy Efficient routing
    protocol with Differentiated Services (REEDS) for static CRNs. This protocol have
    the capability of prediction and dodging of nodes and at the same time maintains
    QoS for both primary as well as secondary user. Lavanya et al. [49], developed
    cross layer opportunistic routing protocol for ad-hoc CRNs, having properties
    of Network layers as opportunistic data transmission, Media Access Control (MAC)
    layers as opportunistic link discovery and Physical layer as spectrum sensing.
    The best path is formed based on opportunistic link discovery having paramount
    Spectrum Opportunity (SOP) for every path-hop giving the best probability of delivery.
    Tahir et al. [51] proposed an improved sensing technique in cognitive radio networks
    by forming coalitions among cognitive radio users under fading channel. Majumder
    et al. [63] designed robust non-linear congestion controller based on event-triggered
    sliding mode for Cognitive Radio Networks with the motive to maintain desired
    QoS with optimum bandwidth and resource utilization. Askari et al. [56] worked
    on minimization of error in estimation of Channel State Information(CSI) and also
    provided solution to the robust beam-forming in cognitive radio network to enhance
    minimum achievable rates for unlicensed users. Sharma et al. [55] analysed the
    performance of a dual hop cognitive radio underlay network employing a decode
    and forward relay under the fading channels modelled using extended generalized-K
    fading statistics. Kumar et al. [54] proposed novel edge detection algorithms
    based on Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
    techniques, applied on wide-band power spectrum. Under this technique logarithmic
    scaling preceded by a thresholding is performed on the CWT coefficients to enhance
    the small modulus maxima values at the edges, resulting in better detection probability.
    Mamidi et al. [53] proposed the cooperative spectrum sensing network in which
    each cognitive radio is equipped with multiple antennas and an improved energy
    detector (IED) technique is considered as detection scheme. Chaudhari et al. [64]
    developed a strategy based on dynamics transmit power control schemes to maximize
    data rate for cognitive users and simultaneously reducing the licensed used interference
    leakage below threshold. Gu et al. [65] designed two transmit power techniques
    for cognitive machine-to-machine (M2M)devices where minimum level of QoS is guaranteed.
    Zhuang et al. [66] proposed an optimization technique for underlay cognitive radio
    networks restricted to Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) claiming maximized
    throughput compared to other baseline technologies. Diab et al. [67] surveyed
    over the existing routing protocols for cognitive radio, based on two essential
    parameters energy consumption and packet delay. Tayel et al. [68] developed hybrid
    Energy Harvesting model based on underlay and interweaved channel access mode
    for multi-class CRN. The proposed hybrid model claimed to have increased throughput
    due to increased channel utilization and decreased system complexity however they
    packet delay is not analysed. In the next Sect. 3, System Model for the proposed
    Adaptive Power Control (APC) technique based on Power Adaptive Transmission (PAT)
    metric, which overcomes the limitation of complexity and improved efficiency in
    term of both reduced delays and enhanced throughput. 3 System Model Any design
    related to cognitive radio ad-hoc networks has to fulfil the requirements of both
    ad-hoc and cognitive radio networks. Adaptive Power Control (APC) is designed
    as an efficient model using very unique yet simple approach for controlling transmission
    power of secondary user. The proposed approach is hybrid of overlay and underlay
    approach having power control mechanism based on underlay approach and relay node
    selection based on overlay approach. The basic architecture of designed internal
    System Model is shown in Fig. 1. The architecture illustrates the two major requirements
    of CRAHN based on combination of CRN’s and ad-hoc Networks. Adaptive Power Control
    mechanism is based on dynamic spectrum access techniques in which Traffic and
    Interference Information over Channel (TIIC) and Transmission Power and Channel
    Selection (TPCS) is exchanged between MAC and Physical layer of the cognitive
    radio architecture. An additional metric is introduced as Power Adaptive Transmission
    (PAT) metric which is used to support the working of APC. The PAT metric prevents
    primary user interference with adjacent primary and secondary users as well as
    preserves Quality of Service. As the network is considered to be ad-hoc CRN, wireless
    node is set to be mobile and having dynamic network topology. Common Control Channel
    (CCC) is also one of the typical feature of ad-hoc networks, using which the engaged
    wireless nodes shares the basic control signals such as Route REQuest (RREQ),
    Route REPlay (RREP) and Route ERRor (RERR). However, in CRAHN having heterogeneous
    radios and each radio environment is incorporated with multiple channels uncertainty,
    the ideology of considering one or more wholly committed control channels seems
    impractical. So, to overcome such an issue no dedicated CCC is used in this system
    model. After every spectrum sensing by the individual SU, broadcasting of the
    control signals is made by each SU over all sensed vacant channels. Therefore,
    every vacant channel acts as control channel for sharing control signals as well
    as sensed spectrum details. This sharing of sensed information increases the overall
    performance of the network in case of cooperative spectrum sensing [31, 52]. All
    the links between the wireless node is considered to be bi-directional, each node
    is equipped with two interfaces, one tuned to receive data from one channels and
    other to transmit data over another channel, following the channel diverse technique,
    discussed in detail [57]. APC accomplish this feature by empowering each secondary
    user to modify their transmission power based on PAT metric value. PAT metric
    adjust its value based on demand of secondary user and sensed transmission power
    of primary user as shown in Fig. 2. The working of PAT metric is discussed in
    detail later in this Sects. 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Fig. 1 Architecture of system model
    Full size image Fig. 2 Power adaptive transmission (PAT) metric Full size image
    As discussed earlier, APC is built on top of Cognitive radio ROuting Protocol
    (CROP) [57], one of the efficient routing protocols developed for cognitive radio
    ad-hoc networks. APC adapts its transmission power to transmit data packets over
    the desired channel after matching spectrum sensing value and demand of secondary
    user. The working of the proposed APC approach is described in three major steps
    highlighted as follows:- 1. Secondary User Demand 2. Transmission Power of Primary
    User 3. Secondary User Power Adaptation 3.1 Secondary User Demand Initially in
    APC, the user request for channel for a certain application. The classification
    of secondary user demand or requirement is made on the basis of characteristics
    like, connection type, packet payload and so on.Based on this classification the
    PAT metric value is determined with four possible values for application classification:
    0 (zero), 1 (one), 2 (two) and 3 (three). High secondary user demand is allot
    to the value 0, medium secondary user demand is allot to the value 1 and low secondary
    user demand is allot to the value 2. The value 3 states that no secondary user
    have any application request or there is no data available by the secondary user
    for transmission. There are 4 possible values for SU demand PAT metrics: 0 (zero)
    to 3 (three), therefore total of 2 bits will be required by PAT metric indexed
    as \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_0\\) as shown in Fig. 2 indicating \\(S_1\\) as the Most
    Significant Bit (MSB) and \\(S_0\\) as the Least Significant Bit (LSB). The value
    of \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_0\\) according to the 0 (zero), 1 (one), 2 (two) and 3 (three)
    will be 00, 01, 10 and 11 respectively. The percentage range fixed for all four
    values is 75–100% for 0(zero) i.e. for high SU requirement, 50–75% for 1(one)
    i.e. for medium SU requirement, 25–50% for 2(two) i.e. for low SU requirement
    and 0–25% for 3(three) i.e. when SU have no requirement for the channel (no data
    for transmission). With increase in the percentage value, leads to increase in
    transmission power which further increases range of communication as well as data
    rates at an expense of high interference as illustrated in Table 4. Table 4 Power
    adaptive transmission (PAT) according to secondary user requirement Full size
    table After collecting the requirement of the SU, Channel State Information (CSI)
    needs to be sensed by the PAT metric so that collectively decision can be made
    according to the adjustment of secondary user transmission power. In the next
    Sect. 3.2, transmission power of the primary user is sensed by the PAT metric.
    3.2 Transmission Power of Primary User As already discussed PAT metric is dependent
    on PU transmission power over particular channel and SU’s demand based on requirement.
    The PAT metric classify the sensed transmission power of the PU into four possible
    values 0 (zero), 1 (one), 2 (two) and 3 (three). Value 0 indicates as no sensed
    PU power over the channel, value 1 indicates low PU transmission power over the
    channel, value 2 indicates medium PU transmission power over the channel whereas
    value 3 indicates high PU transmission power over the channel. In the similar
    fashion as there are four possible values for the PAT primary user sensed metrics:
    0 (zero) to 3 (three), therefore total of 2 bits are required by the PAT metric
    indexed as \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_0\\) as shown in Fig. 2 indicating \\(P_1\\) as
    the MSB and \\(P_0\\) as the LSB. The value of \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_0\\) for 0 (zero),
    1 (one), 2 (two) and 3 (three) are represented as 00, 01, 10 and 11 respectively.
    The percentage range value for all four values are fixed to 75–100% for 3(three)
    i.e. for high PU transmission power, 50–75% for 2(two) i.e. for medium PU transmission
    power, 25–50% for 1(one) i.e. for low PU transmission power and 0–25% for 0(zero)
    i.e. when no PU is communicating over the channel (channel is sensed idle). The
    increase in the percentage value, leads to increase in transmission power. And
    when the transmission power of primary user is increased, results in decreased
    transmission power of secondary user, which further reduces the data rates of
    Secondary User over the channel as illustrated in Table 5. Table 5 Power adaptive
    transmission (PAT) according to primary user activity Full size table 3.3 Secondary
    User Power Adaptation Decision making based on the secondary user requirement
    given in Sect. 3.1 and spectrum sensing given in Sect. 3.2 is performed in this
    section. As discussed earlier PAT metric have dual function as shown in Fig. 2.
    The matching of both the PAT metrics \\(P_n\\) and \\(S_n\\) that is \\(P_1\\)
    and \\(P_0\\) for primary user transmission power \\(P_n\\) and \\(S_1\\) and
    \\(S_0\\) for secondary user channels requirement is done is such a way that 0
    (zero) PAT value of SU requirement corresponds to 0 (zero) PAT value for PU transmission
    power i.e. High SU requirement corresponds to No PU transmission power. Similarly,
    1 (one) PAT value of SU requirement corresponds to 1 (one) PAT value for PU transmission
    power i.e. Medium SU requirement corresponds to Low PU transmission power. 2 (two)
    PAT value of SU requirement corresponds to 2 (two) PAT value for PU transmission
    power i.e. Low SU requirement corresponds to Medium PU transmission power. Lastly,
    3 (three) PAT value of SU requirement corresponds to 3 (three) PAT value for PU
    transmission power i.e. Nil SU requirement corresponds to High PU transmission
    power. The percentage transmission power of SU is adjusted according to the above
    matched PAT metric value. Under PAT value 3 (three), i.e. High PU transmission
    power over the channel, there will be No transmission made by the SU over that
    particular channel as shown in the Table 6. Under PAT value 2 (two), i.e. Medium
    PU transmission power over the channel, there will be Low transmission made by
    the SU over that particular channel i.e. SU percentage transmission power varies
    between 25–50%. For PAT value 1 (one), i.e. Low PU transmission power over the
    channel, there will be Medium transmission made by the SU over that particular
    channel i.e. SU percentage transmission power varies between 50 and 75%. For PAT
    value 0 (zero), i.e. No PU transmission power over the channel, there will be
    High transmission made by the SU over that particular channel i.e. SU can transmit
    using maximum transmission power between 75 and 100%. Table 6 Decision making
    according to spectrum sensing and requirement Full size table This secondary user
    power adaptation techniques solves the problem of interference constraint of the
    Primary User and at the same instant maintain QoS for SU. The Proposed APC technique
    based on PAT metric provide a simple yet unique idea to model cognitive radio
    ad-hoc network for underlay mode of communication. The node starts the process
    of route discovery immediately after the PAT metric value is determined, discussed
    in detail in paper [57]. The PAT metric value is transmitted with a buffer of
    two bits, which is reserved for RREQ or RREP along with RERR packets. APC has
    some considerable advantages. The Proposed techniques utilizes one new PAT metric
    to achieve two goals, application requirement and channel condition representation
    based on sensed primary user transmission power, without adding any additional
    routing overhead. This new PAT metric is infused in the reserved bit field of
    Weighted Cumulative Expected Transmission Time (WCETT) control packet format [57].
    Moreover, dedicated common control channel is not required in the proposed APC,
    therefore the primary users are not subdued to use their primary channels and
    secondary user are free from the methodological management of common control channel.
    In the Proposed APC spectrum sensing, is performed only after the source node
    gets RREP, thereby making the spectrum sensing process more reliable and real-time.
    The APC technique is capable of avoiding primary users interference, while maintaining
    significant Quality of Service for the secondary users. 4 Performance Evaluation
    4.1 Numerical Power Calculation Basic cognitive radio system model consists of
    two types of users i.e. Primary/Licensed User and Secondary/Cognitive User. Cognitive
    users are further categorised as active and idle cognitive users. In the system
    model total of ‘X’ active and ‘Y’ idle secondary users are considered in cognitive
    radio network as shown in Fig. 3. The selection of path between the Primary Transmitter
    \\(P_{Tx}\\) and Primary Receiver \\(P_{Rx}\\) can either be the direct path or
    a relayed path, shown as black line and red line respectively in Fig. 3. Direct
    path is selected, if the \\(P_{Rx}\\) falls within the transmission range of \\(P_{Tx}\\)
    and the required transmission rate over the direct link is within the computed
    target rate \\(R_{t}\\). If any of the above two condition is not fulfilled, Relay
    path is selected. In the proposed system model only the vacant secondary users
    engage towards the formation of relay path, while active secondary users does
    not participate. Therefore, the interference is restricted to only active cognitive
    users. Out of ‘Y’ idle cognitive users a batch of best relay cognitive users are
    selected to form the best relay path for relaying data between \\(P_{Tx}\\) and
    \\(P_{Rx}\\). The active secondary transmitter from the idle \\(SU_i\\) \\((i
    = 1, 2, \\ldots Y)\\), Secondary user transmit data to their respective destination.
    At the same time idle cognitive users are involved in relay path selection procedure,
    which introduce interference to the vacant cognitive users and primary receiver,
    represented by dotted line in Fig. 3. Total of ‘K’ channels are considered to
    be available as vacant secondary users to act as primary receiver. From these
    ‘K’ channels and ‘Y’ idle secondary users the best combination of relay and channel
    needs to be selected for provide high data rate and minimum interference to the
    licensed users. This channel selection is based on the CR-i-MAC approach discussed
    in detail in [44]. In the normal underlay model the data transmission is done
    between the secondary users under the defined interference threshold limit. In
    the overlay network the primary user depends upon the cognitive users to relay
    over their data. Therefore, in the proposed hybrid model, overlay approach is
    used for relayed path selection and underlay approach is used for controlling
    the transmission power to avoid the interference with the primary user. Two types
    of relay protocols can be used for relaying data: (i) amplify and forward and
    (ii) decode and forward protocol. In the system model decode and forward protocol
    is used for relaying data, which provide improved efficiency. Fig. 3 Relay selection
    in system model Full size image In this on demand relay selection is used in which
    the \\(P_{Tx}\\) forwards the data to the all secondary users presents within
    the range of the transmitter and then selects the best relay. Consider that the
    channels over links \\(P_{Tx} \\rightarrow P_{Rx}\\), \\(P_{Tx} \\rightarrow SU_i\\),
    \\(SU_i \\rightarrow P_{Rx}\\), \\(P_{Tx} \\rightarrow SU_j\\) and \\(SU_j \\rightarrow
    P_{Rx}\\) are subject to Rayleigh flat fading in addition to Additive White Gaussian
    Noise (AWGN) which every node is coupled with a single antenna along with half
    duplex radio system. Assume, the transmit power of primary transmitter and secondary
    transmitter are \\(P_{P_{Tx}}\\) and \\(P_{S_{Tx}}\\) respectively and noise is
    included in the interference [69]. The conceptual method for selection of the
    best channel and best relay in the hybrid APC model is calculated as under taking
    into account the power of Primary User Transmitter \\(P_{P_{Tx}}\\), the interference
    threshold, spectral distances of the primary user and secondary user and their
    respective channels. Initially, the primary target rate based on Signal to Interference
    plus Noise Ratio (SINR) whenever the direct link is established between the Primary
    Transmitter \\(P_{Tx}\\) and Primary Receiver \\(P_{Rx}\\). Let, \\(\\alpha _{P_{Tx}
    \\rightarrow P_{Rx}}\\), \\(\\alpha _{P_{Tx} \\rightarrow SU_i}\\), \\(\\alpha
    _{SU_i \\rightarrow P_{Rx}}\\), \\(\\alpha _{P_{Tx} \\rightarrow SU_j}\\) and
    \\(\\alpha _{SU_j \\rightarrow P_{Rx}}\\) be the link gains over the links \\(P_{Tx}
    \\rightarrow P_{Rx}\\), \\(P_{Tx} \\rightarrow SU_i\\), \\(SU_i \\rightarrow P_{Rx}\\),
    \\(P_{Tx} \\rightarrow SU_j\\) and \\(SU_j \\rightarrow P_{Rx}\\) respectively.
    And ‘r’ is the distance dependent path loss factor. However, the received power
    strength \\(P_{P_{Rx}}\\) at the Primary User Receiver \\(P_{Rx}\\) can be interconnected
    to the transmitted power \\(P_{P_{Tx}}\\) by \\(P_{Tx}\\) as:- $$\\begin{aligned}
    P_{P_{Rx}} = \\frac{\\alpha _{P_{Tx} \\rightarrow P_{Rx}} P_{P_{Tx}}}{(d_{P_{Tx}\\rightarrow
    P_{Rx}})^r} \\end{aligned}$$ (1) over here, \\(d_{P_{Tx}\\rightarrow P_{Rx}}\\)
    represents the distance between the \\(P_{Tx}\\) and \\(P_{Rx}\\). Considering
    \\(SU_i\\) are the active secondary users, therefore the interference power strength
    \\(P''_i\\) at the \\(P_{Rx}\\) can be correlated to the transmitted power \\(P_{SU_i}\\)
    by Secondary User \\(SU_i\\) is expressed as:- $$\\begin{aligned} P''_i = \\frac{\\alpha
    _{SU_i \\rightarrow P_{Rx}} P_{SU_i}}{(d_{SU_i \\rightarrow P_{Rx}})^r} \\end{aligned}$$
    (2) where, \\(d_{SU_i \\rightarrow P_{Rx}}\\) be the distance between Secondary
    User \\(SU_i\\) and Primary Receiver \\(P_{Rx}\\). The SINR measure at point \\(P_{Rx}\\)
    over the links \\(P_{Tx} \\rightarrow P_{Rx}\\) can be expressed as:- $$\\begin{aligned}
    SINR_{P_{Tx} \\rightarrow P_{Rx}} = \\frac{P_{P_{Rx}}}{\\sum _{i=1}^M P''_i +
    \\sigma _p^2} \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where, \\(\\sigma _p^2\\) is the variance of
    AWGN on primary transmitter to receiver link. Therefore, the theoretical achievable
    rate \\(R_{t}\\) bits/s/Hz for the links \\(P_{Tx} \\rightarrow P_{Rx}\\) is given
    by:- $$\\begin{aligned} R_t = log_2 (1 + SINR_{P_{Tx} \\rightarrow P_{Rx}}) \\end{aligned}$$
    (4) when one of the vacant cognitive user act as a best relay node to redirect
    the primary data, transmitted power of primary transmitter \\(P_{P_{Tx}}\\) received
    at relay \\(SU_j\\) is:- $$\\begin{aligned} P_{SU_j} = \\frac{\\alpha _{P_{Tx}
    \\rightarrow SU_j} P_{P_{Tx}}}{(d_{P_{Tx} \\rightarrow SU_j})^r} \\end{aligned}$$
    (5) in this case \\(d_{P_{Tx} \\rightarrow SU_j}\\) calculates the distance between
    the primary transmitter and the idle secondary user. The active secondary users
    cause interference to the idle secondary users. This interference power strength
    \\(p''_{ij}\\) at \\(SU_j\\) is expressed as [70]:- $$\\begin{aligned} p''_{ij}
    = \\frac{\\alpha _{SU_i \\rightarrow SU_j} P_{SU_i}}{(d_{SU_i \\rightarrow SU_j})^r}
    \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where \\(p''_{ij}\\) is the interference from user ‘i’ to
    user ‘j’ and \\(d_{SU_i \\rightarrow SU_j}\\) is the distance between the active
    secondary user and the idle secondary user. The primary transmitter sends the
    data to the relays on separate channels. The rate with which the data arrives
    at the idle secondary users is expressed by:- $$\\begin{aligned} R_{P_{Tx},SU_j}
    = \\frac{1}{2} log \\left( 1 + \\frac{P_{SU_j}}{\\sigma _j^2 + \\sum _{i=1}^M
    p''_{ij}} \\right) \\end{aligned}$$ (7) where \\(\\sigma _j^2\\) is the variance
    of AWGN on primary transmitter to idle secondary user’s link. For every relay
    \\(SU_j\\) paired to every sub-carrier ‘k’ calculate the power required to get
    the same rate in source to relay link and relay to destination link. $$\\begin{aligned}
    p_{j,k}^{rate} = \\frac{\\left( 2^{(2R_{P_{Tx},SU_j})} -1 \\right) \\left( \\sigma
    _k^2 + \\sum _{i=1}^M p''_{ij} \\right) \\left( d_{SU_j \\rightarrow P_{Rx} }
    \\right) ^r }{\\alpha _{SU_j \\rightarrow P_{Rx}}} \\end{aligned}$$ (8) where
    \\(d_{SU_j \\rightarrow P_{Rx} }\\) is the distance between idle secondary user
    and the primary user receiver and \\(\\sigma _k^2\\) is the variance of AWGN on
    idle secondary users to primary user receiver link. For every relay ‘j’ and channel
    ‘k’ find the maximum power that can be allocated to each relay:- $$\\begin{aligned}
    p_{j,k}^{max} = \\frac{I_{th}}{\\omega _{j,k}} \\end{aligned}$$ (9) where \\(\\omega
    _{j,k}\\) is the interference factor of the channel and \\(I_{th}\\) is the interference
    threshold. The interference factor \\(\\omega _{j,k}\\) is given by:- $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\omega _{j,k} = \\alpha T_s \\int _{d_k-B/2}^{d_k+B/2} \\left( \\frac{sin \\pi
    f T_s}{\\pi f T_s} \\right) ^2 df \\end{aligned}$$ (10) where \\(\\alpha\\) is
    the gain of the channel, \\(T_s\\) is the sampling time, \\(d_k\\) is the distance
    in frequency between the sub-carrier ‘k’ and the primary user channel, ‘B’ is
    the bandwidth occupied by the primary user channel [71]. Therefore the final power
    allocated to each relay \\(SU_j\\) over the channel ‘k’ is:- $$\\begin{aligned}
    power_{j,k} = min \\left( p_{j,k}^{max}, p_{j,k}^{rate} \\right) \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) The power with which the signal reaches the PU destination is given by:-
    $$\\begin{aligned} power_{j,k}^{des} = \\frac{\\alpha _{SU_j \\rightarrow P_{Rx}}
    power_{j,k}}{(d_{SU_j \\rightarrow P_{Rx}})^r} \\end{aligned}$$ (12) The optimal
    pair (j, k) that has the maximum value of the condition Eq. (14) is the optimal
    relay and channel to relay the data to PU receiver. $$\\begin{aligned} (j^{opt},
    k^{opt}) = arg \\ max (power_{j,k}^{des}) \\end{aligned}$$ (13) The rate with
    which the signal arrives at the PU receiver from the optimal relay and channel
    pair is given by:- $$\\begin{aligned} R_{P_{Rx}} = \\frac{1}{2} log \\left( 1+
    \\frac{power_{j^{opt},k^{opt}}^{des}}{\\sigma _k^2 + \\sum _{i=1}^{M} p''_i} \\right)
    \\end{aligned}$$ (14) If \\(R_{P_{Rx}} > R_{t}\\) or if the primary user channel
    is broken due to severe shadowing or fading then the direct path is neglected
    for transmission and switched to the relayed path. The algorithm for the working
    of proposed APC based on PAT is given in Algorithm 1. 4.2 Simulation Environment
    For the implementation of APC, Cognitive Radio Cognitive Net- work (CRCN) [72]
    patch is used, which is built over the Network Simulator [73]. Most of the modelled
    techniques addressed in literature review are simulated using Network Simulator-2
    (NS-2). Capabilities of the proposed APC is tested under an artificial environment
    created with 9 licensed users and maximum of 108 unlicensed users, deployed over
    the simulated network area of \\(1000 \\times 1000\\) m2. Density of the unlicensed
    users with respect to one licensed user is kept to be maximum of 12 i.e. \\(9
    \\times 12 = 108\\) unlicensed user for 1 licensed user. 6 licensed channels are
    used in simulation environment and sensed vacant channel are used as control channels
    for cooperation and synchronization of unlicensed user. Refer [44, 57] for in
    depth working of hidden node problem, Common Control Channel (CCC) and [31] for
    sensing techniques. Transmission range of the each licensed user is fixed to be
    166 m, thereby covering the whole simulated network area. Random mobility of ‘0–2
    m/s’ is assigned to random nodes with random pause time of ‘0–12 s’. Assumption
    is made that perfect sensing at Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is performed
    i.e. there is no case of Probability of False Alarm \\((P_{fa})\\) and Probability
    of Missed Detection \\((P_{md})\\). The average sensing time is fixed at 0.1 s
    and transmission time to 0.6 s. Various other simulation parameters are indexed
    under Table 7. 3–9 licensed users may be present at any an instance of time. Testing
    of the proposed techniques is based on various parameters like average throughput
    and average end to end delay w.r.t. time, no. of node, application demand and
    primary user activities. As far as the accuracy of the system is concerned average
    simulated value is computed upto 2 decimal values i.e. \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\) of
    second. Monte-Carlo based simulation is performed for 100 random simulation scenarios.
    The average of simulated throughput and delay of all 100 simulation scenario and
    100 values over a second is calculated and plotted. Curve smoothing using GNUPLOT
    is performed to smooth down the curves. Performance of the proposed APC techniques
    is performing and analysed using comparative performance analysis of the system
    model with APC as well as without APC technique. Table 7 Simulation parameters
    for APC Full size table 4.3 Simulation Results The performance of proposed APC
    techniques is evaluated and analysed extensive under several critical conditions.
    Comparative performance of the proposed techniques is tested under using APC techniques
    and without using APC. Efforts are made to analyse the proposed technique to compute
    the throughput with respect to the transmitting and receiving rate (normalised
    to bandwidth) as calculated in [14] according to varying SINR. As the proposed
    technique is designed based on requirement of secondary users, activity of primary
    user and density of the network. So, simulation is repeated by simulative the
    network environment for three different cases. Case 1:, for average throughput
    and end-to-end delay analysis according to the density of the secondary users
    according to the primary user. Addressed as average throughput and end to end
    delay vs. number of nodes with and without APC. Case 2:, for average throughput
    and end-to-end delay analysis according to the requirement demand of the secondary
    users. Addressed as average throughput and end to end delay vs. Application Load
    with and without APC. Case 3:, for average throughput and end-to-end delay analysis
    according to the activity of the primary user. Addressed as average throughput
    and end to end delay vs. primary user activity with and without APC. The average
    throughput as well as the end-to-end delay is also calculated and plotted vs.
    simulation time with and without APC. In the end, average throughput and end-to-end
    delay vs. simulation time is also analysed and graphed according to the tunable
    parameters ‘\\(\\alpha\\)’, where \\(\\alpha\\) varies between 0 and 1. Lower
    values of ‘\\(\\alpha\\)’ represents low transmission power and high values represents
    high transmission power. Higher the value of \\(\\alpha\\) higher will be the
    throughput and high interference with the primary user. The sum of sensing time
    and transmission time is considered as the actual time required to transmit packet
    from source to destination node. Calculation of throughput is based on above actual
    time required to transmit data and is expressed as: $$\\begin{aligned} Throughput
    = \\frac{Data \\ Delivered}{Actual \\ Time \\ Taken} \\end{aligned}$$ (15) The
    summation of total sensing time includes time taken to sense the idle licensed
    channels, configuring transmission power according to secondary user requirement
    and primary user activity. To simulate the end-to-end delay, the start time \\(T_{start}\\)
    by the transmitting node and \\(T_{end}\\) by the receiving node is taken into
    consideration. The difference between the \\(T_{end}\\) and \\(T_{start}\\) computes
    the end-to-end delay and represented as: $$\\begin{aligned} Delay_{end\\text{-}to\\text{-}end}
    = T_{end} - T_{start} \\end{aligned}$$ (16) In Fig. 4, throughput is calculated
    with respect to the transmitted rate normalised to bandwidth for varying SINR
    from − 4 to 0 dB as calculated by Wang and Lu [14]. The throughput varying from
    0.1 to 0.75 for \\(SINR=0\\) dB, where for lower values of SINR reaches to the
    maximum of 0.5, 0.32, 0.3 and 0.25 for SINR − 1 dB, − 2 dB, − 3 dB and − 4 dB
    respectively. Similarly, the throughput for receiving rate is calculated and analysed
    showing a slight drop in throughput for respective SINR as shown in Fig. 5. This
    drop in throughput is due to the interference between the power of primary user
    and secondary user. To analyse this the computed throughput with respect to transmitting
    as well as receiving rate is plotted of the same graph to analyse the % drop in
    throughput of receiving rate as compare to the transmitting rate shown in Fig.
    6. Percentage drop of 1–2% for each value of SINR. Fig. 4 Throughput according
    to the transmitting rate at varying SINR Full size image Fig. 5 Throughput according
    to the receiving rate at varying SINR Full size image Fig. 6 Throughput according
    to the transmitting/receiving rate at varying SINR Full size image For the fair
    and efficient testing of the proposed technique, APC is testing for different
    cases discussed in the starting of this section. Case 1:, for average throughput
    and end-to-end delay analysis according to the density of the secondary users
    according to the primary user. Addressed as average throughput and end to end
    delay vs. number of nodes with and without APC. The Figs. 7 and 8 refer to the
    graph plotted under this case. Comparative graphs are plotted so that the performance
    of the proposed techniques can be analysed clearly. The density represents the
    number of cognitive user are available for single primary channel. The density
    varies from 2 CUs to 12 CUs. 2 CUs referred as least dense network and 12 CUs
    referred as extremely dense network. Slight Increase of 0.2 mbps is observed in
    Fig. 7 for the extreme dense scenario. Moreover, Increase in throughput is observed
    with increasing density until 12 CUs and thereafter increasing the density the
    throughput degrades significantly. This can be observed from Fig. 8, delay increase
    exponentially with the increase in density of the network. Significant increase
    in end-to-end delay of approx. 0.1 s is observed for extreme dense network i.e.
    12 nodes. Fig. 7 Throughput according to density of nodes Full size image Fig.
    8 End-to-end delay according to density of nodes Full size image Case 2:, for
    average throughput and end-to-end delay analysis according to the requirement/demand
    of the secondary users. Addressed as average throughput and end to end delay vs.
    Application Load with and without APC. Figures 9 and 10 refer to the graph plotted
    under this case. Comparative graphs are plotted so that the performance of the
    proposed techniques can be analysed clearly. Application Load represents the adaptation
    of the proposed techniques according the requirement of Secondary Users. Fig.
    9 Throughput according to application load Full size image Fig. 10 End-to-end
    delay according to application load Full size image The parameters of application
    load are defined as Low, Medium and High. Low referred as when the Bandwidth requirement
    is low for the Cognitive User or the case when there is minimum requirement of
    spectrum by the Cognitive User and similar for the High application load, i.e.
    Cognitive User requirement of the spectrum is high. Constant throughput is observed
    for simulation when APC technique is used, whereas a drop of approx. 0.5 Mbps
    is observed for the case when proposed APC technique in not used. Moreover, analysing
    the end-to-end delay in Fig. 10 significant drop in delay of approx. 70 ms is
    observed for High Application Load. Case 3:, for average throughput and end-to-end
    delay analysis according to the activity of the primary user. Addressed as average
    throughput and end to end delay vs. primary user activity with and without APC.
    Figures 11 and 12 refer to the graph plotted under this case. Comparative graphs
    are plotted so that the performance of the proposed techniques can be analysed
    clearly. Primary user Activity represents the case when primary user uses the
    licensed channels. The parameters of primary user activity are defined as Low,
    Medium and High. Low referred as when licensed users uses the licensed channel
    rarely and similar for the High primary user activity when primary user occupies
    the licensed channels at most of the time. Constant throughput is observed for
    simulation when APC technique is used, whereas a significant drop of approx. 2
    Mbps is observed for the case when proposed APC technique in not used as shown
    in Fig. 11. Moreover, analysing the end-to-end delay in Fig. 12 significant drop
    in delay of approx. 120 ms is observed for high primary user activity. Fig. 11
    Throughput according to primary user activity Full size image Fig. 12 End-to-end
    delay according to primary user activity Full size image In Figs. 13 and 14 comparative
    analysis of proposed APC technique is performed in which Average throughput and
    end-to-end delay with respect to simulation time is computed. Analysing the average
    throughput and overall average increase of 0.5 Mbps is observed over the simulation
    time of 50 s. Observing graph in Fig. 13 a delayed increase in throughput is observed
    in simulating the system model with APC. This is due to adaptation of PAT metric
    used in proposed APC to modulated the tune-able parameter \\(\\alpha\\) which
    controls the transmission power of Cognitive Users. Accordingly, an average reduction
    of 50 ms observed in Fig. 14. Fig. 13 Throughput according to simulation time
    Full size image Fig. 14 End-to-end delay according to simulation time Full size
    image Moreover, to analyse the effect of tunable parameter ‘\\(\\alpha\\)’ on
    the average throughput and end-to-end delay. \\(\\alpha\\) varies between 0 and
    1, lower values of ‘\\(\\alpha\\)’ indicates low transmission power for the cognitive
    user whereas high values of \\(\\alpha\\) indicates high transmission power. Simulation
    is performed to calculate the average throughput and end-to-end delay at three
    different values of ‘\\(\\alpha\\)’ i.e. 0.2, 0.5, 0.8. Higher the value of \\(\\alpha\\)
    higher will be the throughput at the expense of high interference with the primary
    user as shown in Fig. 15. Alternate will be the case of end-to-end delay which
    can be analysed from the Fig. 16. Fig. 15 Throughput according to simulation time
    at varying ‘\\(\\alpha\\)’ Full size image Fig. 16 End-to-end delay according
    to simulation time at varying ‘\\(\\alpha\\)’ Full size image 5 Conclusion In
    this paper simple and unique Adaptive Power Control APC techniques for underlay
    approach for cognitive radio mobile network is proposed. This techniques introduces
    a Power Adaptive Transmission PAT metric which overcomes three major issues. Firstly,
    this proposed techniques work efficiently over dense networks with marginal increased
    throughput of 0.2 Mbps, Secondly, APC this techniques adapts to the requirement
    of Secondary user and lastly, to maintain the QoS of primary user. Under simulation
    testing of the proposed APC techniques, the proposed techniques outperforms various
    other underlay as well hybrid techniques for power control under cognitive radio
    environment. References Mitola, J., & Maguire, G. Q. (1999). Cognitive radio:

  description: With the development of wireless communication and Internet of Things
    (IoT), there are massive wireless devices that need to share the limited spectrum
    resources. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a promising paradigm to remedy the
    problem of inefficient spectrum utilization brought upon by the historical command-and-control
    approach to spectrum allocation. In this paper, we investigate the distributed
    DSA problem for multi-users in a typical multi-channel cognitive radio network.
    The problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision
    process (Dec-POMDP), and we propose a centralized off-line training and distributed
    on-line execution framework based on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning
    (MARL). We employ the deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) to address the partial observability
    of the state for each cognitive user. The ultimate goal is to learn a cooperative
    strategy which maximizes the sum throughput of a cognitive radio network in distributed
    fashion without information exchange between cognitive users. Finally, we validate
    the proposed algorithm in various settings through extensive experiments. Experimental
    results show that the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art
    DQSA (Deep Q-Learning for Spectrum Access) in terms of successful access rate
    and collision rate by at least 14%, and 12%, respectively.

    brought upon by the historical command-and-control approach to spectrum allocation.
    In this article, we investigate the distributed DSA problem for multiusers in
    a typical multichannel cognitive radio network. The problem is formulated as a
    decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), and we
    propose a centralized off-line training and distributed online execution framework
    based on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We employ the
    deep recurrent Q -network (DRQN) to address the partial observability of the state
    for each cognitive user. The ultimate goal is to learn a cooperative strategy
    which maximizes the sum throughput of a cognitive radio network in a distributed
    fashion without information exchange between cognitive users. Finally, we validate
    the proposed algorithm in various settings through extensive experiments. The
    experimental results show that the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm outperforms the
    state-of-the-art deep Q -learning for spectrum access (DQSA) in terms of successful
    access rate and collision rate by at least 14% and 12%, respectively. Published

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The future network is
    involving into Internet of Everything. Wireless devices, such as smartphones,
    wearable fitness recorders, smart home devices, and various sensors are vying
    for access to the radio spectrum and the number of them is surging. According
    to Cisco’s forecast [1], the number of devices connected to IP networks will reach
    29.3 billion by 2023. And by 2030, the demand for wireless access could be 250
    times larger than it is today. However, the spectrum resource has almost been
    fully allocated, and the spectrum management mechanism is lack of efficiency.
    It allocates exclusive licensed bands to isolated wireless systems, which guarantees
    interference-free communication, but it is human-operated. It is difficult for
    the limited available spectrum to accommodate the growing demand of wireless applications.
    However, in a given period, some allocated bands are underutilized, while other
    bands are overwhelmed, which squanders enormous spectrum capacity, and exacerbates
    the scarcity of spectrum. Therefore, developing a flexible and high-efficiency
    wireless paradigm of spectrum access to meet the increasing demand of massive
    wireless devices is a crucial issue for future wireless communication. Dynamic
    spectrum access (DSA) technology enables users to access the available spectrum
    flexibly according to their demands, which is envisioned as a promising technology
    to solve the current spectrum inefficiency problem. With the potential advantages
    of machine learning, we try to propose an intelligent DSA technology. A. Related
    Works Some literatures have surveyed the traditional DSA models [2] [3]. However,
    the traditional model-based approaches focus on designing spectrum access protocols
    for specific network scenarios, which require prior knowledge of the network dynamics
    to formulate wireless network models and cannot effectively be applied to handle
    complex real-world problems. The myopic policy [4] and the Whittle index policy
    [5] are two classic algorithms devised for single-user scenario, where the channels
    are independent and the state transition matrixes are known in prior. The myopic
    policy always selects the channel which maximizes the immediate reward and ignores
    its long-term effects. Only when the state transitions are positively correlated
    or slightly negatively correlated, the performance is optimal, otherwise is not.
    When all the channels are independent but not identical, the Whittle index policy
    can achieve an optimal result. When channels follow identical distribution, the
    Whittle index policy falls into the same round-robin structure as the myopic policy.
    However, both of them are not competent for complicated communication scenarios
    with unknown network dynamics. The development of artificial intelligence (AI)
    facilitates intelligent wireless communications [6] [7], and machine learning
    is a powerful tool which is envisioned as a potential solution of the DSA problem
    [8]. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) [9] embraces the multidimensional perception
    ability of deep neural network (DNN) and the autonomous decision-making ability
    of reinforcement learning [10]. The agents learn by trial-and-error interaction
    with its surrounding environment. DRL can be model-free and does not require the
    network dynamics in prior. At each time step, the agent observes the state of
    the environment and takes an action according to its own policy, meanwhile receives
    a scalar reward that evaluates the quality of the action, and then adjusts its
    strategy to achieve the optimal policy. Luong et al. [11] have surveyed the applications
    of DRL in wireless communications and networking. DRL is even applied to secure
    wireless communication using the intelligent reflecting surface [12] [13]. Due
    to the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential growth of the state-action
    space in multiuser scenarios, the existing works mainly focus on DSA of a single-user
    based on the single-agent DRL algorithm. The work [14] is the pioneer work which
    applied DRL in the field of DSA, in which the authors formulated the dynamic multichannel
    access problem of a single-user as a partially observable Markov decision process
    (POMDP) and applied deep Q -network (DQN) to obtain the optimal access policy
    in wireless sensor networks, demonstrating that DQN could outperform the traditional
    DSA approaches. A deep actor-critic reinforcement learning-based framework for
    dynamic multichannel access was proposed in [15]. The actor-critic reinforcement
    learning algorithm consisted of a critic network and an actor network. The critic
    network estimated the Q -value and the actor-network updated the policy guided
    by the Q -value. By decoupling the Q -value estimation and action selection, the
    actor-critic reinforcement learning-based DSA algorithm converged faster and can
    achieve the near-optimal performance compared with the DQN-based algorithm. Xu
    et al. [16] investigated the distributed spectrum access in heterogeneous environments
    with partial observations, where the intelligent users employed deep recurrent
    Q -network (DRQN) to make access decision based on previous observations. The
    simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the DRQN-based
    approach in cognitive radio networks with multiple heterogeneous primary users
    (PUs). These works focused on single-user scenarios employing single-agent DRL.
    However, the real-world wireless communication networks are multi-agent systems
    usually, in which the agents share the common environment and the interaction
    between agents can be either cooperative, competitive, or mixed [17]. The current
    works simply apply the single-agent reinforcement learning to the multi-agent
    context, which may incur nonstationary and nonconvergent results. Naparstek and
    Cohen [18] devised a deep Q -learning spectrum access (DQSA) algorithm based on
    Dueling-DQN and long short-term memory (LSTM) for multiuser under partial observability,
    which learnt policies from their own ACK signals and each user employed an independent
    single-agent Q -learning algorithm. A central trainer trained the neural network
    for each user, and updated the network parameters periodically. This DQSA algorithm
    is only applicable to wireless networks with a relatively small number of channels
    and users. A combination of reservoir computing [a special type of recurrent neural
    network (RNN)] and DQN was utilized to design spectrum access strategies for secondary
    users (SUs) in distributive DSA networks in [19]. The SUs made spectrum access
    decisions relying on their current and past spectrum sensing outcomes. The algorithm
    also adopted an independent-learner manner, which did not take the other users’
    policy into account. With the increasing number of the channels and users, the
    state space and action space grown exponentially, leading to prohibitive computation
    complexity. In multiuser spectrum access scenarios, the network can be modeled
    as a multi-agent system, which aims to optimize the system-level performance from
    the global view, rather than focus on maximizing a single agent’s utility. Multi-agent
    reinforcement learning (MARL) integrates the development of single-agent reinforcement
    learning, game theory and direct policy search techniques [20]. It is more promising
    to handle the large scale and complex wireless communication settings. B. Contributions
    Our work is inspired by the spectrum collaboration challenge (SC2), which was
    a three-year competition hosted by DARPA, aiming to overcome the scarcity of radio
    spectrum by machine-learning approaches [21]. In cognitive radio networks, there
    are two critical challenges, which are avoiding causing harmful interference to
    PUs and coordinating with other cognitive users to maximize the sum throughput
    of the system for cognitive users to access the licensed spectrum. We consider
    cognitive radio network as a multi-agent system, and investigate the DSA of cognitive
    users by formulating it as a Markov game. Since there is no prior information
    about the dynamics of network, we cannot formulate the spectrum access model precisely
    by traditional approaches. Therefore, the concept of MARL is introduced and a
    cooperative MARL-based multiuser DSA algorithm (CoMARL-DSA) is proposed in multichannel
    cognitive radio networks. The CoMARL-DSA is devised based on QMIX [22], which
    is a novel value-based MARL algorithm that trains decentralized policies in a
    centralized end-to-end way. The QMIX is accommodated for multiagents cooperative
    settings, in which the agents learn a cooperative strategy in the centralized
    training paradigm. Our goal is to develop a MARL-based multiuser DSA algorithm
    for multichannels access under partial observability, and maximize the successful
    access rate of the whole system by designing suitable utility functions based
    on game theory. The main contributions of this article are summarized as follows.
    We model the multichannel access problem of multiuser as a Markov game. Specifically,
    we formulate DSA of multiuser as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision
    progress (Dec-POMDP). In order to maximize the successful access rate of the network,
    we model the collaborative spectrum access as a cooperative game, and adopted
    the MARL to solve the distributed multiuser spectrum access problem. In order
    to tackle the instability and irrationality of the distributed access strategy,
    we propose a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture,
    which estimates the joint-action value conditioning on global state information
    in the centralized training phase and the cognitive users make access decision
    condition only on their local partially observations. The CTDE architecture could
    be conducted with the advantages of emerging mobile edge computing technologies.
    We propose a multiuser distributed spectrum access algorithm based on cooperative
    MARL, which we refer to as CoMARL-DSA. With the proposed algorithm, each cognitive
    user can make access decisions based on its own local observation and requires
    no information exchanging with other cognitive users, which can greatly alleviate
    the communication overhead and guarantee the real-time action. C. Organization
    of the Paper The remainder of this article is structured as follows. We give some
    background knowledge about MARL, Dec-POMDP, and DRQN in Section II. In Section
    III, we present the system model and problem formulation. The proposed CoMARL-DSA
    algorithm and the utility function design based on cooperative game are detailed
    in Section IV. In Section V, we implement the proposed algorithm and validate
    its effectiveness and efficiency by numerical results. Conclusions are drawn in
    Section VI. SECTION II. Preliminaries A. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning In
    multi-agent scenarios, a set of autonomous agents obtain optimal policy by interacting
    with their shared environment dynamically. Different from single-agent reinforcement
    learning, in which the state transition of the environment switches based on its
    own action only, the new environment state of the multi-agent system is based
    on the joint action of all agents. To a single agent, its optimal policy depends
    not only on the state of the environment, but also on the policies of the other
    agents as well. Therefore, the shared learning environment is not stationary anymore,
    and this can no longer be described by the Markov decision process (MDP) model.
    MARL is a multi-agent extension of the single-agent reinforcement learning and
    can be modeled as a Markov game [23]. MARL can be denoted as a tuple ⟨N,S, { A
    n } n∈N ,P, { r n } n∈N ,γ⟩ , where N={1,2,…,N} is the index set of agents, S
    denotes the set of environment states. A n is the action space of agent n and
    A= A 1 × A 2 ×⋯× A N denotes the joint-action space of all agents, and the joint-action
    vector is a={ a 1 , a 2 ,…, a N } . P( s ′ |s,a):S×A×S↦[0,1] denotes the transition
    probability function of the system states given the joint action a . r n (s,a):S×A↦R
    denotes the reward function of agent n with the given joint-action a executed
    at state s . At each step, the n th agent acquires the immediate reward r n (s,a)
    of a transition from (s,a) to next state s ′ . 0≤γ≤1 is the discount factor, which
    indicates the long-term effect of the current action. In MARL, each agent aims
    to obtain an optimal policy π ∗ which maximizes the expected cumulative reward
    during the executing period π ∗ = argmax π E[ ∑ t=1 T γ t−1 ⋅ r n t (s,a)| s 1
    ] (1) View Source where t refers to the time slot and s 1 is the initial sate
    ( t=1 ). B. Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process MARL is
    applied in various areas such as autonomous navigation, traffic-light controlling,
    and sensor networks, where the agents are spatially distributed. Owning to the
    observation ability limitation of a single agent, an agent may not have full and
    perfect knowledge of the environment states, i.e., o n ≠s , where o n is the observation
    of the n th agent and s is the environment state. In single-agent settings, the
    problem is formulated as a POMDP. While in multi-agent scenarios, decisions are
    made in a decentralized manner by a set of agents, and the problem can be modeled
    as a Dec-POMDP [24], which offers a framework for cooperative sequential decision
    making in a shared environment. Dec-POMDP can be defined as a Markov game with
    incomplete information and denoted by a tuple ⟨N,S, { A n } n∈N ,P, { r n } n∈N
    , { Z n } n∈N , { O n } n∈N ,γ⟩ . In contrast with the notations of MARL, S is
    the true state of the environment, Z is the observation space, and an observation
    function Z(s,a):S×A↦O determines the observation that each agent observes at each
    step. The other denotations are the same as defined in MARL. Because the state
    is partially observed, it is beneficial to remember an observation-action history
    τ∈T={O×A} . A stochastic policy π(a|τ):T×A↦[0,1] is drawn conditioned on the observation-action
    history. Dec-POMDP is a stochastic game with incomplete information. At each step,
    action decisions of each agent are made solely on local observations, but these
    decisions can affect the global state and each agent’s immediate reward and observation.
    The goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward of each agent over a finite
    or infinite number of steps. C. Deep Recurrent Q -Network POMDP is polynomial-space
    hard and requires exponential computation complexity to find the exact solution
    [25]. Even worse, the system dynamics is unknown in prior, which makes it intractable
    to find a feasible solution timely. In real-world MARL, the agents have only a
    partial view of the global state, resulting in imperfect awareness of the environment.
    It is difficult for normal DQN to address this kind of problem. To make up this
    gap, DRQN [26] introduces RNN to deal with the partially observation problems,
    considering that RNN can remember a piece of historical data, and infer the environment
    state from the sequential but imperfect data. In DRQN architecture, a fully connected
    layer is replaced by a recurrent layer (e.g., LSTM [27] or GRU [28]). In the training
    phase, the parameters of the recurrent layer and fully connected layers are updated
    by back-propagation simultaneously. Many works have demonstrated that DRQN performs
    robustly with incomplete and imperfect information [16], [18]. SECTION III. System
    Model and Problem Formulation A. System Model In this article, we investigate
    an OFDM-based cognitive radio network, which coexists with a primary network with
    K orthogonal channels. The cognitive users access the spectrum holes opportunistically.
    The overall available frequency bandwidth is divided into K orthogonal subchannels
    with equal size, and the bandwidth spanned by an OFDM channel is smaller than
    the channel coherence bandwidth. Consequently, the spectrum can be approximated
    as flat. We consider the cognitive network as a fully synchronized time-slotted
    system, where time is slotted and indexed by t , and each time slot has a fixed
    duration. In each time slot, L OFDMA symbols are transmitted. The length of time
    slot is designed to match the coherence time of the channel, so the channel state
    information (CSI) holds the same within the time slot. Each cognitive user accesses
    the channels at the very beginning of the time slot, and holds on until the time
    slot ends. As depicted in Fig. 1, the system consists of primary tiers and cognitive
    tiers, in which the primary tiers consist of primary base stations and its associated
    PUs, while the cognitive tiers contain secondary access points (APs) and their
    associated cognitive users, or cognitive Tx-Rx pairs. The cognitive users are
    scattered within the transmission range of the primary BS, and all cognitive users
    locate in an area with geographical proximity and are of the sensing distance
    from each other (i.e., a fully connected wireless network). We study the uplink
    spectrum access problem of cognitive users in a time-slotted channel hopping cognitive
    radio network, in which the scattered cognitive users transmit packets to their
    corresponding receivers or APs via shared wireless channels. Fig. 1. System model.
    Show All Without loss of generality, we assume that the cognitive radio network
    consists of N cognitive users, and n∈{1,2,…,N} is the cognitive users index. We
    focus on the subchannels access in the uplink of cognitive radio network, in which
    N cognitive users share K orthogonal channels, and k∈{1,2,…,K} denotes the k th
    subchannel. The cognitive users transmit the data over the shared channels cooperatively
    using the random-access protocol (e.g., CSMA-type narrowband transport protocol).
    At each time slot, each cognitive user selects M(0≤M≤K) channels out of K orthogonal
    channels to sense, and then chooses one channel from the sensed channels to transmit
    packets according to its learnt policy. We assume that all cognitive users are
    backlogged and always attempt to transmit at each time slot. We consider the distributed
    DSA problem of multiple cognitive users. To guarantee the scalability and robustness
    of the system, we assume that there is no central controller in the cognitive
    radio network. In order to provide centralized off-line training, we deploy a
    parameter server on the edge of the cognitive radio network (i.e., wireless APs
    or cognitive base station). The parameter server is specially deployed for training,
    and is not involved into making spectrum access decisions. In order to enhance
    the efficiency of the spectrum access protocol, we assume that there is no information
    exchange between cognitive users. Each cognitive user makes the access decision
    according to its own learnt policy based on local observation. B. Problem Formulation
    Based on the system model above, the distributed multiuser DSA problem can be
    modeled as a cooperative Markov game [23]. Considering that cognitive users have
    limited sensing ability and no prior knowledge of the network dynamics, the cooperative
    spectrum access can be modeled as a Dec-POMDP, which is given by a tuple G=⟨N,S,
    { A n } n∈N ,P, { r n } n∈N , { Z n } n∈N , { O n } n∈N ,γ⟩ . N is the index set
    of cognitive users, S is the true state of overall channels occupation. A is the
    channel-selection space of cognitive users which yields the joint-action set A=
    A 1 × A 2 ×⋯× A N and joint-action vector a={ a 1 , a 2 ,…, a N } . P( s ′ |s,a):S×A×S↦[0,1]
    is the transition probability function of the channels states given the joint
    action a , r n (s,a):S×A↦R denotes the reward function of the cognitive users
    with the given joint-action a executed at current state s . O n is the observation
    space, and an observation function O n (s, a n ):S×A↦Z determines the observation
    that each cognitive user sensed at each step. γ∈[0,1] is the discount factor,
    which indicates the long-term effect of the current action. Considering the state
    is partially observed and imperfect, we exploit the observation-action history
    τ∈T={O×A} to infer the true state from the sequential but incomplete data. Let
    B(τ):T↦S be the belief function maintained by the cognitive users. We employ DRQN
    to update B(τ) in each time slot, and infer the true channels occupation state.
    As a result, the cognitive users can make access decisions according to the learnt
    policy solely based on their own local observations. 1) State Switching Patterns:
    In the cognitive radio network with multiuser sharing available channels cooperatively,
    each cognitive user first selects M(0≤M≤K) channels out of K channels to sense
    at each time slot, and then chooses one idle channel to access. The channels may
    be independent or correlated. For each channel, it has two states: idle (1) or
    busy (0), and its state transition follows two-state Markov chain, denoted as
    P k =[ p 00 p 10 p 01 p 11 ] , as depicted in Fig. 2. Consequently, the whole
    system can be described as a 2 K -state Markov chain. We denote the channel states
    as s t ={ s 1,t , s 2,t ,…, s K,t } , where s k,t stands for the state of the
    k th channel in time slot t . The channels state switch at the beginning of each
    time slot and remain the same within the time slot duration. Fig. 2. Two-state
    Markov model of channel occupancy. Show All The cognitive users adopt the listen-before-talk
    (LBT) mechanism to access the spectrum. At the very beginning of each time slot,
    each cognitive user selects M channels to sense. If there is more than one idle
    channel in the sensed channels, the cognitive user chooses one idle channel to
    transmit packets. At the end of the time slot, if the cognitive user receives
    an ACK from the corresponding receiver, the transmission is successful, and a
    collision occurs otherwise. The slot structure is depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3.
    Slot structure. Show All 2) Cognitive Users’ Observation Space: Considering the
    network dynamics is not priory known to the cognitive users, and the perception
    of the cognitive users is limited, the cognitive users only have partially local
    information of the channels state. We model the DSA of the multiuser as a Dec-POMDP,
    and we can deduce the state switching pattern from an observation-action history
    τ∈T={O×A} . At each time slot, each cognitive user selects M channels out of the
    K channels to sense, and the states of the selected channels are revealed to the
    cognitive user, while the states of the other channels which are not selected
    remain unknown. The size of the observation space O is 2 M ×( K M ) . The notation
    ( K M ) refers to a binomial combination, which represents the number of combinations
    that can be created when choosing M objects from a set of K objects. We denote
    the observation of cognitive user n as o n (t)={ o n 1,t , o n 2,t ,…, o n K,t
    } , where o n k,t stands for the observed state of k th channel by the n th cognitive
    user in time slot t . o n k,t is defined as o n k,t = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ s k,t
    , −1, if the k-th channel is sensed by n-th cognitive user in time slot t if the
    k-th channel is not sensed by n-th cognitive user in time slot t. (2) View Source
    s k,t is the state of the k th channel in time slot t , which is defined as s
    k,t ={ 1, 0, if the k-th channel is idle in time slott if the k-th channel is
    busy in time slott. (3) View Source 3) Cognitive Users’ Action Space: As described
    before, each cognitive user selects M channels out of the K channels to sense
    in a time slot, where 0≤M≤K , which constitutes the cognitive users’ action space.
    Therefore, the size of action space A is ( K M ) . In this article, the cognitive
    users are homogeneous, and deployed in proximity, therefore they have the same
    action space. At the beginning of each time slot, each cognitive user executes
    an action selected from the action space according to the learnt policy, and then
    acquires the state of the sensed channels. 4) Cooperative Game Reward: At each
    time slot, after sensing the M selected channels, the cognitive users learn the
    state of the sensed channels. If there is no idle channel in the sensed channels,
    the cognitive user does not transmit data and receives reward (0) at the end of
    the time slot. If there are idle channels in the sensed channels, the cognitive
    user picks one idle channel to transmit packets and receives an ACK from the corresponding
    receiver at the end of the time slot. Through measuring the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) of the feedback from the corresponding receiver, we can infer whether
    there is a collision. If the transmission is successful, the cognitive user acquires
    a positive reward (+2) . If a collision occurs, the cognitive user acquires a
    negative reward (−1) . The reward acquired by each cognitive user is defined as
    r n t = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0, +2, −1, if the n-th cognitive
    user does not transmit in time slot t if the n-th cognitive user transmits and
    no collisions occur in time slot t if the n-th cognitive user transmits and collisions
    occur in time slot t. (4) View Source From the perspective of one single cognitive
    user, the goal is to learn an individual multichannel access strategy π ∗ , which
    maximizes the expected cumulative reward during the executing period T , also
    named an episode. Therefore, we have π ∗ = argmax π E[ ∑ t=1 T γ t−1 ⋅ r n t (
    o n t , a n t )| o n 1 ] (5) View Source where 0≤γ≤1 is the discount factor, which
    indicates the long-term effect of the current action. In this article, owning
    to episodes are bounded and each time slot is equivalent, we set γ=0.98 . When
    we consider an episode composing only one time slot, the problem is simplified
    to the well-known multiarmed bandit problem. In a multiusers scenario, where a
    group of cognitive users share the common available channels, the number of cognitive
    users may be much larger than that of channels, i.e., N>K . Therefore, the cognitive
    users should coordinate to access the spectrum holes cooperatively in order to
    reduce collisions so as to maximize the throughput of the cognitive radio networks.
    To address this problem, we model the distributed DSA problem as a cooperative
    game [29], in which all cognitive users share the global system-level reward.
    The global reward is defined as R tot = ∑ n=1 N ∑ t=1 T γ t−1 ⋅ r n t ( o n ,a).
    (6) View Source As defined above, r n t is a linear function and the global reward
    can be rewritten as R tot = ∑ t=1 T γ t−1 ∑ n=1 N r n t ( o n ,a). (7) View Source
    In DRL, the global reward is received at the end of the episode. Thus, it is a
    delayed reward, and has low training efficiency. From (7), we can define the total
    reward of all cognitive users in each time slot as r tot t = ∑ n=1 N r n t ( o
    n ,a). (8) View Source The multiusers spectrum access in each time slot can also
    be formulated as a cooperative game. Cooperative games are a special type of exact
    potential game (EPG) [30], and r tot t :O×A↦R is the potential function. Denote
    a n , a ˜ n ∈A as two different chosen actions of the n th cognitive user, and
    a −n ={ a i } i≠n as the action profile of the other cognitive users except n
    th cognitive user. Then, the following equation holds for all cognitive users:
    r n t ( a n , a −n )− r n t ( a ˜ n , a −n )= r tot t ( a n , a −n )− r tot t
    ( a ˜ n , a −n ). (9) View Source Therefore, r tot t has the same monotonicity
    as r n t , which is equivalent to argmax a r tot t (s,a)= ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ argmax a 1 r
    1 t ( o 1 , a 1 ) ⋮ argmax a N r N t ( o N , a N ) ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ . (10) View Source
    EPG admits an important property that it has the finite improvement property (FIP)
    and convergence to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) when the strategy space
    is finite [30]. The goal of distributed DSA of multiuser is to find the equilibrium
    point that maximizes the expected cumulative reward G tot = max π ∗ E[ ∑ t=1 T
    γ t−1 ∑ n=1 N r t n ( o n , a n , a −n )| o 1 ]. (11) View Source In the following
    section, we will employ MARL to get the near-optimal strategy of this Markov game
    in an incomplete and dynamic environment. SECTION IV. Proposed CoMARL-Based Dynamic
    Spectrum Access Algorithm A. Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution
    The existing works mainly focus on single-agent reinforcement learning or centralized
    approaches, where a network controller is employed as a central trainer and executor.
    However, as the number of users and network scale increases, the state space and
    action space increase exponentially, which bring prohibitive computational overhead.
    MARL is capable of modeling and resolving the multi-agent system problem in a
    distributed manner, even when the cognitive users only observe their local information.
    In practice, there is usually no base station or central controller in cognitive
    radio networks. Even though there is a central controller, the exchange of observation
    and decision-making information between central controller and cognitive users
    may impose heavy communication overhead on the network. Meanwhile, if the cognitive
    radio network is fully decentralized, and there is no coordination information
    exchange between cognitive users, the system would be nonstationary and nonconvergent.
    To make a tradeoff between the aforementioned two extremes, we propose a CTDE
    architecture, which employs a central trainer on the network edge of the cognitive
    radio network, as shown in Fig. 4. The CTDE architecture is robust to network
    topology variations and facilitates scalability. Fig. 4. Centralized training
    and distributed execution architecture of CoMARL-DSA. Show All In the centralized
    training phase, we employ the edge computing server as a central trainer for off-line
    training. The central trainer collects interactive experience tuples (state, observation,
    action, and reward) of all cognitive users for cooperative strategy training.
    After the training is done and the cooperative strategy is obtained, the cognitive
    users need no internal information exchange and make spectrum access decisions
    individually based on their local observations in the execution phase. B. Proposed
    CoMARL-DSA Algorithm For MARL with discrete state and action space, the value-based
    algorithms are effective [9]. Value decomposition network (VDN) [31] is a centralized
    learning and distributed execution algorithm, which is accommodate for solving
    cooperative games. VDN obtains the joint-action value function by adding all agents’
    Q -value function directly, i.e., Q tot = ∑ N n=1 Q n ( τ n , a n ; θ n ) , where
    Q tot stands for joint-action value function, Q n ( τ n , a n ; θ n ) denotes
    the n th agent’s Q -value function, τ=( τ 1 , τ 2 ,…, τ N ) denotes the joint
    observation-action history, τ n t =( o n t−l , a n t−l ,…, o n t−1 , a n t−1 ,
    o n t , a n t ) denotes the l -length observation-action history of the n th agent
    until step t , and a=( a 1 , a 2 ,…, a N ) denotes the joint action. θ n is the
    parameters of the n th agent network. Considering maximizing Q tot is equivalent
    to maximizing all Q n ( τ n , a n ; θ n ) , we can obtain the distributed policy
    for all the agents through maximizing the Q n ( τ n , a n ; θ n ) , respectively.
    QMIX [22] is an extension of the VDN, which adopts a mixing network to integrate
    all individual Q -value functions of the agents, meanwhile coalesces the global
    state information to assist training, which is helpful to improve the performance
    and convergence speed of the algorithm. QMIX is also a centralized learning and
    distributed execution reinforcement learning algorithm, whose Q tot has the same
    monotonicity with the single agent value function Q n ( τ n , a n ; θ n ) . i.e.,
    argmax a Q tot (τ,a)= ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ argmax a 1 Q 1 ( τ 1 , a 1 ) ⋮ argmax a N Q N (
    τ N , a N ) ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ . (12) View Source The monotonicity can be enforced through
    imposing a constraint on the relationship between Q tot and each Q n , that is
    ∂ Q tot ∂ Q n ≥0∀n∈{1,2,…,N}. (13) View Source Consequently, in the cooperative
    game, the common joint-action value function is the potential function. Maximizing
    Q tot is equivalent to maximizing all Q n ( τ n , a n ; θ n ) , and thus we can
    obtain the distributed policy for all the agents by maximizing Q n ( τ n , a n
    ; θ n ) , respectively. QMIX consists of a mixing network, a hypernetwork [32]
    and a set of agent networks. Each agent has a DRQN which receives the current
    local observation and the last action as input at each step, and estimates its
    individual Q -value function Q n ( τ n , a n ; θ n ) . The mixing network takes
    the agent networks’ outputs as input and mixes them monotonically to produce the
    global value function Q tot . The weights of the mixing network are produced by
    hypernetwork, which takes the global state as input and generates the nonnegative
    weights for the mixing network to guarantee the monotonous of Q tot . QMIX is
    accordance with the CTDE architecture as depicted in Fig. 4. In cognitive radio
    networks, we propose the CoMARL-DSA algorithm based on QMIX, which formulates
    the multiuser DSA problem as a cooperative game. Since the cognitive users are
    homogeneous, their DRQN networks are identical and have the same parameters. The
    CoMARL-DSA algorithm is detailed in Table I. TABLE I CoMARL-DSA Algorithm In the
    execution phase, cognitive users make spectrum access decisions individually according
    to the learnt policy based on their own local observations. C. Computational Complexity
    In the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm, most of the operations involve matrix multiplications
    and additions, and simple activation function ReLU: max(⋅,0) is adopted. The number
    of multiplications through the DQN with L layers is D=U⋅ l 1 + ∑ L−1 j=1 l j ⋅
    l j+1 , where U is the size of the input layer which is the size of state and
    l j is the number of neural units in the j th layer. In the training phase, we
    conduct parallel off-line training in a centralized powerful trainer. For each
    agent network, the computational complexity of the forward and back propagation
    for one sample is O(D) , the training complexity of one mini-batch of B episodes
    with T time slots is O(BTD) . The training is done over I iterations until convergence,
    and the computational complexity is O(IBTD) . In the execution phase, the computational
    complexity in real-time for each cognitive user is given by O(D) at each time
    step. SECTION V. Experiments and Performance Evaluations In this section, we present
    numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
    CoMARL-DSA algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm was compared with the
    state-of-the-art DQSA algorithm, which achieves the best performance among existing
    works tackling the DSA problem of multiusers in multichannel cognitive radio networks.
    We consider a cognitive radio network with K=16 orthogonal channels whose bandwidths
    are equal, and each channel is occupied by corresponding PUs following the two-state
    Markov chain pattern. N cognitive users scattering in proximity access the spectrum
    holes cooperatively as described in Section III. Here, we consider various scenarios
    and settings to fully validate the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm. First, we validated
    the CoMARL-DSA algorithm in the scenarios both N≤K and N>K (i.e., the numbers
    of cognitive users N varies from 3 to 21). Then, we presented the numerical results
    when cognitive users possessed different numbers of sensing channels. Further
    on, in order to evaluate the robust of proposed algorithms, we conducted experiments
    in periodic channels setting, correlated channels setting, and variable wireless
    environment. At last, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed CoMARL-DSA
    algorithm in real-world channels setting. The CoMARL-DSA algorithm is comprised
    of a mixing network, a hypernetwork and N agent networks. The mixing network consists
    of one hidden layer of 32 neurons, utilizing ELU as the activation function. The
    hypernetwork which produces nonnegative weights for mixing network also consists
    of one hidden layer of 32 neurons with ReLU as the activation function. Each agent
    network is a DRQN with one recurrent layer consisting of a GRU with 64-dimension
    hidden state. In the training phase, each cognitive user adopts ε -greedy policy
    to explore action space. Throughout the training, ε decays from 0.4 to 0.05 over
    10000 steps and keeps constant until the end. The discount factor is γ=0.98 and
    the neural networks are trained using RMSprop optimizer with learning rate α=5e−4
    . Every time we sample batches of 16 episodes from the replay buffer, and each
    containing 20 steps. The target networks are updated every 40 training steps.
    In order to speed up the training, all cognitive users share the same agent network
    architecture. A. Varied Numbers of Cognitive Users With Fixed Number of Sensing
    Channels In this experiment setting, 16 orthogonal channels are occupied by PUs
    following distinct two-state Markov chain patterns P k . We randomly set the state
    switching probabilities P k =[(x,1−x),(y,1−y)] for k th channel. x denotes the
    probability of the state transferring from busy to idle, and 1−x denotes the probability
    of state staying busy. y denotes the probability of the state transferring from
    idle to busy, and 1−y denotes the probability of the state staying idle. We conducted
    the experiments for N=3 , 6, 9, 15, and 21 cognitive users, and each cognitive
    user-perceived two channels at each time slot. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the proposed
    CoMARL-DSA algorithm can converge with a low collision rate after certain training
    steps for different numbers of cognitive users. From Fig. 5, we can observe that
    the rate of convergence becomes faster as the number of cognitive users increases
    when N≤9 (i.e., N=3,6,9 . N is the number of cognitive users). Because the cognitive
    users have learnt a cooperative strategy, they can sense and access the channels
    cooperatively. Each cognitive user selects two channels to sense, they can acquire
    the state of all channels coordinately when N≥8 . However, when K>9 (i.e., K=15,21
    ), the rate of convergence decreases as the number of cognitive users increases.
    This is due to the coordination becoming more difficult as the number of cognitive
    users increases, and the cooperative strategy is more difficult to learn. The
    outcome shows that the proposed algorithm has good scalability. Fig. 5. Varied
    numbers of cognitive users with two sensing channels. Show All B. Fixed Number
    of Cognitive Users With Varied Numbers of Sensing Channels The experiment setting
    is the same as Section V-A, and we implemented the experiments for three cognitive
    users with varied sensing channels M=1,2,3 , and 4. By statistical calculation,
    16 orthogonal channels have 7.42 idle channels in each time slot on average. Each
    episode is comprised of 20 time slots, and thus each episode can release 148.4
    idle time slots for reusing. For three cognitive users with the continuous transmission,
    they need 60 idle time slots for accessing in an episode. From Fig. 6, we can
    observe that the proposed algorithm converges faster and achieves better performance
    when cognitive users perceive more channels, meanwhile causes the lower collision
    rate. For three cognitive users with four and five sensing channels, they access
    almost 57 idle time slots in an episode, and the success rate of access is more
    than 95%. Fig. 6. Three cognitive users with varied numbers of sensing channels
    versus DQSA. Show All In the experiments of six cognitive users with varied sensing
    channels M=1 , 2, 3, and 4, we can get the same conclusion as scenarios with three
    cognitive users. For six cognitive users with continuous transmission, they need
    120 idle time slots for accessing in an episode. As depicted in Fig. 7, six cognitive
    users with four sensing channels access almost 112 idle time slots in an episode,
    the success rate of access is more than 92%. Fig. 7. Six cognitive users with
    varied numbers of sensing channels versus DQSA. Show All Furthermore, we implemented
    the DQSA algorithm proposed by [18], in which Naparstek and Cohen devised a DQSA
    algorithm based on Dueling-DQN and LSTM under partial observability. Each cognitive
    user employed an independent single-agent Q -learning network, and the central
    trainer was responsible for updating the network parameters. The DQSA algorithm
    also formulates the distributed DSA problem as a cooperative game in the centralized
    training phase, and achieves almost 80% channel throughput in the open shared
    radio access environment. From Fig. 6, we observe that three cognitive users employing
    DQSA reuse about 40 idle time slots in an episode with 20 time slots, and the
    convergence curve fluctuates wildly. The success rate of access is 67% with PUs
    coexisting. From Fig. 7, we observe that six cognitive users employ DQSA reuse
    about 62 idle time slots in an episode and the collisions increase. The success
    rate of access is 52%. As the number of cognitive users increasing, the successful
    access rate decrease dramatically. From the experiments conducted above, we can
    observe that three cognitive users with four sensing channels and six cognitive
    users with two sensing channels achieve almost the optimal performance. This is
    because in the centralized training phase, we model the distributed spectrum access
    as a cooperative game, and cognitive users learn a cooperative strategy in a centralized
    training fashion. As each cognitive user perceive more channels, they can obtain
    more information about the channels’ state. When each cognitive user senses M=K/N
    channels, they can obtain the complete globe state information coordinately. Therefore,
    the successful access number reaches a maximum value when N×M≥K . We also observe
    that the CoMARL-DSA algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art DQSA, especially
    when the number of cognitive users is large. This is due to that the DQSA is unable
    to learn a cooperative strategy as the number of cognitive users increasing. Meanwhile,
    in the training phase, the DQSA needs the complete state information of all channels
    and the experience tuples of all cognitive users, which would impose prohibitive
    computational complexity. In contrast, the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm requires
    only partial state information of the channels and a single Q -value of each cognitive
    user. C. Periodic Channels In this experiment, we set four idle channels in each
    time slot. The channels with idle slot switch according to round-robin scheduling
    with a switching probability of 0.75. The channel switching pattern is depicted
    in Fig. 8. Fig. 8. Periodic channels with four idle channels in each time slot,
    and the switching probability is 0.75. Show All In this scenario, we implemented
    the CoMARL-DSA algorithm for three cognitive users and each user with two sensing
    channels. In an episode comprised of 20 time slots, three cognitive users with
    continuous transmission need 60 idle time slots to access. From Fig. 9, we can
    observe that the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm converges after certain training
    steps, and achieves the near-optimal performance. This implies that the cognitive
    users have learnt the channels switching pattern and adopted a cooperative access
    policy. Fig. 9. Three cognitive users with two sensing channels in periodic channels.
    Show All D. Correlated Channels In this experiment, we consider wireless channels
    with switching pattern of correlated channels. 16 orthogonal channels were divided
    into four subsets, each channel in a subset was the same or inverse to the other
    channels. By statistical calculation, 16 orthogonal channels had eight idle channels
    in each slot on average. The channel switching pattern is depicted in Fig. 10.
    Fig. 10. Correlated channels with four sets, each may be of different size. Show
    All In this scenario, we implemented the CoMARL-DSA algorithm for three cognitive
    users with two sensing channels in correlated channels. In an episode comprised
    of 20 time slots, three cognitive users with continuous transmission need 60 idle
    time slots to access. From Fig. 11, we observe that the proposed algorithm converges
    after certain training steps, and achieves the near-optimal performance. This
    implies that the cooperative access policy was learnt in correlated channels setting.
    Fig. 11. Three cognitive users with two sensing channels in correlated channels.
    Show All E. Adaptivity to Variable Environments In order to illustrate the adaptivity
    of the proposed framework, we implemented the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm in
    the time-varying environments. 1) Periodic Channels to Correlated Channels: In
    this experiment, we first set the wireless channels as a round-robin switching
    pattern, which is described in Section V-C. Then at epoch 150, the channels switching
    pattern changes to correlated channels which is described in Section V-D. The
    time point when to change the switching pattern is unknown to the cognitive users.
    In the execution phase, when the cognitive users encounter a sudden performance
    degradation, this means that the wireless environment is changed. Then, all parameters
    of the networks are reset to initial states, and a new training phase initiate.
    In the described scenarios, we implemented the CoMARL-DSA algorithm for three
    cognitive users with two sensing channels. From Fig. 12, we observe that the proposed
    algorithm can converge fast and achieve the near-optimal performance, when the
    cognitive users encounter a sudden performance degradation at epoch 150. Fig.
    12. Three cognitive users with two sensing channels switching from periodic to
    correlated channels at epoch 150. Show All 2) Markov Channels to Markov Channels:
    In this experiment, we first set the wireless channels following Markov switching
    pattern P , which is depicted in Section V-A. Then at epoch 150, the channels
    switching pattern changes to P ′ , and P ′ ≠P . The time point when to change
    the switching pattern is unknown to the cognitive users. As described above, when
    the cognitive users encounter a sudden performance degradation in the execution
    phase, all parameters of the networks are reset, and to initiate a new training
    phase. We implemented the CoMARL-DSA algorithm for three cognitive users with
    two sensing channels in this dynamic environment. From Fig. 13, we observe that
    the proposed algorithm can converge fast and achieve the near-optimal performance,
    when the cognitive users encounter a sudden performance degradation at epoch 150.
    This implies that the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm can adapt to dynamic scenarios.
    Fig. 13. Three cognitive users with two sensing channels switching from Markov
    channels to different Markov channels in epoch 150. Show All F. Real-World Channels
    In this section, we trained and evaluated the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm with
    the real-world data trace which was downloaded from website [33]. The real-world
    data trace is produced by an indoor low-power wireless network testbed which is
    deployed by the University of Southern California (USC). It features three generations
    of wireless sensor nodes, all with IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radios operating on
    the 2.4-GHz frequency band. The sensor nodes perceive the interference coming
    from surrounding Wi-Fi networks and record the states of channels. We implemented
    the CoMARL-DSA algorithm for three cognitive users with one sensing channels with
    the real-world data trace. Meanwhile, we implemented the DQSA algorithm in the
    same wireless setting. In an episode comprised of 20 time slots, three cognitive
    users with continuous transmission need 60 idle time slots to transmit. From Fig.
    14, we observe that the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm and DQSA converge after
    certain training steps, but the CoMARL-DSA algorithm achieves better performance
    than DQSA. The experiments result shows that the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm
    is effective in real-world wireless setting. Fig. 14. Three cognitive users with
    two sensing channels in real-world channels. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In
    this article, we have investigated the distributed DSA problem of multiusers in
    a multichannel cognitive radio network. We modeled this problem as a Dec-POMDP,
    in which the cognitive users had incomplete information of the wireless environment
    state and the network dynamics was not known to cognitive users in prior. The
    cognitive users learnt the network dynamics by interaction with the wireless environment
    continuously and inferred the environment state from their own local observations
    and historical feedback of the actions. We formulated this problem as a Markov
    game. Each cognitive user was modeled as an independent learning agent observing
    its local environment state to make the optimal access strategy autonomously,
    without exchanging coordination information with the other cognitive users. The
    goal was to learn a distributed multichannel access strategy with high channel
    utilization but a low collision rate for multiuser cognitive radio networks. To
    overcome the dimension explosion and instability of the multi-agent system, we
    proposed a CTDE framework for distributed DSA problem based on MARL. In the training
    phase, the cognitive users sent their observation-action function to the central
    trainer deployed on the edge computing server to learn a cooperative strategy.
    In the execution phase, the cognitive users made access decisions autonomously
    according to their local observations. There was no coordination information exchange
    between the cognitive users, which reduced the communication overhead greatly.
    We validated the proposed CoMARL-DSA algorithm in various environment settings
    and compared with the state-of-the-art DQSA algorithm. From the simulation results,
    we observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the DQSA algorithm in terms
    of convergence speed and achieved performance. Authors Figures References Citations

    February 2024 1 Introduction Recent decades have witnessed rapid growth in the
    number of wireless devices, which has greatly enhanced the demand for spectrum
    bands. Like any other natural resource, the availability of frequency spectrum
    is also limited. Previously, in spectrum regulation, the fixed spectrum access
    policy was adopted where a fixed portion of the spectrum is allocated to a group
    of users. Thus, they have the license to use that particular frequency band whenever
    they want. Several studies on actual spectrum measurement [1,2,3] have revealed
    that most of the licensed frequency bands experience a very small amount of utilization
    most of the time. In fact, in the report [1] published by Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) in November 2002, the Spectrum Policy Task Force noted that:
    “In many bands, spectrum access is a more significant problem than physical scarcity
    of spectrum, in large part due to legacy command-and-control regulation that limits
    the ability of potential spectrum users to obtain such access.” Therefore, we
    need to enhance spectrum utilization by enabling opportunistic frequency reuse
    to maintain the sustainable growth of wireless technology. This has highly motivated
    the design and practical implementation of cognitive radio [4,5,6], which confronts
    the spectrum shortage by increasing the opportunistic usage of frequency bands.
    In contrast to the traditional listen-and-talk protocol, cognitive radios make
    use of the listen-before-talk protocol, which means they can continuously adapt
    their transmission parameters with the surrounding environment where they are
    functioning. In general, there are three stages of work that enable cognitive
    radios to achieve this adaptability: spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA) and data transmission. Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) mainly consider two
    types of users: the primary users (PUs) and the secondary users (SUs). The PUs
    own frequency bands and thus they are licensed to access the spectrum anytime
    they wish. However, when the PUs are not active, the corresponding channels remain
    idle which leads to poor utilization of spectrum resources. The key concept behind
    CRNs is to lend these channels temporarily to the SUs or the unlicensed users
    with the condition that they will evacuate the channels as soon as the PUs are
    reactivated. Thus proper spectrum hand-off is essential in CRNs and this necessitates
    the monitoring of each PU’s idle/active state by the SUs through spectrum sensing.
    Once the spectrum sensing is done, the idle channels need to be assigned to the
    SUs to ensure dynamic spectrum access. This is not a trivial task as it involves
    competition among the SUs for the channels. Finally, each SU can send the data
    packets through the frequency band allocated to it. Throughout the whole process,
    the PUs’ concern that the interference caused by the SUs might affect its own
    transmission must be taken into account. Again, though the PUs have a higher priority
    in CRNs over the SUs, some performance guarantees must be provided to the SUs
    so that they can benefit from the opportunistic spectrum usage. The conflicts
    among the PUs and the SUs in CRNs have been addressed in existing literature from
    different viewpoints. In particular, the game-theoretic approaches have attracted
    the attention of many researchers, as the game theory has been widely accepted
    as a tool for analyzing interactions among multiple rational agents, each one
    having its own motive. The concepts of non-cooperative games and Nash equilibrium
    have been applied [7, 8] to the CRNs to determine optimal strategies on behalf
    of the PUs and the SUs. Also, the choice of Nash equilibrium, Pareto optimality,
    and evolutionary dynamics has been studied in existing works [9, 10]. Bargaining
    games and coalitional games are generally explored for resource allocation [11]
    and distributed spectrum sensing in CRNs [12]. For channel assignment and spectrum
    leasing, various types of auction games and matching theory have been used [13,14,15].
    The survey paper [16] summarizes the contributions of many other research works
    at the intersection of game theory and CRNs. In this paper, we want to focus on
    the applications of the Stackelberg game to model the dynamic interactions between
    the PUs and the SUs in CRNs and discuss some recent works published since 2010.
    Unlike other duopoly models where the agents make decisions simultaneously, the
    Stackelberg game considers two types of players—a leader and a follower. The leader
    takes action before the follower reserving the first mover’s advantage. Thus a
    similarity can be observed immediately between the Stackelberg game and the working
    of CRNs assuming the PUs are the leaders and the SUs are the followers. The optimal
    strategies can be achieved by investigating this framework. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides a brief introduction and mathematical
    formulation for the general Stackelberg framework. The contributions of the research
    work focusing on the power and spectrum allocation in CRNs using the Stackelberg
    game have been discussed in Sects. 3 and 4 respectively. Section 5 describes various
    difficulties and future scopes in tackling the problem of resource allocation
    for CRNs applying the Stackelberg framework. Section 6 concludes the paper. Fig.
    1 System model of CRN Full size image 2 Preliminaries In economics, the Stackelberg
    game is a duopoly model of the strategic interactions between two firms. The leader
    firm makes the first move and then the follower firm takes its action. The feature
    that makes Stackelberg game distinct from other duopoly models such as the Cournot
    game and Bertrand game is the sequential decision-making of the firms. Let us
    consider the leader firm outputs \\(q_l\\) quantity of a product and the follower
    firm outputs \\(q_f\\) quantity. If the function \\(\\varPi (.)\\) determines
    the market price, then the price of the product is \\(\\varPi (q_l+q_f)\\). We
    assume \\(C_l(q_l)\\) and \\(C_f(q_f)\\) to be the cost functions of the leader
    and the follower firm respectively. Thus, the profit of the leader firm is revenue
    minus cost: $$\\begin{aligned} U_l(q_l)=\\varPi (q_l+q_f)\\cdot q_l - C_l(q_l),
    \\end{aligned}$$ (1) and the profit of the follower firm is given by: $$\\begin{aligned}
    U_f(q_f)=\\varPi (q_l+q_f)\\cdot q_f - C_f(q_f). \\end{aligned}$$ (2) The solution
    of the Stackelberg game can be obtained by finding out the subgame perfect Nash
    equilibrium. The leader first anticipates the best response of the follower and
    then chooses its own action. Then the follower observes the leader’s move and
    plays its best strategy. This is called backward induction method. To maximize
    \\(U_f(q_f)\\), we differentiate (2) with respect to \\(q_f\\) and set it to zero.
    $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial U_f}{\\partial q_f}=\\frac{\\partial \\varPi
    (q_l+q_f)}{\\partial q_f}\\cdot q_f +\\varPi (q_l+q_f)-\\frac{\\partial C_f(q_f)}{\\partial
    q_f}=0. \\end{aligned}$$ (3) Let us assume the solution of (3) is \\(q_f^*(q_l)\\).
    Substituting it in (1) and maximizing \\(U_l\\) with respect to \\(q_l\\), we
    obtain the best strategy of the leader by solving (4). $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned}
    \\frac{\\partial U_l}{\\partial q_l}=&\\frac{\\partial \\varPi (q_l+q_f^*(q_l))}{\\partial
    q_f}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial q_f^*(q_l)}{\\partial q_l}\\cdot q_l+\\frac{\\partial
    \\varPi (q_l+q_f)}{\\partial q_l}\\cdot q_l\\\\&+\\varPi (q_l+q_f^*(q_l))-\\frac{\\partial
    C_l(q_l)}{\\partial q_l}=0. \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (4) Fig. 2 Applications
    of Stackelberg Game in CRNs Full size image With this general introduction to
    the Stackelberg game, we will proceed to examine how it has been applied for resource
    allocation in CRNs. In Fig. 1, we show the fundamental system model of a CRN with
    one PU and one SU. The SU utilizes the idle spectrum band when the PU is inactive,
    whereas the PU is concerned about the interference caused by the SU. Thus, there
    are two types of resources that require proper allocation in CRN: the transmission
    power of the PU and the channel bandwidth leased to the SU. Thus we can divide
    the research works on the applications of Stackelberg games in two broad categories
    (Fig. 2): (i) the works concentrating on the power allocation problem and (ii)
    the works concerned about the spectrum allocation problem in CRNs. Some of the
    works reviewed in this paper consider conventional CRNs whereas other works explore
    heterogeneous system models with different users having different demands and
    functioning under various types of protocols. It is evident that the resource
    allocation problem becomes far more complicated under such heterogeneous settings.
    However, it is more practical since the emerging 5G/MIMO technology facilitates
    this type of system models and also the spectrum utilization is greatly accentuated
    in such systems. 3 Stackelberg Framework for Power Allocation in CRNs In this
    section, we discuss how the problem of power allocation has been addressed in
    several recent works. Generally, the PUs in CRNs impose a penalty on the SUs for
    the interference caused by them provided that the maximum allowable interference
    is constrained by some upper limit determined by the PUs. Thus the PUs gain a
    net payoff from the SUs by setting an interference price. On the other hand, the
    SUs make a profit proportional to their throughput minus the cost of interference
    to the PUs. Thus they participate in a Stackelberg game where both the parties
    try to maximize their own payoff. Table 1 describes this general setup. The authors
    in [17,18,19] have considered this kind of a framework. Table 2 compares all the
    works on power allocation presented in this paper. In [17], a CRN with one PU
    and multiple SUs has been investigated. There are multiple frequency tones available
    to be shared among the SUs. The authors have proved the existence of a unique
    Nash equilibrium in case of weak interference among all users and provided a distributed
    algorithm to compute the optimal strategies. The channel model does not include
    fast fading or shadowing effects and the perfect channel information is considered
    to be available at primary and secondary nodes in the network which is a serious
    drawback of this work. The revenue function considered here is piece-wise linear
    which simplifies the optimization problem. The main contribution is to provide
    a general framework for applying the Stackelberg game to CRNs. However, the case
    of multiple PUs is not explored. Thus here all the frequency bands are owned by
    a single PU which reduces the flexibility and opportunistic gain utilized by cognitive
    radios throughout the network. Finally, the complexity of the algorithm rapidly
    increases with the number of SUs and thus the scalability of the scheme is quite
    restricted. Table 1 Setup of Stackelberg Game for Power Allocation Full size table
    A price-based power allocation model for CDMA-based CRNs has been proposed in
    [18] considering a single PU and multiple SUs in the system. Similar to [17],
    an interference power constraint to the PU has been considered but this work is
    more general in the sense that the primary and secondary networks are separated
    here. Thus the two types of users are served by different base stations (BS).
    The utility for the PU is non-concave which makes the maximization problem hard
    to solve. Using the variable substitution method, the authors have transformed
    the non-concave problem into an equivalent convex optimization. Finally, an algorithm
    of linear complexity in the number of SUs is provided to calculate the optimal
    values. However, the work does not consider an ad-hoc cognitive radio system and
    is only limited to the slow-fading environment. Again, the discussion about the
    practical implementation of the scheme raises few questions. The PU is assumed
    to have complete knowledge about channel gain which is impractical. Again, the
    channel state information from the SUs to the BS is sent to the PU as feedback
    which increases communication overhead in the control channel. Furthermore, there
    is no defense mechanism to enable the system protecting the PU and innocent SUs
    against some arbitrary intrusion by malicious SUs. The authors in [19] have developed
    a joint precoding and power allocation scheme for a cognitive cellular system
    equipped with fractional frequency reuse (FFR). There are various traditional
    techniques for frequency reuse. However, FFR outperforms those methods by redistributing
    spectrum bandwidth between the cell-edges and cell-centers and thus reduce the
    interference among the users on edge. It can potentially contribute to efficient
    spectrum sharing among the interior users also. To implement FFR in this work,
    typically the primary base stations are deployed at the cell centers and the SUs
    are distributed in cell centers and edges. A Stackelberg game has been formulated
    to maximize the SUs’ utility reserving a higher priority for the QoS and data
    transmission requirements for the PU. The proposed scheme has been shown to improve
    overall bidding strategies, resulting in a more efficient spectrum auction. However,
    this work considers only a single PU and hexagonal cell instead of complex network
    topology. The argument behind this is that any complex topology can be divided
    into multiple regular portions. This directly limits the work since it does not
    consider a spatial point process distribution of the nodes in the network. An
    analysis treating multiple PUs as leaders might be interesting for heterogeneous
    networks. Table 2 Comparison of different power allocation schemes using Stackelberg
    Game Full size table In [20], the authors have investigated a CRN where the PU
    can adjust its transmission power to meet its minimum rate requirement. The PU
    first jointly optimizes power allocation and its interference price in this scheme.
    Then the SU maximizes its utility as a follower. Additionally, an incentive-based
    method has been considered so that the PU and the SU cooperate with each other
    in their power allocation and thus keep the social welfare optimum. Finally, the
    work has been extended from the single SU to multiple SUs scenario to achieve
    enough flexibility in system modeling. The Stackelberg equilibrium is obtained
    by a distributed algorithm which does not use perfect channel state information
    assumption. To find its equilibrium strategy, the PU employs Brent’s method which
    is an iterative procedure to solve single-variable optimization without taking
    derivative of the objective function. The most important contribution of this
    work is to optimize the social welfare in order to mitigate the monopolistic pricing
    mechanism of the PU. However, for multiple SUs scenario, the social optimum is
    unstable and hence the authors consider an incentive-driven functioning of the
    scheme to motivate the SUs in participating in the Stackelberg game. The system
    design in this work relies on several real-world assumptions that contribute to
    the potential impact of the scheme. An interference pricing-based resource allocation
    strategy has been discussed in [21], where a single primary base station (PBS)
    collects revenue from the SUs in the network. The authors have introduced uniform
    and non-uniform sensing-based interference pricing schemes for the SUs, which
    respectively allow channel access at the same and different prices for the users.
    The joint PBS revenue and SU utility maximization problem is formulated as a Stackelberg
    game. Also, a maximum tolerable interference limit is set to restrict SU transmission
    power. The proposed resource allocation strategy is studied under two different
    imperfect spectrum sensing scenarios in CRNs namely the sensing-based spectrum
    sharing (SBSS) and the opportunistic spectrum access (OSA). In SBSS, the SUs cause
    interference when they correctly identify the active status of PBS; whereas, in
    OSA, the interference happens due to incorrect spectrum sensing and misdetection
    of the PBS to be idle. Experimental result shows that a higher PBS revenue and
    SU throughput can be achieved in SBSS compared to what is observed in OSA. However,
    none of the previous works consider multiple PUs which is a common criticism of
    the former methods. The authors in [22] have argued that the single PU setting
    does not exploit the full potential of cooperation over the whole network and
    hence this work explores a network with multiple PUs. In this model, the SUs work
    as relays to the PUs and a Bayesian framework has been employed to evaluate whether
    an SU is trustworthy or not. This provides necessary protection against dishonest
    or malicious SUs that can damage the PUs performance. The Stackelberg game is
    formulated to obtain optimal transmission power and spectrum access time of the
    SUs. Two types of cooperation have been studied involving the utility maximization
    of the PUs and the cluster formation of SUs to maximize total spectrum access
    time across all the channels. There are several interesting contributions of this
    work. The cooperation between PUs and SUs have considered in a per time-slot basis
    where the SUs relay the packets of PU and transmit their own packets with the
    remaining amount of resources. An SU can increase its utility by being trustworthy.
    Furthermore, the authors have considered a weight matching problem to assign each
    SU to a suitable PU as a relay. Also, the competition between multiple SUs for
    gaining access to a particular channel is modeled. However, the proposed scheme
    seems to be too much complicated for practical systems. Specifically, it is difficult
    to achieve proper cooperation between the PUs and the SUs over multiple channels.
    Also, this work assumes perfect channel state information is available which is
    not very realistic for practical implementation. In [23], the authors have investigated
    cross-layer design for physical and network layer in energy harvesting CRNs. They
    have considered various practical constraints including the random changes in
    harvested energy, data generation, and channel state. In the network, each PU
    harvests energy from its surroundings and also can buy power from the grid. But
    SUs have only harvesting capabilities. The goal of the users is to minimize individual
    buffer delay during transmission. The PUs are protected and prioritized over the
    SUs by a signal-to-interference constraint. A stochastic Stackelberg game has
    been proposed in a single PU-multiple SUs framework first and then the extension
    of algorithms to multiple PUs scenario is provided. If the PUs have the SUs’ private
    information, they can anticipate SUs’ response to their own strategies by solving
    a stochastic mathematical program with complementarity constraints (SMPCC). However,
    assuming that the private information of SUs is unavailable to the PUs, the authors
    have developed a Nash Equilibrium-based re-Optimization (NEO) algorithm and verified
    its convergence theoretically. An online algorithm is also designed namely Greedy
    one-slot Game (GoG), which requires information from the current transmission
    slot only. Furthermore, the NEO algorithm has been adapted as a bi-Layer re-Game
    (biLG) algorithm for multiple PUs scenario. The authors in [24] have studied a
    cooperative cognitive wireless powered communication network (CWPCN) with a cognitive
    base station (CBS), multiple SUs, and wireless powered PUs. They have modeled
    the interaction between the CBS and the PUs as a Stackelberg game. Thus, in contrast
    to other works, CBS acts as a leader here and the PUs are the followers. The action
    profile for the CBS is to determine the price for energy transferred to PUs whereas
    the PUs decides the transmission power of the CBS. The Stackelberg problem formulation
    is convex and thus can be solved by the interior point method. However, note that
    this paper does not consider the stochastic nature of channel state and energy
    harvesting. Also, their problem formulation between single CBS and multiple PUs
    is equivalent to the single PU-multiple SUs scenario and thus does not investigate
    the complexities of a practical network model. For heterogeneous wireless networks,
    energy efficiency is a critical issue due to increasing restrictions on energy
    consumption by the transmitters spatially distributed over the network. The resource
    allocation and dynamic spectrum utilization for femtocell cognitive radios have
    been addressed in [25]. Two types of femtocells are considered namely the standalone
    femtocells which are too far away from each other to experience the co-tier interference
    and the collocated femtocells suffering from the interference power. The spectrum
    band of each macro user is shared by several standalone and collocated femtocells.
    The utility functions for two types of femtocells are defined as the energy efficiency
    minus the cost of transmission. However, this work does not provide details about
    the discrimination between the standalone and the collocated femtocells. In real-world
    systems, the difference between these two types of users might not be clear and
    thus one might need to consider some geometric constraints among the randomly
    deployed nodes. Also, the penalty charged for interference to the macro base station
    (MBS) is the same for the standalone and the collocated femtocells which could
    have been different as the standalone femtocells will cause less interference
    than the collocated femtocells due to their distant position from the BS. Finally,
    the backward induction method is used to solve the Stackelberg game and the uniqueness
    of the solution is justified. In the follow-up work [26], the authors consider
    a similar system model with quadratic utility function for the BS and propose
    a low complexity gradient assisted binary search algorithm to solve the Stackelberg
    game. The utility for the SUs is measured as the revenue gained from energy-efficient
    transmission minus the cost. Assuming a linear demand structure for spectrum bands,
    the utility for the BS is defined. However, this assumption is not justified properly.
    Additionally, a utility for the primary network has been considered in terms of
    the revenue gathered by leasing the spectrum bands. Next, a three-stage Stackelberg
    game has been formulated where first the primary network broadcasts spectrum prices
    to cognitive BS, then cognitive BS receives the channel state information from
    the SUs and finally, the spectrum bands are bought for transmission. The Stackelberg
    equilibrium is obtained using the gradient iteration algorithm which converges
    to near-optimal solutions in finite steps. The main limitation of this work is
    that it is essentially a centralized scheme that depends on feedback passed from
    the SUs to the BS. Thus, the communication overhead in the feedback channels is
    too high and the practical implementation of such a system lacks scalability.
    Also, the assumption of perfect channel information is not realistic. The authors
    in [27] introduce a two-stage Stackelberg game between the spectrum providers
    and SUs in the heterogeneous cognitive system. The spectrum providers equipped
    with distributed cloud computing facilities keep track of idle frequency bands
    in cellular, satellite or WiMAX networks distributed over certain geolocations.
    If an SU wants to transmit data, it first sends its location to the spectrum provider
    in order to obtain information about vacant channels in its location. Two subgames
    are defined for the power allocation among the SUs and the price selection among
    the spectrum providers. The solutions of these games are obtained by finding out
    the best response of the players. This work allows the SUs to opportunistically
    access multiple idle bands simultaneously. Also, it assumes a distributed setup
    among the agents in the network which is an immediate advantage. However, the
    interference among the SUs is not taken into account for the mathematical formulation.
    Also, the spectrum providers are assumed to contain perfect information about
    the location of free channels and the SUs. This is quite impractical from the
    point of view of users’ privacy concerns in the network. Again, considering the
    fact that the spectrum bands belong to different types of wireless networks, their
    availability cannot be homogeneous and hence the spectrum providers should determine
    the price charged to the SUs based on the particular identity of a channel. 4
    Stackelberg Framework for Spectrum Allocation in CRNs In this section, various
    proposed schemes using the Stackelberg game will be discussed for spectrum allocation
    in CRNs. Table 3 illustrates the general setup for formulating the game and Table
    4 describes all the works on spectrum allocation that we present in this survey.
    The SUs, in general, pay a price for spectrum access which constitutes the revenue
    gathered by the PU. This price depends on the amount of spectrum leased to the
    SUs. The spectrum pricing mechanism has been modeled in various works such as
    [28,29,30], considering the monopoly of the PU which implies that the PU can increase
    the price anytime to make the SUs’ net payoff zero. Table 3 Setup of Stackelberg
    game for spectrum allocation Full size table The authors in [28] proposed a four-stage
    spectrum pricing and allocation scheme. A CRN with a virtual network operator
    is considered along with a group of users. The backward induction of the four-stage
    Stackelberg game has been introduced in this network. The fourth stage deals with
    spectrum allocation formulating a game between the SUs and the operator and maximizing
    the utility. The third stage is focused on the optimal pricing of the spectrum
    bands on behalf of the operator. The net revenue is maximized in this stage with
    respect to the per-unit price. Optimal leasing and sensing are discussed in the
    second and first stages respectively where the maximum of revenue is obtained
    with respect to the leased and sensing bandwidth. The mathematical formulation
    is simple which allows the authors to incorporate the spectrum sensing and dynamic
    spectrum access in their model simultaneously. The most significant observation
    made by this work is that the spectrum resource can be obtained through low cost
    and uncertain spectrum sensing. A proper trade-off can be made between the expected
    profit and variation of realized profit by choosing the proper sensing realization
    factor. Finally, the authors show that when this factor is unknown, it can be
    estimated using the machine learning algorithm. However, there are several limitations
    to this work. First, no interference between the SUs has been taken into account.
    Also, perfect sensing outcome has been assumed which is not practical. Again,
    the assumption of perfect channel state information is too ideal. Another problem
    is whether the four-stage backward induction is possible in the real-world since
    this sequential decision making requires a synchronous mode of operation. For
    example, in a large-scale network, the operator may need to decide how much spectrum
    bands should be leased before obtaining the sensing results. Finally, a more generalized
    network model should consider multiple operators which are absent in this work.
    In [29], a pricing-based spectrum trading mechanism has been developed. The authors
    have constructed a spectrum market with the monopoly of one PU first and then
    extended it to multiple PU scenario where each PU can sell the idle portion of
    their frequency bands to the SUs. After spectrum sensing, the SUs can access the
    channel randomly and this has been modeled as slotted ALOHA and carrier sensing
    multiple access (CSMA). A \\(\\alpha\\)-fair utility is used for the secondary
    nodes whereas, the utility of the monopoly PU is defined as the total revenue
    collected from the SUs constraining their expected number of successful transmission
    according to the price paid. The Pareto optimal solution is obtained that maximizes
    the SU throughput maintaining the corresponding budget constraint. Next, when
    multiple PUs enter the market, the problem is formulated as a three-stage Stackelberg
    game. In the first and second stages, the PUs determine the available spectrum
    opportunities and pricing for the spectrum bands. The final stage assigns the
    SUs to the PUs according to their demand. Similar to [28], the backward induction
    starting from the final stage has been implemented here. Though this work has
    incorporated various practical design constraints, there are few open issues.
    The spectrum utilization is quite poor under slotted ALOHA. If the slotted ALOHA
    is replaced by a more complicated spectrum access method, the mathematical analysis
    will be restricted for large-scale approximations only. In that case, the methodology
    developed in this work may not be feasible in real-world systems. Thus, further
    investigation is required considering heterogeneous spectrum owners and multiple
    SUs. In the follow-up work [30], the authors consider a similar system model and
    provide a Pareto-optimal solution. Exploiting the decentralized structure of this
    solution, the SUs can compute spectrum access probabilities locally and this motivates
    the authors to formulate a distributed algorithm. As the contention among the
    SUs results in frame collisions in slotted ALOHA and the channel utilization suffers,
    the system model with CSMA techniques has been implemented as well and the improvements
    in the revenue for PUs under CSMA are explored due to the increased cooperation
    and awareness among the users. In the case of multiple PUs, the Stackelberg framework
    has been utilized assuming both the PUs and the SUs to be rational and selfish.
    The Nash equilibrium is computed as the intersection between the best-response
    functions of the players. This work does not consider heterogeneous PU which might
    be an interesting extension of this scheme. Also, perfect channel sensing is considered
    in this work. Again, to calculate the optimal spectrum pricing, the PUs collect
    budget information from the SUs. This can create a potential problem if the SUs
    are not truthful in reporting their actual budgets. One can utilize a VCG price-setting
    where the truthful reporting would be the dominant strategy as the departure will
    always hurt the utility of an agent. Finally, the scalability of this work needs
    to be explored because the computation overhead might increase with the number
    of PUs and SUs in the market and also with fading and shadowing effects in the
    interference-limited networks. Table 4 Comparison of different spectrum allocation
    schemes using Stackelberg game Full size table The authors in [31] have proposed
    a joint optimization scheme integrating the Stackelberg game and matching theory.
    Considering PUs and SUs as selfish and rational agents, spectrum leasing price
    and spectrum allocation factor can be dynamically handled using the low-complexity
    decentralized framework offered by the matching theory. The payoffs for PUs and
    SUs are first maximized in a Stackelberg interaction and then the one-to-one stable
    pairing between them is facilitated via a stable marriage algorithm. Thus, both
    the pairing problem and spectrum pricing problem are dealt with simultaneously.
    In this work, the authors have considered a network with single primary and cognitive
    base stations and multiple PUs and SUs. The users access the channel using time-division
    multiplexing. In each frame, there are three phases: spectrum leasing, SUs acting
    as PUs’ relay, and SU transmission. The SUs have to pay price for causing interference
    in the relay transmission phase and using spectrum in the SU transmission phase.
    However, this work does not consider channel state fluctuations. Also, it is not
    explained how the joint optimization will be performed in an online setting. Numerical
    results demonstrate that the matching framework has significantly improved the
    overall spectrum efficiency. In [32], the authors have explored spectrum allocation
    in Cognitive Radio-based Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for Smart Grid communication
    with heterogeneous user terminals (UTs). The goal is to maximize the utility of
    the NAN gateway by differential pricing of UTs. The problem can be formulated
    as a Stackelberg game and the subgame perfect equilibrium can be achieved by the
    backward induction method. There are 4-stages of the Stackelberg game: Sensing
    stage, Leasing stage, Differential pricing stage, and Spectrum allocation stage.
    First, the NAN gateway determines the amount of available spectrum by sensing.
    Then, the spectrum that will be leased is decided based on sensing results from
    the first stage. Next, the differential pricing is set according to the demand
    of UTs. Finally, each UT maximizes its utility by selecting an optimal amount
    of spectrum. Observing the structure of the solution, the authors have also provided
    some insights into real-world pricing techniques. The authors in [33] have introduced
    a recall-based CRN with heterogeneous primary spectrum owners and multiple SUs.
    PUs are served at the primary owners based on a first-come-first-served rule.
    It has been assumed that the PUs arrive as a Poisson process and when the spectrum
    bands are idle, the primary owners lease those bands to the SUs. Due to the random
    arrival of the PUs, there might be a sudden demand for spectrum by the primary
    owners and therefore, the primary owners reserve the right to recall back a portion
    of the spectrum given to the SUs. This prevents degradation in the overall utility
    of the primary owners. In order to lease the spectrum bands to the SUs and to
    recall them back if necessary, the authors have proposed a two-stage solution.
    The first stage involves a combinatorial spectrum auction where the primary owners
    report idle spectrum bands to a centralized spectrum broker. The SUs also send
    their sealed bids to the broker. Finally, the sellers and the bidders are grouped
    to maximize social welfare. To make sure that some dishonest SU does not benefit
    from the auction, VCG pricing mechanism has been applied in this work which makes
    truthful bidding the dominant strategy. Once the SUs are selected for leasing
    the channels, we move to the second stage of the recall-based pricing game. Here
    the utility of the SUs is defined as the net throughput minus the price to be
    paid to the primary owners plus the compensation received by the SUs if its spectrum
    band is recalled. The primary owner needs to provide this compensation to every
    selected SU in the auction if their spectrum band is suddenly taken back. Thus,
    the utility of the primary owners is measured by the revenue gathered minus the
    compensation provided to the SUs. The spectrum allocation scheme developed in
    this work is thorough yet easily implementable. The simulation results also show
    significant enhancement in spectrum efficiency due to the proposed scheme. A heterogeneous
    cognitive sensor network has been considered in [34]. The sensor nodes in the
    network opportunistically convey their readings to the next hop when the spectrum
    is idle until the sink has been reached. Also, the actor nodes in the network
    are equipped with renewable power sources and programmed to act on the sensed
    outcome. Thus the Stackelberg game in this network is defined with the actors
    as followers and the BS as the leader. The utility of the actor node is defined
    as the throughput achieved over the minimum rate requirement minus the cost of
    accessing the idle spectrum bands. On the other hand, the base station accumulates
    the revenue from the actor nodes and also maximizes the payoff for the licensed
    nodes. Thus the game is formulated with these two sets of utility functions and
    the backward induction method is used to solve this game. A closed-form solution
    is available without considering the spectrum access strategy of licensed users.
    But if the max rate access principle is taken into account, the formulation becomes
    complicated. The max rate principle states that the licensed users will connect
    to the BS that provides them the best data rate. Thus it adds some additional
    constraints to the utility maximization problem of the Stackelberg game. Indeed,
    the optimization can no longer be solved analytically and the authors propose
    a numerical algorithm to solve the problem. The major contribution of this paper
    is to utilize the Stackelberg framework in the context of wireless sensor networks.
    However, the scheme described in this work is centralized and hence can be difficult
    to implement in reality. In [35], the author has proposed a joint spectrum allocation
    and pricing scheme for cognitive multi-homing networks. The hierarchical game
    theory framework is adopted to model the heterogeneous cognitive network as an
    oligopolistic market. The spectrum pricing and subchannel allocation have been
    considered under both constant and variable bit rate. The Stackelberg game is
    formulated with the primary operators as leaders and the secondary mobile terminals
    as followers. The product of utilities of the mobile terminals is maximized via
    a bargaining framework. Once optimal spectrum allocation is achieved, a Bertrand
    game is defined to obtain the spectrum prices for the primary network operators.
    Thus there are two distinct levels in this scheme. The solution of the bargaining
    game accommodates various desirable properties such as Pareto optimality, independence
    of irrelevant alternatives, invariant under affine transformation, etc. Again,
    the Bertrand game is solved by obtaining the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium
    strategy in terms of spectrum prices. Finally, the joint spectrum pricing and
    allocation algorithm is developed using the backward induction method. Also, the
    signaling overhead and complexity analysis for this algorithm have been included
    in this work. However, perfect channel information is assumed here. Also, the
    spectrum pricing policy could have been elaborated based on the heterogeneous
    nature of the primary operators in the network. Furthermore, instead of considering
    flawless channel sensing, a more realistic scenario might be explored incorporating
    quantities like the probability of misdetection and false alarm, etc. The authors
    in [36] have constructed a joint pricing and decision-making scheme for serving
    the heterogeneous user demand in a CRN with two primary operators, multiple PUs
    and SUs. The concept of virtual queues has been utilized where the SUs wait before
    dynamically accessing the free channels. This work considers a four-queue system
    supporting two kinds of service priorities for the POs. Again, in addition to
    single-band spectrum sharing between POs and SUs, multiband spectrum handover
    is also investigated where each PO has multiple idle channels to lease to the
    SUs. This has been formulated as M/M/s queueing system. Introducing a pre-emptive
    resume priority (PRP) M/M/1 queueing model, the authors have defined the utility
    of the SUs as the service value minus the cost. The cost has two parts. The fixed
    part is due to admission into the queue of a particular PO and the variable part
    is proportional to the waiting time in the queue. The solution to the decision-making
    problem of the SUs has been obtained as the Wardrop equilibrium. The spectrum
    pricing has been implemented using a Stackelberg framework. For single-band sharing,
    the backward induction was enough to solve the game. In the case of the multiband
    spectrum sharing, the POs must decide the number of channels to lease as well
    as the price and hence the problem becomes complicated. The global particle swarm
    optimization algorithm has been used to solve this problem. This work can be easily
    extended for multiple POs competing against each other. The authors have provided
    extensive simulation results to demonstrate the performance of this scheme. Other
    queueing models can also be investigated assuming imperfect spectrum sensing by
    the SUs. 5 Research Challenges and Future Directions Stackelberg game is very
    popular for modeling the resource allocation problem in CRNs. However, there are
    several challenges in applying this framework for practical wireless systems.
    Let us first consider the power allocation problem. The proper interference modeling
    is at the heart of the optimal power analysis. One particularly important tool
    for interference design is stochastic geometry. But often it makes the mathematical
    expression complicated. This becomes a problem while solving the Stackelberg game.
    Another challenge is to estimate the channel. Under multipath fading and large-scale
    shadowing environment, one must consider the outage probability and the ergodic
    capacity of the users to formulate the utility functions. Otherwise, the game
    formulation becomes unrealistic for actual design purposes. Again, the spectrum
    allocation problem has gained much attention due to rapid growth in the demand
    for frequency bands. The key issue here is how to set the spectrum prices. Often
    a linear demand function on behalf of the SUs has been implemented which is too
    simple. Most of the works so far illustrate a uniform valuation of spectrum bands.
    Considering a heterogeneous primary network, the price design must recognize the
    diversity among the population of primary nodes. Also, we may need to prioritize
    different categories of PUs. The auction-based games such as English and Dutch
    auctions, seal-bid auctions, etc might be useful for setting up the spectrum cost
    by bidding over the users. Another aspect of resource optimization is the nature
    and functioning of the algorithm. A centralized algorithm may converge to the
    global optima. However, it is very difficult to implement in practice due to the
    huge amount of information it needs to process. Often, in reality, we do not care
    about optimal solutions. A satisfactory outcome with some performance bound is
    good enough most of the time. Hence, distributed algorithms will be preferred
    over centralized ones in many situations. Distributed algorithms also require
    less information to process and hence the communication overhead between several
    cooperating nodes is greatly reduced. Finally, the heterogeneous networks and
    MIMO systems have been widely popular these days. The cognitive radio, being a
    promising future technology, has many scopes in these domains of research. Two
    main design parameters namely energy and spectrum efficiency are critical for
    multiple antenna communication. Several constraints make resource allocation a
    truly challenging problem in cognitive MIMO networks. Stackelberg games can be
    applied in such situations to prioritize the set of primary users over secondary
    nodes to facilitate opportunistic spectrum usage while protecting licensed users.
    Therefore, all these new interesting directions might be explored in the future
    to develop resource allocation schemes for adaptive efficient wireless networks
    equipped with cognition and self-organizing ability. 6 Conclusion In this paper,
    we have investigated the recent literature on the applications of the Stackelberg
    game for resource allocation in both homogeneous and heterogeneous Cognitive Radio
    Networks (CRNs). A comprehensive review of the related works has been presented
    broadly separating in two categories. The first category deals with the power
    allocation problem among the users in the network and the second category contains
    the spectrum allocation schemes between the primary and secondary nodes. The main
    issue while obtaining optimal strategies corresponding to Stackelberg equilibrium
    is to reduce the computation overhead and required information in order to facilitate
    the flexibility and scalability of the scheme for practical system design. However,
    we mention the advantages and drawbacks of each individual work elaborately and
    also provide some insights about possible improvements. Finally, we have discussed
    potential future research directions for applying the Stackelberg game in order
    to allocate network resources in upcoming advanced fifth-generation networks and
    design modern cognitive systems with better spectrum efficiency and performance
    guarantees. Availability of data and material All data and material available.

    networksintelligent techniquesmachine learning Introduction The exponential growth
    in the demand for extra spectrum resources become more prominent to support numerous
    wireless services leads to the advent of new technologies for high-speed data
    networks (X. Zheng et al., 2008). According to Cisco, global mobile data traffic
    will increase sevenfold between 2017 to 2022 (Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global
    Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2017–2022, 2018). But radio spectrum is an
    inherently limited resource in which frequency bands are exclusively assigned
    to the licenced users called Primary User’s (PUs) for a long term basis which
    leads to spectrum scarcity in a particular spectrum band. In contrast, a survey
    of spectrum utilisation being conducted by the Federal Communication Commission
    (FCC) has indicated that many portions of the radio spectrum are not in use, called
    spectrum holes, for a significant amount of time which leads to under-utilisation
    of the assigned spectrum. To overcome this problem, FCC reforms the spectrum allocation
    policy and allows unlicensed users, also known as secondary users/Cognitive Radios
    (CRs) to borrow unused radio spectrum from licenced users through Dynamic Spectrum
    Access (DSA) (FCC, 2003). The CR as an intelligent radio that can be reprogrammed
    and reconfigured dynamically. Such intelligent radio automatically detects available
    channels in the wireless spectrum, changes accordingly its transmission and reception
    parameters to switch between available vacant spectrum bands dynamically. This
    process is known as Dynamic Spectrum Access which can be realised only with CR
    networks (Akyildiz et al., 2008). Figure 1 presents a system model showing the
    available spectrum holes of various networks such as Television, GSM, Satellite,
    and Wi-Fi. CR requires a spectrum hole for its application which requires intelligent
    techniques to access the spectrum dynamically. The intelligent spectrum management
    includes spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility.

    CRs having multiple requirements. Display full size Figure 2. The fixed spectrum
    allocation policy. Display full size Figure 3. The dynamic spectrum allocation
    policy. Display full size Figure 2 shows the currently fixed spectrum allocation
    policy decided by governmental agencies. Due to this fixed spectrum allocation
    policy, some frequency bands are highly utilised and some are lightly utilised.
    It is observed from Figure 2 that networks 1 and 2 are lightly utilised whereas
    networks 3 and 4 are highly utilised. It is shown that there exist large numbers
    of spectrum holes of heterogeneous networks that can be utilised with dynamic
    spectrum allocation policy. Figure 3 shows a dynamic spectrum allocation policy
    where CR access the unused spectrum. Thus, the demand for extra spectrum bands
    for wireless applications can be solved with flexible usage of available spectrum
    holes. As an intelligent wireless network, CR shares the spectrum with PUs in
    an opportunistic manner to avoid interference among multiple spectrum users with
    its learning abilities to adapt and act in a dynamic environment (Xu et al., 2014).
    To address the problem of spectrum scarcity, each CR:(Akyildiz et al., 2008).
    Determine the presence of spectrum holes called spectrum sensing. Determine available
    channels including spectrum selection, routing protocol, and reconfiguration called
    spectrum decision. Allocation of resources and serve its users without causing
    interference to PUs called spectrum sharing. Vacate the channel on the arrival
    of PUs called spectrum mobility. The most important issue is how to access the
    spectrum dynamically without interference with PUs. This requires CR which is
    intelligent by nature and having learning capability to learn from past experiences,
    which is an essential part of intelligence. Haykin envisioned CR as an intelligent
    wireless communication system that is based on the methodology of understanding
    by building to achieve two goals: highly reliable communication and efficient
    utilisation of radio resources (Khozeimeh & Haykin, 2012). To perform these tasks,
    CRs must be equipped with intelligence like a human (Zafari et al., 2019). The
    implementation of such capabilities requires functional architecture like the
    brain to access the spectrum efficiently i.e. Cognitive Engine (CE) (Dong et al.,
    2012). The CE acts as a brain of CR to perform various cognitive functions intelligently
    and provides learning capabilities to implement the cognitive cycle by making
    use of machine learning algorithms. The CR technology is based on Software Defined
    Radio (SDR), which allows the radio to reconfigure through software, based on
    the interaction with the surrounding environment in which it operates. However,
    in recent years machine learning algorithms in CR networks gains a lot of attention
    from researchers (Kotsiantis, 2007) (Thilina et al., 2013). A look at a recent
    literature survey on CR networks reveals that various leaning techniques are proposed
    that have been applied to numerous CR applications (Yau et al., 2012)(A. He et
    al., 2010). Some authors presented machine learning techniques, particularly focused
    on spectrum sensing and decision making in CR networks (Abbas et al., 2015). Further,
    CR has to work under unknown environments where complete Channel State Information
    (CSI) is not present or only partial CSI is available but it has to estimate the
    behaviour from other CRs present in network to coordinate its actions. Another
    author surveyed machine learning techniques for decision making and feature classification
    in different environmental conditions. In general, learning becomes an indispensable
    part of CR if the input-output relation of the system is not known, or as in the
    case of CR networks, due to channel uncertainty. Thus, learning becomes a necessary
    tool to estimate that channel characteristics to reduce error probability (Zafari
    et al., 2019). In CR’s, several parameters need to be adjusted simultaneously
    such as availability of spectrum (Tripathi et al., 2011), transmit power (G. Yang
    et al., 2015), adaptive coding and modulation schemes (Zafari et al., 2019), antenna
    selection, rate control (Hanif et al., 2011), spectrum handoff (Thakur et al.,
    2017), etc., and it is not possible to identify and adjust all these parameters
    simultaneously. Thus, learning techniques can be applied to perform specific CR
    tasks with efficiency and accuracy. An overview of an existing literature survey
    is presented in Table 1. The survey reveals that most of the authors have shown
    their interest in the specific issue of spectrum management. Most of the authors
    provide different types of solutions to address the spectrum scarcity problem.
    Some of the authors specifically discuss a problem related to spectrum management
    whereas no work has been presented with machine learning techniques for dynamic
    spectrum management which includes spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum
    sharing, and spectrum mobility. In this survey, spectrum management with intelligent
    techniques, considering learning as an important parameter has been discussed.
    In particular, we provide an in-depth discussion on different types of intelligent
    techniques such as Artificial Neural Network, Metaheuristic Algorithms, Support
    Vector Machine, Bayesian Learning, Game Theory, and Hidden Markov Models. The
    pros and cons of each technique in the context of spectrum management have also
    been discussed. We firstly present a spectrum management framework. Then we introduced
    various intelligent techniques used in CR networks as well as a survey of state-of-the-art
    achievements of these techniques for dynamic spectrum management in CR networks.
    The major contributions of this paper are summarised as follows: This paper presents
    a comprehensive survey of various intelligent techniques and presents their applications
    in CR networks. The target of this paper is to provide a focused survey of these
    techniques and evaluates its performance in spectrum management as major CR tasks
    which include spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum
    mobility. This paper presented state-of-the-art achievements in applying intelligent
    techniques to CR networks along with their strength and limitations to provide
    an overview of active research in the area of CR networks. The paper discusses
    research issues and challenges that are still an open issue and need the attention
    of researchers. Table 1. Comparison with an existing literature survey Download

    the spectrum management framework for CR networks. The taxonomy of various intelligent
    techniques is presented in Section 3. The evaluation of intelligent techniques
    along with their strengths and limitations are presented in Section 4. Section
    5 presents research issues, challenges, and future directions in the area of spectrum
    management. Finally, the concluding remarks are given in Section 6. Spectrum management
    framework To address the critical challenges associated with the co-existence
    of PUs and CRs in CR networks, CRs are required with the following functions in
    spectrum management: Interference Management: The important role of CR is to resolve
    the interference issues with PUs which can be resolved in two manners: Proactive:
    In this, the CR switches its communication before the arrival of PUs. Reactive:
    CR switches its communication after the arrival of PUs. Quality of service (QoS)
    Awareness: In heterogeneous networks, the selection of an appropriate spectrum
    band is necessary to provide QoS aware communication CR technologies provide intelligent
    spectrum management capabilities that could meet the ever-increasing demand of
    spectrum, thus empowers radio with etiquette to avoid interference. The complete
    spectrum management framework is presented in Figure 4. It shows that CR spectrum
    management framework has four main steps: Figure 4. The complete spectrum management
    framework. Display full size Spectrum Sensing: The first step of spectrum management
    starts with spectrum sensing on the arrival of CR. Spectrum sensing provides the
    ability to detect the spectrum holes (in terms of the frequency band, location,
    duration of availability) and PU activity by periodically sensing the spectrum
    and use it without interference with PUs (Noorshams et al., 2010). Spectrum Decision:
    Spectrum decision includes spectrum analysis and decision making. It deals with
    the selection of appropriate spectrum bands according to the required QoS. The
    spectrum hole is characterised, with various parameters such as multipath environment,
    operating frequency, interference, link delay (Pourpeighambar et al., 2017) and
    number of PUs using the spectrum, being considered (X Liu et al., 2013). After
    spectrum analysis, the decision has been made to access the spectrum hole. Various
    optimisation techniques can be applied to obtain optimal decisions depending upon
    the radio environment whether it has to optimise single objective or multiple
    objectives (Ramzan et al., 2017). Spectrum Sharing: The main function of spectrum
    sharing is to avoid collision among the CRs as multiple users trying to access
    the spectrum while maintaining QoS. Spectrum sharing deals with coordination among
    CRs to access the shared channels, resource allocation, and spectrum access (Kour
    et al., 2018)(Akyildiz et al., 2008). The spectrum allocation includes the assignment
    of spectrum band in a cooperative (Bayrakdar, 2020). or non-cooperative manner
    using handshaking protocols of transmitter and receiver (X Liu et al., 2013).
    The spectrum access includes collision avoidance among CRs in the access phase
    Spectrum Mobility: Spectrum mobility deals with spectrum handoff and connection
    management. CRs are usually regarded as visitors which often need to switch from
    one spectrum hole to another on the arrival of PUs in a dynamic environment (Christian
    et al., 2012). Spectrum mobility utilises a reactive and proactive approach for
    the detection of PUs whereas connection management ensures that CR continuously
    transmits its data in a new spectrum hole (Thakur et al., 2017). Intelligent techniques
    in cognitive radio networks A CR as an intelligent wireless device, which is aware
    of its environment, capable of learning and adapt from its surrounding environment
    and learning considered to be an indispensable component of an intelligent system
    which is considered to be a basic tool of CRs for dynamically access the available
    spectrum without interfering with PUs. CR must have the capability to learn from
    current observations and past experiences. However, CR has to work under different
    radio environments in which CR might have full or partial CSI or sometimes under
    a completely unknown environment. However, not being idealistic, due to fluctuations
    in the wireless channel, channel estimation errors, and quantisation errors, it
    is not possible to obtain perfect CSI. Thus, CR might apply an intelligent algorithm
    to estimate its actions concerning other CRs for spectrum management. Various
    techniques in CR networks are shown in Figure 5. Intelligence with artificial
    neural networks Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) provides Artificial intelligence
    (AI) which aims to incorporate intelligence in machines so that machines can perform
    like an expert. Also, machine learning, a subclass of AI, gained a lot of attention
    from the researchers in CR networks. Learning can be classified as supervised,
    unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (Jiang et al., 2017)(Duda et al., 2001).
    Supervised learning learns from the training set and requires prior information
    about the environment. On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require
    any training set and it performs self-adapting actions without any prior knowledge
    about the environment. Figure 5. Intelligent techniques in CR networks. Display
    full size Reinforcement learning or learning with critic, the learning agents
    learn by observing actions of other agents, and its performance is influenced
    by learning regime and operating environment (Duda et al., 2001)(Dandurand & Shultz,
    2009). However, it is a particular point of interest here that how these intelligent
    algorithms have been applied to access the spectrum dynamically. In this section,
    we present various ANN techniques that can be applied to CR networks. Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) Artificial Neural Network (ANN or simply NN) consists of
    several interconnected neurons, identical to the human brain, which is made up
    of real biological neurons. The first artificial neuron was introduced in 1943
    by the neurophysiologist W. McCulloch and logician Walter Pits. ANN composed of
    a large number of artificial neurons which are interconnected to each other that
    mimics the behaviour and natural processing of biological neuron .i.e., learning
    and organisation (Tsagkaris et al., 2008). The human brain can perform fast due
    to its special ability of parallel data processing and NN tries to mimic the behaviour
    of solving narrowly defined problems. As stated earlier, NN consist of a pool
    of neurons, and these neurons are configured in the form of layers and connected
    to other nodes with links defined by the weight w j k , which determines the effect
    of the signal of a neuron j on a neuron k . In NN, three types of layers are present,
    which are distinguished as the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The
    input layer consists of neurons, which receive data whereas output layers consist
    of neurons, which send data out from the NN layer and the hidden layer consists
    of neurons whose input, and output remain in NN. Each neuron within NN uses some
    activation function to process the input signals s k it receives from (a) neighbours
    belonging to different layers (b) external sources. The type of activation function
    used depends on the problem to be addressed. Types of NN and Machine Learning
    In this section, we describe different NN models. Supervised NNs In supervised
    NNs, the input and output are known and its objective is to discover the relationship
    between two. The two main NN models are as Feed Forward NNs (FFNNs) and Recurrent
    NNs (RNNs). FFNNs are further classified as: Single layer FFNNs (SL-FFNNs) and
    Multilayer FFNNs (ML-FFNNs). Feed Forward NNs In FFNNs, neurons feed their values
    in the forward direction. It is of two types describes as: Single-layer FFNN (SL-FFNNs):
    It consists of single-layer of neurons. Due to its single-layer network, learning
    and training mechanism is easy but it has limited utility, as it is not able to
    solve real-world complex problems. Multilayer FFNN (ML-FFNNs): It consists multiple
    layers (hidden layers) between input and output layer. These hidden layers solve
    complex problems using the activation function. As stated earlier, some activation
    function is required to process the information, and the selection of activation
    function depends on the problem to be solved. Table 2 shows various types of activation
    functions to address different problems. Table 2. Types of the activation function
    Display Table Various type of ML-FFNNs using different activation functions leads
    to slight variation in the network. (Tumuluru et al., 2010), designed a multilayer
    spectrum predictor using a neural network, which does not require prior knowledge
    of traffic characteristics of PUs. CR may predict channel status based on sensing
    history which further saves sensing energy. (Liu et al., 2015) proposed ML-FFNN
    based dynamic Chinese restaurant game for spectrum sensing, which considered CR
    as customers to learn the table state (available spectrum hole) in the restaurant
    (network). Some important examples of ML-FFNNs include Radial Basis Neural Networks
    and Convolutional Neural Networks which are described below: Radial Basis Neural
    Networks (RBNN): RBNN composed of three layers: input layer, hidden layer, and
    output layer. The hidden layer consists of neurons using a Gaussian transfer function
    gives the output as Y j = ∑ j w j exp − r x − r μ 2 σ j 2 (1) In Gaussian transfer
    function, x → is input, μ ⃗ j and σ j represents centre vector and width of j
    t h neuron in hidden layer respectively, which need to be calculated for each
    neuron, ||.|| denotes Euclidean distance. However, an initial value of the centre
    vector and width affects the prediction ability of the network. An unsupervised
    learning technique i.e. K-means clustering (K-RBF) algorithm can be used to obtain
    the values of centre vector and width of the hidden neurons associated to construct
    and train RBNN in a more accurate way. The output of the transfer function weighted
    and summed as shown in Equation (1) . Zhang (S. Zhang et al., 2013) proposed K-RBF
    for spectrum sensing based on previous information of the PU spectrum which reduced
    prediction error to one-third as compared to RBF. Researchers proposed a design
    of CE based on the RBF and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for multi-objective optimisation.
    RBF has strong learning capability while GA is good at multi-objective optimisation
    (Y. Yang et al., 2012). Convolutional Neural Networks (Conv-Nets or CNN): CNN
    is another variant of ML-FFNN that has been used effectively in the areas of image
    recognition and classification. CNN exploits spatially local correlation by enforcing
    local connectivity with adjacent layer neurons, which does not take entire data
    from preceding layers. LeNet was the very first CNN which become an important
    tool for machine learning. Key operations of CNN include convolution, non-linearity
    (ReLU), pooling (or sub-sampling), and classification (Fully connected layer).
    For example, when an image is passed to CNN, features are extracted from the image
    using convolution preserves the spatial relationship between pixels of an image
    by utilising a small square of input data. Another operation i.e. ReLU has been
    performed after convolution, which introduces non-linearity in CNN. ReLU stands
    for Rectifier Linear Unit, which is an element-wise non-linear operation (applied
    per pixel) and replaces negative pixels in feature map by zero. Pooling operation
    can be done after convolution+ReLU operation, which can be done in different ways
    such as sum, average, max, etc. This operation reduces the dimensionality of each
    feature map by only retaining important information. Finally, the classification
    process is done. The output extracted from previous operations extract high-level
    features that are used for feature classification of the input image. The term”
    Fully connected” means every neuron of the preceding stage is connected to every
    neuron of the succeeding stage that classifies and forms various classes based
    on the training dataset. Further, CNN can be trained using gradient descent and
    backpropagation (Lecun et al., 1998). Backpropagation calculates the gradients
    of error concerning all weights in the network and updates weights and parameter
    values using gradient descent to minimise an output error. Lee (Lee et al., (
    2019) cooperatively implemented the CNN spectrum sensing technique, in which optimal
    strategy is used for combining sensing results of individual CRs obtained using
    CNN. Sensing based on deep neural networks is used to learn from a large set of
    data through a backpropagation algorithm. Deep sensing provides optimised combining
    strategy based on spectral and spatial correlations of channel i.e. based on the
    location of CRs and PUs characteristics. Selim et al. ( 2018) presented the CNN
    spectrum monitoring framework for radar bands in spectrum sharing scenarios. The
    main idea behind this framework is to detect the presence of radio signals in
    the radio spectrum even when this signal is overlapped by other signals due to
    simultaneous transmission. (b) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) The idea behind
    RNN is to make use of sequential information, with the output being dependent
    on previous computations. Here, the neurons are connected in a cyclic manner,
    which allows exhibiting dynamic temporal behaviours shown in Figure 6. Unlike
    FFNNs, RNN does not propagate information directly to the next connected layer
    but use their internal memory to process the input. Figure 6. Recurrent neural
    network. Display full size RNN are called recurrent because they perform the same
    operations for every element in the input sequence. Let X t , O t and H t be the
    input, output, and state of the hidden layer(s) on time t . In simple mathematical
    form, RNN can be expressed as O t = F ( H t , θ ) (2) H t = F ( H t − 1 , X t
    ; θ ) (3) where the parameter θ defines weight and bias for the network. Equation
    (2) states that output O t at a particular time t depends upon the state of the
    hidden layer H t and θ . Further, H t depends upon its previous states H t − 1
    and input X t at a time t as stated in Equation (3) . To train RNN, the backpropagation
    algorithm through time approach is used which ‘unfold’ RNN in time and converted
    into FFNNs consisting of identical copies of RNN. RNN consist of a large number
    of layers as compare to ML-FFNNs and also training process is based on the passage
    of information through these layers and propagation of unsuitable information
    through the network leads to the accumulation of large error which leads to inaccurate
    results. Usually, the gradient descent method is used for backpropagation training.
    Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN): DRNN (Tang & Li 2017) consists of multiple
    hidden layers that enable the prediction of the spectrum of multiple time slots
    in CR networks since existing methodology only predicts the spectrum of a single
    slot. Here, the channel state is divided into slots and forming time series of
    channel state. Due to multiple hidden layers in DRNN, it is difficult to train
    using a gradient descent method, which leads to slow convergence and gradient
    disappearance. To avoid these problems, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimation
    of weights is used which overcomes the problem of slow convergence and vanishes
    gradients in a gradient descent method. Unsupervised NNs As the name indicates
    unsupervised NNs only know the input and the main objective is to discover patterns
    in features of input data. The system learns using certain test dataset and allows
    a lower-dimensional representation of input data. Unsupervised ML-FFNNs (Auto-encoders)
    Auto-encoders are the type of FFNNs specially designed for dimensionality reduction.
    In other words, auto-encoders provide the same output as the input. In auto-encoders,
    encoder function learns from input to representation and decoder function back
    from representation to input i.e. reconstruction. Denoising auto-encoders (Bengio
    et al., 2013) are the extension of basic auto-encoders, which attempts to address,
    identify function risk by introducing noise. Random noise is added to the input
    in the form of percentage and then this noisy data is fed in auto-encoder, which
    finds correlations within the input data to find correct data instead of noise
    added data. In Sparse auto-encoders, a sparsity constraint on the hidden layer
    is applied for extracting interesting features from unlabelled data even if numbers
    of hidden layers are large. Authors proposed a novel modulation classification
    method using denoising sparse auto-encoder as a classifier to improve spectrum
    sensing, i.e. to avoid interference with PUs (Zhu & Fujii, 2016). Moreover, the
    denoising process improves the performance of noise suppression by training the
    network with a corrupted database. Further, Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) emerged
    as a powerful unsupervised learning framework for generating complicated data.
    They can learn a low dimensional representation of high dimensional data (Doersch,
    2016). Contractive Auto-encoders (CAE) make use of explicit regulariser which
    learns a function even in slight variations of input values. CAE adding a well-chosen
    penalty term to cost function which enables an auto-encoder to perform better
    (Rifai & Muller, 2011). (b) Unsupervised Recurrent NNs (URNN) URNN is a complex
    type of NNs, which are inspired by ideas from statistical physics which model
    system as an energy function. RNNs are computationally powerful and learn from
    the temporal behaviour of given training data. Compared to the FFNN, RNN is more
    powerful in representing complex dynamics and having a compact size. Two main
    types of URNNs are Hopfield Network and Boltzmann Machine, which are described
    next. Hopfield NNs: Hopfield NNs is a dynamic auto-associative model, which can
    store information in a dynamically stable structure. Each Hopfield network has
    some energy function (Lyapunov function) associated with it, which always tries
    to converges to a local minimum of the function. Hopfield NNs is biologically
    plausible, as its working is similar to the human retina. Hasegawa (Hasegawa et
    al., 2014) proposed an optimisation algorithm for decision making on radio resources
    in centralised and decentralised CR networks. In a decentralised network, the
    energy minimisation dynamics of Hopfield NNs are considered. Boltzmann Machine(BM):
    BM is a stochastic RNN, like the Hopfield network, in which the network unit finds
    a global minimum of the energy function. BM is designed for discrete variables
    having the disadvantage of being slow. Another problem with BM is it stops learning
    correctly when the machine statics grows exponentially with the size of the machine
    and with the magnitude of connection strength. Other variants of BM are Restricted
    Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). Restricted Boltzmann
    Machine (RBM): As the name indicates, a restriction is imposed with neurons that
    they have symmetric connection between different groups of nodes but no connections
    between the same group of nodes which allows more efficient training algorithms
    than BM. MohanaPriya and Shalinie ( 2017) presented a secure routing protocol
    for CR networks. The RBM algorithm self learns the routing procedure between source
    and destination node. Further, it provides energy-efficient routing to prevent
    flooding attacks. Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM): DBM (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009)
    have the potential to learn complex internal state representations, which is useful
    in speech recognition problem. It also develops high-level representations to
    tune its model for a specific task from unlabelled data as well as from limited
    labelled data. Unsupervised competitive NNs Unsupervised competitive learning
    is a form of unsupervised training where output neurons are said to compete for
    input patterns. It employs a winner-take-all strategy since only winning neuron
    is updated. Two major techniques of unsupervised competitive learning are a. Self-Organising
    Maps/Kohenon Maps Self-Organising Maps (SOM) are the special class of ANN, which
    is inspired by the cortex of the human brain. SOM makes use of competitive learning
    in which neurons compete with each other to win and then the winner neuron displaced
    to feature space to form clusters. The competition is induced by inserting negative
    feedback between neurons, which forces neurons to organise themselves. For obvious
    reason, such a network is called self-organising maps. SOM was introduced by Kohenon
    used to assist CRs to choose among various configurations to operate by considering
    bit rate predictions (Tsagkaris et al., 2012). Khozeimeh and Haykin ( 2012) proposed
    a self-organising dynamic spectrum management technique for CR networks in which
    CRs continuously senses the environment, extract PUs and neighbouring CRs activity
    patterns, and store to obtain knowledge that significantly reduces the probability
    of collision. b. Adaptive Resonance Theory Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is
    another class of unsupervised competitive NNs that is designed for object identification
    and recognition based on matching between observer expectations and sensory information.
    This ART matching criterion is set by vigilance parameter, ƿ (threshold of recognition).
    High vigilance permits weight updation of winning recognition neuron while low
    vigilance inhibits weight updation of recognition neuron and search procedure
    is carried out(Carpenter et al. 2016). Another variant of ART is ART 1 and ART
    2. ART 1 is the simplest type of ART which accepts an only arbitrary sequence
    of binary input patterns whereas ART 2 supports analog inputs patterns as well
    as binary input patterns (Carpenter & Grossberg, 1987). In CR networks, a channel
    sensing algorithm based on ART-2 is proposed for cognitive wireless mesh networks
    in which the spectrum is divided into disjoint sub-bands and sensing is performed
    in each sub-band. This sensed information is further fused in a fusion centre,
    which is defined as a pattern classification problem. In this algorithm, only
    pattern phase information is considered which leads to wrong pattern classification
    (Zhu et al., 2008). Further modified ART-2 is described which considers amplitude
    as well as phase information. Reinforcement learning and NNs Reinforcement Learning
    (RL) is another AI approach that enables an agent (decision maker) to observe
    its state, choose an action in a particular state to obtain rewards. The transition
    from one state to another depends on several factors such as previous state, action
    taken, and next state. The main goal is to estimate the reward function for each
    state-action pair accumulates knowledge and maximise reward function. To apply
    the RL model (single-agent approach), identified by state, action, and reward.
    In the multi-agent approach, the set of agents is enabled to learn about each
    other information to maximise its reward function. Unlike supervised NNs, it does
    not have any prior knowledge about its input and output. It learns online from
    the environment and builds the knowledge to achieve its objectives. RL in the
    context of CR networks which provides intelligence in terms of dynamic channel
    selection, spectrum sensing, routing, spectrum allocation (Y. Wang et al., 2019),
    power control mechanism (K.L.A. Yau et al., 2014). Further, enhanced RL techniques
    in CR networks have also been presented. The authors in (Saleem et al. 2015) addressed
    routing issues by clustering mechanisms using the RL approach. Further, routing
    based clustering improves network stability and scalability. Moreover, spectrum
    aware cluster-based routing is presented which overcomes the challenges of multihop
    routing. In RL, an agent maps the situation (channel state) to maximise its reward
    function on a long term basis. The agent learns continuously and the environment
    responds to the state through its action by state transition after each epoch.
    The agent uses optimal policy to decide each time while taking the next step which
    maximises its rewards. To obtain an optimal policy, the Dynamic Programming approach
    can be used when perfect information about the system is available. The system
    is modelled using Markov property which makes the RL model equivalent to Markov
    decision Process (MDP). On the other hand, when perfect system information is
    not available, but the sequence of past state, action, and rewards are available
    then the Monte-Carlo method can be applied to obtain an optimal policy. Another
    approach named Temporal Difference (TD) learning approach does not form the system
    model and obtain its optimal policy based on prediction. Q-Learning (Q-L) and
    SARSA are the most widely used TD learning techniques (Sutton & Barto, 1998).
    These schemes are implemented for resource allocation in CR networks and it is
    observed that SARSA converges slower than Q-L as shown in Figure 7. This is due
    to the reason that Q-L follows a greedy approach for action selection according
    to off-policy whereas SARSA selects its action corresponding to the current policy
    obtained. Figure 7. Comparison between the performance of Q-L and SARSA schemes.
    Display full size Lo et al., ( 2010) proposed RL based cooperative spectrum sensing
    model in which CR learns to find an optimal set of cooperative neighbours which
    reduces sensing delays. Further, RL based optimum solution is provided which improves
    spectrum sensing under the shadowing effect. The reward function depends on reporting
    time delay i.e., the time duration between CRs request of cooperation to neighbouring
    node and arrival to sensing outcome. The authors in (Li, 2009) proposed Q-Learning
    to address resource allocation problems in a multi-agent environment. Koushik
    (Koushik et al. 2018) discussed RL based spectrum handoff and issues related to
    RL during handoff. In this paper, the authors presented hardware implementation
    of RL and Transfer Learning (TL) schemes to update its Q-value table greedily
    and shown that RL takes longer time to converge than TL which has expert node
    to transfer its knowledge in form of Q-table. Figure 8. Illustration of fuzzy
    logic in CR networks. Display full size Combinational NNs Neuro-Fuzzy NNs Fuzzy
    logic is an attractive technique, particularly where it is difficult to express
    the mathematical model of real-world problems. In fuzzy Sets, elements are assigned
    a certain degree of belongingness. The numbers in the range [0,1] are used to
    represent the degree of belongings. Fuzzy logic becomes a useful scheme to represent
    uncertain data. The fuzzy logic controller consists of three main components as
    shown in Figure 8. Fuzzy Interface: Converts real-world values to suitable fuzzy
    sets. Interference Engine: Interference engine uses a knowledge base to decide
    output for a specific combination of input fuzzified variables and maps into output
    variables. Defuzzy Interface: Converts output fuzzy sets to real-world values.
    The authors (Salgado et al., 2016) proposed a fuzzy algorithm is proposed for
    decision making and particularly for backup channels for spectrum mobility. This
    proposed algorithm based on multiple criteria decision-making techniques considers
    four parameters: availability probability of channel, estimated channel time availability,
    the signal to interference plus noise ratio of the channel, and bandwidth of the
    channel. Normalised weights (describes a relative degree of importance) are assigned
    according to the importance of each criterion for the selection of a backup channel.
    The pre-selection of back up channels decreases delay during spectrum mobility.
    The authors (Matinmikko et al., 2009) proposed a fuzzy-based cooperative spectrum
    sensing technique. In this technique, spectrum sensing decision from the individual
    node is considered as input, fuses to form output based on combined sensing result.
    Spectrum sensing performance has been characterised based on the probability of
    false alarm and probability of detection in a fading environment. However, fuzzy
    logic represents uncertain data, but it is difficult to design the degree of belongingness
    set. So Fuzzy logic combined with neural networks and forms the neuro-fuzzy combinational
    model. Neuro-fuzzy based spectrum mobility technique due to its capability to
    deal with uncertain environmental conditions as well as in the heterogeneous environment.
    This technique considers interference, bit error rate, and signal strength to
    find the quality of the channel in terms of fuzzy patterns. Based on generated
    fuzzy patterns, neural .networks trained to estimate channel gain, not only for
    spectrum mobility but also for spectrum assignment in a heterogeneous network
    (Maheshwari & Singh, 2015). b. Wavelets NNs Wavelet NNs replaces standard activation
    function (like a sigmoid function) by wavelet activation function. A wavelet is
    a small function that grows and decays in a finite amount of time. Unlike Fourier
    transform, wavelet NN can distinguish between stationary and non-stationary signals.
    Figure 9. A daughter wavelet neuron. Display full size However, wavelet NNs uses
    wavelet function (called mother wavelet) to derive daughter wavelet function ψ
    λ , t ( u ) through linear translation factor, t and scale/dilation factor, λ
    as shown in Figure 9. The daughter wavelet is expressed as ψ λ , t ( u ) = ψ t
    − u λ (4) An author in (Eltholth, 2016) proposed a spectrum predictor model, which
    is based on a discrete wavelet transform nature that produces a time-frequency
    representation of the analysed signal. The analysed time series is broken into
    sub-series, which represents the previous occupancy status of a certain set of
    sub-channels. Thus, design an accurate wavelet NNs based spectrum predictor model
    with less complexity. Wavelet approach for wideband spectrum sensing is sub-divided
    into small bands and characterised by frequency irregularities. Wavelet transform
    and multiscale wavelet approach have been used to detect local irregularities
    that carry information about power spectral density and structure irregularities
    of sub-bands that identify spectrum holes (Tian & Giannakis, 2006). Other NNs
    Quantum NNs Quantum NNs (QNNs) is based on quantum mechanics exploiting quantum
    information processing to improve classical ANN. In classical ANN, much of the
    power is required due to its massively parallel, distributed information processing
    and non-linear transformation operation performed by nodes. On the other hand,
    QNN makes use of powerful quantum parallelism, which provides quantum computing
    to process huge data sets. The author (Liu, 2016) presented QNN based spectrum
    sensing algorithm in which quantum neuron with multiple energy levels is considered
    as the excitation function of hidden layer neurons. Further, the improved version
    has been presented to increase convergence speed and stability. Table 3 summarises

    (SVM) is supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression
    analysis. It is based on statistical learning theory with structural risk minimisation
    (Awe et al., 2013). It is initially preferred for the classification of complex
    problems. For a given training set, the input training vector belongs to one or
    another class of two groups. These two groups are separated by an optimal hyperplane
    that has the largest distance to the nearest training set of any class (maximal
    margin classifier) that achieves good separation. It is easier to train SVM when
    the classes are linearly separable. In non-separable classification, non-linear
    SVM is obtained by introducing a kernel function. The function is said to be valid
    kernel if it satisfies Mercer’s Theorem (Hofmann, 2006), which provides necessary
    and sufficient characterisation of a function as a kernel function. A kernel represents
    a similarity measure in the form of a similarity matrix (Gram Matrix) between
    its input objects. The gram matrix fuses all the necessary information for learning
    algorithms merged in the form of the inner product. For more details, refer (Burges,
    1998). SVM to develop a real-time approach to sense PU as shown in Figure 10.
    The input composite signal includes signal and noise, which is independent of
    each other in the time domain. The sampled data is classified as PU or not based
    on testing and training of the SVM classification model. Figure 10. A diagram
    showing the basic idea of SVM for spectrum sensing. Display full size For linear
    classification, a kernel function is proposed to map input low dimensional vector
    into high dimensional features space (Zhang & Zhai, 2011). Y. Wang (Wang et al.,
    2014) proposed a spectrum mobility prediction scheme that considers time-varying
    and space varying characteristics of mobile CRs simultaneously. The joint feature
    extraction pattern is proposed which executes spectrum mobility prediction through
    the classification of SVM with fast convergence speed. The authors in Huang et
    al., ( 2009) presented an SVM based learning engine that is divided into three
    parts as environmental awareness, knowledge actuation, and decision making. The
    learning engine acquires knowledge about the environment through learning that
    puts intelligence in CRs. Table 4 summarises DSM with SVM in CR networks. Table

    with metaheuristic algorithms a. Genetic algorithm (GA) GAs are stochastic search
    algorithms, which effectively solve machine learning and image processing problems
    (Jedlicka & Ryba, 2016). The main advantage of using GA is parallelism, which
    speeds up its simulation results. The computation in GA starts with the collection
    of chromosomes, which has certain characteristics. The algorithm can be implemented
    using the following steps as shown in Figure 11 (Siddique & Azam, 2010). Initialise
    the population of chromosomes. Evaluate the fitness level of each chromosome to
    rank them. Construction of the new population until the production of next-generation
    completes using the following steps: Selection: The best chromosome is selected
    from the currently available population based on its fitness level. Crossover:
    With crossover probability, selected chromosome reproduces to generate a new individual.
    Mutation: Newly generated individuals will be mutated at a definite point in the
    chromosome. The above steps are repeated until the desired results are obtained.
    In CR networks, the GA uses biological behaviour representing each channel by
    a chromosome. Each gene of the chromosome represents specific parameters. In the
    spectrum decision process, it is all about the fair distribution and utilisation
    of available resources, and for fair resource distribution, optimal distribution
    is required. According to L.Doyle, ‘An optimization process can be defined as
    the process involved in selecting the best choice from the list of available choices
    to reach some kind of goal or at least as near as possible to goal’ (Doyle, 2009).
    In CR networks, spectrum allocation also involves an optimisation task to assign
    spectrum holes to CR found during the spectrum sensing process. Figure 11. Illustration
    of genetic algorithm for CR networks. Display full size The spectrum allocation
    scheme for CR networks using GA in which each gene of chromosome represents different
    parameters (data rate, frequency, bandwidth, error rate, and modulation/coding
    scheme) which is associated with specific weight (Siddique & Azam, 2010). The
    weight for each gene represented in binary form. Like the weight for each gene
    in the chromosome fitness point for each gene is assigned. Once the fitness of
    each gene in the chromosome is calculated, the next step is the construction of
    a new population, which involves selection, crossover, and mutation process. The
    whole process is repeated until the optimum solution among the available solution
    set is achieved. The authors in (Morabit et al., 2015) presented spectrum decisions
    based on GA to provide a new spectrum band as requested by CR in the network.
    GA defines radio in terms of genes and chromosomes and considers user quality
    of service (QoS) as an input to the GA procedure. Further, chromosome population
    size is defined by available spectrum resource size and chromosome genes define
    the efficiency of spectrum allocation. b. Ant colony optimisation (ACO) ACO considered
    as computational technique proposed by Dorigo which is based on the searching
    behaviour of Ants (Dorigo et al. 1997). Although real arts are blind, the search
    their food source via the shortest path by play on the information through a substance
    called pheromones. The ants on its transmission route release this liquid substance,
    which is accumulated on the shortest route and soon ants, start to follow the
    smallest route. The behaviour of real ant has inspired the ant system, which resolves
    many complex problems successfully. The characteristics of the ACO algorithm i.e.
    parallel computation, self-organisation, and positive feedback that can help CR
    to achieve self-adaption and learning capability to achieve global optimisation
    (Q. He et al., 2013) (Bayrakdar & Çalhan, 2018). Different steps in the ACO algorithm
    are as follows: Ant probability distribution rule: In the ant system, artificial
    ants release the solution through moving among vertex follow the principle as:
    p i j k ( t ) = [ τ i j ( t ) ] α [ η i j ( t ) ] β ∑ s ∈ C [ τ i j ( t ) ] α
    [ η i j ( t ) ] β i f j ∈ C (5) where p i j k ( t ) is state transition probability
    of ant moving from vertex i to j at the time t . C is a set of vertex and s is
    unselected vertex in the traversing process. τ i j ( t ) and η i j ( t ) are pheromone
    intensity and heuristic visibility (cost) of a direct route between the node i
    and j . The parameters α and β controls the importance of pheromone and heuristic
    information respectively. 2. Local optimisation procedure: To avoid residual pheromone
    submerging heuristic information, pheromone will keep updated after one ant finishes
    a path searching with follows the principle as: τ i j ( t + 1 ) = ( 1 − ρ ) .
    τ i j ( t ) + ρ . τ 0 (6) where τ 0 is the initial pheromone value and ρ is the
    evaporation coefficient of pheromone. 3. Global optimisation procedure: When all
    ants complete the cycle, the pheromones will be globally updated as: τ i j ← (
    1 − α ) . τ i j + α . 1 G max (7) where α is constant and G max is the maximum
    objective function. 4. Stopping procedure The procedure is stopped after completing
    a predetermined number of cycles to achieve the globally best solution. The author
    in (Jhajj, 2017) discussed the ACO technique to find the optimal sensing time
    of CR. As CR has a fixed time frame for its sensing the environment and transmission
    of data, an optimal sensing time is required that will maximise throughput with
    minimum interference with PUs. This optimal sensing time can be found by ACO which
    implements the above steps to find an optimised solution. The ACO has been proposed
    for reconfiguration decision making in CR networks (Q. He et al., 2013). Reconfiguration
    means configure terminals and network devices to intelligently adapt to environmental
    conditions, which is a challenging task. ACO deals with complex environmental
    conditions as well as target multi-objective optimisation through parallel computation.
    Moreover, ACO learns from the environment and reconfigure spectrum decision through
    self-organisation process. Three types of reconfiguration schemes have been considered
    i.e. parameter variation reconfiguration scheme, radio resource management reconfiguration
    scheme and network access reconfiguration scheme and showed the improved performance
    in the heterogeneous network. A dynamic channel assignment as an optimisation
    problem to maximise the reward of CRs is formulated in (He & Zhang, 2012). The
    algorithm also considers interference with PUs and SINR constraints of CRs to
    maximise the spectrum utilisation. Table 5 summarises DSM with metaheuristic algorithms
    in CR networks. Table 5. Summarises DSM with a metaheuristic algorithm in CR networks

    signifies the importance of prior distribution which represents knowledge of unknown
    parameters in uncertain environmental conditions. It is assumed that no prior
    information is available about the spectrum but some prior information is available
    about the status of the channel which should be explored through learning. Bayesian
    inference is an approach where Bayes’ rule is used for driving posterior distribution
    from the prior distribution which further considered as prior for another posterior
    distribution and so on. In CR networks, CRs can compute the prior distribution
    of a system parameter θ , denoted by P ( θ ) , which represents the spectrum occupancy
    status of PUs. Though spectrum sensing, data observed in n time slots X = [ x
    1 , x 2 , . . . . . . . . x n ] . The likelihood functions of the parameter θ
    , P ( X / θ ) , for observed data, conditional on parameter θ . After acquiring
    prior probability distribution and the likelihood function, Bayesian inference
    can be used to derive posterior density function, P ( θ / X ) which is conditioned
    on data X . Bayes’ Theorem can be simply expressed as P ( θ / X ) = P ( X / θ
    ) . P ( θ ) / P ( X ) (8) In CR networks, Likelihood function denotes the probability
    of busy/idle previous states for a busy/idle current state. In Baye’s theorem,
    the posterior distribution combines the information in both the prior distribution
    function and the likelihood function, which represents stronger information and
    narrower possible values for θ . The Bayesian network has 2 types of models, Bayesian
    Parametric (BP) Model, and Bayesian Non-Parametric (BNP) Model. BP model has a
    finite set of parameters θ to compute prior distribution and In the BNP model,
    it does not mean a lack of parameters but an infinite-dimensional set of parameters
    is assumed to compute prior distribution. Recently BNP model applications in CR
    networks get a lot of attention of researchers because it provides flexibility
    to model to learn in an unknown environment. A Bayesian approach based spectrum
    sensing in CR networks is presented in (Jacob et al., 2014). The authors presented
    Bayesian inferences over single and multiple sensing frames to calculate the posterior
    distributions of unknown parameters, which forms the basis of Bayesian learning
    (Manco-vásquez et al., 2014). In Bayesian inference over multiple frames, learning
    from past samples has been done using threshold-based approximation and Kullback
    Leibler based approximation. Further, A Bayesian approach based decision-making
    engine in CR networks is proposed in (Huang et al., 2010). CE learns from an environment
    and form rules to reconfigure transmission parameters (modulation, code rate)
    which ensures QoS of CRs. The reconfiguration can be achieved with parameter learning,
    structure learning, and inference algorithms that form rules to adapt to environmental
    conditions . Table 6 summarises DSM with a Bayesian approach in CR networks. Table

    Intelligence with Hidden Markov Model Hidden Markov Model (HMM) represented as
    a stochastic process that can be modelled as a Markov chain, whose actual states
    are hidden, to analyse the temporal or dynamic behaviour of PU activity pattern.
    In HMMs, several hidden states represent the probability of distribution over
    a sequence of observations. The HMM gets its name from two properties in which
    it assumes: 1) Observations at the time t generated by some process whose state
    S t is hidden from the observer. 2) State of hidden process S t satisfy Markov’s
    property which states that for a given S t − 1 , the current state S t is independent
    of all states before ( t − 1 ) i.e. For a given S t , the output Y t is independent
    of all other time indices states and observations. HMM has found remarkable applications
    in CR networks since many environmental parameters are partially observed or act
    as hidden states. Various authors proposed HMM-based spectrum sensing schemes
    (Saad et al., 2016), (Ghosh et al. , 2009). HMM-based spectrum prediction for
    industrial applications that accurately predict through multiple slots is proposed
    in (Saad et al., 2016). Large numbers of hidden layers are considered which interpret
    as different PUs activity levels and formulate the prediction problem as a maximum
    likelihood classification approach. Akbar et al., 2007 presented a Markov based
    channel prediction algorithm and considers channel state occupancy of PUs as Poisson
    distributed. Pham et al. ( 2014) presented the HMM based spectrum handoff model
    in CR networks. The proposed approach infers the efficiency of HMM in correcting
    the sensing sequence and prediction of channel status. Further, the proposed algorithm
    applied to the spectrum mobility function in CR networks. An HMM based channel
    selection framework that minimizes the delay incurred during channel selection
    is proposed in (Senthilkumar & Geetha Priya, 2016). The proposed approach achieves
    a significant reduction in data loss and an increase in transmission speed, by
    obtaining the best-matched channel for the users. Table 7 summarises DSM with
    HMM in CR networks. Table 7. Presents DSM with HMM in CR networks Download CSVDisplay
    Table Intelligence with game theory Game theory technique accounts for multi-agent
    decision making, in which the decision of each player for action is based on the
    history of actions performed by other players. This involves the learning process
    by each player, which may ultimately lead to a stable state. Every game involves
    a set of players, actions, and payoff functions (or utility function). A player
    gets more rewards if it has a higher payoff function. Mathematically, a game can
    be represented as: G = ( N , A , P ) (9) where N represents a set of players,
    A represents a set of actions, and P represents payoff functions. In CR networks,
    the players in the games are CRs, which take actions based on observations of
    its environment in which it operates. As time progresses, CR learns from past
    actions and from observing the action of other CRs and modify its actions accordingly.
    Several types of game theory approach in CR networks are shown in Figure 12. Game-Theoretic
    Approaches: Two types of game-theoretic approaches are cooperative and non-cooperative
    games. In cooperative games, a group of players can make binding commitments and
    act jointly whereas, in non-cooperative games, the individual player acts selfishly.
    In cooperative games, cooperation among the players strengthens the position of
    the player in a game. Here the group of players forms a coalition act as a single
    entity. In non-cooperative, each user takes care of its benefit and selects optimal
    actions to maximise its payoff function. The author in (Yu, 2013) presented cooperative
    games for spectrum sensing and sharing and found that the applicability of various
    games depends on several factors. A non-cooperative game can be classified based
    on information i.e. either complete information or an incomplete information game.
    In the complete information games, each player observes other players’ information
    i.e. payoff and their action. On the other hand, with incomplete information,
    the game can be modelled as Bayesian game for decision making in which outcome
    can be estimated based on Bayesian analysis (Wang et al., 2010). Several types
    of games have been adapted to model various situations in CR networks. For example,
    in repeated games, each stage is usually repeated. Let us consider N the set of
    CRs in the network and a ( k ) denotes the action taken by a player at k t h the
    stage of the game. In each stage k , players tend to maximise their payoff function,
    while considering the history of action collected in h ( k ) = ( a ( 1 ) , a (
    2 ) , . . . . . . . . , a ( k ) ) . In other words, players map their actions
    from history a i ( k ) = f i ( h ( k − 1 ) ) . In CR networks, their action is
    the selection of channel available and mapping of action depends on the history
    of PUs activity as well as activity pattern of other CRs. In dynamic/repeated
    games, players came across a similar game number of times. The cooperation among
    the players in repeated games can be introduced to get long term benefits. The
    repeated games are applied for spectrum sharing scenarios where multiple CRs exists
    in (Li et al., 2010). In this context, repeated games apply punishments to achieve
    a desirable outcome. When the PUs activity is considered as stationary with an
    unknown environment then Stochastic games, also known as Markov games, are introduced
    to model the network. The authors in (W. Wang et al., 2018) addressed the routing
    problem using stochastic games. Stochastic routing game is decomposed into several
    stages and at each stage stochastic learning is proposed to learn equilibrium
    strategy of channel selection. Figure 12. Various game theory approaches in CR
    networks. Display full size The Stackelberg game can be modelled for implementing
    spectrum sharing where PUs can involve CRs as cooperative relays (H. Wang et al.,
    2010). In auction games, PUs act as auctioneer, selling idle spectrum bands to
    CRs which are allowed to select the appropriate bidding strategy for each channel
    to maximise their utility function. The concept of auction games has been applied
    to spectrum sharing in CR networks (Khaledi & Abouzeid, 2013), as well as in spectrum
    sensing (Sendrei et al., 2015). Table 8 summarises DSM with game theory in CR

    Table Table 9. Presents the evaluation of various intelligent techniques along
    with their strengths and limitations Download CSVDisplay Table Intelligent techniques
    evaluation: strength, limitations, and challenges Intelligent techniques having
    many advantages but their implementation still facing some challenges. The intelligent
    techniques applications in CR networks, strengths, limitations, and implementation
    challenges are summarised in Table 9. Supervised NNs: Basically, supervised NNs
    accomplished its task under supervision which requires complete knowledge about
    the environment in which it has to operate. However, in the context of CR networks,
    CRs may not have complete knowledge about the radio environment in which it has
    to access the spectrum. NNs provides a high level of feature classification but
    also required data labelling. It requires training under different environmental
    conditions and outcome depends on the selection of initial parameters. Therefore,
    the selection of data for training must be task-oriented and free from noise.
    Also, with the increase of network size, the training process slows down which
    may lead to slower convergence. To improve its efficiency, multiple hidden layers
    are introduced which requires large training data which further slows down its
    training process. Unsupervised NNs: A major challenge CRs can face a lack of knowledge
    of the surrounding radio environment. Even in this situation, CRs are expected
    to adopt changes in the environment so that they may not collide with PUs. CRs
    must be able to extract knowledge about PU activities which makes unsupervised
    NNs an appealing approach in CR networks. In unsupervised NNs, learning is based
    on a correlation among input data, and no information about the correct output
    is available. So unsupervised NNs are used indirectly for spectrum management
    in CR networks like modulation classification, optimisation algorithm for spectrum
    decision, and routing algorithms. Unsupervised Competitive NNs: As the name indicates,
    it is a form of unsupervised learning where output and input neuron compete and
    employs winner take all strategy. SOM is one of the members of this class that
    make use of competitive learning in which neurons compete with each other to win
    and winner neuron displaced to feature space to form clusters. The authors in
    (Khozeimeh & Haykin, 2012) presented SOM based DSM for cognitive ad-hoc networks.
    In this proposed scheme, PU and CR activities patterns are extracted and stored
    in memory which significantly reduces the probability of collision. SOM seems
    to be more realistic as it does not require prior knowledge about the radio environment.
    Further, the application of SOM with a different type of input pattern does not
    require redesigning the existing learning mechanism. SOM can be easily interpreted
    and understood. Moreover, it requires sufficient data to form meaningful clusters.
    Another member of this category is ART which designed for object identification,
    recognition, and pattern classification problem. It has stable and self-regulating
    control structure but it does not always guarantee stability and it has to empirically
    fix its vigilance parameter. This technique is not suitable directly for DSM in
    CR networks. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement Learning is distinct from supervised
    and unsupervised learning as it focuses on online learning rather than offline
    learning. RL learns from positive and negative reinforcement (or rewards) to set
    its training examples. RL seems to be one of the promising intelligent techniques
    to solve the spectrum management problem in CR networks. RL is used in spectrum
    sensing, spectrum decision (in the multi-agent environment and with multiple objectives),
    spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility. One of the major drawbacks of the RL
    technique is slow convergence. The authors presented hardware implementation of
    RL and Transfer learning for spectrum handoff in (Koushik et al., 2018) and found
    that RL takes a long time to adjust its learning parameters as compare to Transfer
    learning Combinational NNs: Combinational NNs have neuro-fuzzy NNs and wavelet
    NNs in this category. Fuzzy logic is an attractive technique that uses human-understandable
    fuzzy logic instead of using complicated mathematical modelling. The main advantage
    of fuzzy logic is that it is faster to train and also it requires less computational
    resources. With fuzzy logic, the solution can be obtained when the system has
    incomplete environmental knowledge. Some disadvantages of fuzzy logic are difficult
    to create its model as with increasing dimensions may lead to inefficient results.
    Further, it is difficult to estimate its membership function according to user
    requirement and it requires more tuning. Support Vector Machine: SVM comes under
    the supervised learning category which is used for object classification, pattern
    recognition, and regression analysis problem. SVM technique provides superior
    performance in many applications due to its generalisation ability and robustness
    against noise. SVM maps input vector from low dimensional feature to high dimensional
    features which make them linearly separable. For non-linear mapping, a kernel
    function is used. In CR networks, SVM is used as a classifier for signal classification.
    The sampled data is classified as PU or not based on the training of SVM. Unlike
    ANN, it is not suffered from overfitting problem and provides good performance
    in small problems. But in complex problems, it provides poor performance and may
    require a high training set which increases its computation complexity and storage
    requirements. Also, SVM requires large labelled data for training and complete
    knowledge of the radio environment which may divert the focus of researchers.
    Metaheuristic Algorithms: These algorithms solve multi-objective optimisation
    problems through parallel computation. GA provides multi-objective optimisation
    based on a fitness function but it may not always converge to the global optimum
    in case of large performance metrics. The performance of GA highly depends on
    fitness function which may be based on prior knowledge. Wrong prior knowledge
    may lead to the generation of bad chromosomes. Thus, the selection of better genes
    (each gene represents bandwidth, modulation scheme, data rate, etc.) to generate
    the next genes are very critical. Further, GA is considered a very slow process
    since fitness function is calculated through selection, crossover, and mutation
    process. GA improves its convergence speed either by combining with RBNNs or by
    increasing the number of genes. In ACO, parallel computation, self-organisation,
    and positive feedback can help CR to achieve self-adaption and learning capability
    to achieve global optimisation. ACO algorithm involves local optimum value based
    on which global optimum value is obtained. ACO can easily adapt environmental
    changes but its performance is poor for local searches. Bayesian Approach: Bayesian
    approach relies on a probabilistic model which signifies the importance of prior
    distribution to derive posterior distribution using Baye’s theorem. The Bayesian
    approach requires prior knowledge about the radio environment. Incorrect information
    may lead to skew inferences. It has high computational complexity due to high
    dimensional integrals. Bayesian learning can combine with other techniques such
    as HMM for channel quality prediction in CR networks. Dynamic Bayesian games are
    used for decision making. Further, the Non-Parametric Bayesian model-based Dirichlet
    process mixture model for unsupervised classification techniques can be used.
    Hidden Markov Model: HMM is a stochastic model based on the Markov model which
    is highly relevant to the CR network applications as environmental parameters
    that are partially observed and act as hidden states. The selection of appropriate
    models for training is a very important task in HMM. Due to the presence of multiple
    hidden layers, it is difficult to decode the sequence. HMMs have been extensively
    used in CR networks for spectrum sensing, channel selection, and spectrum mobility.
    One of the major drawbacks while using HMM is that it requires a training sequence.
    But its training process is quite complex. It can be combined with other techniques
    such as GA to improve its training efficiency. Game Theory: Game Theory is a mathematical
    model which provides a solution for self-centred multi-agent systems where the
    decision of individual agent affects other players decision. Particularly in CR
    networks, each CR act as a player and their action may include the selection of
    parameters according to user requirements. The goal of game theory is to provide
    the best outcome (optimal solution) while considering the interest of all players.
    Game-theory has been applied in several applications in CR networks such as spectrum
    sensing, decision making, spectrum access, etc. One of the major drawback while
    using game theory is to make a model which requires statistical information about
    the radio environment. As the environment is dynamic, which leads to the shift
    optimal solution before the convergence. It is difficult to structure a game that
    always provides an optimal solution. Another drawback is a limited number of players.
    As players increases, it may decrease its convergence speed which is another important
    factor need to be considered. Further, the game theory requires complete knowledge
    of the environment and also need labelled data for training. Incomplete or imperfect
    information can lead to uncertainty. Table 9 presents the evaluation of various
    intelligent techniques along with their strengths and limitations. Research issues,
    challenges, and future directions The intelligent techniques provide a promising
    solution towards the realisation of the DSM but there are certain research issues
    and challenges in DSM that need to be addressed carefully. New radio capabilities
    breed new demands for spectrum access, which presents an open challenge in CR
    networks. Some of these research issues, challenges, and future directions are
    summarised below: Wideband and higher frequencies: With the increasing demand
    for wireless traffic and applications, not only the higher spectrum efficiency
    but also more bandwidth resources are required which presents a major challenge
    in CR networks. As the number of users increases in current wireless systems,
    scalability becomes an extremely important issue. For such purpose, novel brain
    empowered/intelligent techniques need to be designed together with reconfiguration
    capability to achieve the best performance. Interference management: Due to coexistence
    among heterogeneous networks provide a new challenge in DSM. First and foremost,
    consideration is how well the devices are coexisting together. There is also a
    need to develop adaption in modulation schemes as well as other parameters, which
    enables devices to avoid interference. Moreover, cooperation between different
    networks and among CRs further mitigate the effect of interference. The amount
    of cooperation between heterogeneous networks and among CRs is also an additional
    challenge that needs to be addressed. Privacy and security: The deployment of
    new spectrum access technologies and their realisation raises new security challenges
    that have not been studied previously. Furthermore, regulators and policymakers
    have to consider what data from spectrum usage can be collected to access spectrum
    utilisation without trespassing on the user’s privacy. There is a need to ensure
    the correct implementation of the deployed system and when they are not, enforcement
    procedures will be needed to solve the DSM problem. Intelligent techniques based
    on green CR networks: The recent exponential growth of wireless technologies used
    in daily life needs to consider issues related to health and the environment.
    Hence, the designing of the future CRs need to be energy efficient to cut carbon
    emission. There exist limited work for DSM with consideration of green communication.
    Thus, there is a need to design DSM techniques considering green communication.
    Massive MIMO with intelligence: Massive MIMO uses a large number of antennas to
    provide an extra degree of freedom and diversity to improve its performance. To
    use this extra degree of freedom efficiently, intelligence needs to be incorporated
    to improve the perception capability and reconfigurability of CRs. Regulatory
    and policy reform challenges: Beyond technical issues, there are also policy reform
    challenges in DSM. Future deployed systems may employ spectrum dynamically in
    which PUs can sell their spectrum to CRs temporarily. Thus, the service level
    agreements for spectrum sharing need to be reconsidered. Furthermore, strategies
    need to be designed for dynamic spectrum auctions and markets. Multi-objective
    optimisation: In CR networks, multi objectives are conflicting with each other
    such as minimisation of power consumption, maximisation of throughput, minimisation
    of BER, etc. The optimisation of multiple objectives is a challenging task that
    needs to be addressed carefully. Other challenges include lack of incentives for
    spectrum sharing, authorisations constraints, and hardware, software, and protocols
    related issues need to be considered which require interdisciplinary collaboration
    among researchers of diverse backgrounds to address these challenges. Conclusion
    The paper has provided a comprehensive review and the classification of intelligent
    techniques for DSM in CR networks. For efficient realisation, CRs are combined
    with intelligent techniques so that dynamic and intelligent spectrum management
    can be done. The intelligent spectrum management schemes are surveyed in the context
    of spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility.
    The main emphasis of the work is to elaborate on the role of intelligent techniques
    in CR to enhance its learning capability. We have presented state-of-art achievements
    in applying intelligent techniques for DSM along with their strength and limitations.
    It provides an overview of active research in the area of dynamic spectrum management
    in CR networks. Unluckily, available techniques for spectrum management still
    lack the ample reflection of various network parameters in real-world scenarios
    which are quite complex to model, so some model-free schemes would become increasingly
    important. In future work, eliciting and encouraging cooperative behaviour through
    rewards and mechanism design will become important and looks promising to be an
    important area of further research. Disclosure statement No potential conflict

    IEEE Conference Location: Brno, Czech Republic SECTION I. Introduction Current
    static radio spectrum management policies through their highly inefficient spectrum
    use are introducing an artificial spectrum scarcity problem. Several surveys on
    radio spectrum occupancy have observed that most of the allocated spectrum is
    not fully used [1]. In particular, measurements provided by the FCC in several
    American cities have shown large variations in the intensity of spectrum use below
    1 GHz frequency [2]. Additional measurements have been conducted by the Shared
    Spectrum Company in the USA on the frequency range 30 MHz and 3 GHz [3]. The associated
    analyses have assessed an average occupancy in the observed locations of around
    5.2%, with a maximum occupancy of 13.1% in New York City and a minimum occupancy
    of 1% in rural areas. In Europe, several measurement campaigns conducted in Germany,
    Spain, Netherlands, Ireland, France, and Czech Republic show a better situation
    [4], ascertaining a higher spectrum occupancy when compared with USA, but still
    rather low if considered alone. For instance, in the Aachen area of Germany, spectrum
    occupancy is estimated to be 32% in the range between 20 and 3000 MHz. Such discrepancies
    between spectrum allocation and actual usage prove the artificial nature of spectrum
    scarcity as caused by spectrum management policy, not reflecting the actual availability
    of usable radio spectrum. To deal with the spectrum allocation congestion and
    spectrum scarcity problems, the Cognitive Radio (CR) technology has been proposed.
    CR is a technology that allows unlicensed users, namely Secondary Users (SUs),
    to opportunistically utilize already licensed bands left unused by licensed users
    [5]. Such frequency bands are named spectrum holes (or white spaces) and are defined
    as multidimensional regions within time, space, and frequency [6]. Through the
    opportunistic access provided by this technology it is possible to improve the
    efficiency of the spectrum utilization and, in perspective, to allow next generations
    of mobile networks to access radio spectrum bands. A pre-requisite of CR is the
    coexistence with current telecommunication technologies and licensed legacy users,
    namely Primary Users (PU), in the shared spectrum. The reallocation of radio spectrum
    has become an important question and auction design is both answer and efficient
    solution. In particular, in the context of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and CR
    technology, auctions enter in the phase of spectrum allocation since a market
    relationship is created between spectrum owners and cognitive users, see [7] and
    references therein. Here, our focus is to provide a systematic survey on auction-based
    methods applied to spectrum allocation in CR networks (CRNs). The existing survey
    works on CR have focused on various (cooperative and non-cooperative) methods
    for searching spectrum holes by means of spectrum sensing techniques, summarizing
    the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm and their challenging problems.
    References [8] and [9] provided a survey of resource allocation algorithms from
    the aspects of adopted approaches, criteria, techniques, and network architectures.
    Reference [10] presented an up-to-date survey of spectrum decision in CRNs based
    on spectrum characterization, spectrum selection, and CR reconfiguration. In [11],
    spectrum access schemes were reviewed, while in [12] the concept of dynamic spectrum
    sharing, was investigated for different network topologies, features, challenges,
    and probable use cases. Reference [13] provided a comprehensive survey of CR,
    full-duplex communication and Long Term Evolution (LTE) on unlicensed spectrum,
    as well as the multiple spectrum sharing techniques. Reference [14] outlined the
    spectrum sharing mechanism for the next generation cellular networks to overcome
    the energy crisis, and the spectrum sharing between satellite telecommunication
    networks and terrestrial has been surveyed in [15]. More recently, [16] provided
    a comprehensive survey on full spectrum sharing in CR networks towards the fifth
    generation (5G). Compared with previous survey papers, our survey aims at presenting
    an overview of spectrum allocation techniques based on auctions mechanisms in
    CR networks. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (i)
    we outline the characteristics of radio spectrum regulation and spectrum sharing,
    as well as the advantages of a dynamic spectrum access framework; (ii) we introduce
    the economic properties of conventional auctions, and then we present a comprehensive
    taxonomy of auction-based methods applied to spectrum allocation in CR networks,
    as well as their characteristics, and implementation issues. The organization
    of this paper is as follows. Section 2 elaborates on the background and motivation
    of radio regulations, shared spectrum, dynamic spectrum access, and CR technology.
    In Section 3, we present the basic frameworks of auction theory, while in Section
    4 we briefly introduce auctions for radio resources. Spectrum auctions are fully
    reviewed in Section 5 along with a discussion on performance metrics in Section
    6. Our conclusions are finally drawn in Section 7. TABLE I. Policy options for
    primary and secondary users SECTION II. Radio Spectrum Regulations and DSA In
    the context of radio spectrum regulation, it is necessary to distinguish between
    trading, as a transfer of spectrum usage rights, and liberalization, as a weakening
    of the restrictions and limitations associated with spectrum usage rights related
    to technologies and services. The report of the Spectrum Policy Task Force of
    the FCC defines spectrum regulatory mechanisms, highlighting three different models
    [17]: a command-and-control model; an exclusive use model; an open access model.
    The most used one is the command-and-control model, which refers to the licensed
    spectrum for shared usage and unlicensed spectrum. In addition, for primary and
    secondary users of the radio spectrum, it is possible to identify different regulatory
    options as summarized in Table 1, see [18]. It is interesting to note that if
    a PU has enough flexibility, it may choose to grant secondary access instead,
    by creating a secondary market to rent the unused portion of the spectrum. This
    approach can guarantee an adequate QoS for the SUs. As a consequence, auctions
    have been recently used in the context of radio resource management. Cognitive
    Radio technology is able to execute dynamic spectrum access (DSA). Actually, it
    is a form of wireless communication that allows the secondary user or the cognitive
    user to extract information from the radio environment and to identify idle channels
    [19]. Secondary users must respect specific power constraints when the primary
    users are present according to three different ways of accessing the spectrum
    band: spectrum interweave, spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay. Spectrum interweave
    means that unlicensed users can access the spectrum when the primary users are
    not transmitting, but they are obliged to leave when the licensed users require
    to transmit. In spectrum underlay, instead, the unlicensed users and the primary
    users transmit simultaneously with the constraint imposed on the latter to maintain
    interference below a certain threshold. Finally, in spectrum overlay, the unlicensed
    users can access the spectrum, but they have to contribute to primary users’ transmission.
    Table 2 lists the spectrum access techniques and their characteristics. TABLE
    II. Spectrum Access Techniques The DSA is performed by Cognitive Radio technology
    through the following functions: spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum
    access and spectrum handhoff [20]. As for spectrum sensing, it allows the secondary
    users to identify the spectrum holes in the licensed bands. Once the radio environment
    has been sensed, spectrum allocation determines the spectrum distribution to unlicensed
    users. The third function of Cognitive Radio, that is spectrum access, determines
    the way in which the secondary users access the licensed bands. Spectrum access
    must execute in such a way the licensed users do not suffer from interferences
    caused by secondary users’ transmission. Figure 1 illustrates the four main functions
    of Cognitive Radio technology Finally, in the context of DSA and Cognitive Radio
    technology, auctions enter in the phase of spectrum allocation since a market
    relationship is created between spectrum owners and cognitive users. SECTION III.
    Auctions for Radio Resources The reallocation of radio spectrum has become an
    important issue and auction design is both an answer and an efficient solution.
    Fig. 1. Cognitive Radio Functions Show All In auctions for radio resources, the
    primary users play the role of spectrum sellers and the secondary users play the
    role of spectrum buyers. The most used auctions in radio spectrum selling are
    the single-sided auctions, the double-sided auctions, the online auctions and
    the dynamic auctions. It is important to highlight that an auction could be online
    and combinatorial, as well as double-sided, online and combinatorial, and so on,
    so there are many ways in which an auction can be designed. In addition, other
    types of auctions are interested in building a framework that discriminate among
    the secondary users. In particular, as shown by [21]–[22], this discrimination
    tries to promote an energy efficient use of the resource by encouraging those
    users with a lower transmission power. It is important to note that an auction
    can be performed in a centralized or in a distributed manner. In the first case,
    the presence of an intermediate operator is not required, while in the second
    case, the intermediate operator is present. Double-sided auctions are generally
    performed in a centralized manner. According to this classification, different
    auction models will be considered in this survey. The classification is useful
    to describe the problems faced by these kinds of mechanisms, since auctions for
    radio resources present several problems to deal with. One problem is designing
    an auction mechanism that could take into account the reusability of the radio
    spectrum. Actually, due to the fact that the spectrum is a shared resource, reusability
    has to be granted among non-conflict buyers. The second problem deals with the
    channel quality, since it is important to consider that different channels correspond
    to a different transmission quality, therefore, the assumption of homogeneous
    channels for buyers should not be taken into account. The third problem is the
    degradation of the QoS of licensed primary users, in fact it is often assumed
    that the allocated spectrum is occupied only by the winning secondary users. Spectrum
    usage becomes problematic if demand for spectrum from primary users increases.
    The problem of avoiding degradation of the QoS of primary users is addressed by
    introducing the possibility of recalling the channel, in fact the idea of recalling
    the channel imposes a priority in the services of primary licensed users. Other
    problems arise in the design of online auctions, in fact this type of mechanism
    does not allow to have a complete information of the bid and ask prices, information
    easily available in offline auctions. Others arise in the design of online auctions,
    in fact this type of mechanism does not allow to have a complete information of
    the bid and ask prices, information easily available in offline auctions. Finally,
    the last problem concerns the properties that an auction model should have to
    discourage untruthful behaviour and create incentives for both buyers and sellers
    to take advantage of the auction. Let us note that the radio spectrum differs
    from conventional commodities, in the sense that it can be used by several users
    at the same time. This feature is called reusability and gives buyers the ability
    to use the radio resource simultaneously. The possibility of re-use of the radio
    resource should be granted to non-conflicting buyers, which means that they do
    not interfere with each other, so re-use of the spectrum requires modelling the
    relationship of interference among buyers through a conflict graph. A. One-sided
    Spectrum Auctions One-sided spectrum auctions are characterized by the presence
    of one spectrum seller and multiple buyers. Authors in [23] consider the problem
    of spectrum recalling, i.e., the possibility granted to the PUs of getting back
    a quantity of spectrum when they require to transmit. The authors propose a recall-based
    auction framework called RSSA that enables the possibility of preserving the QoS
    of primary users. Within the framework of the RSSA, the second-price sealed-bid
    auction is used for the determination of the payment and this mechanism is shown
    to satisfy the properties of individual truthfulness and rationality. The bids
    of the secondary users are presented to maximize their utility and each of them
    has an evaluation equal to the Shannon Capacity when the recall of the channel
    is not considered. The channel’s valuation decreases when the spectrum seller
    declares the quantity of recalled channels. The idea in [23] is to introduce a
    risk factor that can assess how much SUs react to the possibility of channel recall.
    It can be seen that SUs with a higher risk factor value are less averse to the
    risk of channel recall and, as a result, their bid will be higher ensuring a higher
    probability of winning. The authors in [9] use the same idea of channel recall
    proposed by [23] but allowing the presence of multiple winners. The auction is
    still one-sided, and the proposed framework is called RMSA. In the RMSA framework,
    the presence of multiple winners helps the spectrum seller in increasing revenues,
    in fact, since the demands of secondary users are independent of the number of
    channels that can be auctioned, it is common that the channels auctioned cannot
    be fully used by a single winner. The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism can
    be used in the payment scheme since the presence of multiple winners commutes
    the problem into a combinatorial auction. The VCG mechanism guarantees the properties
    of efficiency, truthfulness and individual rationality. Under RMSA, the number
    of recalled channels cannot be calculated by the secondary user as it depends
    on both his own demand and that of other secondary users. In this context, it
    is possible to define a stability factor that has a different meaning from that
    of the risk factor, in fact the stability factor is determined by the activity
    of primary users. A large value of the stability factor indicates a more stable
    service for secondary users since the primary users are not recalling back the
    allocated spectrum. In the RMSA framework, the VCG mechanism guarantees that truthful
    bidding is a dominant strategy, so once the buyers submit their true values for
    the channels, the winners can be obtained by solving an optimization problem.
    The authors in [23] assume that spectrum allocation is made in units of channel.
    On the contrary, the authors in [24] propose a one-side auction framework with
    a variable bandwidth spectrum allocation, that can grant the secondary users with
    a more flexible use of the spectrum. B. Double-sided Spectrum Auctions The double-sided
    auction is the most popular mechanism used for allocating radio spectrum and its
    popularity is due to the greatest adaptability to the real market conditions [25].
    They are characterized by the presence of multiple competitive buyers and sellers.
    In addition, they need the presence of an auctioneer playing the role of an intermediate
    operator among the agents. In a double-sided auction, buyers submit their bid
    prices, which represent the maximum willingness to pay and, similarly, sellers
    submit their ask prices, representing the minimum price at which they are willing
    to sell the item. After collecting the bid and the ask prices, the auctioneer
    clears the market through a price decision. The double auction model has to guarantee
    the property of individual rationality, truthfulness and ex-post budget balance
    property. The latter requires that the auctioneer’s profit, defined as the difference
    between buyers’ payments and sellers’ revenues, to be positive in order to provide
    incentives to start the auction [25]. A double auction model should also guarantee
    the property of economic efficiency which means that all the efficient trade should
    be executed. These properties cannot occur in the same double auction model, due
    to the fact that there is always a compromise between the properties of economic
    efficiency and budgetary balance. The execution of all trade between buyers and
    sellers leads always to a budget deficit and this turns into a negative profit
    for the auctioneer [26]. The trade reduction mechanism is used in double auctions
    to determine the winners and the corresponding payments. Moreover, this mechanism
    is proved to satisfy the properties of individual rationality, truthfulness and
    ex-post budget balance. In addition, the trade-reduction mechanism sorts the buyers’
    bids and the sellers’ asks, respectively, in a non-increasing and in a non-decreasing.
    Each buyer pays bk and each seller receives sk and the profit of the auctioneer
    is given by the difference between the payments made by the buyers and those received
    from the sellers [26]. In particular, the trade-reduction mechanism finds the
    efficient trade quantity k such that bk ≥ sk. The first k-1 sellers and buyers
    are the winners of the auction [27]. As highlighted by [28], the trade-reduction
    mechanism allows for a separation between the allocation decision and the payment
    decision and the idea is to maintain the property of individual rationality, truthfulness
    and ex-post budget balance by eliminating the least profitable transaction. Therefore,
    the bids that have been removed become the reference prices, that is, the buyers
    pay the bidding price of the removed buyer and the sellers are paid by the asking
    price of the removed seller. Another mechanism of great importance is the McAfee
    mechanism. This mechanism works in the same way as the trade reduction mechanism,
    but there is a difference in the determination of the clearing price. In the McAfee
    setting, the clearing price is set as b k+1 + s k+1 2 if the price is in the interval
    [bk, sk], otherwise the trade reduction mechanism is applied. Most of the existing
    works on double auction for spectrum allocation make use of the trade reduction
    mechanism for winner’s selection and payment’s determination. C. Online Spectrum
    Auctions Spectrum auctions can be performed in offline or in online patterns.
    The offline auctions are also known as periodic auctions. In periodic auctions,
    the bid and ask prices can be submitted only in a certain period. The online auctions
    are characterized by the absence of a bidding period, in fact bid and ask prices
    arrive continuously and the auctioneer has to take the allocation and the payment
    decision immediately. The decision between offline and online auctions is strictly
    affected by the buyers’ and sellers’ preferences. Buyers and sellers prefer online
    auctions when they are impatient and need an immediate allocation of the item.
    In online auctions, the secondary users transmit a request to the auctioneer.
    The request is composed by the willingness to pay of the secondary user, the demanded
    channels, the arrival time, the departure time and the job length. The authors
    in [29] design a truthful online combinatorial auction called TRADE. In TRADE,
    the challenges of online auction mechanisms are highlighted. One of these challenges
    is to avoid the pre-emption effect. The pre-emption effect arises when the auctioneer
    interrupts the execution of a current request to meet new requests [30]. The authors
    in [29] highlight that the pre-emption effect must be avoided for two reasons:
    the partial usage of the channel is not charged and the pre-empted secondary user
    is discouraged to participate in the following auctions. Most of the existing
    works on online auction mechanisms make the same assumptions: the pre-emption
    effect is not allowed, the secondary users submit their truthful job lengths and
    their requested channels. Sometimes, it can be assumed that the secondary users
    lie only in submitting a longer time duration for using the channel. The online
    auctions mechanism are always compared in terms of performance with the offline
    auction mechanisms and the reference point is always the VCG mechanism. In the
    TRADE mechanism, the channels are considered identical, the auction is sealed-bid
    and private and the rejected requests of secondary user can be reconsidered for
    future time slots. TRADE considers the reusability of the radio spectrum and a
    conflict graph is used to represent the interference relationship between secondary
    users, but this time the interference relationship depends on location, time-periods
    and requested channel. TRADE mechanism is proved to satisfy the property of individual
    rationality and truthfulness. The authors in [30] propose an online double spectrum
    auction called TODA, in which the auction is sealed-bid and private, the channels
    are assumed to be identical and the reusability of the spectrum is considered.
    As usual, the secondary users who interfere with each other cannot use the same
    channel. In TODA, the interference relationship is present among primary users
    and among secondary users, but only the conflict between secondary users is considered.
    In both TODA and TRADE, the conflict between secondary users depends on locations
    and requested time periods. In TODA, the interference between secondary users
    can be seen under two different models: the protocol interference model and the
    physical interference model, while in TRADE, only the protocol interference model
    is considered. The interference pattern of the protocol considers two secondary
    users as interferers if they are in each other''s interference field. The physical
    interference model admits the simultaneous use of the channel when the SINR is
    in accordance to a certain threshold. Differently from TRADE, TODA assumes that
    the rejected requests cannot be reconsidered for future time slots. TODA satisfies
    the property of truthfulness, individual rationality and ex-post budget balance.
    The authors in [31] propose an online double auction mechanism called SALSA that
    is similar to TODA in its assumptions. SALSA is proved to be truthful, individually
    rational and ex-post budget balance. In [9], the problem of spectrum allocation
    is also modeled using an online double auction called VIOLET. In VIOLET, both
    the activities of primary users and secondary users are uncertain, and the auctioneer
    has the role of granting the spectrum usage to the secondary users, taking into
    account the higher access priority of primary users. In VIOLET, the spatial reuse
    of the spectrum is granted to non-conflict secondary users and the conflict relationship
    is modeled by a conflict graph which is known to the auctioneer. The non-conflict
    secondary users are put into groups, like in TRUST, and the usual trade reduction
    mechanism is applied to select the winners and the corresponding payments. VIOLET
    satisfies the properties of truthfulness, individual rationality and ex-post budget
    balance, so it resists to market manipulation. D. Dynamic Spectrum Auctions Some
    spectrum auctions can be considered as dynamic, in the sense that, some parameters
    are dynamically adapted to improve the performance of the mechanism. The authors
    in [32] propose an auction mechanism for femtocells where a reserve price is established.
    The reserve price increases in every auction round by a step size. This step size
    is not fixed but varies accordingly to the utility of each secondary users. The
    authors in [26] propose a double auction framework for spectrum allocation in
    which the auctioneer can learn from historical data on previous auctions rounds.
    After this learning process, the auctioneer can help both primary users and secondary
    users in deciding their bidding strategy. The authors in [33] propose an auction
    framework for spectrum allocation performed in a distributed manner. The auction
    is first-price and sealed-bid but some advances are proposed in in terms of the
    bid scheme. A learning algorithm is introduced to help the secondary users in
    deciding the participation to the auction. In this framework, the bid strategy
    of each secondary users depends on the bidding history. The authors in [34] propose
    an adaptive auction framework for spectrum allocation called DEAL, in which the
    characteristics of spectrum channels vary in time and space and also the valuation
    is different. In DEAL, some parameters in the auction are dynamically adapted
    to improve the mechanism’s performance. Besides, the reserve price is based on
    secondary users’ bids, but the secondary users can influence the reserve price
    by reporting untruthful bids. Moreover, in DEAL, the reserve price is adapted
    on previous bids instead of current ones, to avoid the submission of fake bids.
    SECTION IV. Auction Efficiency and Performance Metrics The spectrum auctions are
    employed in radio resource management to improve the spectrum utilization. An
    auction may have either the objective of allocating the item to the highest value
    buyer or to maximize the seller revenue. In auctions for radio resources, these
    two objectives are also taken into account with regard to increasing spectrum
    use. In order to see if the auction design has reached the predefined objectives,
    some performance metrics are employed in spectrum auction, one of the most applied
    performance metrics being the spectrum utilization ratio. In VIOLET, the arrangement
    of non-conflict buyers into groups guarantees the spectrum reusability. The spectrum
    utilization ratio in VIOLET is defined as the ratio of total winning users, both
    primary and secondary, over the whole spectrum. The spectrum utilization ratio
    is lower without the auction because the spectrum usage is granted only to primary
    users. The use of auction can increase the spectrum utilization ratio allowing
    the use of the radio resource also to non-conflict secondary users. The spectrum
    utilization ratio is also evaluated in TASG framework with the same conclusions
    shown in VIOLET. In TODA, the performance of the mechanism is evaluated in terms
    of social efficiency which is defined as the sum of the truthful valuations of
    all winners, while the social efficiency is evaluated for comparison with the
    offline VGC mechanism. The same is made for SALSA, also considering the efficiency
    of the mechanism in terms of revenue, the revenue efficiency being defined as
    the total payment of winners. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper has presented a
    review on auction-based methods applied to radio spectrum allocation in CR networks.
    The characteristics of radio spectrum regulation and spectrum sharing have been
    highlighted along with the advantages of a dynamic spectrum access framework.
    The evidence indicates that spectrum allocation design along with well-managed
    spectrum have become critical for developing mobile services, broadcasting, and
    broadband access. Incumbents and new entrants increasingly resort to wireless
    technologies to modernize and expand their facilities. Only tinkering at the margin
    with existing spectrum management practice is no longer enough. In this regard,
    policies to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband services are generally
    viewed as drivers that would stimulate technological innovation and economic growth.
    Increasing the amount of spectrum available to support new mobile technologies
    is one step toward meeting future demand for mobile services. Authors Figures

    Cognitive radio is a promising technology for efficient spectrum utilization.
    It explores dynamic spectrum access features while satisfying interference constraints.
    In this work, a joint power and spectrum allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize
    the cognitive network throughput while satisfying interference constraints of
    both primary and secondary users in the network. Evolutionary algorithms are used
    to solve the joint power and spectrum allocation problem. Furthermore, the algorithmic
    performance is compared in terms of quality of solution. And also we optimized
    the maximum utilization of the network and capacity of each user simultaneously
    by using Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) and Nondominated Sorting
    Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). Simulation results show that the pareto optimal
    fronts provide the trade-off solutions between total network utilization and individual
    sum capacity of user. 1 INTRODUCTION Power allocation also plays an important
    role in the interference management and energy saving in mobile units. During
    power allocation, it is required to maintain a specific Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise
    Ratio (SINR) level to the cognitive users such that it minimizes interference
    level to the Primary User (PU). In literature, most of the reported work solved
    the Spectrum Allocation (SA) problem by maximizing the network throughput using
    evolutionary algorithms.1-4 Also, it is required to optimize the individual transmitted
    power of each user during SA. Digham et al proposed a joint power and channel
    allocation optimization algorithm for maximizing sum capacity of the Cognitive
    Radio (CR) network, while satisfying SINR constraints posed by PUs.5 However,
    it does not consider the fairness among the CR users. Wang et al proposed a novel
    SA and power control algorithm to maximize the network utility functions in CR
    networks,6 in which transmitting power of CR node is dynamically varied according
    to the cost and connection degree by satisfying the quality of service requirements
    and interference constraints posed by Secondary User (SU). Haddad et al proposed
    a downlink and uplink distributed power allocation algorithm to maximize the CR
    network capacity.7, 8 In,7 a SU can decide either to communicate or silent in
    the channel without affecting the Quality of Service (QoS) of PUs. Liu et al proposed
    a joint subchannel, power and leasing time allocation algorithm9 to maximize throughput
    of the system using CVX solver to solve the optimization problem. Zayen et al
    proposed a binary power allocation scheme that consists of a single PU and multiple
    SUs in the network.10 If a SU uses multiple channels for communication, then it
    may affect on multiple PUs transmission due to interference. In recent studies,
    CR protocols are extended such that both primary and secondary users simultaneously
    transmit over the same channel.11, 12 In literature, many works have considered
    the centralized optimization scheme for power control that requires the information
    about interference and channel conditions of the network.13, 10, 5 To avoid this
    problem, distributed scheme is preferred in which each user can manage its resources
    based on locally available information like channel gain, interference and noise
    conditions. The main goal of the present work is to assign suitable channels to
    SUs with optimum transmitting powers for maximizing the network throughput under
    various constraints like noise, power and interference. A joint spectrum and power
    allocation function is formulated to maximize the capacity of each user. It is
    solved using Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
    algorithms to provide a fair allocation of channel and transmission power to SUs
    in both uplink and downlink scenarios. It is also important to study the effect
    of the joint spectrum and power allocation on the total network utilization. In
    literature, the total network utilization is analyzed using Max-Sum-Reward (MSR)
    utility function in a distributed network architecture. It is used to maximize
    the utilization of spectrum resources by assigning proper channels to SUs by satisfying
    the interference constraints posed by both SUs and PUs. Hence, this study is extended
    to optimize the total network utilization (MSR) and capacity of each user simultaneously
    using MODE and NSGA-II algorithms. The performance of two algorithms are compared
    in terms of quality of the solution. Finally, forced termination probability is
    included as one more objective function and optimized the three functions simultaneously
    to find the quality of service metric of the proposed algorithm. 2 SYSTEM MODEL
    It is considered that a wireless cognitive radio network consists of K number
    of primary users and N number of secondary users randomly deployed over a geographical
    area as shown in Figure 1. It is assumed that M number of channels are available
    for communication. It is also assumed that (a) all SUs have a prior knowledge
    about the channel state information of their links and (b) channel gains are independent
    and identically distributed random variables. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Network model To avoid the interference to PUs, SUs communicate outside the protection
    range of PUs. The protection area surrounded by each primary user is denoted by
    dp and the minimum and maximum communication range of each SU is in the range
    of dmin and dmax respectively. Each SU calculates its availability matrix L based
    on the availability of channels near to it. The channel availability matrix is
    L = {ln, m ∣ ln, m ∈ {0, 1}}N × M. If mth channel is available to nth user then
    ln, m = 1 otherwise ln, m = 0. The channel reward matrix B = {bn, m}N × M is initialized
    with the capacity assigned to nth user in mth channel using power allocation algorithm.10
    The interference constraint matrix C = {cn, p, m ∣ cn, p, m ∈ {0, 1}}N × N × M
    is determined by evaluating the channel constraints and user constraints.14 In
    this distributed approach user''s position and available spectrum are static during
    the allocation process. The final assignment matrix A = {an, m| an, m in{0, 1}}N × M
    is calculated using L, B and C matrices. The instantaneous capacity of ith primary
    user is given by10: (1) where pi is the transmitted power of ith primary user,
    gi, i is the channel gain between base station and primary user, pi, j denotes
    the transmitted power of the jth secondary user in ith channel, gi, j denotes
    the channel gain of jth SU from ith PU, σ2 is the ambient noise variance. 3 PROPOSED
    ALGORITHM In this work, it is assumed that both primary and secondary users are
    utilizing the same channel by limiting the transmitted power levels of SUs. In
    communication, the SUs detect the hole, then adapts to PU transmission characteristics
    without any interference to PUs while satisfying the QoS requirements. In this
    technique, SUs opportunistically selects the channel with an acceptable transmission
    power to maximize the total sum rate while considering the proper outage probability
    of PUs. A distributed approach is considered for joint spectrum and power allocation,
    in which SU decides the channel and power allocated to each channel, such that
    the allocated power is less than the SNR threshold. Initially, the joint spectrum
    and power allocation problem is formulated as a single objective optimization
    problem and the average capacity of each user is maximized by satisfying the SINR
    and outage probability constraints. During the evaluation of the objective function,
    an iterative method is used to check the SINR constraints and PU outage probability.
    Based on these constraints, the solution is updated and finally a fair spectrum
    and power assignment solution is achieved. The joint spectrum and power allocation
    optimization problem is defined in Problem 1: (2) where Ri denotes ith PU transmitted
    data rate and w is the outage probability. The key idea in this technique is that
    each SU selects a suitable channel and limit its power level in the range of [0, pth]
    by controlling the interference to other users in the network. 4 JOINT SPECTRUM
    AND POWER ALLOCATION USING DE AND PSO ALGORITHMS In this work, two evolutionary
    algorithms namely DE and PSO are used for solving the joint spectrum and power
    allocation problem. In the present CR network model, if multiple channels are
    allocated to a SU, then it does not terminate forcefully due to either interference
    or PU arrival. However, the SU transmission data rate may decrease because it
    vacates few channels from the assigned channels. In each iteration, pi, j values
    are updated using DE/PSO algorithms. Each PU verifies its outage constraint in
    every iteration based on the results of channel and power allocation. This loop
    iterates until a maximum number of iterations is reached. The same problem is
    solved using PSO algorithm and compared the performance with DE algorithm. For
    simulation, the joint spectrum and power allocation problem defined in (2) is
    optimized using DE and PSO algorithms. MATLAB software is used to perform the
    extensive simulation. For simulation K number of channels (K = 10), M primary
    users (M = 10) and N number of cognitive users (N = 1 to 10) are deployed uniformly
    within an area of 1000 m radius with PU protection area of radius 600 m for the
    model shown in Figure 1. The channel gains are considered as defined in COST-231
    model15 with log-normal shadowing (SD of 10 dB) and fast fading effects in the
    range of (0.1). In simulation, the maximum power (Pmax), power ratio for downlink
    and uplink are considered as 1 W, 10 and 1 respectively. In the DE based joint
    spectrum and power allocation, the control parameters are initialized as crossover
    rate Cr = 0.9, weighting factor F = 0.9, population size NP = 600 and maximum
    generations Gmax = 200. In case of PSO, the control parameters are initialized
    as maximum iterations = 200, number of particles NP = 600, inertial weight ω =
    0.3 and weighting coefficients c1 = c2 = 0.9. The dimension of population is calculated
    by considering the number of elements in availability matrix L and the transmitted
    power pi, j depends on number of SUs in the network. The lower and upper bound
    of channel assignment variables are set as 0 and 1, whereas power assignment variables
    (pi, j) are set as 0 and Pmax respectively. This subsection presents numerical
    results for network capacity and the average capacity of each user by assigning
    suitable spectrum and transmitted power to each user. For the same network settings,
    both DE and PSO algorithms are used to solve the spectrum and power allocation
    problem and the results are given in Figures 2-5. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer

    SUs capacity vs number * of SUs for R = 0.5 bits/s/Hz FIGURE 5 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Sum of SUs capacity vs number of SUs for R = 0.3 bits/s/Hz From
    Figures 2 and 3, it is observed that as the number of incoming SUs increases,
    the number of active SUs also increases while satisfying the QoS requirements
    of PUs. From this results, it is noted that the number of active SUs in downlink
    outruns the uplink scenario for power allocation. It is also observed that in
    downlink scenario base station transmitted power is 10 times more than uplink
    power, that helps to maintain guaranteed QoS to PUs. In the case of downlink scenario,
    for a rate R = 0.1bits/s/Hz (also referred as spectral efficiency), 68% of SUs
    are allowed, whereas in uplink 43% of SUs are allowed for 16 incoming SUs using
    DE algorithm. In case of PSO, 53% and 43% of SUs are allowed in downlink and uplink
    scenarios respectively. As the number of incoming SUs increases, initially the
    number of active SUs also increases but at a certain value the active SUs remains
    constant due to the interference constraints posed by SUs and PUs in multiple
    channels. It is also observed that the number of active SUs is decreasing with
    increase in R. It means that the data rate required by SU increases, but the number
    of active SUs decreases due to limited availability of resources. Figures 4 and
    5 show the affect on sum of user capacity over the available channels for both
    uplink and downlink configurations for R = 0.5 and 0.3 bits/s/Hz. It is observed
    that the capacity in uplink scenario outruns that of downlink system. It is also
    to be noted that as the number of SUs increases, capacity of a user also increases
    up to a certain number of users, then there is a decrease in SINR of each user
    due to interference that in turn decrease the user capacity. If the protection
    area of a PU and its primary cell radius decreases, deployment of a large number
    of SUs transmissions affect the interference caused to PUs and user capacity.
    Hence, there must be a trade-off between the number of active SUs and average
    user capacity. From the Figures 2-5, it is observed that DE performs better compared
    to PSO in terms of quality of solution due to its robustness and quick convergence
    in finding a solution. 5 MODE BASED JOINT SPECTRUM AND POWER ALLOCATION The network
    utility function Max-sum-Reward (MSR) is considered to obtain the relationship
    between the average capacity of a user and total network utilization. This function
    maximizes the total network capacity by assigning more number of channels with
    optimal power. It is given by14 (3) where Ai, j is the channel assignment matrix
    and Bi, j is the reward matrix of SUs. In this subsection, the dependency between
    total network utilization and average sum of user capacity is observed for a fixed
    number of SUs and PUs. Hence, it is considered that the total network utilization
    (MSR) as one objective function and average capacity of SU (Capsum) as another
    objective function. The proposed joint spectrum and power allocation problem is
    formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and the two objective functions
    (MSR & Capsum) are optimized simultaneously using MODE and NSGA-II algorithms.
    The multi-objective optimization of joint spectrum and power allocation is formulated
    as Problem 2: In the proposed MODE-based joint spectrum and power allocation algorithm,
    the solution is represented as a population that defines channel and power assignment
    to CR users. These two objective functions are optimized simultaneously using
    MODE and NSGA-II algorithms and pareto front is shown in Figure 6. From this figure,
    it is observed that as the total network capacity (MSR) increases, average capacity
    of SU is decreasing. It means that increase in total network capacity is due to
    the allocation of more number of channels to the user, but the Capsum decreases
    due to more number of constraints need to be satisfied by the user in the selected
    channels. It is also observed that MODE performs better compared to NSGA-II algorithm
    for maximizing total network capacity and average user capacity. FIGURE 6 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Pareto front between MSR and average user capacity
    Further, forced termination probability is included as one more objective function4
    along with the above two objective functions and optimized simultaneously to find
    the channel allocation metric. From the resultant pareto front, four instances
    of the solution are selected that are approximately close to solutions obtained
    from Figure 6. The calculated and optimized forced termination probability are
    plotted in Figure 7. From this figure, it is observed that inclusion of termination
    probability in joint spectrum and power allocation algorithm (3 Obj) gives approximately
    same termination probability as compared to the termination probability obtained
    by optimizing the two objective functions (MSR and Capsum) simultaneously (in
    case of S1, S2, S3 and S4 solutions of MODE). This is because the outage probability
    constraint is included in the proposed joint spectrum and power allocation algorithm.
    The same conclusion can be drawn for NSGA-II solutions also. In Figure 7, the
    solutions S5, S6, S7 and S8 corresponds four different instances obtained from
    NSGA-II algorithm. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Performance of quality
    of service 6 CONCLUSION In this work, a joint spectrum and power allocation algorithm
    is presented to increase the efficient utilization of network resources. To maximize
    the network utilization and each secondary user''s capacity, the SUs have to select
    suitable channel with optimal power transmitted power to avoid the interference
    to primary and neighbor secondary users. The joint spectrum and power allocation
    problem is solved by using DE and PSO algorithm to maximize the efficiency of
    spectrum. From the simulation results, it concludes that the DE algorithm outperforms
    PSO algorithm in terms of quality of solution that is, maximizing the average
    SU capacity. A network utilization function MSR and one more objective function
    is used to maximize the individual user sum capacity over the selected channels.
    Hence, the above joint channel and power allocation problem is formulated as a
    multi-objective optimization problem and optimized the two objective functions
    simultaneously and the trade-off solutions and forced termination probability
    obtained under the power constraints and QoS requirements of PUs. REFERENCES Citing

    Notes Abstract Cognitive radio (CR) has evolved as a novel technology for overcoming
    the spectrum-scarcity problem in wireless communication networks. With its opportunistic
    behaviour for improving the spectrum-usage efficiency, CR enables the desired
    secondary users (SUs) to dynamically utilize the idle spectrum owned by primary
    users. On sensing the spectrum to identify the idle frequency bands, proper spectrum-allocation
    mechanisms need to be designed to provide an effectual use of the radio resource.
    In this paper, we propose a single-sided sealed-bid sequential-bidding-based auction
    framework that extends the channel-reuse property in a spectrum-allocation mechanism
    to efficiently redistribute the unused channels. Existing auction designs primarily
    aim at maximizing the auctioneer’s revenue, due to which certain CR constraints
    remain excluded in their models. We address two such constraints, viz. the dynamics
    in spectrum opportunities and varying availability time of vacant channels, and
    formulate an allocation problem that maximizes the utilization of the radio spectrum.
    The auctioneer strategises winner determination based on bids collected from SUs
    and sequentially leases the unused channels, while restricting the channel assignment
    to a single-channel-multi-user allocation. To model the spectrum-sharing mechanism,
    we initially developed a group-formation algorithm that enables the members of
    a group to access a common channel. Furthermore, the spectrum-allocation and pricing
    algorithms are operated under constrained circumstances, which guarantees truthfulness
    in the model. An analysis of the simulation results and comparison with existing
    auction models revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach in assigning
    the unexploited spectrum. Keywords: cognitive radio; dynamic spectrum access;
    spectrum allocation; single-sided auction; primary user; secondary user; spectrum
    opportunities 1. Introduction The regulation of radio spectrum usage is guided
    by a conventional procedure called static spectrum assignment that permits licensed
    users to access portions of the spectrum on a long-term basis. However, reports
    from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [1], an independent agency of
    the United States, reveal that a significant section of the licensed spectrum
    remains underutilized by its legitimate owners, both spatially and temporally.
    Such occurrences create spectrum opportunities (or spectrum holes) in the network.
    On the contrary, recent advances in wireless and mobile technologies have led
    to insufficiency of the radio spectrum, creating new challenges in resource management.
    Therefore, with an intention to dynamically exploit the unused spectrum of licensed
    users or primary users (PUs), cognitive radio (CR) [2,3,4] presents itself as
    a promising technology that uses dynamic spectrum access (DSA) [5] techniques
    and enables the opportunistic use of the spectrum holes by unlicensed users or
    secondary users (SUs) while preventing any destructive interference with the PUs.
    To facilitate dynamic spectrum allocation, one of the key elements in CR networks
    is spectrum sensing, during which SUs can discover their spectrum opportunities
    over a wide range of frequency bands. Once the free channels are known amongst
    the SUs, there arises a need to design a proper spectrum-allocation mechanism
    so that unused channels can be fairly distributed according to the demand of the
    SUs. Although spectrum allocation has been widely explored by several researchers
    in recent years, unfortunately, their work has ignored certain CR constraints
    that need to be considered in order to achieve allocation patterns with enhanced
    spectrum utilization. Different allocation models [6,7] have been developed for
    CR networks (CRNs). Amongst them, auctions are well-known market-based mechanisms
    that can efficiently manage the scarce radio resource. Several auction-based models
    have been designed for CRNs, but none of these approaches incorporate the network
    constraints that appear in CRNs. As such, there can be situations where these
    models result in a degraded performance in terms of spectrum utilization. An auction
    [8,9] is the process of selling goods to relevant bidders with the return of some
    monetary profit. Conventional single-sided auctions are being conducted worldwide
    by government bodies to assign the spectrum to the wireless service providers
    (WSPs) who submit the highest bid values [10]. However, an auction designed for
    a CR network differs from such conventional auctions. The prime intention of conventional
    auctions is to earn high income in exchange for the leased spectrum. However,
    auction theoretic models for CRNs are designed to boost the spectrum utilization,
    without concentrating much on the auctioneer’s revenue. Both single-sided auctions
    and double-sided auctions are applicable in a CR environment. In a single-sided
    auction, the primary owner (primary base station) of a network takes up the role
    of auctioneer and earns a monetary profit. The primary owner (PO) leases the channels
    left vacant by the PUs in the network. These available channels, being the auctioned
    items, get bid for by the SUs, who act as bidders. However, when the POs of the
    network take part in the auction as sellers and they compete amongst themselves
    by submitting ask values for their channels, this formulates a double-sided auction.
    A third party acts as the auctioneer who decides the clearing price based on the
    bid values and ask values received from the SUs and POs, respectively. However,
    a PO in a double auction can sell its channel only when its ask value is less
    than the winning bid value. Otherwise, the channel from the PO remains unassigned.
    In this paper, we focus on a single-sided auction mechanism that is being deployed
    for spectrum allocation in CRNs, as shown in Figure 1. We consider a sealed-bid
    auction where bidders (SUs) privately communicate their bid values to the auctioneer;
    no bidder can realize the bid values of another bidder in the game. As such, there
    appears no information exchange among the SUs, which thereby reduces the communication
    overhead. Additionally, an auction formulation designs the model in such a way
    that every participant gets an equal opportunity to win the game, and bidders
    submitting higher valuations have a greater chance of picking up the auctioned
    item. In today’s scenario, CR technology can be integrated with the 5G network,
    where the flexibility in spectrum utility provided by CR can help to achieve higher
    capacity in such networks [11,12]. Including auctions in designing radio spectrum
    allocation can impart better coordination with PUs while availing the dynamic
    spectrum in 5G networks, since PUs themselves are willing to lease their spectrum.
    Additionally, operators in such a network may not want to communicate due to security
    reasons. Here, auction mechanisms are worthwhile since operators need to convey
    their bids only to the auctioneer. Similarly, IoT-based applications [13,14] can
    also be addressed with CR. With the heavily increasing demand of IoT objects,
    it can be seen that in the near future, the allocation of the spectrum to these
    objects will become inadequate. In such an environment, spectrum-allocation mechanisms
    in CR could help the IoT objects to intelligently access the unused spectrum.
    As such, CR would provide a helping hand to different IoT-based healthcare applications,
    environmental applications, in-home applications, etc. Figure 1. Single-sided
    auction in cognitive radio networks. 1.1. Motivation Most of the existing auction-based
    approaches for CRNs deploy a double-sided auction that primarily concentrates
    on earning a good revenue for the sold channels. However, when a double auction
    is implemented, based on its allocation condition, there can be some channels
    that are left unassigned even when there are SUs who are looking for the underutilized
    channels. Such a condition restricts the use of the radio spectrum. Thus, to enhance
    the spectrum utilization, a single-sided auction becomes favourable, where all
    the channels can be allocated while abiding by the network constraints. Additionally,
    the strategy of monetary bid submission may not be suitable for formulating the
    spectrum-allocation problem in a CRN. When monetary amounts are used for bidding,
    it is not always necessary that the bidder with the highest bid value who wins
    the auction makes the best use of the assigned channel for its transmission. Instead,
    if bids are submitted in terms of a particular channel characteristic, such as
    the bandwidth, data rate, etc., then we can achieve a better usage of the spectrum
    bands. Apart from these points, there are certain network challenges that need
    to be addressed while allocating a channel in a CRN. One such challenge is the
    variation in the spectrum opportunities (SOPs) of the SUs. The dynamics in SOPs
    may not allow every SU to sense all the free channels as available. Accordingly,
    before bidding for the channels, the channel set available at each SU should be
    studied so that every winning SU receives a channel that is actually available
    at the SU. Another challenging issue in CRNs is related to the channel-availability
    time. If a PU wants to reclaim its channel that is currently being used by an
    SU for its transmission, then the SU immediately vacates the channel, which in
    turn disturbs the transmission of the SU. Since only one channel will be assigned
    to an SU in this model, there arises the need to look for the availability time
    of the channels offered for auction so that an SU can look for only those channels
    whose availability times will be longer than the time duration for which the SU
    needs the channels. Otherwise, if an SU wins a channel and, while it is using
    the channel, the SU’s transmission gets interrupted due to the PU activity, then
    this wastes the spectrum given to that particular SU, resulting in reduced spectrum
    utilization. Prior work on auction-based models in CRNs have not covered the issues
    related to the dynamics in SOPs and varying channel-availability time, due to
    which spectrum utilization as well as network throughput becomes affected. Hence,
    motivated by these observations, we planned to develop an efficient allocation
    mechanism for CRNs that could address the challenges that we have explored. In
    this paper, we propose a sequential auction-based multi-winner (SAMW) spectrum-allocation
    framework where the PO serves as the auctioneer and decides a noncooperative auction
    game among SUs (bidders). It extends the work carried out in [15], which discusses
    an allocation mechanism that applies a concurrent bidding policy to auction heterogeneous
    channels. The authors in [15] proposed a multi-winner auction mechanism where
    channels differ with respect to their maximum allowable transmission power, and
    to achieve a better performance in spectrum utilization, all the available channels
    are auctioned simultaneously so that each SU can choose its most preferred channel.
    In this work, we consider that the channels offered for auction are homogeneous,
    due to which sequential bidding becomes favourable for bid submission. To perform
    the spectrum-sensing process, we assume that the sensing result of every SU is
    available to us through the basic energy detection method [16]. Moreover, with
    the radio spectrum being interference limited and reusable among geographically
    separated users, this work enables multiple noninterfering bidders to share a
    single idle channel at a time. Such a condition facilitates an increase in spectrum
    utilization along with the revenue earned by the auctioneer. Furthermore, the
    proposed model ensures truthfulness for preventing any kind of manipulation of
    the bid values. This makes every SU bid a true valuation, while the SU is completely
    unaware of any other bidder’s bidding strategy. To evaluate the performance of
    our proposed model, we conducted simulation experiments in the MATLAB platform.
    The experimental results for our model are compared with some existing work to
    analyse the performance improvement. 1.2. Contribution This paper makes the following
    key contributions: With the channels being homogeneous, we apply the sequential
    bidding strategy for collecting the bids since the bid values from SUs can be
    improved in each round, which will in turn improve the spectrum utilization. The
    process of sequential bidding allows every channel to be auctioned one after another,
    and once an SU obtains its access to a channel, the SU–channel pair cannot further
    participate in the allocation process. Bids from an SU are decided in terms of
    the rate of data transfer that can be applied over the auctioned channel. There
    can be different bid values from an SU for each auctioned channel, even though
    the channels are homogeneous. This is because the bid values from an SU are determined
    while studying the dynamics in the SOPs of the SU and the availability time of
    the auctioned channels. Existing auction models with homogeneous channels allow
    an SU to submit a uniform bid value for every channel that is auctioned. Such
    an assumption ignores the network constraints that can appear in a CRN. A sealed-bid
    single-sided auction framework is adopted to address the spectrum-allocation problem,
    where the channel distribution is restricted to a single-channel-multi-user allocation
    constraint, which declares that each user (SU) can obtain, at most, one channel
    at a time, but a channel can be assigned to multiple non-interfering users at
    the same time. We developed two algorithms, a group-formation algorithm and spectrum-allocation
    algorithm, to plan the winner-determination strategy. Then, we developed a pricing
    algorithm that charges the winning bidders in the return of their respective assigned
    channels. 1.3. Organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
    2 reviews the related work. The proposed spectrum-auction model is elaborately
    discussed in Section 3, where the subsections refer to the system model, the challenges
    that can arise in CRNs, the proposed auction mechanism, and proof of the auction
    properties, respectively. Section 4 provides the performance evaluation with a
    discussion of the simulation results. Finally, Section 5 provides the conclusion
    and future directions. 2. Related Work Many spectrum-sharing approaches deploying
    different allocation models, such as graph theory [17,18], game theory [19], evolutionary
    theory [20], and so forth, have been proposed for CRNs. Apart from these, auction
    theory provides a different perspective for spectrum allocation where PUs themselves
    lease their unused channels temporarily to the desired SUs. The authors in [21]
    formulated a bandwidth auction for both single-PU and multi-PU scenarios. A dynamic-updating
    algorithm plans the spectrum-assignment pattern, which can be achieved with the
    Nash equilibrium. Kash et al., in [22], define bucketing and ironing techniques
    for developing a scalable strategy-proof auction mechanism for spectrum sharing
    amongst shared and exclusive-use bidders. A bipartite graph-based auction model
    was developed in [23] where SUs and channels form the two vertex sets. Finding
    a maximal weight matching in the bipartite graph defines the winner-determination
    strategy to assign one channel to only one SU. Then, to obtain the revenue of
    the auctioneer, the authors used the general Vickrey Clarke Groves (VCG) auction.
    In [24], Amraoui et al. designed another single-sided auction scenario with a
    first-price auction and English auction. The first-price auction picks the highest
    bidding user for channel allocation. However, in the English auction, multiple
    rounds are executed to obtain the winning bidder. Two online-auction models for
    sharing randomly available spectrum are discussed in [25]. Gao et al., in [26],
    discuss the problem of maximizing the primary owner’s (auctioneer) revenue. Channels
    are characterised by their channel capacity, and for the bidding process, quality–price
    combinations are taken up such that a feasible contract can be achieved to provide
    a fair channel allocation. Another multi-item-based auction mechanism is proposed
    in [27] that allows every SU to obtain a single channel at a time. The algorithm
    developed to share the spectrum uses the first-price auction model, allowing the
    highest-paid bidder to win. A bandwidth or power auction is discussed in [28],
    where homogeneous resources are sequentially auctioned by following a second-price
    auction. The authors in [29] focus on revenue generation for the auctioneer by
    using the concept of virtual valuation during bid submission, and a suboptimal
    solution was defined to formulate the revenue-maximization problem. Another single-channel-allocation-based
    auction model is discussed in [30], where the channel-availability time is taken
    into consideration for deciding the bid value, and adjacent channels get assigned
    to non-interfering SUs such that each SU obtains a single channel at a time. Similarly,
    VERITAS, in [31], was designed as a truthful single-sided buyer-only auction to
    manage the dynamic spectrum market, which further aims at improving the spectrum
    utilization. Several double-auction models have also been designed to resolve
    the channel-allocation problem. A double-auction mechanism that models spectrum
    reuse as an SINR model was deployed in [32]. This approach primarily aims at optimizing
    the profit and energy across the network and allows every SU to be assigned only
    one channel. In [33], PreDA uses the concept of the preference list (based on
    SINR values) to gather bids from the SUs. The formation of virtual groups encourages
    channel reuse in the model along with multi-channel allocation. Another double-auction
    model was proposed in [34], where both the seller and buyer sides are decoupled
    to organize the spectrum separately. On the buyer side, graph partitioning and
    the further merging of the subgraphs determines the allocation pattern. Consecutively,
    the sellers follow a traditional method to decide the winners and their respective
    revenue. In the auction model developed in [35], both the PU and the SUs are allowed
    to share a common channel constrained to a threshold limit of the interference
    temperature. TAMES, in [36], involves a multi-seller-multi-buyer double auction
    that creates spatial reusability via an interference graph with sequential grouping.
    In [37], another online-auction model named LOTUS was designed that introduces
    the concept of the interference discount. An adaptive-auction mechanism is discussed
    in [38], where two different auctions, a local auction and global auction, are
    implemented with an intention to improve the revenue of the sellers. In [39],
    an auction is carried out in a cooperative CRN to resolve both spectrum allocation
    and relay allocation by proposing two different auction schemes. Another relay-based
    auction model is introduced in [40], which performs relay selection using a Vickrey
    auction and uses both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward protocols for
    sharing the spectrum. Table 1 compares the existing research that uses auctions
    for spectrum allocation in CRNs. Table 1. Literature study on auction models used
    for spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). A literature survey
    on auction designs unveiled that single-sided auctions have not been extensively
    studied in CRNs. In a practical scenario, a cellular network conducts the single-sided
    auction, where a base station acts as the auctioneer. When the idle channels of
    the users are auctioned among the SUs (of an ad hoc CRN), the spectrum utilization
    can be significantly improved with the single-sided auction, and revenue is drawn
    by the network provider. Additionally, the survey shows that the existing approaches
    have not incorporated certain network constraints of CRNs, which need to be investigated
    in further research work. The dynamics in the SOPs and differences in the availability
    time of the unused channels are two such network constraints, which when integrated
    in the auction model, can provide a better spectrum usage as well as being able
    to increase the network throughput. This study developed an auction mechanism
    with sequential bidding that permits channel reusability while taking into account
    both the network constraints. 3. Auction Model for Spectrum Allocation in CRN
    This section provides an elaborate discussion of our proposed model. Additionally,
    challenges that appear in CRNs and proofs of auction properties are discussed
    in this section. 3.1. System Model We assume there is a network with both primary
    and secondary users. Primary users allow opportunistic access to their free channels
    to secondary users through a single-sided auction model. True valuations are submitted
    as bid values while abiding by the availability time constraint of the channels.
    Winner determination and payment strategies are carried out by the auctioneer
    with an aim to improve the overall spectrum utilization. Spectrum allocation applies
    the channel-availability constraint among the SUs and single-channel-multi-user-allocation
    constraint for spectrum reuse to achieve an efficient allocation mechanism. A
    cognitive radio network consisting of N SUs (bidders), 𝒩 = {1,2,3, ..., N}, coexists
    with a primary network. PUs are willing to give away a total of M idle channels,
    ℳ = {1,2,3, ..., M}, among N SUs, where it is assumed that 𝑁>𝑀 . The PO auctions
    the channels left unused by PUs while allowing them to be reused by non-interfering
    users and, in return, earns a revenue. To communicate with the auctioneer, a dedicated
    common-control channel (CCC) in the licensed band [41] can be utilized amongst
    the SUs along with the OFDMA access mechanism. Now, to discover the channel availability
    for each SU, spectrum sensing needs to be carried out before triggering the allocation
    process, where the same set of channels may not be available to every SU. Such
    a variation in the SOPs of the SUs arises due to differences in SU capabilities
    [42]. This constructs a channel-availability matrix, 𝐶= { 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 | 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 ∈{0,1}}
    𝑁×𝑀 , where 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 if SU i senses channel j and finds it to be available; otherwise,
    𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =0 . According to the channel-availability constraint, a channel j can be
    assigned to an SU i only if 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 . The interference relationship among geographically
    separated SUs is represented using an interference matrix, 𝑋= { 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 | 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 ∈{0,1}}
    𝑁×𝑁 , where 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 =1 if SUs i and k cannot be assigned the same channel simultaneously
    since they are interfering; otherwise, 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 =0 . Moreover, the SUs in this model
    look for channels with higher channel-availability time, since due to particular
    PU activity, a free channel may become reclaimed by the licensed user, which seems
    to disturb the data transmission of the SU. The availability time of a channel
    can be estimated during the sensing phase accordingly, as in [43]. In [43], every
    channel is configured as an ON–OFF model where the OFF phase specifies the time
    period in which the owner leaves the channel unused. It is during this period
    when the SUs can utilize the channel without causing any interference to the owner.
    Thus, with 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) being the channel-availability time for a channel j, SU i submits
    its bid for channel j only when the channel requirement time of SU i for channel
    j, 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) , is less than or equal to 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) . For every SU who senses channel
    j as available, 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) is approximately similar. In this model, we assume that
    the transmission time and propagation delay together give the channel requirement
    time, 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) . The distance to the receiver and propagation speed provide the
    propagation delay for the SU i. To obtain the transmission time, the size of the
    message transmitted by the SU i and data rate over channel j need to be used.
    As such, on auctioning a channel, the bid value determined by an SU for the channel
    is the data rate that the SU uses for its transmission over the channel. Another
    consideration is for homogeneous channels, where all the available channels are
    similar in their characteristics. In the literature, when channels are homogeneous,
    authors consider that an SU chooses a uniform valuation of all the channels. However,
    in this model, the bid submitted by an SU i for each channel j differs with respect
    to 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) . Now, on auctioning a channel j, the SU i decides the valuation for
    the channel, given as 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Initially, when channel j is auctioned, the 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗)
    of SU i is obtained by taking the channel capacity of j (the channel capacity
    is same for all the channels). Accordingly, 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 is decided as per the following
    conditions. If 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =0 , then 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 =0 , since the channel is unavailable at the
    SU. If 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 and 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) > 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) , then 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 = 0. With 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 < the channel capacity,
    𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) will increase and cannot proceed towards 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) . If 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 and 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗)
    = 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) , then 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 = the channel capacity. With 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 < the channel capacity,
    𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) > 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) . If 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 and 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) < 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) , then 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 < the channel capacity,
    but 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 is chosen such that the condition 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) ≥ 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) continues to hold.
    For instance, consider a channel C1 with a channel capacity of 4.2 bps and 𝑇 𝐴(1)
    of 2.806 s. Three SUs, S1, S2, and S3, have message sizes of 10, 8, and 12 bits
    and propagation delays of 0.30, 0.20, and 0.45 s. Thus, 𝑣 11 =4.07 (10/4.07 +
    0.30 = 2.757 < 2.806), 𝑣 12 =3.50 (8/3.50 + 0.20 = 2.485 < 2.806), and 𝑣 13 =0
    (12/4.20 + 0.45 = 3.30 > 2.806). Therefore, for S3, the condition cannot be satisfied
    even on submitting 4.2 as the bid. Moreover, 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 is decided only when 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1
    . To represent the channel assignments among SUs, a channel-allocation matrix
    𝐴= { 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 | 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ∈{0,1}} 𝑁×𝑀 is used, where 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =1 if SU i gets access to channel
    j; otherwise, 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =0 . With the allocation constraint stating that one SU can
    acquire, at mos,t one vacant channel at a time, the rows of the allocation matrix
    become imposed on ∑ 𝑀 𝑗=1 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ≤1 , ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝒩 . Now, the SUs look to submit their
    bid values for the valuated channel wherein 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 represents the bid given away
    by SU i to get access to channel j. Every SU, constrained to the sequential-bidding
    condition, submits the valuation as its bid value, which assures a truthful auction.
    As such, when channel j is auctioned among SUs, a bidding vector 𝐵 𝑗 is built
    up such that 𝐵 𝑗 = { 𝑏 𝑗1 , 𝑏 𝑗2 ,..., 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ,..., 𝑏 𝑗𝑁 }, where bid 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 is given
    by Equation (1). 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨       𝑣 𝑗𝑖 0 if ∑ 𝑞=1 𝑀 𝑎 𝑖𝑞 =0 otherwise
    (1) Therefore, for M channels, the bidding vectors formed during the sequential
    strategy are 𝐵 1 , 𝐵 2 , ..., 𝐵 𝑀 . Incorporating a sealed-bid auction game in
    the model takes bid values as private information from the bidders. Thereafter,
    once a channel is allocated to the winner SUs, every winner SU i has to pay a
    price, 𝑝 𝑖 , to the auctioneer. P = { 𝑝 1 , 𝑝 2 , ..., 𝑝 𝑖 , ..., 𝑝 𝑁 } represents
    a price vector where 𝑝 𝑖 is the expense incurred by SU i on acquiring a particular
    channel. However, during the implementation of the pricing strategy, situations
    may arise where the PO may receive zero payment from a winner SU. To enable the
    PO to earn a minimal payment for its leased channels, we consider that the PO
    sets a reserve price on auctioning each channel sequentially. 𝑟 𝑗 represents the
    reserve price for channel j when the channel is auctioned in the jth round, and
    𝑟 𝑗 can be obtained using Equation (2). 𝑟 𝑗 ≤min{ 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ∈ 𝐵 𝑗 }s.t. 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≠0, 𝑟
    𝑗 ≠0 (2) Thus, when channel j gets assigned, the PO earns at least the reserve
    price 𝑟 𝑗 as its revenue. The utility earned by an SU is the difference between
    the valuation of the user for a channel and the price paid on acquiring the channel.
    The utility, 𝑢 𝑖 , of an SU i for a channel j can be represented as shown in Equation
    (3). 𝑢 𝑖 ={ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 − 𝑝 𝑖 0 if 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =1 otherwise (3) After leasing all the available
    channels, the auctioneer earns a revenue, ℛ , which includes the total price paid
    by the winner SUs and can be given by Equation (4). ℛ= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑝 𝑖 (4) The proposed
    approach tries to enhance the spectrum utilization, 𝒮 𝑢 , where 𝒮 𝑢 can be interpreted
    as the sum of the winning bid values from the SUs for all the assigned channels.
    With the channel allocation 𝐴= { 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 } 𝑁×𝑀 obtained from the bids submitted to
    the auctioneer, the spectrum utilization, 𝒮 𝑢 , can be given by Equation (5).
    𝒮 𝑢 = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑀 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 (5) Figure 2 shows a diagrammatic representation
    of the system model, where three channels, C1, C2, and C3, are auctioned among
    eight SUs, S1 to S8. Following the sequential-bidding strategy, when channel C1
    is to be allocated, the auctioneer receives bids from S1, S2, S3, and S5 and thereby
    assigns the channel to S1 and S3. For channel C2, even though S1 finds C2 to be
    available, it cannot bid for C2 since it has already been allocated the channel
    C1. Similarly, S1, S2, S3, and S7 cannot bid for C3. Figure 2. Diagrammatic representation
    of system model. To provide an efficient channel allocation, the proposed approach
    aims at maximizing the spectrum utilization across the network. Therefore, the
    problem for efficient channel allocation can be stated as an optimization problem
    as shown in Equation (6). Maximize 𝒮 𝑢 = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑀 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 subjectto (𝑖)
    𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =0,if 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =0 (𝑖𝑖) 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 + 𝑎 𝑘𝑗 ≤1,if 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 =1 (𝑖𝑖𝑖) ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑀 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ≤1,∀𝑖 (𝑖𝑣)
    ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =𝑛,0≤𝑛≤𝑁,∀𝑗 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ∈{0,1};𝑖,𝑘∈𝒩;𝑗∈ℳ (6) According to Equation (6),
    the channel-availability constraint (i), interference constraint (ii), and single-channel-multi-user-allocation
    constraint (iii) and (iv) are considered while designing the auction mechanism
    so that the spectrum utilization efficiency can be boosted in the CR network.
    Auction Properties The auction properties that are used for the single-sided auctions
    are as follows: Individual rationality: An auction is individually rational if
    no winning bidder pays a price that is higher than the bid value submitted for
    the auctioned item that it won. This implies that every winner will have a non-negative
    utility. Thus, when 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =1 , the winning SU i pays a payment 𝑝 𝑖 where 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≥
    𝑝 𝑖 . Truthfulness: An auction is truthful if no bidder can improve its utility
    by submitting a bid value that is different from its true valuation, 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≠ 𝑣
    𝑗𝑖 , no matter how other bidders bid for the item. Truthfulness is important to
    avoid market manipulations of the bid values to ensure an efficient auction. Bidding
    the true private valuation maximizes the bidders’ utility. 3.2. Challenges This
    section discusses the issues that arise when CR constraints are excluded in the
    spectrum-auction model, and the second-price auction for multi-winner allocation.
    3.2.1. Dynamics in SOPs In a CRN, every SU may not sense all the free channels.
    A channel available at one SU may become unavailable at another SU. This occurs
    due to the different hardware constraints faced by an SU during the sensing process
    [43]. Such a constraint also affects the channel-allocation process because if
    an SU bids for a channel that is not available with it and, going by the winner-determination
    strategy, if the SU wins the channel, then the channel will again remain unused,
    as the SU cannot perform any transmission. This degrades the spectrum utilization
    as well as the network throughput. Previously designed auction models for CRNs
    consider that an SU bids for all channels without having any prior knowledge on
    the channel availability of the SU. Additionally, some work considers that all
    the channels are available to each SU, which is generally not a practical scenario
    in CRNs. Thus, to absorb such a CR constraint, an SU has to initially sense its
    available channels before starting the bidding process. 3.2.2. Channel-Availability
    Time In a CRN, a channel allocated to an SU may become unavailable due to the
    return of the PU who leased the channel. Such a situation disturbs the transmission
    process of the SU. In an auction model, to avoid bidding for such channels, the
    SU needs to study the channel-availability time of every available channel. Thereafter,
    the SU bids for the channel only when its availability time is more than the time
    that the SU requires to transmit over the channel. None of the existing auction
    models for CRNs have incorporated this constraint while modelling the channel-allocation
    problem. Due to this, a winner SU may have to vacate its channel before completing
    its transmission, and this thereby results in a wastage of the assigned radio
    spectrum. Hence, excluding such a constraint can adversely affect the spectrum
    utilization as well as the network throughput. 3.2.3. Second-Price Auction The
    second-price auction (or Vickrey auction) [8] provides a truthful design model
    for single-unit auction scenarios that allows single-winner allocation (an auctioned
    item given to, at most, one bidder). When the second-price auction is being deployed
    to lease an item, the bidder with the highest bid value wins the item and pays
    the highest losing bid. This guarantees an optimal and truthful allocation of
    the auctioned item. Now, when sequential bidding is applied for bid collection,
    every channel is auctioned one by one in multiple rounds, and this relates to
    a single-unit auction in each round, where a second-price auction can be used
    to obtain an optimal allocation. However, such an auction is not suitable for
    multi-winner allocation, where one channel can be assigned to multiple non-interfering
    users. Therefore, on extending the second-price auction for channel reuse, we
    should be able to map different non-interfering SUs to one channel. To implement
    a simple framework (called the general sequential auction (GSA)) with the reusability
    feature, we assume that for the auctioned channel, the bidder with the highest
    bid is declared as a winner. Then, we move to the bidder having the second-highest
    bid. If the bidder does not conflict with the winning SU and satisfies the allocation
    constraint, then they too get included in the winner list. Otherwise, the third-highest
    bidder is picked up. This process repeats till the last SU in the list is reached.
    Such a method can lead to a group of non-interfering SUs for each channel. However,
    here, we may not obtain the group having a high total valuation for the channel,
    and this can reduce the use of the spectrum bands. Thus, the challenge in our
    proposed model is to choose the groups of SUs that can give a high total valuation
    and, thereafter, improve the overall spectrum usage. 3.3. SAMW Model The auction-based
    spectrum-allocation model SAMW tries to allocate the licensed spectrum efficiently
    in a CR environment. SAMW follows the procedure of the second-price auction by
    integrating spectrum reuse, where it maps a group of non-interfering SUs to a
    channel and maintains the economic properties. The PO auctions the available channels
    in decreasing order of their channel-availability times in M (the total number
    of channels) different rounds, allowing one channel in each round. That is, 𝑇
    𝐴(1) ≥ 𝑇 𝐴(2) ≥ 𝑇 𝐴(3) ≥...≥ 𝑇 𝐴(𝑀) An SU i who cannot win the auctioned channel
    in the jth round will decide to submit a higher bid in the (𝑗+1) th round. Bidders
    increase their bids so that their chances of winning the (𝑗+1) th channel increases.
    Moreover, such a strategy helps to improve the overall spectrum utilization along
    with the PO’s revenue. However, in cases where 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) = 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗+1) and 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 = the
    channel capacity, the SU i has to submit the same bid as in the jth round, i.e.,
    𝑏 (𝑗+1)𝑖 = the channel capacity. Again, when 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) ≠ 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗+1) and 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 = the
    channel capacity, the SU i cannot bid for the (𝑗+1) th channel since 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗+1)
    will be less that 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖(𝑗+1)) . For instance, let SUs, S1, S2, and S3, be the
    three bidders in the game where interference exists between S1 and S3, and S2
    and S3. Consider two channels C1 and C2 with channel capacities of 42 bps and
    availability times 𝑇 𝐴(1) =2.60 s and 𝑇 𝐴(2) =2.80 s, respectively. Both channels
    are available to all three SUs. Figure 3 and Figure 4 provide a diagrammatic view
    of this example. With sequential bidding, C2 is auctioned in the first round,
    and the bids are 𝑏 21 =3.32 , 𝑏 22 =3.71 , and 𝑏 23 =4.11 . Consider that S3 wins
    the channel C2. Now, in second round, remaining SUs will increase their bid values
    so that they can get the channel. 𝑏 11 =3.69 and 𝑏 12 =3.85 are the bids for C1.
    Thus, with multi-winner allocation, both S1 and S2 win C1, and the spectrum utilization
    obtained is 11.65. Now, let us consider concurrent bidding where all the channels
    are auctioned simultaneously. As such, every SU bids for all its available channels,
    giving 𝑏 11 =3.16 , 𝑏 12 =3.87 , and 𝑏 13 =3.56 for channel C1 and 𝑏 21 =3.32
    , 𝑏 22 =3.71 , and 𝑏 23 =4.11 for channel C2. The SUs S1 and S2 win channel C1
    and the SU S3 wins channel C2, giving an overall spectrum utilization of 11.14.
    Therefore, with homogeneous channels, sequential bidding is preferable since the
    bid values increase in each round, which always increases the spectrum utilization.
    However, no such strategy for bid submission can be applied in concurrent bidding.
    In the proposed model, on auctioning a channel j in the jth round, a bid vector
    𝐵 𝑗 gets formed and the PO sets a reserve price 𝑟 𝑗 based on the bids in 𝐵 𝑗 .
    Finally, when a channel is allocated to the winner SUs, the SUs and the channel
    can no longer take part in the further allocation process. Figure 3. Sequential
    bidding for homogeneous channels. Figure 4. Concurrent bidding for heterogeneous
    channels. Three different algorithms are carried out to solve the channel-allocation
    problem in the SAMW model. They are the group-formation algorithm, spectrum-allocation
    algorithm, and pricing algorithm. Figure 5 shows a flowchart representation of
    the proposed auction process, which implements the three algorithms on auctioning
    each channel. Initially, on starting the auction for a channel j, SUs decide their
    respective valuations for the channel and thereafter submit their bid values according
    to Equation (1). Furthermore, the three algorithms are carried out to decide the
    winners and the payment for the channel. Figure 5. Flowchart representation of
    the proposed auction process. 3.3.1. Group-Formation Algorithm This algorithm
    (Algorithm 1) forms groups of non-interfering SUs such that a common channel can
    be assigned to a group. It is executed for every auctioned channel one by one,
    where a winning bid value and a winner set of SUs are computed for every SU who
    bids for the channel. This constructs a winning-value vector, 𝒲 , and a winner-group
    vector, 𝒮 , which holds the winning bid value and winner set of SUs, respectively,
    for every SU bidding for the channel. Now, on auctioning a channel j, every SU
    computes a winner-deciding matrix, Z, one by one, given as 𝑍= { 𝑧 𝑖𝑘 } ∣𝒩∣×∣𝒩∣
    , where for the ith row, 𝑧 𝑖𝑘 = 𝑧 𝑖𝑙 = 1 implies that SUs k and l can be taken
    together for assigning the auctioned channel. For each SU i ∈𝒩 , matrix Z is initialized
    to 0, after which different SU combinations that include SU i are computed for
    the auctioned channel j while taking into account the interference and channel-availability
    constraints. Then, from Z, the SU combination that gathers the highest total valuation
    for the given channel is considered for further action. However, if ties occur
    for the total valuation, any one of the SU combinations is randomly picked. A
    winning-value vector 𝒲= { 𝑤 𝑖 } 1×∣𝒩∣ is built up, where 𝑤 𝑖 is the highest total
    valuation obtained from Z for SU i, and 𝑤 𝑖 = 0 when 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 = 0, which implies that
    SU i has no bid for channel j. To begin with, 𝑤 𝑖 is initialized to 0, ∀𝑖∈𝒩 .
    Additionally, a winner-group vector 𝒮= { 𝑠 𝑖 } 1×∣𝒩∣ , where 𝑠 𝑖 ⊆ {1,2,3, ...,
    N}, is constructed that holds the SU combination corresponding to the valuation
    entered in 𝑤 𝑖 . This implies that every element of 𝒮 is itself a vector of SUs,
    where initially, ∀𝑖∈𝒩 , 𝑠 𝑖 is taken to be empty. Once the algorithm completes,
    we get the groups that can participate in the auction process for channel j. For
    the computational complexity of Algorithm 1, we find that for every ith iteration
    of the outermost loop, the two inner loops run N times each. For every qth iteration
    of the first inner loop, there appears another inner loop that runs N times. Then,
    for every kth iteration, there can be (𝑁−1) runs to check for interference conditions
    in l∈SUList in the algorithm. Similarly, for every gth iteration of the second
    inner loop, another innermost loop runs N times. Hence, the overall time complexity
    for Algorithm 1 is computed to be O( 𝑁 4 ). 3.3.2. Spectrum-Allocation Algorithm
    With Algorithm 2, spectrum allocation is carried out for the auctioned channel.
    After 𝑤 𝑖 values are determined for all the SUs who bid for the channel j, we
    implement Algorithm 2, which picks the SU combination corresponding to the maximum
    total valuation in 𝒲 , and this accordingly updates the allocation matrix for
    channel j. For the computational complexity, there can be N runs for updating
    the allocation matrix, giving the time complexity as O(N) for Algorithm 2. 3.3.3.
    Pricing Algorithm On acquiring the channel j, every winning SU i needs to pay
    a price 𝑝 𝑖 to the auctioneer. If SU i remains unassigned, then 𝑝 𝑖 =0 . Otherwise,
    to compute 𝑝 𝑖 , Algorithm 3 is executed. A group of SUs who are interfering with
    SU i but not with other winners of channel j are gathered in 𝒟 . 𝐵 𝑗 ̃ holds the
    respective bids 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 , ∀𝑘∈𝒟 . Thereafter, Algorithm 1 takes 𝐵 𝑗 ̃ and 𝒟 as input
    to compute the highest total valuation from 𝑊 ̃ = { 𝑤 𝑖 ̃ } 1×∣𝒟∣ . If 𝑤 𝑖 ̃ =𝑚𝑎𝑥(
    𝑊 ̃ ) , then the payment 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑤 𝑖 ̃ . Otherwise, if ∄𝒟 satisfies the conditions
    for payment, then 𝑝 𝑖 is the reserve price, 𝑟 𝑗 , set for the channel. O( 𝑁 2
    ) gives the computational complexity for Algorithm 3. In brief, the proposed auction-based
    approach for spectrum allocation deploys a sequential-bidding policy that tries
    to proffer channel reuse while restricting to channel-availability and interference
    and allocation constraints, and eventually trying to enhance the overall spectrum
    utilization across the network. 3.4. Proof of Auction Properties Theorem 1. SAMW
    is individually rational. Proof of Theorem 1. For the proposed mechanism to be
    individually rational, every winner SU i has to pay a price 𝑝 𝑖 on wining a channel
    j such that 𝑝 𝑖 ≤ 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 when 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 = 1. According to the payment strategy in Algorithm
    3, SU i, on wining channel j, pays a price 𝑝 𝑖 from 𝒟 . There appears a group
    of SUs, 𝒢 , in 𝒟 , such that 𝑝 𝑖 = ∑ ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏 𝑗ℎ . Here, ∀h ∈𝒢 , 𝑥 𝑖ℎ =1 and 𝑥 𝑓ℎ
    =0 ∀𝑓∈𝒩 , where f is a winner SU of the channel j other than SU i. Moreover, ∑
    ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏 𝑗ℎ gives the highest total valuation in 𝒟 for channel j, where ∑ ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏
    𝑗ℎ ≤ 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 . Otherwise, if there is no such 𝒟 to get the payment, then 𝑝 𝑖 is the
    reserve price and 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≥ 𝑟 𝑗 according to Equation (2). As such, the 𝑝 𝑖 from
    SU i for channel j cannot be greater than bid 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , which in turn provides non-negative
    utility to SU i, i.e., 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 0.    □ Lemma 1. Given 𝐵 𝑗 = ( 𝑏 𝑗1 , 𝑏 𝑗2 ,...,
    𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ,..., 𝑏 𝑗𝑁 ), bids submitted by SUs on auctioning channel j. If SU i wins
    the auction for channel j by bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , then it also wins the channel by bidding
    𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 (provided that all other conditions remain same). Proof of Lemma
    1. On auctioning channel j, an SU i wins the channel by bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , which incurs
    the highest total valuation along with the other non-interfering winners for the
    channel. If ∃ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 = 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 such that 𝑎 𝑘𝑗 =0 , this implies that 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 =1 (other
    winners are non-conflicting with SU k). Otherwise, if 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 > 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , then SU i
    cannot win with 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 . Thus, submitting 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 will again allow SU i to
    win the channel. Additionally, if ∃ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 ≥ 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 such that 𝑎 𝑘𝑗 =0 , this implies
    that SU k interferes with some winner SU of channel j (other than SU i), which
    would a provide lesser or equal valuation for the channel. On bidding 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 >
    𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , SU i still wins the channel j irrespective of 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 ≥ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 or 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 <
    𝑏 𝑗𝑘 since the inclusion of 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 among the winning bid values increases the
    highest total valuation for the channel. □ Theorem 2. SAMW is truthful. Proof
    of Theorem 2. Let 𝑢 𝑖 and 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 represent the utility when SU i bids its true
    value 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and an untruthful bid 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≠ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 for a channel j, respectively. The
    proposed mechanism is truthful when no SU i can improve its utility 𝑢 𝑖 by submitting
    a bid value 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≠ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 for channel j, i.e., 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 (provided that all other
    conditions remain same). Case 1: 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 By Lemma 1, it cannot be true that
    bidder i wins the auction by bidding 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 but loses when it bids 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 since 𝑏
    𝑗𝑖 > 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Thus, the three subcases that can arise are: (1) When SU i loses the
    game by bidding both 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 ; the utility obtained is 𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 = 0 as
    per Equation (3). (2) SU i wins on bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 but loses for 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , which gives
    a utility 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . With 𝑝 𝑖 and 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 being the payment for 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑏 𝑗𝑖
    respectively, 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑢 𝑖 = 0. For 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 to lose, there can be a situation where
    ∃ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 ≥ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 = 1, such that the total valuation including 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 is higher
    than or equal to that including 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Additionally, there can be another situation
    where there appears a group of SUs, 𝒢 , such that ∀h ∈𝒢 , 𝑥 𝑖ℎ = 1, and 𝑏 𝑗ℎ <
    𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , but ∑ ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏 𝑗ℎ ≥ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Since 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 wins the game, this implies
    that 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 or 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = ∑ ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏 𝑗ℎ , following Algorithm 3. Hence, this
    gives 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . (3) When SU i wins by bidding both 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , this provides
    𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . With 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 winning the game, there may appear a bid 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 ≥ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and
    𝑥 𝑖𝑘 = 0 such that in one situation, SU k wins the channel j along with SU i,
    whereas in another situation, SU k cannot win the channel j even when 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 = 0
    because SU k interferes with a winner SU of channel j other than SU i, which yields
    a higher total valuation for the channel. On bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , SU i still wins, giving
    a payment 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑖 , where 𝑝 𝑖 is the payment for 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , since the highest
    valued group in 𝒟 is less than or equal to 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Additionally, with 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 = 𝑣
    𝑗𝑖 and 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 = 1, when SU i wins the channel and SU k loses, 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 if SU k
    is not interfering with other winners of channel j. Otherwise, 𝑝 𝑖 ≤ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 . With
    𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , SU i wins by paying 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑖 , giving 𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . Case 2: 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 < 𝑣
    𝑗𝑖 By Lemma 1, it cannot be true that bidder i wins the auction by bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖
    but loses when it bids 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 since 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 . Thus, the three subcases that
    can arise are: (1) For proving that SU i loses the game by bidding both 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 and
    𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , the same analysis as provided in Case 1 is used, which gives 𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′
    𝑖 = 0. (2) When SU i wins with 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and loses with 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 = 0. However,
    according to Theorem 1, 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 0, which states that 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . (3) When SU i
    wins by bidding both 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , a similar situation arises as discussed in
    Case 1. However, for 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 to win, 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≥ 𝑝 𝑖 , where 𝑝 𝑖 is the payment for 𝑣
    𝑗𝑖 . This gives 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑖 , and accordingly, 𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 .  Algorithm 1: Group-formation
    algorithm.  Algorithm 2: Spectrum-allocation algorithm.  Algorithm 3: Pricing
    algorithm. This completes the proof that a bidder cannot improve its utility by
    submitting a bid value that is different from the true valuation. □ 4. Performance
    Evaluation To evaluate the performance of SAMW, a MATLAB-based simulation was
    carried out as described in this section. We consider a CR environment with a
    PO acting as the auctioneer, who handles multiple bidders (SUs) that are randomly
    distributed in an area of size 800 × 800 m. We assume that the sensing data are
    obtained through an available robust sensing process, and this provides the set
    of free channels to each SU. Interference among the SUs was modelled by applying
    the distance-based criterion [44]. The channels available were taken to be GSM
    channels with a bandwidth of 200 KHz and channel capacity of 270 Kbps. First,
    we examined the proposed approach, SAMW, by comparing it with a general sequential
    auction (GSA), which applies a second-price auction with channel reuse as described
    in Section 3.2.3. Additionally, we compared SAMW with VERITUS [31]. VERITUS was
    chosen among the existing approaches since it is a single-sided model that also
    aims at improving the spectrum utilization, identically to SAMW. We considered
    that VERITUS abides by the network constraints and accordingly gathers the bids.
    However, in VERITUS, bids are submitted at once for all the channels since the
    channels are auctioned concurrently. Additionally, each SU will request only one
    channel according to the allocation constraint. Two different network scenarios
    were deployed, where in one scenario, the number of channels was varied as {4,6,8,10,12,14},
    keeping the number of SUs unchanged at 40, and in the other scenario, the number
    of SUs was varied as {20,30,40,50,60}, keeping the number of channels unchanged
    at 6. Then, we also explored the confidence intervals at the 95% confidence level
    for all the scenarios. Second, we compared SAMW (which allows spectrum reuse)
    with a simple second-price auction, which follows single-winner allocation. This
    explored the change in spectrum utilization with and without spectrum reuse. Third,
    to show the influence of the dynamics in SOPs and differences in channel-availability
    time in CRNs, we compared our model with VERITUS, where in VERITUS, none of the
    network constraints were incorporated (as in the actual model) to frame the model.
    For each type of scenario, we ran the simulation for 500 rounds to take the average
    values for each performance metric. The performance metrics used for evaluating
    SAMW are as follows: Average utility, ( 𝐴𝑣 𝑔 𝑢 ): This is the ratio of utility
    obtained by all the winning SUs to the total number of participating SUs, as expressed
    in Equation (7). 𝐴𝑣 𝑔 𝑢 = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑢 𝑖 𝑁 (7) User satisfaction ( 𝑈 𝑠 ): This is
    the ratio of the winner SU count for all the available channels to the total number
    of participating SUs, as expressed in Equation (8). 𝑈 𝑠 = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑀 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑎 𝑖𝑗
    𝑁 (8) Spectrum utilization ( 𝒮 𝑢 ): This computes the total winning bids from
    the winners as expressed in Equation (5). Revenue ( ℛ ): This gives the total
    earning of the auctioneer as expressed in Equation (4). Successful user ratio
    ( 𝒮 𝑟 ): This metric is used to show how the two network constraints can have
    an affect on the performance of the designed model. 𝒮 𝑟 is the ratio of the number
    of winning SUs who can complete their transmission to the total number of winning
    SUs in the model. 𝒮 𝑟 = ∑ 𝑖=1 ( 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) > 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗)) 𝑁 ∑ 𝑗=1 ∧( 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1) 𝑀 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ∑
    𝑀 𝑗=1 ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 (9) Discussion In Figure 6a–d, we show the plots for the performance
    metrics obtained by varying the number of channels. In Figure 7a–h, the confidence
    intervals for the performance metrics shown were obtained at the 95% confidence
    level by considering two different cases, four channels with 40 SUs and 12 channels
    with 40 SUs. These two cases represent the upper limit and the lower limit, respectively,
    for the graphs Figure 6a–d along the x-axis. From Figure 6a and Figure 7a,b, we
    can observe that with an increase in the number of channels, the spectrum utilization
    increases for all the approaches. This is due to the greater availability of spectrum
    resources, which allows a higher number of users to access the spectrum. The performance
    of the GSA is degraded as compared to that of SAMW because in the GSA, when a
    channel is auctioned, it starts by picking the highest-bidding SUs sequentially
    while restricting to network constraints. However, such an approach may not provide
    the highest-valued group for each channel, and this thereby decreases the use
    of the spectrum in the GSA. However, when the number of channels increases and
    gets closer to the number of SUs, then the GSA can outperform SAMW in certain
    cases. This occurs because a bidder who is chosen as a winner for a channel during
    SAMW may not be considered as a winner on auctioning the same channel with the
    GSA. This bidder then submits a higher valuation for another channel in the GSA,
    which when acquired by the bidder, improves the spectrum utilization. Additionally,
    VERITUS shows a decrease in its performance as compared to SAMW because in VERITUS,
    bids for all the available channels are collected concurrently, and the allocation
    process proceeds without considering the highest-valued group for every channel.
    Similarly, the revenue earned by the auctioneer increases with an increase in
    the number of channels as shown in Figure 6b and Figure 7c,d since a higher number
    of items are now available for auction. The payment algorithms are different in
    all three approaches. In the GSA, we pick the next-highest bidder for payment.
    In VERITUS, the next-highest bidder is picked while taking into account certain
    constraints in the model. In SAMW, we follow Algorithm 3 for payment, where SUs
    interfering with the winner are taken along with other different considerations.
    Thus, the revenue earnings with SAMW greatly depend on the interference status
    of the users in the network. Now, going by the payment algorithm in SAMW, we can
    find several winning bidders paying the reserve price, which thereby deteriorates
    the revenue in SAMW as compared to in the GSA and VERITUS. However, the use of
    the reserve price in SAMW helps the auctioneer to earn at least a minimal payment
    (always greater than zero) for each leased channel, which further improves the
    overall revenue. From Figure 6c and Figure 7e,f, we find that SAMW shows a greater
    improvement in average utility as compared to the other two approaches. This is
    accounted for by the payment algorithm taken up in SAMW, which creates high utility
    values (Equation (3)) amongst the winners. Similarly, user satisfaction shows
    a rise in performance as observed from Figure 6d and Figure 7g,h due to the greater
    availability of channels. When the number of channels is greater, a higher number
    of SUs can use the spectrum for their transmission. SAMW shows good results due
    to the allocation method applied in SAMW as compared to GSA and VERITUS. Figure
    6. Spectrum utilization, revenue, average utility, and user satisfaction for sequential
    auction-based multi-winner (SAMW), general sequential auction (GSA), and VERITUS
    with respect to number of channels. Figure 7. Confidence intervals at 95% confidence
    level for spectrum utilization, revenue, average utility and user satisfaction
    for 4 channels with 40 secondary users (SUs) and 14 channels with 40 SUs Figure
    8a–d display the plots for the performance metrics when we vary the number of
    SUs. Corresponding to these plots, we obtained the confidence intervals for the
    performance metrics at the 95% confidence level as shown in Figure 9a–h. Two different
    cases were considered while computing the confidence interval, 20 SUs with six
    channels and 60 SUs with six channels. These two cases represent the upper limit
    and the lower limit, respectively, for the graphs Figure 8a–d along the x-axis.
    In Figure 8a and Figure 9a,b, the spectrum utilization shows a rise in its performance
    upon increasing the count of SUs. This is because, with an increase in the number
    of SUs, there appears a higher number of bidders who can acquire the auctioned
    channel, and along with that, the range of bids gathered for the auctioned channel
    gets wider. However, the use of spectrum is comparatively less in the GSA and
    VERITUS. This is accounted for by the allocation methods deployed for both the
    approaches, where they do not look for the highest-valued group of bidders for
    each channel. Similarly, the revenue improves in all the three approaches since
    the number of buyers gets increased for an auctioned item. However, due to the
    payment algorithm designed in SAMW, the revenue gathered in SAMW is computed to
    be less compared to that for the GSA and VERITUS, which can be seen from Figure
    8b and Figure 9c,d. Then, from Figure 8c,d and Figure 9e–h, we can observe that
    the average utility and user satisfaction curves tend to decline with an increasing
    number of SUs. This is because, for same number of channels, more SUs claim to
    get access to the channel, incurring an increase in competition amongst the users.
    However, this decline appears to be moderate due to the implementation of channel
    reuse in the model. A performance comparison shows that SAMW outperforms the other
    two approaches to achieve good results in both the metrics. Figure 8. Spectrum
    utilization, revenue, average utility, and user satisfaction for SAMW, GSA, and
    VERITUS with respect to number of secondary users. Figure 9. Confidence intervals
    at 95% confidence level for spectrum utilization, revenue, average utility and
    user satisfaction for 20 SUs with 6 channels and 60 SUs with 6 channels. In Figure
    10a,b and Figure 11a,b, SAMW is compared with the second-price auction, which
    allows single-winner allocation for every auctioned channel. SAMW performs channel
    reuse where multiple non-interfering SUs can be simultaneously given a common
    channel. However, in the other approach, one channel can be assigned to only one
    bidder, whoever bids the highest. Under the two network scenarios deployed for
    simulation, we can infer that both the spectrum utilization and revenue show much
    improved performance for SAMW due to its reusability feature. Figure 10. Spectrum
    utilization and revenue for SAMW and second-price auction with respect to number
    of secondary users. Figure 11. Spectrum utilization and revenue for SAMW and second-price
    auction with respect to number of channels. Then, to show the impact of the two
    network constraints, i.e., the dynamics in the SOPs of SUs and varying availability
    time of channels, we obtained the curves shown in Figure 12a,b. Here, we simulated
    VERITUS such that it did not include any of the network constraints, according
    to [31]. Then, when we performed channel allocation in VERITUS, there could be
    some winning bidders who could not complete their transmission due to the constraints
    arising in the CRN. However, since SAMW makes up the model by incorporating such
    constraints, in SAMW, every winner SU can complete its transmission over the assigned
    channel, which can be viewed in both the figures. Accordingly, the spectrum utilization
    improves in SAMW because there is no wastage of the spectrum. Figure 12. Successful
    user ratio for SAMW and VERITUS. Hence, the results obtained through the network
    simulations state that the proposed auction model SAMW proffers an improved utilization
    of the unused radio spectrum, which in turn helps to settle the spectrum-scarcity
    problem. For the practical implementation of the auction model, we can use CR-related
    standards such as IEEE 802.22 (Wireless Regional Area Network) [45], IEEE 802.11af
    (Wi-Fi over TV whitespace) [46], etc. There should be practical infrastructural
    support and spectrum usage policy for running auctioneers, bidders, and auction
    centre functionality in the deployed network environment. 5. Conclusions In this
    paper, we propose SAMW, a single-sided sequential-bidding-based auction mechanism
    that enables spectrum reuse. On auctioning homogeneous channels, SUs offer different
    bid values according to their spectrum availability. Compared with existing research
    on CRNS, this model addresses two concerning issues surrounding CRNs, viz. the
    dynamics in the spectrum opportunities among SUs and varying availability time
    of channels, which further influence the bid-submission process. Winner determination
    and pricing strategies are carried out by the auctioneer to determine the winners
    and their respective payments. Truthful bidding strategies are used so that any
    kind of manipulation with the bid values can be avoided. Finally, the simulation
    results demonstrate that SAMW outperforms the GSA model as well as the VERITUS
    model in terms of spectrum utilization, revenue, average utility, and user satisfaction,
    which altogether enhance the network performance in a CRN. For future work, we
    would like to design a multi-channel-multi-winner-allocation scheme for CRNs by
    incorporating the CR constraints. Another future initiative could be to develop
    an energy-efficient approach that formulates an auction to allow channel allocation
    in a CRN. We can think of reducing the communication cost and computational cost
    or managing the number of phases in the auction process to achieve an energy-efficient
    solution for the spectrum-allocation problem. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction As we
    know in today''s world communication has become very effective tool in one''s
    life. Wireless communication is considered as one of the most successful contribution
    to the mankind. It is one of the fastest growing technology which has applications
    in all the fields such as medical, military, etc., and in future, it is believed
    to bring remarkable changes in the upcoming fields like virtual reality, deep
    learning, internet of things, etc. With the rise in radio devices and technologies,
    there is a huge surge in demand for the available radio spectrum which is becoming
    increasingly crowded due to underutilization of available spectrum. Presently,
    the available radio spectrum is distributed to licensed user or Primary user (PU)
    as a fixed frequency bandwidth, which is only utilized when the users use it at
    that time and free in the remaining of the time. Due to underutilization and inefficient
    use of available spectrum, hence the concept of cognitive radio is set forth.
    Cognitive Radio (CR) is an intelligent radio which can sense, learn and adapt
    to different situations concerning wireless communication and technology. Secondary
    user (SU) is an unlicensed user who can temporarily use the unused spectrum of
    primary users with the help of CR network. CR network detects the best available
    free channel in the communication media and tune the CR parameters according to
    it and allocate them to the secondary users without any interference which is
    caused during allocation and deal location of spectrum. when the primary user
    is inactive or underutilized, the CR network detects it and allocate it to the
    cognitive (secondary) users without any interference or noise and provides best
    quality of service, and if PU needs its allocated bandwidth then CR deal locates
    it from the SU in real time and allocates it to PU and at the same time it searches
    for the suitable idle channel of another PU and allocate it to the SU. The cognitive
    radio performs functions like spectrum sensing, management, mobility and sharing
    [1]. In Spectrum sensing, the CR network detects the available free channels,
    in order to use them effectively. Spectrum Management is the process of selecting
    the channels which can fulfil the communication requirements. Spectrum Mobility
    deal locates the channels from SU without any interference, if PU needs them and
    in spectrum sharing, a fair chance is given to all cognitive users to use the
    available spectrum. Lately, many evolutionary techniques such as Genetic Algorithm
    and swarm-based techniques such as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Particle Swarm
    Optimization (PSO), Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO), Bat Algorithm (BA), etc. which
    gaining more popularity in solving search based and other complex problems. They
    are preferred because they can solve complex problems in real time and very efficiently.
    Genetic Algorithm (GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), and Particle Swarm Optimization
    (PSO) are used for solving spectrum allocation problem in cognitive radio network
    by authors Zho et.al [1] and considered frequency accessibility matrix and the
    intrusion as limitations and these methods have shown better performance than
    the color sensitive graph coloring algorithm. Liu [2] used Maximal Independent
    Set [MIS] theory to solve spectrum allocation problem. Spectrum utilization, fairness
    and communication overhead are considered as constraints. The author achieves
    lowest communication overhead on the network. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), GA
    and PSO with limitation as spectral interference is considered by the author Pradhan
    [3], and proved ABC is superior over PSO and GA methods. The main drawbacks of
    this paper are size of cognitive radio and the acceptable interference power of
    licensed user (primary user), puts constraints on transmission power of cognitive
    user and restriction on the cognitive engine design. Ant colony system (ACS) and
    graph coloring problem (GCP) are used to find a solution to the frequency allocation
    issue by author Koroupi [4]. The Results are compared with the PSO and color sensitive
    graph coloring (CSGC) algorithm. ACS and GCP showed better results when compared
    with PSO and CSGC. But the running time is slightly higher. Simulated annealing
    approach and spectrum migration model have been considered by author''s Liu et.al
    [5] to determine the optimal spectrum assignment solution. Capacity, rate requirement
    and interference are considered as constraints. The algorithm performs better
    than the random and the greedy migration approaches. Bin Hou et al. [6] have applied
    an Improved GA method for spectrum allocation. Power consumption, user rate and
    a fairness of spectrum distribution are considered as constraints to exploit the
    transfer rate of a system. It showed better results compared with the simple genetic
    algorithm. Seshadri et.al [7] have used PSO for solving frequency allocation problem
    and identified the parameters influencing the resource sharing issues in cognitive
    radio networks. The main advantage of this paper is larger the number of particles
    and higher the rehearsals rises the suitability of the variables. Binary Particle
    Swarm Optimization (BPSO) and GCP algorithms are used by author''s Snehal et.al
    [8] for finding a solution to the problem of frequency assignment in cognitive
    radio network. Noise, bandwidth and channel availability are considered as parameters.
    It overcomes the problem rises due to disparity between the spectrum properties
    and the facility demands. Improved network and fairness reward can be achieved
    compared to another algorithm. Jamal [9] has approached the problem through G
    A method. Considered limitations, like population size, cross over, the amount
    of generations and the mutation rate. For radio channel allocation problem, it
    showed better results and it also takes less execution time. It endorses the real-time
    sharing of cognitive radio spectrum. To exploit the overall transfer rate of the
    system, with limitations such as bit error rate, total power usage and individual
    transfer rate are considered by authors Mishra S et al. [10] to solve spectrum
    allocation problem by using PSO method. The authors obtained the optimal solution
    and also achieved higher transfer rate by using a smaller number of iterations.
    SECTION II. Problem Formation In the entire spectrum only a part of it is being
    used and the rest is getting wasted which leads to the sub-optimal use of the
    spectrum. Hence, spectrum allocation is to determine a way in which the alternative
    resources can efficiently utilize the rest of the spectrum which is not used and
    also takes care that when the primary user can use their spectrum without any
    kind of interference due to sharing process. The aim of the paper is to exploit
    the overall assignment rate of the system by considering parameters such as entire
    power usage, individual allocation rate and bit error rate (BER). The above parameters
    are considered to make sure the distribution of spectrum among the users are fair
    and to make sure it is energy efficient with minimum BER. Each user is allocated
    with a subcarrier and, Multiple Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (MQAM) and transmission
    power of each subcarrier is determined. A spectrum allocation of each users to
    the subcarriers is denoted as S= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ S 11 ⋮ S M1 ⋯ ⋱ ⋯ S 1N ⋮ S MN ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    (1) View Source Where, s MN =( A mn ,T P mn ) A mn and T P mn represents MQAM
    modulation order and transmission power for the M th user and N th subcarrier.
    The overall transfer rate of the system is given by OTR= B ∗ ∑ N n=1 ∑ M m=1 U
    mn (2) View Source Where, B refers to the subcarrier bandwidth. The system has
    M cognitive users and N subcarriers. Spectrum utilization factor is given by U
    mn ≅0.5∗lo g 2 A mn (3) View Source Which is often characterized by the probability
    of spectrum hole utilization and is defined as the successful data transmission
    by the secondary user in the given transmission time provided as spectrum hole
    is currently declared and there is no interference to primary users during the
    transmission. Bit Error Rate (BER) of the scheme is given as E mn =  E=avg( E
    mn );  ∀ m,n  such that  A mn ≠0 [ 4 log 2  Amn ][1− 1 log 2  Amn − − − − − −
    − − √ ]erfc[ 3∗ log 2 Amn∗TPmn (Amn−1)∗N − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √
    ] (4) View Source The amount of an information stream received over a channel
    due to changes caused by interference, bit synchronization errors or distortion
    is the amount of bit errors. The bit error rate (BER) is the quantity of bit errors
    per unit time. Higher the MQAM modulation order higher the average bit error rate.
    Where, erfc is the complementary error function. Overall transmission power of
    the system is represented as OTP= ∑ N n=1 ∑ M m=1 T P mn  ;  ∀ mn  such that  A
    mn ≠0 (5) View Source Higher the MQAM modulation order greater the system transfer
    power will be needed. To exploit the overall transfer rate of the scheme, following
    conditions are considered: Transfer rate of individual should be larger than lowest
    transfer rate of any user: B ∗ ∑ N m=1 U mn ≥T R min (6) View Source Where, T
    R min is the lowest transfer rate for any user in Kbits/s. Average BER across
    the system should be less than maximum permissible BER. E≤ E max (7) View Source
    Where, E max is the maximum permissible BER. E is the average BER across the scheme.
    The overall transmission power of the system should be less than the maximum overall
    power usage of the scheme. OTP≤ O P max (8) View Source Where, O P max is the
    maximum overall power usage of the scheme. OTP is the overall transmission power
    of the system. The equation (6) represents the fitness function. SECTION III.
    Technique Particle Swarm Optimization Particle Swarm Optimization is a nature
    inspired Metaheuristics algorithm which is inspired by the behaviour of swarm
    searching for food. Kennedy and Eberhart are the first to propose PSO in the year
    1995. This algorithm makes use of social behaviour and dynamic movement of birds,
    fish and insects. When the swarm of birds disperse from one place to another in
    search of food, the bird which is nearer to the food source detect it and inform
    the birds closer to it. Information sharing and cooperation is essential among
    the birds to detect the food source. According to PSO, when a bird travels from
    one place to another it is considered as an optimal solution and the food they
    search is considered as global optimum of the whole search. Personal best is the
    highest optimal value obtained by an individual bird and the Global best refers
    to the highest optimal value obtained by the swarm of birds. In PSO, birds are
    considered as particles, each particle in the population is evaluated based on
    some fitness function set by the programmer based on the problem. The positions
    and velocities of each particle are calculated for every iteration and their personal
    best and global best are updated according to it. Personal best and global best
    ensure that the particle exchange information among themselves and move towards
    the local optimum and global optimum of the solution. III. Algorithm 1. Initialize
    the secondary users (population) and subcarriers with arbitrary positions and
    velocities. 2. Find the fitness function of each secondary user with subcarrier.
    3. Find and update personal best (Pbest) and global best (gbest) of all secondary
    users (particles). 4. Compute and update the velocity of each secondary user with
    subcarrier. 5. Compute and update the position of each secondary user with subcarrier.
    6. Find the best fitness function 7. Update the fitness function as global best.
    8. Stopping criteria reached (if false go to 2) 9. End Velocity of the particle
    is defined by V new i =w∗ V old i + a 1 ∗ r 1 ∗(pbes t old i − P old i )+ a 2
    ∗ r 2 ∗ (gbes t old i − P old i ) (9) View Source Position of the particle is
    defined by P new i = P old i + V new i (10) View Source Where, P old i is the
    position of ith user with subcarrier in the previous iteration, P new i is the
    position of ith user with subcarrier in the current iteration, V old i is the
    velocity of ith user with subcarrier in the previous iteration, V new i is the
    velocity of ith user with subcarrier in the current iteration, r 1 and r 2 are
    random values between 0 and 1, w is the inertia weight, a 1 is the accelerating
    factor of local information and a 2 is accelerating factors of local and global
    information. In this paper, spectrum allocation of users to the subcarrier using
    PSO algorithm is considered. A population of users with a subcarrier is taken
    which is shown in the matrix S in Eq. (1). The fitness function of each user with
    subcarrier is determined by using Eq. (6). For each allocation of user to the
    subcarrier, personal best and global best are determined and then new velocities
    and positions are evaluated and updated. This procedure is repetitive till the
    assignment of spectrum which provides the highest overall transfer rate, with
    the limitations of overall power usage, BER and individual transfer rate, i.e.,
    the best allocation is determined. The flow chart in Fig. 1 signifies the steps
    of the projected method. Fig. 1 Proposed PSO algorithm Show All SECTION IV. Experimental
    Setup MATLAB tool is used for the execution of the proposed mechanism on a laptop
    having Intel i3 core processor and 8GB RAM. The number of iterations = 100. The
    number of users = 50. The available carriers = 1000. The sub carrier bandwidth,

    . The highest overall power usage, OPmax=90 W . SECTION V. Results and Discussions
    The simulation outcomes are shown in Fig. 2–11. The simulation results obtained
    shows a higher overall transfer rate of the system with faster execution time
    using PSO algorithm. The overall transfer rate increases in parallel with increase
    in modulation order, total system bandwidth i.e., increase in subcarriers or subcarrier
    bandwidth. At around 60 iterations, the proposed approach coincides, which makes
    this approach more efficient and faster. Since the sharing of information among
    the secondary users i.e., cognitive users take place resulting in more than one
    optimal solution which is more preferable than the previous one. We have taken
    values of number of iterations, TTR and time taken and plotted graphs for different
    bandwidth a) Total Bandwidth = 30 MHz Fig. 2 Number of iterations vs. time taken
    Show All Fig. 2 shows the plot of number of iterations v/s time taken by each
    user to converge towards available spectrum, i.e., with the subcarrier, it is
    found that it takes only 0.04 seconds. This attribution is due to the fact that
    the secondary users exchange information among them continuously till they obtain
    the available subcarriers. Fig. 3 Total system transfer rate vs. time taken Show
    All Fig. 4 Total system transfer rate vs. no. of iterations. Show All Fig. 3 and
    4 shows the overall transfer rate v/s time taken and number of iterations respectively,
    it is seen that the overall transfer rate increases with time and number of iterations,
    it converges around 60 iterations, which makes it a fast and an efficient method.
    This is happening due to the fact that the cognitive users are exchanging information
    among them, thereby interpreting every successive generation a more ideal one
    than the earlier. b) Total Bandwidth = 60 MHz Fig. 5 No. of iterations vs. time
    taken Show All Fig. 6 Total system transfer rate vs. time taken Show All Fig.
    5, 6 and 7 shows the plot of number of iterations v/s time taken, overall transfer
    rate of v/s time taken and overall transfer rate v/s number of iterations for
    a bandwidth of 60 MHz. It is seen from the plots that as the bandwidth increases
    the overall transfer rate of the system also increases and time taken for each
    iteration is also more. This is due to the fact that as the number of iterations
    increases, the time taken to converge by the cognitive user towards the available
    subcarriers also increases, because of large bandwidth optimal searching of available
    subcarriers also increases. The procedure is repeated for a system bandwidth of
    120MHz, the respective outcomes of the simulation are shown in the fig. 8, 9 and
    10. Fig. 7 Total system transfer rate vs. no. of iterations Show All c) Total
    Bandwidth 120 MHz Fig. 8 No. of iterations vs. time taken Show All Fig. 9 Total
    transfer rate vs. time taken Show All Fig. 10 Total transfer rate vs. no. of iterations
    Show All Fig. 11 No. of iterations vs. time taken Show All Fig 12: Overall transfer
    rate v/s no. of users Show All Fig. 11 and 12 shows the number of iterations v/s
    time taken and Overall transfer rate v/s the number of users, it is found that
    the proposed scheme provides larger assignment rates. Table 1: Overall transfer
    rate for different system bandwidth Table 1 provides the summary of overall transfer
    rate for different system bandwidth, it seen that as the system bandwidth increases
    the overall transfer rate of the system also increased. The simulation outcomes
    show that a larger assignment rate is obtained with a quicker execution time by
    making use of PSO approach. The users are taken as particles in PSO algorithm
    and modulation order is initialized randomly to the users which is allocated with
    a subcarrier and total transfer rate is found out with respect to the modulation
    order. Hence the PSO technique is a tangible and quick approach to achieve spectrum
    sharing in cognitive radio networks. SECTION VI. Conclusion Spectrum sharing approach
    using PSO for the cognitive radio networks has been designed under the constraints
    of overall power usage, bit error rate and specific allocation rate. Due to the
    implementation of information exchange mechanism in the proposed PSO technique,
    it offers a larger allocation rate instantaneously with smaller amount of rehearsals
    to determine a finest result. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    As the number of devices connected to the internet increases day by day, there
    is a severe constraint on the allocation of spectrum resources. It is a well-known
    fact that spectrum is a limited resource. Spectrum bands are open auctioned, and
    are sold to the highest bidder. Broadly speaking, communication spectra are divided
    into licensed and unlicensed bands. The licensed user has access to the channel
    at all times. However, when the licensed user does not use it, the channel is
    available for communication. According to the federal communications commission
    (FCC), spectrum under utilization is one of the main causes of this spectrum scarcity.
    This gave rise to a new generation of edge devices called cognitive radios (CR).
    A CR is an enhanced software-defined radio, which learns from its environment,
    and can also adjust to changes in the nature of licensed signals, network parameters,
    and Qos requirements. Primary applications of CR include communication systems
    that require high reliability whenever and wherever needed [1]. CRs extend the
    functions of a software radio. A major hurdle in a wireless network is efficient
    spectrum management. Even with significant investment in 3G infrastructure, the
    spectrum allocated to 3G was limited. To overcome this, CR offers a new class
    of protocols called formal radio etiquettes [2] for the flexible pooling of radio
    spectrum resources. Similarly, the works in [3]–[5] have explored the design of
    CR in a 4G network. In recent times, with the advent of 5G and its close interlude
    with internet-of-things (IoT), the number of devices connecting to the internet
    is now more than ever. Hence the need to inculcate CR networks to utilize the
    spectrum effectively has become an important research topic. Although several
    classical signal processing methods exist for CR applications like spectrum sensing,
    dynamic spectrum access, decision-making, and spectrum prediction, they are model-based
    and their performance degrades with uncertainties in model [6]. On the other hand,
    ML techniques exploit the experimentally captured data, and when trained properly
    across a variety of data, can robustly learn the radio environments, adapt to
    new conditions and consistently yield a good performance. These algorithms are
    modular in their architectures and hence form elegant solutions to problems encountered
    in CR networks [7]. In this paper, we present a contemporary survey on the utility
    of ML algorithms for CR applications. As mentioned earlier, ML algorithms are
    envisioned to solve several problems in CRNs, thanks to the rapid development
    in ML techniques and architectures. First, we present a high-level overview of
    some of the key challenges in CRNs and mention the architectures and algorithms
    in ML that can be used to alleviate them. Next, given the vast scope of approaches
    for CR, we focus our attention on two fundamental applications, namely spectrum
    sensing (SS), dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and subtopics such as cooperative
    sensing, spectrum prediction and spectrum auction. We provide a detailed description
    of recent advancements in the field of ML for CR for the above mentioned applications.
    Moreover, we briefly discuss a set of challenges in real-time implementation of
    the mentioned ML techniques. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    Some of the key challenges in CRNs and corresponding ML-based solutions are presented
    in Section II. Section III details the SS problem in CRNs, and presents the popular
    ML algorithms for conventional and cooperative SS. In Section IV, DSA is studied
    in detail as a learning problem, and existing ML solutions for problems such as
    spectrum auction and spectrum prediction are discussed in detail. Common challenges
    encountered while employing ML techniques for CR are briefed in Section V, and
    concluding remarks are provided in Section VI. SECTION II. Key Challenges and
    Ml Solutions In this section, we discuss some of the major challenges in designing
    a CR network, and mention some of the ML-based solutions to alleviate them. At
    a high level, these key challenges in CRNs can be categorized into four classes,
    namely, radio scene analysis, channel identification, spectrum management and
    resource management, as shown in Fig. 1. A CR needs to be aware of the radio frequency
    activity in its environment. In radio scene analysis, SS and interference control
    are the two important tasks. The key problem in SS is to detect white spaces,
    while in interference control, the requirement is to avoid harmful interference
    with a primary user (PU). Distributed Q-learning has been proposed to control
    the interference caused by multiple CRs on a PU [8]. Game theory and reinforcement
    learning are some of the popular techniques used in spectrum management [9], [10].
    In resource management, the goal is to manage the resources in an efficient way
    to meet the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Frequently used algorithms
    in channel estimation and spectrum prediction are hidden Markov model and long
    short term memory (LSTM), respectively. Other ML algorithms for various tasks
    under these four categories are mentioned in Fig. 1. Due to the vast advancements
    in the field of ML for CR, we restrict our attention to ML techniques for SS and
    DSA in this paper. In the next section, we discuss the advancements in SS in detail.
    Fig. 1: Key challenges in cognitive radios and the corresponding machine learning-based
    solutions. Show All SECTION III. Spectrum Sensing Spectrum sensing is one of the
    most essential functionalities in a CR, which is the task of deciding the presence
    or absence of a PU. Many classical signal processing methods such as energy detector
    (ED), matched filter detector (MFD), cyclostationary feature-based detector, and
    differential entropy detector (DED) have been proposed [11], [12]. However, there
    are some limitations to these methods. In the case of ED, the variance of the
    noise has to be known a priori in order to set the threshold. The MFD assumes
    that the CR has complete information about the primary signal, while the cyclostationary
    detector is computationally complex. To overcome these problems, several ML algorithms
    have been proposed [13]–[16]. In an ML framework, SS can be framed as a classification
    problem [17]. The received signal power and the correlation of the cyclic prefix
    were used as inputs to train a naive Bayes'' classifier in [17]. Cyclic prefix
    induced correlation was used to overcome the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) wall
    phenomenon in ED in [18], [19]. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for SS
    were proposed in [15], [16], [20], [21]. Similarly, a deep learning classification
    technique was proposed in [15]. The power spectrum of the received signal was
    used as the input to train the CNN model. Normalization of the input signal power
    was performed to solve the problem of noise uncertainty. Different types of modulation
    schemes like BPSK, QPSK, FSK, QAM, and PAM were used for training. A four-layer
    CNN was developed in [20] to restrict the computational cost while meeting the
    SS requirements. The proposed method was evaluated against a dataset collected
    in the ultrahigh frequency TV band. The aim of the proposed method was to decrease
    the training duration in cases where the input signal features change. Transfer
    learning was used to decrease the training duration, as it enables a swift adaption
    to changes in frequency, environment, and location. Exploiting the knowledge of
    history of the activity of a PU, [21] uses a CNN-based deep learning algorithm
    for activity pattern aware spectrum sensing (APASS). This approach was data-driven
    and did not assume any information about signal statistics and PU activity pattern
    model. For model-based frameworks, the sensing performance depends on the accuracy
    of the considered models. However, when used on real incoming data, there can
    be mismatches and the performance of the above methods can decline significantly.
    No such assumptions are made in data-driven frameworks. These methods learn from
    the pattern present in the input. This helps in reducing the effect of model-mismatch
    problems. Two phases are proposed in data-driven detectors, namely (i) offline
    training phase, and (ii) an on-line detection phase. In [21], the correlation
    matrix (CM) was used as a test statistic for SS, since it contains information
    of the energy of the signal and correlation among the signals. Interestingly,
    this can also be interpreted as an image and passed to CNN as inputs for training.
    To capture the activity of a PU, the present CM and past CM of the PU signal were
    considered for training. These inputs were passed through several convolution
    and max-pooling layers. The output after these layers were flattened and concatenated.
    After applying a softmax regression, sensing results were interpreted. The APASS
    algorithm has the advantage that it can learn the PU activity pattern with no
    prior assumption on the PU signal and the signal model. Next, we look at some
    of the methods proposed for cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS). A. Cooperative
    Spectrum Sensing In conventional SS, a single CR senses the spectrum for channel
    availability. Two main problems occur because of this approach: (a) the hidden
    node problem, and (b) loss of performance due to multipath fading. To overcome
    these problems, cooperation among CRs is desired [22]. The CSS method makes use
    of spatial diversity in CRs for an enhanced sensing accuracy. In CSS, the CRs
    can be simple sensors and the fusion centre (FC) can have a powerful computing
    capability. There is always a tradeoff between the CR overhead and the sensing
    accuracy. Classical fusion methods such as the OR rule, AND rule, K-out-of-N rule,
    counting rule, and linear quadratic combining rule have their associated advantages
    and disadvantages. These methods require setting a threshold value to make optimum
    decisions, and are not scalable. In CSS with ML framework, this threshold setting
    is not required. Several ML algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, have
    been proposed for CSS in existing literature [23]–[27]. Energy vector, where each
    element is the energy of the received signal measured by a CR has been used for
    classification [14], [23], [28]–[30]. The training time of the ML models increases
    with increase in number of CRs. To overcome this problem, authors in [24] propose
    using low dimensional probability vectors as features. It is shown that the N
    -dimensional energy vector y follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The
    mean vectors and covariance matrices under each hypotheses are written as μ y|
    H i =[ μ y 1 | H i ,…, μ y N | H i ] T ,i=0,1, Σ y| H i =diag{ σ 2 y 1 | H i ,…,
    σ 2 y N | H i },i=0,1, (1) (2) View Source where diag(.) denotes a diagonal matrix.
    The corresponding Gaussian distribution values of y are computed and fed as input
    to classifier, which reduces the training time. Finding an idle channel quickly
    with high probability can be improved, if the channel occupancy statistics by
    a PU is known. To this end, authors in [25] use Q-learning to find the order in
    which channels are to be sensed. Further, to improve the sensing accuracy, discounted
    upper confidence bound (D-UCB) is used to select a SU partner for cooperation.
    The sensing accuracy is also known to increase if the data points of signal present
    and absent classes are well separated. The hidden PU problem is known to decrease
    the separability of these classes [31]. To tackle this, [31] proposes a strategy
    to place CRs to increase spectrum sensing coverage. The analytical expression
    for spectrum sensing coverage is derived based on Kullback-Leibler divergence
    between the distributions under each class. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
    technique is also known and is used to improve spectrum utilization. Authors in
    [32] consider power-domain NOMA with CSS, in which the same resource block is
    used by two PUs with different transmit power levels. Unsupervised algorithms
    such as GMM, K-Means, and supervised algorithms such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN),
    directed acyclic graph support vector machine (DAG-SVM), and back propagation
    (BP) algorithms were studied, with energy vector as a feature. A total of M CRs
    are considered, and each user measures energy locally over L time slots. Thus
    a matrix Y∈L×M is defined as a energy-based feature, which is considered for training
    and testing. Multiple PUs may operate in the environemnt around a CR, over the
    same frequency band. Such a setup is considered in [27], which considers a cellular
    network where frequency is reused by neighbouring cells, which are sufficient
    distance apart. In this setup, a multi-class classification is considered, by
    considering spectrum availability across space and time. Error-correcting output
    code based multi-class support vector machine classifier is used for classification.
    In a CSS scenario, the number of CRs may not be sufficient to sense all the PU
    channels for some applications. To solve this, a multiuser, multiband SS problem
    was formulated as a partially observable stochastic game in [33], which proposed
    a collaborative distributed multiagent RL-based SS to solve this problem. The
    CRs select a detection threshold such that a constraint on probability of miss
    is satisfied. The selection of the threshold is done according to the required
    diversity order. In each state, each SU chooses a frequency band to sense, and
    receives a reward based on the sensing results. The local decisions are fused
    by considering the neighbouring CRs for each frequency band. The reward each CR
    receives is based on the number of vacant channels. The aim of each CR is to increase
    the expected sum of future rewards given a constraint on the probability of miss.
    To optimize the above goal, an optimal action-value function is used. However,
    constructing lookup-tables of q values across all possible state-action pairs
    is not practical. Therefore, [33] employs a linear approximation on the action-value
    function, which reduces the computational complexity. Through simulation results,
    it is shown that this method provides an efficient way to find vacant spectra
    in a multiuser, multiband CRN. Deep learning (DL) on each CR to know about the
    status of the PU channel is presented in [30]. A matrix containing locally measured
    energy in each frequency band by each CR is fed as input to the DL model. However,
    collecting this information from each SU increases network flow and usage of resources.
    Hence, reinforcement learning (RL) is used to select a few CRs to update their
    locally sensed energy in the input matrix in the present time slot. In RL, there
    is a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation [34]. The term exploitation
    refers to choosing an optimal action from the action space which provides maximum
    rewards, whereas exploration is choosing an action other than the present optimal
    action so as to explore new actions which may provide higher rewards. Exploitation-only
    causes convergence to a suboptimal solution, while frequent exploration decreases
    average rewards. SECTION IV. Dynamic Spectrum Allocation After sensing the channels
    and detecting the spectrum holes, CRs are assigned a channel each for data transmission.
    Conventionally, fixed spectrum is assigned to users to perform data transfers.
    However, in a CRN, the CRs need to vacate the spectrum upon the arrival of the
    PU. Hence DSA is necessary to prevent interference with the PU. The main task
    in DSA is to allocate available channels to different CRs based on a chosen performance
    metric, with a constraint on interference to PUs and other CRs. In [35], DSA for
    a decentralized, ad-hoc CRN is considered. The CRs continuously learn their environment
    and share the information with neighboring CRs over a common channel. Each CR
    learns about the pattern of channel acquisition by the PU and other CRs, which
    is carried out by Tsigankov-Koulakov self-organizing maps, a special case of ANN.
    The throughput of CRs can be significantly improved if patterns in the PU traffic
    is exploited by a learning algorithm. In [36], CRs use a two-stage reinforcement
    learning to estimate the channel to be sensed, and its availability time. In the
    first stage, the modified optimistic Thompson sampling algorithm is used to return
    a list of available channels in order. In the second stage, a Bayesian method
    is employed to determine the length of channel availability. Authors in [37] define
    a monopolistic market environment with a single PU (monopoly), N CRs and C subchannels.
    Each CR bids for channel access from a PU, and the PU gives channel access to
    the highest bidder. Probabilistic reinforcement learning is employed in both PU
    and CRs to learn the optimum strategy. Authors in [38] consider QoS requirements
    of CRs, and an optimization step is proposed before SS. Two strategies are proposed,
    namely wideband predictive sensing (WBPS) and Q-learning enabled WBPS (QWBPS).
    Prediction of future traffic loads of various radio access technologies (RAT)
    such as GSM, LTE, IEEE 802.11n, is performed at the CR base station (BS). In WBPS,
    the BS chooses a RAT with less likely traffic load, based on the request by a
    CR node. Then, CR performs narrow band SS for the activity of that RAT. In QWBPS,
    the BS performs Q-learning by taking input as QoS requirements, demands of the
    CR node and predicted traffic loads to find the best RAT to sense. A. Spectrum
    Auction and Leasing Spectrum auction is an effective method to exploit the under-utilized
    spectrum for data transmission. When not in use, the licensed spectra is auctioned
    to unlicensed users. In return, licensed users relay their transmission through
    the unlicensed users to save power. An extensive survey on the spectrum auction
    procedures for wireless systems is presented in [39]. In-depth analysis of various
    auction models like forward, single-sided, double-sided, open-cry, and sealed
    cry is presented. Further, a survey of single-hop and multi-hop systems are presented
    as examples for resource allocation in CRNs. In DSA, only CRs are assumed to be
    the players. Each player can place a bid by specifying their will to spend certain
    amount of power to relay the PU data. In [40], an asymmetric cooperative communication-based
    spectrum leasing for both centralized and distributed architectures is presented.
    In the former, a decision centre assigns a bid for each PU channel based on the
    previous assignments through reinforcement learning. In the latter, an auction
    game-based protocol is presented, where a CR places a bid on every channel of
    the PU separately. The PUs on each channel selects a CR based on the bid that
    helps it to maximize the total power savings. The PU receivers can learn and adapt
    through reinforcement learning and increase the minimum bid to minimize their
    power spent for data transmission. Repeated auction has been adopted to maximize
    the tradeoff between the gain and cost in accessing channels [40], [41]. CRs are
    selected based on their past auction history and valuations. Spectrum access in
    CR can be formulated as a dynamic game because of the distributed nature of the
    users. In [41], a Bayesian non-parametric belief update scheme is proposed to
    solve such a game. This scheme achieves a good trade-off between fairness and
    efficiency. A two-stage spectrum sharing method is presented in [42]. They consider
    a scenario where each PU has a different amount of spectrum to sublet. The spectrum
    auction is performed in the first stage. Based on the winner, each PU determines
    a limit for the spectrum recall for the next round. In the next stage, using the
    Stackelberg pricing game, spectrum recall on both PUs and CRs is optimized. In
    the Stackelberg game, PUs and CRs act as leaders and followers respectively. Any
    strategy adopted by the PUs affects the actions of the CRs. Therefore PUs adopt
    an optimal strategy by studying the actions taken by the CRs. Spectrum is assigned
    to the winning CR. However, CRs are informed of the spectrum recall. Therefore,
    CRs start competing among themselves to reduce the total sum of recalled spectrum.
    The outcome of this process is reduction in payments. Both theoretical and simulation
    results show that using this two-stage resource allocation scheme in spectrum
    sharing improves the utilities. B. Spectrum Prediction Spectrum prediction is
    an important topic of research in the field of CR, which aims to improve the time
    and energy efficiencies of the SS process. SS with a large number of PU channels
    would require large sensing time and considerable sensing energy. With spectrum
    prediction, CRs minimize the number of channels sensing channels by choosing those
    which have a high chance to be vacant in the upcoming time slot. The prediction
    algorithms have become significantly better with the advent of ML research. This
    section aims to capture some of the key works in this aspect. In [43], four supervised
    ML techniques, recurrent neural networks, multilayer perceptron and SVM (Gaussian
    and linear kernel) were compared for DSA. Poisson, interrupted Poisson and self-similar
    traffics were used for analyzing the PU environment. Among the learning models
    considered, SVM with linear kernel was found to yield a consistently best performance
    across all the traffic patterns. The LSTM networks are a popular choice due to
    its feedback nature and ability to remember past inputs and results. The LSTM
    networks are designed to tackle the problem of longterm dependency. An LSTM network
    was used in [44], whose output was classified into two classes. With the same
    number of hidden layers and neurons, LSTM shows more encouraging results compared
    to the back-propagation network. A deep learning-based approach was developed
    in [45] by simultaneously predicting multi-slot ahead states of multiple spectrum
    points within a period of time. Supervised learning is initially employed to construct
    samples on short and long term high frequency data. Further, advanced residual
    network modules extract characteristics in these data with diverse time scales,
    which are classified using a deep temporal-spectral residual network. A fusion
    of statistical and predictive modelling of spectrum occupancy was proposed in
    [46] for enhanced dynamic spectrum access. An investigation was conducted to characterize
    the spectrum occupancy of the PU with the help of generalized Gaussian mixture
    models(GMMs). Further, the working of the proposed GMM was validated through learning
    based prediction via recurrent neural networks. Neural networks (NN) offer both
    flexibilities in architecture and consistency in results. Hence, a number of variants
    of NN are proposed and are shown to have reliable performance. A multilayer perceptron
    (MLP) is implemented in [47]. The model does not require a prior knowledge of
    the traffic distributions of the PU and hence is particularly useful in real-life
    scenarios. Another architecture that does not require any a priori knowledge is
    the neural network developed on the basis of a genetic algorithm model. Simulation
    results in [48] indicate that such a method can predict spectrum availability
    accurately and further improve the prediction accuracy compared to other neural
    network-based prediction techniques. A further improvement to the conventional
    back propagation (BP) based NN is seen in [49]. For input, channel states are
    used instead of channel power values. An optimization of the back propagation
    method is performed by using momentum algorithm and genetic algorithm in the prediction
    scheme. Further, a threshold interval is applied to determine predicted channel
    states. This is shown to have superior performance when compared to the conventional
    BP based NN. Time delay neural networks are designed to predict time-series data.
    Next, we discuss some challenges encountered while employing ML methods in CRNs.
    SECTION V. Challenges The main challenges associated with ML algorithms in CRNs
    include: (a) complexity of the real-time model, and (b) the convergence of these
    algorithms within a limited time [50]. Most of the ML algorithms learn from a
    pre-recorded dataset. They find patterns, develop understanding and evaluate their
    prediction confidence from the training data. Therefore the training time depends
    on the size of the dataset and the veracity of the dataset [51]. Another challenge
    faced is to ensure that the security of the device and the network is not comprised
    [52]. As the number of devices grows, there is an increase in the device-to-device
    interaction in a distributed architecture. Therefore, PU emulation can send bogus
    SS results, thereby degrading the throughput of the network. In a centralized
    architecture, malicious users can overload the BS with erroneous results. The
    deployed algorithms have to provide a work around to mitigate this. Further, real-world
    test bed for testing these algorithms has not yet been systematically addressed
    [53]. Hence, CR algorithms trained a dataset may not be robust to work effectively
    in a different environment. Robustness and scalability are two key problems which
    are encountered while implementing ML methods for CRNs. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    In this paper, we discussed ML algorithms for CRNs for non-cooperative and cooperative
    SS, spectrum auction and prediction in DSA applications. At a high level, we discussed
    the set of major challenges in CRNs and mentioned the ML techniques to alleviate
    them, and also briefly discussed the challenges in implementation of these ML
    algorithms. Given the pros and cons of the discussed ML techniques, they offer
    a great value addition to performance analysis and practical implementation of
    CRNs in the near future. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Solan, India SECTION I. Introduction CR is
    a hardware device which has a capability of tuning to any frequency band and receives
    any modulation transversely in the wide frequency spectrum and it processes these
    signals through software. Initially, the CR observes, learns, senses the RF environment,
    and detects the RF activity of multiple bands, standards and channels. After gaining
    this information based on learning and observation, the CR adapts to the environment
    by dynamically changing its transmission parameters according to the changing
    environment and performs to give the optimal output. These key functions of CR
    are shown in the Figure 1. CR joins various wellsprings of data, decides its present
    activity settings, and teams up with other intellectual radios in a remote organization;
    hence it becomes a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). By practically implementing
    this cognitive radio technology, Secondary User (SU) can sense and able to know
    which portion of the spectrum is accessible. Based on it, SU could be selected
    the optimized channel availability & access the allocated spectrum with another
    users also whenever main user again claim for spectrum (Haykin&Simon 2010). The
    sensational increment of quality of service & channel-limit in wireless systems
    is extremely restricted by the lack of energy and transmission capacity, that
    has primary resources. In this way, scientists are as of now focusing their consideration
    on new interchanges and systems administration standards that can use these rare
    resources in efficient manner. Cognitive-Radios is one basic powerful innovation
    for futuristic correspondences and systems administration that could use the restricted
    system resources in a more proficient and adaptable way. It varies from modernized
    correspondence ideal models in which the radios or devices can adjust their working
    parameters, for example, transmission power, frequency, modulation sort, and so
    forth, to the varieties of the encompassing radio environment (Haykin& Simon 2010).
    FIGURE 1: KEY FUNCTIONS OF COGNITIVE RADIO Show All The variation of environmental
    of CRs during the working mode, the cognitive radio should 1st enhance the fundamental
    data. There are different qualities that handle cognitive radio devices to know
    about radio waves and transmitting wave correspondence system sort as per requirement.
    The geographical information, locally open resources and organizations, customer
    needs, security approach, and so forth After CR gadgets collect their necessary
    information from the radio climate; they could drastically alter their transmission
    boundaries as shown by the distinguished climate assortments and achieve ideal
    execution, which is determined to as configurability. SECTION II. Block Chain
    Overview Blockchain adoption is gaining huge momentum as industry is evolving
    at a fast pace. Many startups have initiated use cases and there is significant
    rise in investments in blockchain projects as well. Although blockchain is still
    evolving in terms of technological maturity, innovative experimental adoption
    and customization are continuously rising. Blockchain has the potential of displacing
    a setup innovation and stirs up the business or a pivotal item that makes a totally
    new industry [16] and initial trends with the rise of crypto currencies has signaled
    that blockchain has been disruptive for the banking industry and financial services.
    Crypto currency has the potential of shaking a centralized banking system by eliminating
    the need to pay fees for using credit or debit cards. Recent Trends have shown
    that blockchain is turning out to be a sustaining technology rather disruptive
    and has huge potential in supply chain healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) education
    and public services. Commercial viability and acceptability of blockchain are
    on the rise and 3021 patent families related to blockchain applications are divided
    into four sub-categories based on different types of application like Payments
    and Transaction systems, Financial services business, Administration and E-commerce.
    Extensive use of cryptography and decentralization makes it highly secure. Privacy
    issues over public blockchains can be addressed by implementing blockchain in
    a controlled manner (permissioned blockchain). Blockchains can be named public,
    private or half and half variations, contingent upon their application [25]. Public
    – No one owns Public blockchains, they are fully decentralized and are visible
    by anyone. Private – These are also referred to as permissioned blockchains and
    uses privilege to control who can peruse from and write to the blockchain. Hybrid
    – These blockchains are public just to an advantaged bunch. Agreement measure
    is constrained by special workers utilizing a bunch of rules consented to by all
    gatherings. FIGURE 2: AN OVERVIEW OF BLOCK CHAIN ARCHITECTURE. Show All Blockchain
    may record exchanges, contracts, data resources or for all intents and purposes
    whatever can be put away in advanced structure. Blockchain records are lasting,
    carefully designed, straightforward, and accessible. Each new \"block\" created
    is added to the furthest limit of a \"chain.\" Initiation, validation, storage,
    and distribution of each new block is managed by a protocol. Blockchain replaces
    the need of third-party intermediaries and participants of blockchain run complex
    algorithms to certify the integrity of records in the block. Blockchain hence
    is an interesting alternative to how data is stored. Databases have been the way
    to store data in databases. Though databases are quite fast and user friendly,
    they too have limitations and issues like lack of immutability. Following table
    highlights key differences between blockchain and databases. Table 1 Comparison
    of Databases with Blockchain Blockchain is a system having various components
    that work together to perform transactions of business operations. Each element
    in the blockchain has a specific role to play as listed below. Node: Node is a
    computing device within a blockchain that can initiate, receive or validate a
    transaction. A node operates with the help of a software application that offers
    various functionalities related to the business use case. Blockchain typically
    has two kinds of nodes i.e., validator nodes and member nodes. Validator nodes
    have more capabilities as compared to member nodes as they could initiate, received
    & validated a transaction whereas defined nodes can only initiate & receive a
    transaction. Transaction: Transaction in a blockchain is a collection of various
    data items that carries facts about the exchange of something like product, service,
    entity, event or anything that carries value. Block: A Block is a data structure
    that keeps a set of transactions. Every block on successful verification is distributed
    to all nodes of the blockchain network. A block contains various elements as shown
    in Table 2. Block number can be used for unique identification of blocks in a
    chain of blocks. Nonce is a random number that helps generate a hash code with
    reasonably difficult mathematical computation. Previous represents the hash code
    of the previous block and Hash represents hash code of current block. Chain: Chain
    in a Blockchain is an interconnected sequence of blocks in chronological order
    with the latest block in the last with each block having reference to its previous
    block to trace back the complete blockchain. Miners: a blockchain may have two
    kinds of nodes Miner nodes (also called Network nodes) and User Nodes. Miners
    are the one who have the copy of the blockchain and they also participate in the
    block verification process, whereas User nodes can only initiate a transaction.
    Consensus: Consensus algorithms are used to assure necessary conformity on a single
    state of the network consisting of distributed machines or network nodes in a
    blockchain system. The consensus is assessed by comparing the hash codes of all
    copies of the chain. SECTION III. Requirement For Security In Cognitive Radio
    Network Cognitive Radio has the ability of adjusting to nature and make improvements
    in view of their interaction capacities for the secure correspondence. Contrasting
    the wired system together with the wireless system, the security is powerless
    if there should arise an occurrence of remote system. At the point when the information
    is sent by means of a wireless system, then there is a probability of eavesdropping,
    or alteration, which causes congestion. The Cognitive Radio systems have one of
    the specific characteristics that security turns to be an essential thing over
    it. FIGURE 3 MESHARCHITECTURE OF CRN Show All SECTION IV. Trust Based Algorithm
    To Access the Secured Spectrum Dubey Rajniet al. (2012) have suggested that Wireless
    Spectrum was valuable, so there are dependably necessities of dynamic shared spectrum
    strategies as well as the intelligent wireless correspondence structure, for example,
    Cognitive-Radio Network (CRN). In spite of the fact that, CRN gives reliability,
    mobility, awareness, flexibility and adaptability to its clients yet it has likewise
    opens the entryway for more number of dangers and assaults. In this paper, different
    conceivable assaults and dangers together with the possible approaches are explained.
    This paper likewise proposes a trust based security calculation enabling intellectual
    radio to acquire the appropriated estimation, conservers, and assets are available
    in Cognitive Radio climate. The Trust Based Algorithm proposed is connected concerning
    the area identification and distance between the versatility of customers. Trust
    is registered from the genuine acquired force esteems and trust estimations are
    assessed by uniting the necessities of the dependability and the QoS with the
    connection ways. In light of this calculation, three dimensional (3D) masterminds
    the structure and it was used to affirm the space of the fundamental (essential)
    customer and pernicious customer. Proposed calculation has portrayed the trust
    segment of various customers on the reason of dependability. The recreation yields
    clarify the significance of the proposed trust based calculation for all of the
    three kinds of customer. They are essential, auxiliary and threatening customer,
    as far as both security as well as the performance. ParvinSazia&FarookhKhadeer
    Hussain (2012) have proposed Cognitive Radio (CR) thus it was considered to be
    an essential (primary) system to distinguish whether a specific portion of the
    radio spectrum was presently being used, and it is utilized to quickly involve
    the useless spectrum without disturbing the transmissions of different clients.
    Wang Ji & Ray Chen (2014) have proposed Cognitive radio networks being promising
    approach for spectrum limitations. Secondary Users (SUs) receive sensing mechanism
    to take in the essential client''s (PU''s) availability. This work builds up a
    trust-based information accumulation approach to adapt malignant SU assault in
    spectrum detection of the cognitive radio systems. The proposed plan joins the
    direct and second-hand detecting confirmation to ensure the general execution
    and receives a static diversion model to avoid malignant SUs from reporting fake
    recognition parameters. Theoretical as well as simulation outputs demonstrate
    that the proposed plan exceeds the conventional aggregation plan regardless of
    a high rate of malicious hub density and can viably recognize malignant hubs from
    ordinary hubs by their enumeration scores. Spectrum detecting, spectrum administration,
    spectral sharing, and mobility of a spectrum are a portion of the difficulties
    in CRN security. Ensuring reliable range discovery is a of the significant applications
    in-CRs. The fundamental sign assessment is recommendation in the proposed investigation.
    Trusted on range distinguishing occurs if the fundamental sign is imitated & seen
    precisely. e.g, a noxious customer just as hackers can interpret the fundamental
    (essential) customer flag and include the range for childishness (Ian F Akyildiz
    2006). Further, the cloud usage to take out the wrapped porting issues were managed
    in (Chen et al. 2008). The response for impediment issue was proposed in (Chen
    et al. 2008) and range distinguishing can be perceived successfully through various
    customers in a pleasant way. When the free range is distinguished, the best availability
    bandwidth would be perceived via neighborhood discernments & quantifiable features.
    The customary controlling issue incorporates the exchanging of safety keys betn
    the centers. The approval among the centers gives securities & dependability of
    the trades. This strategy gives the ideal securities however the secret porting
    issue actually remains. SECTION V. Blockchain In Supply Chain Blockchain adoption
    is gaining huge momentum as industry is evolving at a fast pace. Many startups
    have initiated use cases and there is significant rise in investments in blockchain
    projects as well specially across diverse sectors such as supply chain [20] and
    financial industry has been the prime sector for blockchain adoption. There are
    many use cases that can apply Blockchain technology for making processes more
    efficient and effective [28]. With the rise in digitization and process automation
    organizations need to maintain a competitive advantage by adopting technological
    enhancements across their process that decrease Turnaround time to address speed
    to market &the ability to rapidly navigate alteration models of buisness Supply
    chains have huge scope for blockchain adoption and involve complex operations
    and transactions having product variety, global sourcing of components with strong
    emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness [23]. Supply chains systems involve interaction
    of multiple stakeholders and participants across various business processes like
    manufacturing, freight and logistics, financial, sales and distribution. These
    systems may involve interaction with government entities and several third-party
    service providers. There is a requirement of a robust system to ensure quick and
    effective coordination with multiple stakeholders like freight forwarder, customs
    broker, banks and so on). Supply chains can be significantly transformed by using
    smart contracts to facilitate trust with the blockchain system and to ensure operations
    with minimal human intervention. Production network the executives are to coordinate
    all the inventory network activities that length all upgradation & crude oil volumes,
    work-in-measure stock & completed merchandise via the starting place to the utilized
    mark [45]. The basic test is to track down the best store network arrangement
    with the end goal that activities can be acted in an effective and responsive
    manner administrative and consistence necessities. [27]. Supply chains cover complex
    interactions of various stakeholders and complexity of operations increase with
    time [21] [29]. There are many factors that contribute to the complexity of supply
    chain systems as listed below Continuous innovation in product development and
    service delivery processes. Regular change in Continuous extension and topographically
    spread provider and client organizations. Process re-appropriating; hazard the
    executives’ practices and security contemplations. Rise of e-business and innovative
    changes to speed up change in provider organizations and client assumptions. Expected
    expansion in the quantity of members inside the inventory chains. As supply chains
    become more complex, this leads to firm’s exposure to greater volume of data [27].
    This leads to data management challenges to ensure data perceivability and straightforwardness
    for existing and recently added activities in supply chains. There is risk of
    reduction of data accuracy as information is obtained from multiple diverse sources
    [27]. Subsequently, keeping both visibility and value of data in spite of involvement
    of diverse stakeholders is imperative for sustained efficiency and responsiveness
    in supply chain systems. As supply chain management covers internal and external
    participants, appropriate and precise information transfer is mandatory to achieve
    improved performance in supply chain systems. SECTION VI. Blockchain Use Case
    Selection and Design Process Blockchain use case selection involves many decisions
    based on following criteria and NITI Ayog has published a blockchain use case
    selection framework [29] as shown in Figure 4 that covers all these. Is there
    a compelling business case to reduce intermediaries? Are Multiple Stakeholders
    Involved? Are we working with advanced resources rather than actual Assets? Do
    numerous gatherings require shared compose access? Do we require superior and
    fast exchanges? Do we plan to store non-conditional information as a feature of
    your answer? Do we need to depend on believed parties for consistence reasons?
    Do we have a powerful Tokenomics Model? Do we need the capacity to control usefulness?
    Should exchanges be public? The structure presents following four potential results
    dependent on models, Don’t use blockchain Blockchain can’t do this effectively
    yet solutions are in development shown fig 4 ❖ Strong case for public blockchain
    ❖ Strong case for private blockchain FIGURE 4: FRAMEWORK FOR BLOCKCHAIN USE CASE
    EVALUATION Show All From that point onward, an assortment of plan choices around
    blockchain arrangement should be made, similar to the sort of blockchain, agreement
    convention, block size and recurrence. The bolts just represent one of the potential
    groupings to settle on plan choices. A few choices are required to set up acceptable
    levels of expansion (like block size and rate of occurrence), security, cost of
    processing and performance [26]. SECTION VII. Conclusions In this paper, somewhat
    recently, extraction of requisition for the remote admittance to the web has caused
    traffic of some limited groups of ranges of radio wave. Nonetheless, there are
    a few groups of recurrence that are doled out to the authorized client and are
    underutilized more often than not. Psychological Radio (CR) is a promising innovation
    that could beat such difficulties by giving astute admittance to the non-utilization
    limit. Regardless of the number of advantages brought by CRs to remoted area organizations,
    such innovative & difficulties notwithstanding those that are as of now present
    in the remote organizations. In this work, at first the overall ideas of CR, psychological
    radio organizations, and security issues in intellectual radio organizations were
    examined. Then, at that point three principle issues in giving got correspondence
    were distinguished. Blockchain arrangements should be assessed as far as their
    versatility and cost-viability to address worries of business supervisors. This
    is a significant test and an unavoidable issue is what might befall the current
    functional framework and what amount of time it would require to create another
    blockchain based framework. The motivation of doing this research is to understand
    and analyze the Blockchain technology, and explore its applicability in addressing
    challenges of existing supply chain cyber physical systems in a cost effective
    manner. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This wChain:

    for Sixth-Generation (6G) networks by reusing each MNO’s 28 GHz spectrum to SCs
    of about 33.33%, 50%, and 50% less number of buildings than that required by the
    SLSA for a spectrum reuse factor of six per building of small cells. 1. Introduction
    1.1. Background Nowadays, radio spectrum scarcity has become a major issue in
    mobile communications due to a nondynamic or static allocation of spectrum to
    Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to serve a growing user demand for high capacity
    and data rates. Such static allocations of spectrum cause a large segment of the
    allocated spectrum idle, resulting in a low utilization. As per [ 1], the occupancy
    of spectrum below 3 GHz varies from 15% to 85%, which reflects as well a considerable
    variation in the utilization of spectrum in that region. Recently, cognitive radio
    (CR) has been considered as a key enabling technology to address this spectrum
    scarcity issue [ 2]. In CR, spectrum access is a major function [ 3], which prevents
    simultaneous access of any spectrum by primary and secondary user equipments (UEs).
    In this regard, interweave and underlay are two major spectrum access categories
    in CR that exploit the power domain (PD) to limit the transmission power of secondary
    UEs (SUs) to reduce interference to primary UEs (PUs) while ensuring the quality-of-service
    [ 4]. In case of interweave, only the unused spectrum by PUs can be accessed by
    SUs opportunistically. Though interweave access needs additional spectrum sensing
    by SUs to find an idle spectrum of PUs, SUs are allowed to transmit at the maximum
    power. In contrast, in the underlay spectrum access, SUs can simultaneously access
    the spectrum of PUs subject to satisfying the interference threshold set by PUs.
    In addressing the cochannel interference (CCI) limit by SUs toward PUs, even though
    underlay suffers from the reduced transmission power of SUs, no spectrum sensing
    is needed by SUs. Hence, though both the interweave and underlay have pros and
    cons when employing separately as aforementioned; the combination of these two
    spectrum access techniques (also termed as hybrid interweave-underlay technique)
    can improve spectral and energy efficiencies [ 4] even further. More specifically,
    SUs can explore the interweave access when the spectrum of PUs is idle and the
    underlay access when the spectrum of PUs is busy. This allows SUs to operate at
    the maximum transmission power during an idle period in contrast to operating
    at the reduced transmission power when employing only the underlay access all
    the time. 1.2. Related Work and Problem Statement A number of research works have
    already addressed the interweave and underlay spectrum access techniques both
    separately and jointly. For example, several works have already been carried out
    in the existing literature on the underlay technique as follows. In [ 5], an interference
    management method to share spectrum using the underlay access, and in [ 6], an
    investigation on the quality-of-service-aware user selection approach for the
    CR underlay access, have been addressed. Moreover, a study in [ 7] and a survey
    in [ 8] on resource allocation of underlay CR networks have been carried out.
    Furthermore, in [ 9], a technique employing the underlay access for small cells
    located in buildings in the multiple MNO scenario has been presented. Similarly,
    regarding the interweave access, the authors in [ 10] have investigated the resource
    allocation in interweaved primary and secondary multicast networks, whereas, in
    [ 11], the authors have addressed the stable throughput of an interweave CR. Further,
    the authors in [ 12] have provided a detailed analysis of the interweave policy-based
    CR network. Furthermore, in [ 13], the authors have presented a novel approach
    and investigated the impact of imperfect channel knowledge on the performance
    of the interweave systems, whereas, in [ 14], the author has presented an interweave
    shared-use model in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. Moreover, a number of existing
    researches have addressed already the hybrid or joint interweave-underlay spectrum
    access technique. For example, the author in [ 15] has proposed a novel hybrid
    interweave-underlay spectrum access and reuse technique for the countrywide full
    28 GHz spectrum. Moreover, in [ 16], a hybrid underlay-interweave mode enabled
    cognitive radio network (CRN) scheme, and in [ 17], a hybrid interweave-underlay
    spectrum access scheme in the 5 GHz has been proposed. Besides, for the performance
    analysis, the downlink capacity region of a secondary network has been presented
    by the authors in [ 18] for a hybrid underlay-interweave paradigm. However, a
    consensus about the more suitable spectrum access out of the interweave and underlay
    for SUs is not too obvious [ 2]. Besides, most data are originated indoors, particularly
    in urban buildings installed with small cells [ 19]. Hence, it is critical to
    serve high capacity demand in such buildings. In this regard, operating small
    cells in the mmWave spectrum bands in such buildings can be a promising candidate.
    Along this direction, a comparative study relating to the PD based dynamic spectrum
    access techniques in CRN, particularly, when employing the interweave and the
    underlay spectrum access techniques separately, as well as jointly, to avail more
    spectrum within multistory buildings may contribute to serve the growing capacity
    demand indoors, which, however, has not been addressed in the existing literature.
    1.3. Contribution and Novelty (1) Contribution. To address the issues outlined
    above, PD based dynamic spectrum access (PDSA) techniques are proposed for the
    dynamic spectrum access of the 28 GHz spectrum of an MNO, referred to as primary
    MNO (p-MNO), by in-building small cells of the other, referred to as secondary
    MNO (s-MNO) by controlling the transmission power of small cells of each MNO countrywide.
    The proposed PDSA techniques explore the traditional interweave and underlay spectrum
    access techniques both separately and jointly. The following are contributed in
    this paper (i) The proposed techniques along with the system architecture are
    presented (ii) We then derive generic expressions for the average capacity, spectral
    efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), cost efficiency (CE), and throughput
    per small cell UE performance metrics for a country with an arbitrary number of
    MNOs (iii) Extensive numerical and simulation results and analyses are carried
    out to evaluate the performance when employing the interweave and underlay spectrum
    access techniques jointly, as well as separately (iv) Finally, we evaluate the
    SE and EE performances of the proposed techniques against the SE and EE requirements
    for Sixth-Generation (6G) networks (2) Novelty. The above contribution is an extended
    version of the conference work [ 20]. The novelty of the contribution due to the
    extension to [ 20] can be summarized as follows (a) Relaxation of the Constraint
    and Estimation of the Generic Performance Metric. In [ 20], the mathematical analysis
    and evaluation are carried out for a specific number of MNOs (i.e., four MNOs)
    in a country. We relax this constraint by considering MNOs of any number countrywide.
    Correspondingly, generic expressions for the performance metrics are deduced and
    analyzed by introducing newly the properties of Pascal’s triangle and the equal
    likelihood criterion (b) Spectrum Reusing. Unlike [ 20], we consider exploiting
    the spectrum allocated to each MNO in the primary level (even after sharing with
    other MNOs) further in the 3-dimensional space of a multistory building of small
    cells to reuse the same spectrum of each MNO more than once to its small cells
    within the building subject to satisfying a minimum CCI threshold set by the operators
    in prior (c) Inclusion of New Result and Discussion. Unlike [ 20] that deals only
    with the hybrid access technique in PD, we explore the interweave and the underlay
    access techniques separately, as well as jointly, to provide a complete PD based
    dynamic spectrum access analysis by presenting their relative outperformance when
    each of them is employed individually, as well as in a hybrid mode. Moreover,
    two more performance metrics, including average CE and throughput per small cell
    UE, are introduced newly, and performance evaluations of the proposed techniques
    in terms of these metrics are carried out 1.4. Organization The following are
    performed section-wise to address PDSA techniques. In Section 2, PDSA techniques
    and system architectures are discussed. In Section 3, we perform relevant mathematical
    analysis to derive average capacity, SE, EE, CE, and throughput per small cell
    UE performance metrics by employing the proposed techniques. Parameters and assumptions,
    as well as simulation results and analyses are presented in Section 4 to demonstrate
    that employing interweave and underlay techniques jointly performs better than
    when employing each of them separately. Moreover, we also show that the interweave
    and underlay spectrum access techniques, regardless of employing them separately
    or jointly, can address both SE and EE requirements for 6G networks. The paper
    is concluded in Section 5. 2. System Architecture and Proposed Techniques 2.1.
    System Architecture We consider that an arbitrary number of O MNOs is operating
    in a country. An example of system architecture is shown in Figure 1 for four
    MNOs (i.e., ), represented as MNO , where . Assume that each MNO has a similar
    architecture, and hence, only MNO 1 is shown in detail in Figure 1(a) for simplicity.
    All small cell base stations (SBSs) are deployed only within multistory buildings.
    Though in practice, an SBS can serve multiple users simultaneously, we limit the
    maximum number of users that an SBS can serve at a time to one to take advantage
    of the system-level modeling due to its insignificant variation with the number
    of users served simultaneously by an SBS. Picocell base stations (PBSs) help offload
    a portion of traffic of the macrocell base station (MBS). All in-building SBSs
    operate at the 28 GHz, whereas MBSs and PBSs operate at the 2 GHz. Each MNO is
    allocated to the same amount of the 28 GHz spectrum, which can be shared among
    them by employing the proposed PDSA technique. An illustration of sharing 28 GHz
    spectra of other MNOs with a small cell of MNO 1 is shown in Figure 1(b). Remark
    1. An SBS usually serves a small group of users within a small area, and the speed
    of a UE in the indoor environment is very low such that the channel variation
    at this speed can be considered negligible for a Line-Of-Sight (LOS) 28 GHz mmWave
    channel. Further, since Resource Blocks (RBs) are allocated orthogonally by any
    proportional fair scheduler to small cell UEs of an MNO, the overall system-level
    capacity and other associated performance metrics are not affected by the change
    in the number of active small cell UEs per SBS (i.e., small cell UE density).
    Hence, following numerous existing literature [ 21, 22] that considered as well
    the user density of one UE per small cell (e.g., femtocell), we also adopt that
    each SBS serves only one UE at a time. Certainly, in practice, the UE density
    per SBS can be more than one. However, such simplicity in assumptions is suitable
    for closed-form expressions and reasonable for the system-level performance evaluations.    Figure
    1  A system architecture consisting of MNOs in a country. denotes the transmission
    power of an in-building small cell base station of MNO 1. 2.2. Proposed Techniques
    We propose power-domain based dynamic spectrum access (PDSA) techniques by controlling
    the transmission power of in-building small cells of any MNO in a country stated
    as follows. The 28 GHz spectrum allocated to an MNO, called primary-MNO (p-MNO),
    in a country can be shared with small cells in a building of the other MNO, called
    secondary-MNO (s-MNO), subject to satisfying the condition that each small cell
    of the s-MNO operates at the maximum transmission power if no UE of the p-MNO
    is present, whereas at a reduced transmission power if a UE of the p-MNO is present.
    The transmission power of small cells of the s-MNO is reduced commensurate with
    the interference threshold set in prior by the p-MNO. As indicated above, using
    the PDSA techniques, in addition to operating at either the interweave spectrum
    access technique (i.e., operating at the maximum transmission power) or the underlay
    spectrum access technique (i.e., operating at a reduced transmission power) separately,
    by exploring both techniques jointly based on the presence of UEs of p-MNOs, in-building
    small cells of an s-MNO in a country can be operated in a hybrid interweave-underlay
    technique. In executing the proposed PDSA techniques, SBSs of the s-MNO keep sensing
    to identify UEs of each p-MNO to update the spectrum access mode to either the
    interweave or the underlay or the hybrid interweave-underlay to limit CCI to UEs
    of the respective p-MNO. In this regard, to switch between the transmission power
    levels corresponding to the interweave and underlay spectrum accesses, both reactive
    (where an s-MNO executes the sensing operation) and proactive (where the arrival
    of UEs of a p-MNO are predicted based on the knowledge of traffic model [ 23])
    spectrum sensing techniques can be used. Moreover, since the licensed spectrum
    of an MNO can be reused in space subject to satisfying a minimum CCI, we consider
    employing the spectrum reusing technique on top of the dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA) techniques by exploiting the space-domain. In this regard, by forming a
    three-dimensional cluster of small cells within a building subject to satisfying
    a minimum CCI between cochannel SBSs, the same spectrum allocated to each MNO
    in the primary-level can be reused to improve the spectrum utilization further.
    3. Mathematical Analysis 3.1. Preliminary Consider that there are O MNOs countrywide
    which are allocated to a total of 28 GHz spectrum. is expressed in Resource Blocks
    (RBs), and an RB is equal to 180 kHz. Denote as the 28 GHz spectrum allocated
    to an MNO such that and . Further, let and denote the number of macrocells and
    picocells per macrocell, respectively, of any MNO. Also, let denote the number
    of buildings per macrocell and denote the number of small cells per building.
    Assume that each building has small cells. Also, denote as the simulation run

    power of an SBS of MNO when operating under the interweave and underlay spectrum
    access techniques such that . Denote as the interference threshold at a UE of
    a p-MNO in the underlay spectrum access. Then, the transmission power of a small
    cell of an MNO needs to be adaptive as follows [ 24] when operating in the underlay
    access for an interference channel gain of . The received Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise
    Ratio (SINR) at in Transmission Time Interval (TTI) =  at a UE of an MNO can be

    a link throughput at in for an MNO in bps per Hz is given by [ 25, 26]. Using
    (4), the total capacity of macrocell UEs of MNO is given by where denotes 2 GHz
    spectrum in RBs of an MBS of MNO . and are estimated over RBs in for MNO . 3.2.
    Spectrum Sharing in PD Recall that we consider one small cell per MNO , which
    can serve a maximum of one UE at a time in each apartment of a building. A UE
    of an MNO may either exist (represented by binary 1) or not (represented by binary
    0) in an apartment such that UEs can coexist in a maximum of possible ways, as
    shown in Table 1 for . Let each combination of coexistence of O UEs in an apartment
    is equally likely. Hence, given the existence (i.e., the binary state 1) of a
    UE of an MNO over , UEs of other MNOs can coexist with that of MNO in a maximum
    of (i.e., 8 for ) possible ways (Table 1); each occurs with a probability of (i.e.,
    for ). Table 1  Coexistence and shared spectrum for UE u1 of MNO 1 using the proposed
    technique. For example, as given in Table 1, for a UE of MNO 1 as an s-MNO, all

    MNO 3, and MNO 4 as p-MNOs, respectively, are the following , , , , , , , and

    using Table 1, for an arbitrary number of MNOs countrywide, the components of
    the shared spectra can be expressed as where such that Table 1 follows a left-justified
    Pascal’s triangle [ 27] as shown in Table 2 for . Each entry in row and column

    spectrum components in Table 1 [ 27]. Note that the same component of the shared
    spectrum exists more than once, and the complete set of components of the shared

    multiplier, for a UE of an MNO (shown in Table 1) can be expressed in Table 2
    as follows [ 27] . Assume that and denote, respectively, the received SINR at
    in at a UE of an MNO when operating under the interweave spectrum access and the
    underlay spectrum access techniques. Let and denote, respectively, the link throughput
    corresponding to and . Now, using (2) and (4) and following Table 1, the aggregate
    capacity of MNO when employing only the interweave access is given for an SBS
    , as well as all SBSs per building, as follows. Similarly, when employing only
    the underlay spectrum access technique, the aggregate capacity of MNO is given
    for a small cell , as well as all small cells per building, as follows. However,
    when employing the hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access technique, the aggregate
    capacity of MNO can be given for a small cell , as well as all small cell per
    building, as follows. Hence, for (11), the countrywide aggregate capacity of all
    MNOs for a building of SBSs is given by, Like (12), using (6) and (8), we can
    derive the countrywide capacity when employing the interweave spectrum access
    technique and the underlay spectrum access technique, respectively. Hence, in
    what follows, for brevity, we consider only the hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum
    access for further analysis. However, the analysis is equally applicable when
    employing the interweave, as well as the underlay, spectrum access techniques.
    3.3. Spectrum Reusing The spectrum allocated to each MNO in the primary level
    even after sharing with other MNOs can be exploited further in the 3D space of
    a multistory building of small cells. A minimum distance between cochannel small
    cells located on the same floor and across different floors for reusing the same
    28 GHz spectrum multiple times within a multistory building of small cells can
    be defined subject to satisfying a minimum CCI threshold set by the operator in
    prior. The number of small cells that falls under the 3D space within the building
    represents the size of a 3D cluster of small cells such that the same spectrum
    can be reused for MNO to each cluster of small cells. Moreover, the external wall
    penetration loss for a building is high, particularly for a high-frequency signal
    such that reusing the same spectrum can be reused even to the adjacent building
    of small cells. Hence, by varying the spectrum reuse factor (RF) both vertically
    within the same building and horizontally between adjacent buildings, the required
    capacity can be obtained. Following [ 28], a minimum distance between cochannel
    small cells for the 28 GHz mmWave spectrum in the intrafloor level and interfloor
    level, respectively, for MNO can be given by, where and denote, respectively,
    intrafloor and interfloor CCI constraints at a small cell UE. and denote, respectively,
    the maximum number of cochannel small cells in the intrafloor level and interfloor
    level. denotes the minimum distance between a cochannel small cell and a small
    cell UE, and denotes the floor penetration loss at the 28 GHz mmWave spectrum.
    Let and denote, respectively, the number of small cells corresponding to and in
    a building such that a 3D cluster consists of small cells. Hence, the same spectrum
    of MNO can be reused for each cluster of small cells in a building. Let denote
    the maximum number of small cells of MNO in a building such that the number of
    times the same spectrum of MNO can be reused in building (i.e., the spectrum RF
    for MNO in building ) is given by Hence, for number of buildings of small cells
    in a macrocell of MNO , the spectrum RF for a macrocell of MNO is given by, Because
    of low multipath fading effect and hence less channel variation of high-frequency
    signals indoors, we assume a similar channel condition for all buildings of small
    cells. Then, for the same number of SBSs per building (i.e., ) such that for each
    MNO , the spectrum RF for a macrocell of MNO is given by, 3.4. System-Level Performance
    Metrics Using linear approximation and considering and for MNO , the countrywide
    system-level average capacity and SE of all MNOs can be given, respectively, for
    as follows. Since each SBS can serve one UE at any time, the average throughput
    per small cell UE of MNO in building can be expressed as follows. Recall that,
    in PD, the transmission power of an SBS of MNO varies with the existence of UEs
    of other MNOs . We consider a separate transceiver for the spectrum of each MNO
    of each SBS to switch on and off easily to save the transmission power. Hence,
    there are transceivers per SBS of MNO where one transceiver is operating at the
    28 GHz spectrum of MNO itself and the remaining () transceivers are operating
    at the shared spectrum of other MNOs such that the average EE in Joules/bit in
    PD for the hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access can be given by, where ,
    , and denote, respectively, the transmission power of a small cell of MNO in a
    building when operating at the maximum transmission power, the transmission power
    with employing the interweave spectrum access, and the transmission power with
    employing the underlay spectrum access such that and . Similarly, following (21),
    the average EE in PD when employing either the interweave spectrum access or the
    underlay spectrum access can be expressed. Now, for the cost efficiency (CE),
    which can be defined as the amount of cost required to achieve per unit achievable
    average capacity (i.e., per bps), let denote the cost of the 28 GHz licensed spectrum
    for an MNO such that the total cost of the countrywide full-spectrum is given
    by . Then, the CE for all MNOs can be expressed as follows. 3.5. SLSA Technique
    and Improvement Factor In a static licensed spectrum allocation (SLSA) technique,
    an equal amount of spectrum of RBs is allocated exclusively to each MNO. Then,
    the countrywide system-level average capacity, SE, EE, and CE for all MNOs when
    employing the SLSA technique are given, respectively, by, Likewise, the average
    throughput per small cell UE due to applying SLSA for MNO in building is given
    by, Hence, the average capacity, SE, EE, CE, and throughput per small cell UE
    performance improvement factors due to applying the hybrid interweave-underlay
    spectrum access in comparison with that of the SLSA are given, respectively, by
    4. Performance Result and Analysis 4.1. Default Parameter and Assumption Table
    3 shows selected simulation parameters and assumptions used for evaluating the
    performance of the proposed PDSA for all MNOs countrywide. Detailed channel models
    and antenna characteristics of all types of base stations and UEs can be found
    in [ 29– 33]. Previously in [ 20], though the performance evaluation is carried
    out for four MNOs in a country (i.e., ) as an example scenario, we relax this
    constraint in this paper by considering an arbitrary number of MNOs in a country.
    Correspondingly, generic expressions for the performance metrics are derived and
    analyzed using the properties of Pascal’s triangle and the equal likelihood criterion.
    The randomness in mobile traffic and user characteristics is captured using the
    equal likelihood criterion to model the presence of UEs of MNOs within each apartment
    (Table 1). Besides, to operate in the underlay spectrum access, we limit the transmission
    power of a small cell to 20% of its maximum value. Table 3  Default parameters
    and assumptions. 4.2. Performance Result (1) Performance Metric Improvement Factor.
    Improvement in average capacity, SE, EE, and CE, as well as throughput per small
    cell UE, performances for four MNOs countrywide is shown in Figure 2 due to applying
    the hybrid interweave-underlay, as well as when applying either the interweave
    or the underlay spectrum access techniques. It can be found that the hybrid technique
    improves all these performance metrics considerably as compared to that of the
    interweave and underlay techniques when applied separately. This is because, using
    Table 1, the maximum shared spectrum achieved due to applying the hybrid interweave-underlay
    technique is 3 times (interweave and underlay techniques each contributing 1.5
    times) the licensed 28 GHz spectrum of any MNO of RBs (e.g., MNO 1 in Table 1)
    for time . This causes the hybrid technique to increase the licensed spectrum
    of RBs to 4 RBs for each MNO in time .   (a)           (a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  (e)           Figure
    2  (a) Average capacity, (b) SE, (c) EE, (d) CE, and (e) throughput per small
    cell UE improvement factors for four MNOs countrywide due to applying different
    PD DSA techniques to a single building of SBSs for equals to 1. Since the capacity
    and hence the SE, as well as the throughput per small cell UE, are directly proportional
    to the available spectrum, the hybrid interweave-underlay technique improves the
    average capacity and SE, as well as throughput per small cell UE, by about 2.9
    times with respect to that of SLSA as shown in Figure 2. These correspond to the
    average capacity, SE, and throughput per small cell UE improvement by about 1.49
    times and 1.4 times, respectively, when applying the interweave and underlay techniques
    separately. In contrast, since the EE and CE are inversely proportional to the
    capacity [ 35], i.e., the available spectrum, the hybrid interweave-underlay technique
    improves the EE by about 73% and the CE by about 74.4% with respect to that of
    SLSA (Figure 2). These correspond to the EE improvement by about 57.46% and 57.65%,
    respectively, and the CE improvement by about 60% and 58.4%, respectively, when
    applying the interweave and the underlay techniques separately (Figure 2). Note
    that a slight variation in the EE and CE responses occurs due to the fact that
    in addition to the capacity, unlike the CE, the EE depends as well on the transmission
    power of BSs. (2) Impact of the Spectrum Reuse Factor. Figures 3(a)–3(d) show,
    respectively, the average capacity, SE, EE, and CE responses for all four MNOs
    countrywide by varying the spectrum reuse factor for the mmWave spectrum in each
    building of small cells due to applying the hybrid interweave-underlay technique,
    as well as interweave, underlay, and SLSA techniques. Overall, the hybrid interweave-underlay
    technique provides the best, whereas the SLSA provides the worst, performances
    of all techniques in terms of the average capacity, SE, EE, and CE   (a)         (a)  (b)  (c)  (d)         Figure
    3  (a) Average capacity, (b) SE, (c) EE, and (d) CE performances of four MNOs

    of SBSs for equals to 1 and 6. More specifically, with an increase in , a linear
    increase in the average capacity and SE, whereas a negative-exponential improvement
    in the EE and CE, are observed for all techniques for any . This implies that,
    unlike the average capacity and SE, the improvement in both EE and CE gets to
    a steady-state value as tends to a very large value. Moreover, if increases (e.g.,
    from 1 to 6 as shown in Figure 3), all these performance metrics also improve
    following the same trend as that when increases. Hence, the overall improvement
    in any performance metrics is defined by the product of and such that by varying
    either or L, or both and L, the required value of the average capacity, SE, EE,
    and CE can be defined. We discuss further the impact of and L with specific examples
    in the following section. 4.3. Performance Comparison According to [ 36, 37],
    the future 6G mobile network is expected to provide 10 times average spectral
    and energy efficiencies of 5G mobile systems [ 38, 39]. In other words, 6G requires
    an average SE of 270-370 bps/Hz, as well as average EE of 0.3 μJ/bit. Using Figure
    3, for , it can be found that the values of that can achieve the required spectral
    and energy efficiencies for 6G as aforementioned are 2, 3, 3, and 6, respectively,
    for the hybrid interweave-underlay, interweave, underlay, and SLSA techniques.
    Hence, based on the above discussion, the hybrid interweave-underlay technique,
    the interweave technique, and the underlay technique, respectively, can fulfil
    these requirements for 6G by reusing the countrywide full 28 GHz spectrum of all
    MNOs to in-building small cells of roughly 33.33%, 50%, and 50% less number of
    buildings of small cells than that required by the SLSA technique. In general,
    the required value of that can satisfy both SE and EE requirements for 6G varies
    with the value of since both SE and EE performances are a function of the product
    of them, i.e., . Specifically, SE and EE requirements for 6G can be obtained either
    by increasing with a corresponding decrease in or by decreasing with a corresponding
    increase in . For example, for , the required values of to satisfy SE and EE requirements
    for 6G are 1, 2, 2, and 3, respectively, for the hybrid interweave-underlay, interweave,
    underlay, and SLSA techniques. In short, by trading off, the values of and , the
    required SE and EE for 6G can be achieved. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have
    proposed power-domain based dynamic spectrum access (PDSA) techniques to share
    the 28 GHz spectrum of one MNO with small cells in a building of another MNO in
    a country. The proposed PDSA techniques have explored the traditional interweave
    and underlay spectrum access techniques separately, as well as jointly, by controlling
    the transmission power of SBSs of each MNO in a country. Unlike [ 20], average
    capacity, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, cost efficiency, and throughput
    per small cell UE performance metrics have been derived when the interweave and
    the underlay spectrum access techniques operate separately, as well as jointly,
    for an arbitrary number of MNOs countrywide. With numerical and simulation results,
    we have evaluated the performances of the interweave and underlay, as well as
    hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access techniques, for an example scenario
    of four MNOs in a country. It is shown that, due to gaining more shared spectra,
    the hybrid interweave-underlay technique improves all the above performance metrics
    considerably as compared to that of the interweave and underlay techniques when
    employing separately. Particularly, the maximum amount of the shared spectrum
    obtained by employing the hybrid interweave-underlay technique is 3 times (as
    opposed to 1.5 times the licensed spectrum for both interweave and underlay techniques)
    the licensed spectrum of any MNO for any observation time. This causes the hybrid
    interweave-underlay technique to improve the average capacity and SE, as well
    as throughput per small cell UE, by about 2.9 times in comparison with that of
    SLSA. These correspond to the improvement in these metrics by about 1.49 times
    and 1.4 times, respectively, when applying the interweave and underlay techniques
    separately. Further, the hybrid interweave-underlay technique improves the EE
    by about 73% and the CE by about 74.4% with respect to that of SLSA, which corresponds
    to the EE improvement by about 57.46% and 57.65%, respectively, and the CE improvement
    by about 60% and 58.4%, respectively, when applying the interweave and the underlay
    techniques separately. Moreover, average capacity and hence SE increase linearly,
    whereas EE and CE improve negative-exponentially for all techniques as increases,
    and the hybrid interweave-underlay technique provides the best, whereas the SLSA
    provides the worst, performances of all techniques in terms of average capacity,
    SE, EE, and CE. Furthermore, we have shown that the hybrid interweave-underlay
    technique, the interweave technique, and the underlay technique, respectively,
    can fulfill both spectral and energy efficiencies requirements for 6G networks
    by reusing the countrywide full 28 GHz spectrum of all MNOs to in-building small
    cells of roughly 33.33%, 50%, and 50% less number of buildings of small cells
    than that required by the SLSA for an intrabuilding spectrum reuse factor of six.
    Overall, the required value of to obtain the expected spectral and energy efficiencies
    of 6G varies with the value of the intrabuilding reuse factor since both SE and
    EE performances are a function of the product of them, i.e., . Specifically, SE
    and EE requirements for 6G can be satisfied either by increasing with a corresponding
    decrease in or by decreasing with a corresponding increase in such that by trading
    off the values of and , the required spectral and energy efficiencies of 6G can
    be achieved. The proposed technique can be investigated further for a complete
    analysis to address numerous crucial issues, including mmWave bands other than
    28 GHz, such as 26 GHz, 38 GHz, and 60 GHz; non-LOS path loss models; directional
    mmWave antennas; spectrum sensing mechanisms and control signaling overhead; implementation
    complexity analysis; burst traffic characteristics; and random deployments of
    indoor UEs; as well as serving more than one UE simultaneously by a single small
    cell in a building. Data Availability Data, primarily, in the form of numerous
    simulation assumptions and parameters reported previously by the standardization
    bodies, including 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [ 29, 30] and International-Telecommunication
    Union-Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) [ 31], included and detailed within the
    article in Table 3, were used to carry out the performance evaluation of this
    study. Other prior studies than these above [ 29– 31] were cited at relevant places

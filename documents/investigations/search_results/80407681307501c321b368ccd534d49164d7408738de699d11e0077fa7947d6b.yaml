    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio is regarded as a promising technology
    to provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless network architectures
    and dynamic spectrum access techniques. However, cognitive radio networks may
    also impose some challenges due to various factors such as the ever increasing
    complexity of network architecture, the high cost of configuring and managing
    large-scale networks, the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, diverse
    QoS requirements of various applications, and the intensifying difficulties of
    centralized control. A plethora of work has been carried out to address the challenges
    aforementioned by employing cognitive radio functionalities with self-organization
    features. In this article, variant aspects of self-organization paradigms in cognitive
    radio networks, including critical functionalities of MAC- and network-layer operations,
    are surveyed. The main contributions of this survey include introducing the fundamentals
    of existing cognitive radio and self-organization techniques as well as their
    current progress, surveying critical cognitive radio issues (including common
    control channel management, cooperative spectrum sensing, bioinspired spectrum
    sharing, network scalability and adaptive routing) as well as their self-organization
    features, and identifying new directions and open problems in cognitive radio
    networks. Published in: IEEE Wireless Communications ( Volume: 20, Issue: 2, April

    10.1109/MWC.2013.6507392 Publisher: IEEE INtroduction Since modern communications
    networks must deliver ever increasing data rates at an ever decreasing cost per
    bit, their spectral efficiency must be further improved. However, the current
    static spectrum allocation policy faces spectrum scarcity, especially spectrum
    bands, and cannot satisfy the increases in spectrum demand. More-over, a significant
    amount of spectrum is underutilized due to a large portion of the assigned spectrum
    being used sporadically. Hence, a new communication paradigm, dynamic spectrum
    access (DSA), whose key enabling technology is referred to as cognitive radio
    (CR), was recently proposed to solve these spectrum inefficiency problems. Since
    CR technology enables unlicensed users to share spectrum with primary/ licensed
    users in an opportunistic manner, both the spectrum utilization and coverage area
    of CR networks (CRNs) can be significantly improved. However, DSA technology suffers
    from low scalability and convergence. Moreover, CRNs may also impose new challenges
    due to the ever increasing complexity of network architecture, the fluctuating
    nature of the available spectrum, and some other important issues that affect
    the quality of service (QoS) of user applications. Furthermore, some other challenges,
    such as the increasing complexity with configuration and management of large-scale
    networks, the upgrading capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures
    (OPEX), and the intensifying difficulties of centralized control, will further
    arise in the future heterogeneous networks. Decentralized approaches, which enable
    CR users to perform spectrum sensing/access based on partial knowledge of network
    status, can be adopted to address the aforementioned challenges, and will consequently
    lead to a new concept: self-orga-nization. Various appealing characteristics,
    such as adaptivity to the varying environmental circum-stances, the ability to
    self-organize in a fully distributed fashion, and the ability to operate without
    centralized control or human intervention, have been emphasized in artificial
    self-organized networking (SON) systems such as wireless ad hoc and wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs). In CRNs, mechanisms of self-organization have also been emphasized
    to address the emerging spectrum scarcity problem. Since the coordination among
    the distributed CR users should experience minimum delay to facilitate seamless
    communications during spectrum handoff, decentralized protocols exploiting CR
    users'' local observations in spectrum sharing would provide a promising method
    to reduce the information exchanges among CR users for coordination. Therefore,
    DSA can obtain significant benefits from the self-organization features such as
    distributed control or localized interactions. In order to avoid the high computational
    and communication overhead required by the optimization of spectrum access in
    mobile networks, a distributed spectrum allocation based on local bargaining can
    be proposed to enable mobile users to negotiate spectrum assignment in a self-organizing
    manner. Furthermore, bio-inspired algorithms, which were inspired by the collective
    behavior of natural species, may also be investigated to improve the spectrum
    sharing efficiency in CRNs. In this article, we survey various aspects of CR technologies,
    with features of self-organization being emphasized. The main functionalities
    of CR, including spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum sharing, and
    spectrum mobility, are first investigated. Medium access control (MAC) strategies
    of CRNs, including the maintenance of a common control channel (CCC), and cooperative
    spectrum sensing and sharing, are then surveyed. After that, the critical network-layer
    issues in CRNs, such as network scalability and adaptive routing, are discussed,
    with the remaining challenges faced in those techniques analyzed. The remainder
    of this article is organized as follows. The fundamentals of CR techniques are
    introduced, followed by an introduction to the fundamentals of self-organization.
    Important issues of MAC strategies in CRNs, including the maintenance of a control
    channel and cooperative spectrum management, are surveyed. Critical network-layer
    issues, including network scalability and adaptive routing, are investigated.
    After that, the remaining challenges faced in developing future CR-enabled SON
    systems are analyzed, followed by the conclusions drawn. Fundamentals of Cognitive
    Radio Cognitive radio, as first introduced by Joseph Mitola III [1], is the key
    technology that enables an unlicensed (secondary) user to use spectrum in a dynamic
    and opportunistic manner. CR technologies provide opportunistic spectrum sharing
    capability by enabling users to perform spectrum sensing, spectrum management,
    spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility functionalities, as illustrated in Fig.
    1. Figure 1. Functionalities of cognitive radio, including spectrum sensing, spectrum
    mobility, spectrum management, and spectrum sharing. Show All CRN Architecture
    CRNs, equipped with the intrinsic capabilities of CR, will provide an ultimate
    spectrum-aware communication paradigm by exploiting the existing wireless spectrum
    opportunistically. The components of CRN architecture can be classified as the
    primary network and the CR network [2]. The primary network generally refers to
    the existing network infrastructure (e.g., common cellular and TV broadcast networks),
    and has exclusive rights to a certain spectrum. The latter, on the other hand,
    does not have license to operate in a desired band, and its spectrum access is
    allowed only in an opportunistic man-ner. Both infrastructure and ad hoc networks
    can be deployed in CRNs, with components of CR users, CR base stations, and spectrum
    brokers (or scheduling servers) included. Current Progress In Research On Cognitive
    Radio Since CRNs provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless
    network architectures and DSA techniques, they can be applied to various applications
    such as cognitive mesh networks, emergency networks, and military networks. Several
    projects around the world, such as NeXt Generation (xG) program [3] and the European
    DRiVE/OverDRiVE project [4], have been carried out to implement DSA in heterogeneous
    networks. Since CRNs provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous
    wireless network architectures and DSA techniques, they can be applied to various
    applications such as cognitive mesh networks, emergency networks, and military
    networks Besides, CR features have started to be included in recently developed
    wireless stan-dards, with the capabilities of wideband spectrum sensing and opportunistic
    spectrum exploitation emphasized. For instance, IEEE 802.22, which is the first
    worldwide standard based on the CR technologies, specifies spectral efficiencies
    of wireless regional area networks (WRANs) in the range of 0.5~5 b/s/Hz. Compared
    to the existing IEEE 802 standards, the base station coverage of an IEEE 802.22
    WRAN can go up to 100 km, provided that the power is not a restraining issue [2].
    Fundamentals of Self-Organization Self-organization, as occurs in many branches
    of science such as biology, physics, and telecommunications (as exemplified in
    Fig. 2), is regarded as a promising solution for large-scale networks to address
    the challenges brought by the ever increasing complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamics
    in complex communications systems. Various artificial SON systems (e.g., wireless
    ad hoc and WSNs) have been developed, with some major properties, such as the
    ability to self-organize without centralized control or human intervention and
    adaptive routing mechanisms to respond to the network topology changes, exhibited
    in them. Besides, as a critical and main feature of the Third Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced sys-tems, the self-X capabilities
    (e.g., self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, and plug-and-play)
    have already been emphasized in the evolved Node B (eNodeB) functionalities. Figure
    2. Self-organization, as occurs in many branches of science such as biology, economics,
    and telecommunications, is essentially an interdisciplinary research field. Show
    All Considering that several natural species have already evolved for one million
    years or even longer, some insights learned from those species may be beneficial
    in designing intelligent artificial systems (i.e., bio-inspired algorithms have
    been developed [5]). For instance, some ant colony optimization (ACO)-based protocols
    such as AntNet [6] and AntHocNet [7] have been developed for use in packet-switched
    networks and are proven to outperform the Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV)
    routing algorithm in terms of either packet delivery ratio or average end-to-end
    packet delay. Furthermore, some other pioneering works on finding out the essential
    and universal paradigms for designing intelligent artificial SON systems have
    already been carried out from an interdisciplinary point of view [8]. As the self-organization
    theory and technology continues to mature, self-organized approaches (e.g., bio-inspired
    methods) will play an increasingly important role in either performance enhancement
    or cost reduction in terms of CAPEX/OPEX and system control in CRNs. Mac Strategies
    for CRNS CR MAC protocols are conventionally classified by considering either
    the spectrum access scheme (i.e., to divide the spectrum access as random access,
    time slotted access, or hybrid access) or spectrum sharing architecture (i.e.,
    either centralized or decentralized). Besides, self-organization features are
    extensively observed in the decentralized spectrum sharing protocols and have
    been proven to be capable of achieving cost-effective spectrum access and management.
    Control Channel Management In CRNs Effective spectrum sharing and utilization
    can be obtained in CRNs through spectrum sensing/ management, with some new features
    (e.g., adaptive frequency hopping) introduced to reduce the interference between
    users or wireless technologies sharing the same spectrum bands. Designing multichannel
    MAC protocols is assumed to be the first step in the development of CR MAC protocols
    in unlicensed ad hoc scenarios. Different from conventional multichannel networks
    that consider a fixed number of channels at each user, the number of channels
    at each CR user varies with time and space in CRNs. Moreover, the timescale in
    which a CRN operates should be different from that of conventional multichannel
    networks since secondary users must be aware of the wireless environment evolution
    and rapidly adapt their behavior to comply with interference constraints. Therefore,
    different methodologies should be implemented to form a control channel for sharing
    the spectrum sensing results among CR users as well as sharing channel allocation
    information. Since the amount of signaling information exchanged in CRNs is substantially
    larger than in conventional networks, most CR MAC protocols exploit an out-of-band
    control channel. Although several existing works assume that a global control
    channel is available, the possibility of finding an opportunistic and universally
    available channel for all users in CRNs is very small. Thus, a local common channel
    can be applied to overcome this drawback, with two approaches, the CCC scheme
    and the split phase (SP) scheme, proposed to manage the out-of-band control channel.
    In the CCC scheme, CR users share a dedicated channel to exchange signaling and
    sensing information, and then perform channel selection. Although CCC may facilitate
    many spectrum sharing functionalities, a channel must be vacated when a primary
    user choose this spectrum band, and a fixed CCC is therefore unavailable. Moreover,
    a channel common to all users in CRNs is highly dependent on the network topology
    and varies over time. In practice, a distributed and localized CCC management
    method can be implemented to enable reliable sharing of sensing information among
    CR users. The SP scheme, on the other hand, requires time synchronization, but
    permits exploiting only one transceiver at CR users. By dividing each time frame
    into two parts (i.e., the control phase and data phase), CR users can overhear
    the control message conveyed by the subframe in the control phase so as to be
    aware of the network status [9]. Spectrum utilization is inevitably reduced due
    to wasted free data channels during control phase transmission. Cooperation In
    Cr-enabled Systems Cooperation is commonly observed in social species, where a
    worker usually does not perform all tasks but rather specializes in a set of tasks.
    In artificial systems (e.g., in WSNs or wireless ad hoc networks), massively distributed
    nodes may collaboratively transmit a big block of information. Another well-known
    cooperative technique for wireless cellular systems is coordinated multipoint
    (CoMP) transmission/reception, which has been chosen as one of the candidate techniques
    for 3GPP LTE-Advanced to increase the average cell throughput and cell edge users''
    spectral efficiency in both uplink and downlink transmissions. Cooperative Communications
    in CRNs In CRNs, although unlicensed users can opportunistically fill in spectrum
    holes to improve spectrum utilization with fast and agile sensing ability, these
    CR users must immediately vacate the licensed spectrum bands they are using once
    the primary users return to access those bands. As a result, the interruptive
    transmissions in unlicensed users will lead to discontinuous data service and
    intolerable delay. Challenges aforementioned can be addressed by using cognitive
    relaying, which enables distributed CR users to collaborate with each other and
    share their distinct spectrum bands. By separating all the secondary users into
    a few clusters, and selecting the most favorable user to act as the cluster head
    and report to the common receiver, spatial diversity gain in the proposed cooperative
    sensing can thus be enhanced Another challenge to CRNs'' connectivity is brought
    by the interference from multiple heterogeneous primary networks, and the constraints
    in the secondary users'' transmission power (i.e., to limit the interference to
    the primary networks) further deteriorate the connectivity. In consideration of
    the possibility of connecting multiple heterogeneous secondary networks with different
    radio access technologies via proper cooperation, those heterogeneous secondary
    networks as a whole can be treated as one secondary network. Thus, users from
    each secondary network can act as relays of the other secondary networks to enable
    this kind of inter-network cooperation. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing In CRNs,
    secondary users can be coordinated to perform cooperative spectrum sensing by
    detecting the primary users more accurately. In consideration of the sensing performance
    degradation due to the fading and/or shadowing that happens in the reporting channel,
    which forwards the sensing observations to a common receiver, a cluster-based
    cooperative spectrum sensing method may be applied to improve the sensing performance.
    By separating all the secondary users into a few clusters, and selecting the most
    favorable user to act as the cluster head and report to the common receiver, spatial
    diversity gain in the proposed cooperative sensing can thus be enhanced. Since
    the co-cluster users are usually close to each other, a perfect inter-user channel
    is thus assumed in most of the existing work. However, in consideration of the
    impact of spatial correlation between CR users on the performance of cooperative
    spectrum sensing, spatially close CR users are likely to be under the same environment
    conditions and suffer from common biases in spectrum sensing. In this case, CR
    users that are farther apart can benefit from their geographical difference and
    obtain more reliable spectrum sensing, although an imperfect channel may be obtained
    due to the inter-user spatial separation. The main self-organi-zation features,
    including fully distributed user selection without the need for a central entity,
    adaptive tracking of dynamic changes of the correlation experienced by the CR
    users due to the network changes, and location unawareness, have been exhibited
    in user selection and proven to be able to bring about significant benefits in
    improving the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing. Bio-Inspired Spectrum
    Sharing Bio-inspired algorithms, as inspired by the collective behaviors, have
    exhibited their capabilities in enabling artificial SON systems to be self-optimizing,
    fault-tolerant, highly scalable, and so on, and may be investigated to provide
    a new way of obtaining decentralized spectrum sharing. In [10], a biologically-inspired
    spectrum sharing (BlOSS) algorithm based on the adaptive task allocation model
    in insect colonies is pro-posed. Efficient spectrum sharing over multiple spectrum
    bands is enabled in BIOSS, which performs decentralized spectrum sharing and requires
    no inter-user coordination. In order to mitigate the drawback of BIOSS with a
    high probability of conflicts between CR users, an enhanced BIOSS algorithm (i.e.,
    e-BIOSS [11]) is proposed to enable CR users to select the appropriate channels
    to transmit and at the same time avoid interference to the incumbent users. The
    channel selection probability function in e-BIOSS is modified to enable a CR user
    to gravitate toward the channel with minimum excess power. Besides, a binary learning
    factor, which leads to a direct decision being made on whether to adopt or abandon
    a certain channel, is also applied in e-BIOSS to enable a rapid reaction to the
    dynamic wireless environment in CR users. Game Theory in CRNs Besides the aforementioned
    issues, game theory may also play an important role in modeling network interactions
    and optimizing MAC-layer protocols in CRNs. In game theoretic algo-rithms, interactions
    between CR users can be represented as a game, with the dynamics of CRNs being
    resolved efficiently by using game theory to model the adaptation and recursive
    interactive decision process (i.e., via a repeated game). Interactive behaviors
    among CR users can be represented as a game Γ=<N,{ S i },{ U i }> , where N is
    the set of game players, S i represents the strategy space of player i , and U
    i stands for the local utility function that models the scope of player i . Note
    that each player may adopt a unique utility function to pursue its specific goals.
    Game theoretic approaches that use optimization techniques to find the optimal
    strategies for spectrum sharing have been proposed in CRNs. For instance, a game
    theoretic DSA protocol called GMAC [12], which exploits a function to maximize
    overall network throughput by limiting transmission power, has been proposed,
    with Nash equilibrium being achieved through a distributed recursive game. In
    order to minimize the users'' cooperation overhead and reduce the delay of the
    optimization process at the same time, a clustering algorithm for the game theoretic
    DSA-driven framework is proposed in [13] to achieve inter-player coordination
    and overcome the scalability issues in DSA MAC protocols. Besides, game theory
    can also be exploited for performance evaluation of DSA schemes. In order to carry
    out a performance comparison between cooperative and non-cooperative approaches,
    game theory can be exploited to analyze the behavior of CR users for distributed
    adaptive channel allocation. For more game theoretic algo-rithms, interested readers
    may refer to [14]. Network-Layer Strategies in CR-Enabled Son Systems In this
    section, we focus on network-layer issues of CRNs, with important topics such
    as network scalability and adaptive routing studied. Network Scalability Scalability
    is a critical performance indicator in large-scale networks, and can be measured
    along the following three dimensions: The size of a system with respect to the
    number of involved subsystems The geographical size or geographical distance between
    subsystems The manageability of the whole system However, discouraging results
    showed that the transport capacity in an N -node WSN scales as 1/N from an information
    theoretical point of view, or 1/logN even by employing powerful tools of parallel
    and distributed optimization. In an ad hoc wireless network, the throughput in
    terms of bits per second for each node decreases at a rate between 1/ NlogT −
    − − − − − √ and 1/ N − − √ , as the number of nodes N grows asymptotically large.
    Self-organization, which has been regarded as a promising solution for the management
    and control mechanism of massively distributed net-works, requires a new control
    theory to realize such a manageable and nonlinear complex system through some
    simple and local interactions between neighboring individuals. Some common structural
    properties, referred to as small world and scale-free properties, have been observed
    in various SON systems to ensure network scalabili-ty. Since SON systems exhibit
    emergent properties and heavily rely on localized decision processes, a mechanism
    for positive and negative feedback will have the most fundamental role in controlling
    the systems'' scalability. Besides, some other advanced techniques, such as mobile
    relays, multihop routing, and load balancing, can also be employed to improve
    the scalability of CRNs. Adaptive Routing Adaptive routing, as a critical functionality
    of wireless self-organized networks, has already been studied considerably in
    recent decades. In consideration of the unique characteristics of the radio environment
    in CRNs, new challenges may arise in designing cognitive routing algorithms. First,
    the fixed CCC used in traditional routing protocols is infeasible in CRNs, with
    some specific routing functionalities, such as neighbor discovery, route discovery,
    and route establishment, difficult to facilitate. Second intermittent connectivity
    between neighboring nodes may happen frequently not only because of the node mobility
    and dynamic characteristics of wireless signals, but also due to the dynamic changes
    of available spectrum in CRNs. Besides, the QoS of unlicensed users (e.g., end-to-end
    latency, packet loss probability) may also be degraded due to issues of spectrum
    handoff and interference. Therefore, various important factors, such as the time-variant
    channel attenuation, dynamic changes of spectrum, and the frequency/space-domain
    characteristics of the radio environment should be considered jointly in constituting
    multihop CR routes. Last but not least, spectrum-aware rerouting algorithms should
    also be developed to adapt to spectrum fluctuations and enable optimization/maintenance
    of CR routes. In order to tackle the problem of opportunis-tic data transfer in
    mobile ad hoc networks, the broadcasting nature of wireless links can also be
    exploited to achieve cooperative communications at the link and network layers
    of static multihop wireless networks. Opportunistic spec-trum-aware routing can
    be created by taking advantage of the numerous yet unreliable wireless links in
    a wireless network in a probabilistic manner. Besides, interference minimization
    is usually taken into consideration in designing the spectrum-aware routing to
    optimize the performance from the perspective of delay, through-put, or load balancing.
    By building a runtime forwarding mesh that is updated periodically and offering
    a set of candidate routes to the destination, SAMER can balance the long-term
    route stability and short-term opportunistic performance successfully. In CRNs
    with a mesh framework, a spec-trum-aware mesh routing (SAMER) algorithm passes
    traffic across paths that opportunistically adapt to the dynamic spectrum conditions,
    with the highest-spectrum-availability link being exploited at the same time [15].
    By building a runtime forwarding mesh that is updated periodically and offering
    a set of candidate routes to the destination, the SAMER can balance the long-term
    route stability and short-term opportunistic performance successfully. REmaining
    CHallenges In spite of CRNs will provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous
    wireless architectures and dynamic spectrum access techniques, some challenges
    may still be imposed by CRNs due to the dynamic spectrum environment and the diverse
    QoS requirements of various applications. Heterogeneity induced challenges The
    heterogeneity of the CRNs, especially that exhibited in a multiuser environment
    with coexistence of CR users and primary users, introduces new challenges to the
    spectrum management and sharing. Besides, the heterogeneous spectrum comprising
    both licensed and unlicensed bands for different purposes imposes additional challenges
    in CR techniques. Multichannel spectrum sensing Since CR users may neither occupy
    a spectrum band for a long time period nor satisfy their requirements by utilizing
    a single spectrum band, multiple noncontiguous spectrum bands can thus be simultaneously
    sensed and utilized by CR users for purposes of improvement in throughput and
    communications reliability. However, designing a cost-efficient multispectrum
    sensing approach in heterogeneous CRNs is still a challenging task. Cooperative
    spectrum sensing The effective combination of cooperation and self-organization
    in spectrum sensing is worthy of further investigation, and a totally distributed
    CRN (i.e., cooperation is performed without relying on the coordination of CR
    base stations or permanent cluster heads) would be a promising solution in terms
    of cost reduction in network operation and maintenance. CCC implementation challenges
    Since the implementation of a static or fixed CCC for spectrum sharing is infeasible
    in CRNs, a proper CCC implementation must be exploited for clusters of CR users
    to facilitate the important spectrum sharing functionalities [2]. Being aware
    of the ever Increasing com-plexity, heterogene-ity, and dynamics of communications
    net-works, proposing more fundamental self-organization mechanisms and optimization
    approaches that are universally applicable to heterogeneous CRNs will still be
    a challenging task in the future. Spectrum mobility challenges Limited packet
    loss and delay are required during the spectrum mobility process, and this requirement
    raises new challenges in terms of seamless data trans-mission, priority-based
    channel management, and QoS guarantee. Self-organization paradigms in CR function
    alities Since self-organization paradigms are totally based on local behavior
    of individuals, the decentralized control may raise new challenges: Self-organization
    may not necessarily lead to an optimum solution; In order to minimize human intervention,
    the control decisions as well as data measure-ment/probing/processing should be
    operated autonomously. Therefore, a tradeoff between the reliability and the signaling
    overhead of self-organization methods must be addressed; A new theory of distributed
    self-control and self-management is required to pave the way toward the reliable
    CRNs with a high scalability and spectrum sensing speed. COnclusions As an ever
    increasing research and development effort has been focused on the valuable resource
    in wireless communications systems (i.e., the spec-trum) over the last several
    decades, CR has become a promising concept for utilizing the available spectrum
    more efficiently through opportunistic spectrum usage. Self-organization, as occurs
    in many branches of science such as biolo-gy, physics, and telecommunications,
    is regarded as an effective way to address challenges such as the increasing complexity
    of configuration and management of large-scale networks, upgraded CAPEX/OPEX,
    and the intensifying difficulties of centralized control in future heterogeneous
    net-works. In this article, some critical issues of CRNs in both MAC-layer and
    network-layer operations are surveyed, followed by a discussion of remaining challenges.
    Features of self-organization are emphasized in those issues. Being aware of the
    ever increasing complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of communications networks,
    proposing more fundamental self-organization mechanisms and optimization approaches
    that are universally applicable to heterogeneous CRNs will still be a challenging
    task in the future. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to acknowledge the Editor

    \ the \nspectrum between a user called primary, and a user called \nsecondary.\
    \ Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) is a new spectrum \nsharing paradigm in cognitive\
    \ radio that allows secondary users to \naccess the abundant spectrum holes in\
    \ the licensed spectrum bands. \nDSA is an auspicious technology to alleviate\
    \ the spectrum scarcity \nproblem and increase spectrum utilization. While DSA\
    \ has attracted \nmany research efforts recently, in this paper, a survey of spectrum\
    \ \naccess techniques using cooperation and competition to solve the \nproblem\
    \ of spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks is \npresented.  \n \nKeywords:\

    \ Multi Agent Systems. \n \n1. Introduction \nIn the past five years, we have\
    \ attested an impressive growth \nin wireless communication due to the popularity\
    \ of smart \nphones and other mobile devices. Due to the emergence of \napplication\
    \ domains, such as sensor networks, smart grid \ncontrol, medical wearable and\
    \ embedded wireless devices, \nwe are seeing increasing demand for unlicensed\
    \ bandwidth. \nA study carried out by the Federal Communications \nCommission\
    \ (FCC) has shown that some frequency bands are \noverloaded at the rush hours.\
    \ However, the use of the \nfrequency spectrum is not uniform: according to the\
    \ hours of \nday and to the geographical position; a frequency band can \nbe overloaded\
    \ while another remains unused. The idea to \ndevelop tools to better use the\
    \ spectrum has naturally \nemerged. \nWith spectrum becoming an ever deficient\
    \ resource, it is \nfastidious that new systems utilize all available frequency\
    \ \nbands as efficiently as possible. Dynamic spectrum access \nallocates spectrum\
    \ more dynamically and it is an active area \nof research. DSA requires not only\
    \ advances in technology \nbut also new policy and economic models for spectrum\
    \ use. \nCognitive radios are widely viewed as the disruptive \ntechnology that\
    \ can radically ameliorate both spectrum \nefficiency and utilization. Cognitive\
    \ radios are fully \nprogrammable wireless devices that can sense their \nenvironment\
    \ and dynamically adjust their transmission \nwaveform, channel access method,\
    \ spectrum use, and \nnetworking protocols as needed for good network and \napplication\
    \ performance. \nThe research community has made important progress in \naddressing\
    \ the many research challenges combined with \ncognitive radio and DSA. However,\
    \ there is a big gap \nbetween individual research results and the large-scale\
    \ \ndeployment of cognitive radio networks that dynamically \noptimize spectrum\
    \ use. Recent developments such LTE-A \n(Long Term Evolution-Advanced) which relies\
    \ on flexible \nspectrum use, offer colossal opportunities to demonstrate the\
    \ \npromising value of cognitive radio and DSA. \nThe revolutionary technology\
    \ presented in this survey will be \nat the cutting edge of future wireless communications.\
    \ \nDynamic spectrum access and cognitive radio networks will \nbe supplied with\
    \ an all-inclusive introduction to this \nemerging technology, outlining the fundamentals\
    \ of cognitive \nradio networks and dynamic spectrum access. \nIn this survey,\
    \ first, we define cognitive radio and its main \nfunctions i.e. spectrum sensing,\
    \ spectrum decision, spectrum \nsharing and spectrum mobility. Then DSA methods\
    \ are \ndiscussed, we classify these techniques in four areas, those \nbased on\
    \ auction, on game theory, on Markov chains and on \nMulti Agent Systems (MAS).\
    \  \n2. Cognitive Radio \nThe idea of Cognitive Radio was officially presented\
    \ by \nJoseph Mitola in a seminar at the Royal Institute of \nTechnology in Stockholm\
    \ in 1998, later published in an \narticle by Mitola and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr.\
    \ in 1999 [32]. \nThe term Cognitive Radio is used to describe a system \nwith\
    \ the ability to sense and recognize its context of use, in \norder to enable\
    \ it to adjust its radio operating parameters \ndynamically and autonomously and\
    \ learn the results of \nits actions and its environmental setting operation.\
    \ \nCR is a form of wireless communication in which a \ntransmitter/receiver can\
    \ detect intelligently communication \nchannels which are in use and those who\
    \ are not, and can \nmove to unused channels. This optimizes the use of available\
    \ \nspectrum radio frequency while minimizing interference with \nother users.\
    \ \nThe principle of CR, included in the IEEE 802.22 and IEEE \n802.16h \n[14],\
    \ requires an alternative \nspectrum \nmanagement that is: a user called secondary\
    \ (SU) may at any \ntime access to frequency bands that are free, that is i.e.,\
    \ not \noccupied by primary user (PU) of the licensed band. The SU \nwill assign\
    \ the service once completed, or once a PU has \nshown an inclination connection.\
    \ \nCognitive radio system requires four major functions that \nenable it to opportunistically\
    \ use the spectrum [17]. These \nfunctions consist in the CR terminal’s main steps\
    \ for \nspectrum management. They are: spectrum sensing, spectrum \ndecision,\
    \ spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility. \nA Survey on Dynamic Spectrum Access\

    \          Vol. 5, No. 2, August 2013 \n \n2.1. Spectrum Sensing \nThis is the\
    \ basic functionality; it consists on sensing unused \nspectrum and sharing \n\
    it without \ninterference \nwith \nthe \nother users. One of the goals of the\
    \ spectrum sensing, \nespecially for the interference sensing, is to obtain the\
    \ \nspectrum status (free/busy), so that the spectrum can be \naccessed \nby a\
    \ SU under stress \nof \ninterference. The \nchallenge is that of measuring the\
    \ interference at the receiver \ncaused by the primary transmissions of SUs. \n\
    2.2. Spectrum Decision \nA decision model is required for spectrum access. The\
    \ \ncomplexity of this model depends on the parameters \nconsidered in the analysis\
    \ of the spectrum. \nThe decision model becomes more complex when a SU has \n\
    multiple objectives. For example, a SU may intend to \nmaximize performance while\
    \ minimizing disturbance caused \nto the primary user. Stochastic optimization\
    \ methods will be \nan interesting tool to model and solve the problem of \nspectrum\
    \ access in a CR. \nWhen multiple users (both primary and secondary) are in the\
    \ \nsystem, preference will influence the decision of the spectrum \naccess. These\
    \ users can be cooperative or uncooperative in \naccess to spectrum. \nIn a non-cooperative\
    \ environment, each user has its own \npurpose, while in a cooperative one, all\
    \ users can work \ntogether to achieve one goal. For example, many SUs may \n\
    compete with each other to access the radio spectrum (eg, \nO1, O2, O3, O4 in\
    \ Figure 1 below) so that their individual \nthroughput is maximized. During the\
    \ competition between \nSUs, all ensure that the interference caused to PUs is\
    \ \nmaintained below the temperature limit corresponding \ninterference.  \nIn\
    \ a cooperative environment, CRs cooperate with each other \nto make a decision\
    \ for accessing the spectrum and \nmaximizing the objective function taking into\
    \ account the \ncommon constraints. In such a scenario, a central controller \n\
    can coordinate the spectrum management. \n \nFigure 1. Cooperative and non-cooperative\
    \ spectrum Access \nIn a distributed multi-user environment, access to non-\n\
    cooperative spectrum, each user can achieve an optimal \ndecision independently\
    \ by observing the behaviour of other \nusers (historical/action). Therefore,\
    \ a distributed algorithm is \nrequired for the SU to make the decision to access\
    \ to \nspectrum independently. \n2.3. Spectrum Analysis or Sharing \nThe sensing\
    \ spectrum results are analyzed to estimate the \nspectrum quality. One issue\
    \ here is how to measure the \nspectrum quality which can be accessed by a SU.\
    \ This \nquality can be characterized by the Signal/Noise Ratio \n(SNR), the average\
    \ correlation and the availability of white \nspaces. Information on the available\
    \ spectrum quality for \na CR user can be imprecise and noisy. Learning algorithms\
    \ of \nArtificial Intelligence techniques can be used by CR users for \nspectrum\
    \ analysis. \n2.4. Spectrum Mobility or Handoff  \nSpectrum mobility is the process\
    \ that allows the CR user to \nchange its operating frequency. CR networks are\
    \ trying to use \nthe spectrum dynamically allowing radio terminals to operate\
    \ \nin the best available frequency band, to maintain transparent \ncommunication\
    \ requirement during the transition to a better \nfrequency. \nFigure 2 illustrates\
    \ the four main spectrum management \nfunctions of the cognitive radio cycle as\
    \ well as the possible \ntransitions between them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \nFigure 2. Spectrum management functionality’ s  \n3. Dynamic Spectrum\
    \ Access \nThe explosive growth in wireless services over the past \nseveral years\
    \ illustrates the huge and growing demand of the \nconsumers for communications,\
    \ thus the spectrum becomes \nmore congested. We know that static spectrum allocation\
    \ is a \nmajor problem in recent wireless network domains. \nGenerally, these\
    \ allocations lead to inefficient usage creating \nempty spectrum holes or white\
    \ spaces. To solve the problem \nof spectrum congestion, CR networks use Dynamic\
    \ Spectrum \nAccessing. \nCooperative communication is known as a way to overcome\
    \ \nthe limitation of wireless systems [22]. However, since users \ngenerally\
    \ have a limited knowledge about their environment, \nwe claim that cooperative\
    \ behavior can provide them the \nnecessary information to solve the global issues.\
    \  \nBasically, a SU does not own a license for its spectrum usage \nand it can\
    \ access the spectrum either opportunistically or by \ncoexisting with the neighboring\
    \ licensed users. This kind of \naccess is called “license sharing” and a rather\
    \ large number \nof solutions already exist in the literature [42,31,25]. \nWe\
    \ have found a lot of proposed schemes related to spectrum \naccess, those using\
    \ auctions, a large number of approaches \nused Game theory, and a little less\
    \ works used Markov \napproaches for dynamic spectrum access. But few researches\
    \ \nhave been done in this topic using Multi Agent Systems. \n3.1. Spectrum Access\
    \ using Auctions \nAuctions are based on the concept of selling and buying \n\
    goods or services. The main goal of using auctions in CR \nnetworks is to provide\
    \ a motivation for the SUs to maximize \ntheir spectrum usage. In order to fully\
    \ utilize the spectrum, \nSpectrum  \nSensing \nSpectrum \nAnalysis \nSpectrum\n\

    \ Vol. 5, No. 2, August 2013 \n \nthe dynamic spectrum allocation using auctions\
    \ has become a \npromising approach that allows SUs to lease unused bands by \n\
    the PUs. \nGenerally, an auction consists of several stakeholders; Table \n1 describes\
    \ the difference between traditional auctions and \nwhat corresponds to each speaker\
    \ when applying this method \nto the negotiation in CR networks.  \nTable 1. Difference\

    \ are classified as one of the following auction \ntypes [62], listed in Figure\
    \ 3: \nFirst-price sealed-bid auction (FPSB): winner pays his \nbid. In this case,\
    \ one should bid below one’s value an amount \nthat depends on how many other\
    \ bidders there are. The more \nbidders, the closer to one’s value that one should\
    \ bid. There \nis a tradeoff between profit and the frequency of winning. \nSecond-price\
    \ sealed-bid auction (Vickrey): winner pays \nhighest losing bid. In this type\
    \ of auction, the optimal \nstrategy is to bid one’s value. \nEnglish \nauction\
    \ \n(Open \nAscending-bid \nauctions): \nauctioneer begins with a low price. Bidders\
    \ raise their bids \nuntil nobody is willing to bid higher. The optimal strategy\
    \ in \nan English auction is to bid up to one’s value, staying in the \nauction\
    \ until the bids exceed one’s value. \nDutch \nauction \n(Open \nDescending-bid\
    \ \nauctions): \nauctioneer calls out prices beginning with a very high value\
    \ \nand gradually reduces it. The first bidder to accept an offered \nprice wins.\
    \ The Dutch auction gets its name because of its \nuse in the flower markets in\
    \ Holland.   \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Organigram showing types of auctions \
    \ \nWe can find hybrid form of auction called double auctions \nwhere participants\
    \ are buyers and sellers in the same time \nand trade on the same product. \n\
    In auction-based solutions, each channel is assigned to only \none network, i.e.\
    \ that there is no concept of PU and SU in the \nsame channel. In the literature,\
    \ two possibilities are offered \n[7]. \n• The regulator allocates channels to\
    \ the PUs; these users \nallocate independently the unused portions of their \n\
    channel to SUs. \n• The regulator allocates the right to be Primary or SU in \n\
    the channel. \nA framework for spectrum allocation in the CR is proposed \nin\
    \ [12] using auctions where the regulator can simultaneously \nallocate the rights\
    \ to be primary or SU in the channel. \nAnother way of using auctions is proposed\
    \ in [44], where the \nauthors proved that on certain scenarios the spectrum is\
    \ \nefficiently used when multiple SUs win access to a single \nchannel; this\
    \ is what distinguishes their method with the \ntraditional auctions where only\
    \ one user can win. \nIn these solutions, the users’ behaviors are untruthful,\
    \ so the \ncentralized manager can’t optimize the global utility function \nof\
    \ the network [30]. \nA scenario where secondary users can opportunistically \n\
    access unused spectrum vacated by idle primaries was \nconsidered in [49]. The\
    \ authors introduce two metrics to \nprotect primary performance, namely collision\
    \ probability \nand overlapping time. They present three spectrum access \nschemes\
    \ using different sensing, back-off, and transmission \nmechanisms and show that\
    \ they achieve indistinguishable \nsecondary performance under given primary constraints.\
    \ The \nauthors provide closed form analysis on secondary user \nperformance,\
    \ present a tight capacity upper bound, and \nreveal the impact of various design\
    \ options, such as sensing, \npacket length distribution, back-off time, packet\
    \ overhead, \nand grouping. \nThe authors in [43] have considered the problem\
    \ of spectrum \nsharing among primary users (PUs) and secondary users \n(SUs).\
    \ They formulate the problem based on bandwidth \nauction, in which each SU makes\
    \ a bid for the amount of \nspectrum and each PU may assign the spectrum among\
    \ the \nSUs by itself according to the information from the SUs \nwithout degrading\
    \ its own performance. The authors show \nthat the auction is a noncooperative\
    \ game and that Nash \nequilibrium (NE) can be its solution.  \nA primary radio\
    \ network (PRN) consisting of a primary \nsystem base station (PS-BS) and multiple\
    \ primary system \nmobile stations (PS-MSs) was considered in [50]. The \nauthors\
    \ construct a CR network (CRN) consisting of a PRN \nwith multiple CR-MSs and\
    \ propose a spectrum-management \npolicy framework based on the Vickrey auction\
    \ such that \nCR-MSs can compete for utilization of the PRN spectrum \nbands available\
    \ for opportunistic transmission of CR-MSs. \nPRN users are granted incentives\
    \ at a discounting factor to \naccess spectrum bands and are being compensated\
    \ for \npossible operating interference from CR-MSs, whereas the \ninterference\
    \ is constrained under a tolerance level without \nlosing satisfaction for the\
    \ PS-MSs. \nIn [51], the authors have presented a secondary spectrum \nmarket\
    \ where a primary license holder can sell access to its \nunused or under-used\
    \ spectrum resources in the form of \ncertain fine-grained spectrum-space-time\
    \ unit. Secondary \nwireless service providers can purchase such contracts to\
    \ \ndeploy new service, enhance their existing service, or deploy \nad hoc service\
    \ to meet flash crowds demand. Within the \ncontext of this market, the authors\
    \ investigate how to use \nauction mechanisms to allocate and price spectrum resources\
    \ \nso that the primary license holder’s revenue is maximized. \nAuctions \nMultiple\

    \                                   Vol. 5, No. 2, August 2013 \n \nThe authors\
    \ begin by classifying a number of alternative \nauction formats in terms of spectrum\
    \ demand and then study \na specific auction format where secondary wireless service\
    \ \nproviders have demands for fixed locations (cells). They \npropose an optimal\
    \ auction based on the concept of virtual \nvaluation. \nAssuming \nthe \nknowledge\
    \ \nof \nvaluation \ndistributions, the optimal auction uses the Vickrey-Clarke-\n\
    Groves (VCG) mechanism (generalization of a Vickrey \nauction for multiple items)\
    \ to maximize the expected revenue \nwhile enforcing truthfulness. To reduce the\
    \ computational \ncomplexity, they further design a truthful suboptimal auction\
    \ \nwith polynomial time complexity. It uses a monotone \nallocation and critical\
    \ value payment to enforce truthfulness. \nSimulation results show that this suboptimal\
    \ auction can \ngenerate stable expected revenue. \nThe authors in [15] consider\
    \ a cognitive radio network which \ncontains one PU and many SUs. They use a technique\
    \ based \non auctions for dynamic spectrum access. The authors have \nsuggested\
    \ using a single round auction especially if we seek \nto satisfy applications\
    \ that require an immediate response, \nbecause the use of multiple rounds auctions\
    \ can make us lose \na few seconds since the procedure is slightly longer and\
    \ \nslower. To maximize the gains of the PU, the use of multiple \nround auctions\
    \ is better. But, if we are interested in the \nnumber of satisfied SU, it is\
    \ better to use a single round \nauction because the procedure is faster. The\
    \ method \nproposed by the authors has also proven that to solve the \nproblem\
    \ of spectrum congestion, we should use one of \ndynamic spectrum access techniques\
    \ (single or multiple \nrounds) rather than using nothing and satisfy the first\
    \ \nreceived request. \nFigure 4 illustrates the impact of auctions on the obtained\
    \ \ngains by the PU. \n \n \nFigure 4. Impact of auctions on the obtained gains\
    \ by the PU \nAuction is often modeled as a competitive mode; in this case, \n\
    cognitive radio can function only at a non-cooperative way. \nOn contrary, MAS\
    \ or game theory seems to be a way to \novercome this limit; in fact, cooperative\
    \ way may be \nimplemented in this case. Thus, cognitive radio can function \n\
    at both cooperative and competitive modes. \n3.2. Spectrum Access using Game Theory\
    \ \nGame Theory can be defined as a mathematical framework \nwhich consists of\
    \ models and techniques that use to analyze \nthe iterative decisions behavior\
    \ of individuals concerned \nabout their own benefit. These games are generally\
    \ divided \ninto two types [10], cooperative games and competitive \ngames.  \n\
    • Cooperative (coalition) Games: all players are \nconcerned about all the overall\
    \ benefits and they are not \nvery worried about their own personal benefit. Some\
    \ \nfew recent works in CR [42] [45] consider the use of \ncooperative game theory\
    \ to reduce transmission power \nof SUs in order to avoid generating interference\
    \ to PU \ntransmissions. \n• Competitive Games: every user is mainly concerned\
    \ \nabout his personal payoff and therefore all its decisions \nare made competitively\
    \ and moreover selfishly. In the \nexisting literature, we found that game theoretical\
    \ \nconcepts have been extensively used for spectrum \nallocations in CR networks\
    \ [31] [37] [35], where the \nPU and SU participating in a game, behave rationally\
    \ to \nchoose strategies that maximize their individual payoffs. \nThe most known\
    \ property of game-theoretical approaches is \ncalled Nash Equilibrium (NE). In\
    \ NE, each player is assumed \nto know the equilibrium strategies of the other\
    \ players, and \nno player has anything to gain by changing his or her own \n\
    strategy.  \nPareto efficiency is another important concept of game \ntheory.\
    \ This term is named after Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian \neconomist, who used this\
    \ concept in his studies and defined it \nas; “A situation is said to be Pareto\
    \ efficient if there is no \nway to rearrange things to make at least one person\
    \ better off \nwithout making anyone worse off” [48]. \nIn any game, someone will\
    \ find pure and mixed strategies. A \npure strategy has a probability of one,\
    \ and will be always \nplayed. On the other hand, a mixed strategy has multiple\
    \ \npurse strategies with probabilities connected to them [65]. \nPure strategy\
    \ selects a single action and plays it, each row or \ncolumn of a payoff matrix\
    \ represents both an action and a \npure strategy. Mixed strategy randomize over\
    \ the set of \navailable actions according to some probability distribution. \n\
    Let Ai = {all possible actions for agent i}, and ai be any \naction in Ai.  \n\
    Si (aj) = probability that action aj will be played under \nmixed strategy si.\
    \  \nThe support of si is support (si) = {actions in Ai that have \nprobability\
    \ > 0 under si}.  \nA pure strategy is a special case of a mixed strategy; the\
    \ \nsupport consists of a single action. \nIn fully mixed strategy, every action\
    \ has probability > 0. \ni.e., support (si) = Ai.  \nIn a game without a pure\
    \ strategy Nash Equilibrium, a \nmixed strategy may result in a Nash Equilibrium.\
    \ \nSome of the existing works using game theory for the \ndynamic spectrum access\
    \ are mentioned here. For example, \nin [16], the authors assume that the PUs\
    \ are aware of their \nenvironment and of the SUs existence. PUs adopt the roles\
    \ of \nleaders by selecting a subset of SUs and grating them \nspectrum access.\
    \ Whereas in [19], a framework using game \ntheory where the PU do not have the\
    \ knowledge about their \nneighborhood, so they are unaware of the presence of\
    \ SUs, \nand the SUs are only allowed to access the spectrum \nopportunistically\
    \ (users are modeled as rational, selfish and \nthink only to maximize their profits).\
    \ \n72 \nInternational Journal of Communication Networks and Information Security\
    \ (IJCNIS)                                           Vol. 5, No. 2, August 2013\
    \ \n \nAn interesting game is proposed in [21] where the PU first \ndetermines\
    \ the spectrum price based on the quality of \nspectrum and then, the SU decides\
    \ how much spectrum to \nbuy by observing the price. \nIn the bargaining games,\
    \ the individual players have the \nopportunity to cooperate in order to reach\
    \ a mutual \nagreement. At the same time, these players can have conflicts \n\
    of interest and no agreement can be made with any individual \nplayer without\
    \ its approval. For CR networks, the bargaining \ngames are applied to allocate\
    \ spectrum bands in centralized \nand decentralized network settings; the author\
    \ in [8] proposes \nto design secured autonomous networks where terminals and\
    \ \nbase stations interact and self-adapt in an intelligent manner \nwithout needing\
    \ a central controller or a regulator. The \nnetwork design is done at the equilibrium\
    \ state. \nMention that even cooperative and competitive games focus \non solving\
    \ the NE and analyzing its properties, they do not \nprovide any details about\
    \ the players’ interaction to reach this \nequilibrium [37]. \nThe authors in\
    \ [47] consider the problem of spectrum sharing \namong a PU and multiple SUs.\
    \ They formulate this problem \nas an oligopoly market competition and use a noncooperative\
    \ \ngame to obtain the spectrum allocation for secondary users. \nNash equilibrium\
    \ is considered as the solution of this game. \nIn [2], the authors have developed\
    \ a framework for resource \nallocation in a secondary spectrum access scenario,\
    \ where a \ngroup of cognitive radios accesses the resources of a primary \nsystem.\
    \ They assume the primary system is a cellular OFDM-\nbased network operating\
    \ in uplink. The authors have \ndeveloped an optimum resource allocation strategy,\
    \ using \ncooperative game theory, which guarantees the primary’s \nrequired QoS\
    \ and allocates an achievable rate at a given bit \nerror rate for the secondary,\
    \ when possible. The proposed \ncognitive radio game (CRG) is a network-assisted\
    \ resource \nmanagement method, where users (both primary and \nsecondary) inform\
    \ the primary system’s BS of their channel \nstate information and power limitation\
    \ and the base station \ncalculates the optimum sub-channel and power allocation\
    \ for \nall users. \nThe authors in [5] have considered dynamic spectrum access\
    \ \namong cognitive radios from an adaptive, game theoretic \nlearning \nperspective.\
    \ \nSpectrum-agile \ncognitive \nradios \ncompete for channels temporarily vacated\
    \ by licensed \nprimary users in order to satisfy their own demands while \nminimizing\
    \ interference. For both slowly varying primary \nuser activity and slowly varying\
    \ statistics of \"fast\" primary \nuser activity, the authors apply an adaptive\
    \ regret based \nlearning procedure which tracks the set of correlated \nequilibria\
    \ of the game, treated as a distributed stochastic \napproximation. \nThe authors\
    \ in [64] investigates the impact of the tradeoff \nbetween spectrum sensing and\
    \ spectrum access on the \ncooperative strategies of a network of SUs that seek\
    \ to \ncooperate in order to improve their view of the spectrum \n(sensing), reduce\
    \ the possibility of interference among each \nother, and improve their transmission\
    \ capacity (access). The \nauthors have modeled the problem as a coalitional game\
    \ in \npartition form and an algorithm for coalition formation is \nproposed.\
    \ Using the proposed algorithm, the SUs can make \nindividual distributed decisions\
    \ to join or leave a coalition \nwhile maximizing their utilities which capture\
    \ the average \ntime spent for sensing as well as the capacity achieved while\
    \ \naccessing the spectrum. The authors show that, by using the \nproposed algorithm,\
    \ the SUs can self-organize into a network \npartition composed of disjoint coalitions,\
    \ with the members \nof each coalition cooperating to jointly optimize their sensing\
    \ \nand access performance. \nSimulation results show the performance improvement\
    \ that \nthe proposed algorithm yields with respect to the non-\ncooperative case.\
    \ \nFigure 5 demonstrates that, as the amount of time α  \ndedicated for sensing\
    \ a single channel increases, the time that \ncan be allotted for spectrum access\
    \ is reduced, and, thus, the \naverage payoff per SU per slot for both cooperative\
    \ and non-\ncooperative spectrum sensing and access decreases. In this \nfigure,\
    \ we can see that, at all α , the proposed joint spectrum \nsensing and access\
    \ through coalition formation exhibits a \nperformance gain over the non-cooperative\
    \ case. This \nadvantage decreases with α , but it does not go below an \nimprovement\
    \ of 54.7% relative to the non-cooperative \nscheme at α = 0.5, i.e., when half\
    \ of the slot is used for \nsensing a single channel. \n \n \nFigure 5. Average\
    \ payoff achieved per SU per slot for a \nnetwork with N = 10 SUs and K = 14 channels\

    \ theory gives insight into several less-known aspects, \nwhich arise in situations\
    \ of conflicting interests. It develops a \nframework for analyzing decision making\
    \ in such situations \nwhere interdependence of agents is considered like the\
    \ \nproblem of spectrum access between SUs in cognitive radio \nnetworks. But,\
    \ all the competitive problems cannot be \nanalyzed with the help of game theory,\
    \ also, the assumption \nthat players have the knowledge about their own pay-offs\
    \ and \npay-offs of others is not practical and the techniques of \nsolving games\
    \ involving mixed strategies particularly in case \nof large pay-off matrix is\
    \ very complicated. \n3.3. Spectrum Access using Markov Approaches \nGame theoretical\
    \ approaches do not model the interaction \nbetween the SUs and the PUs for spectrum\
    \ access. This \nmodeling can efficiently be performed using Markov chains \n\
    [30]. \n73 \nInternational Journal of Communication Networks and Information Security\
    \ (IJCNIS)                                           Vol. 5, No. 2, August 2013\
    \ \n \nFew research have been done in this field, for example, In \n[40], a Markov\
    \ model is presented, where each SU randomly \nselects its own channel rather\
    \ than exchanging control \nmessages with the neighboring SUs. A very interesting\
    \ \napproach using Markov models is developed by the authors \nin [1] to analyze\
    \ the different policies proposed for spectrum \nsharing. \nSome works used the\
    \ CTMC (Continious Time Markov \nChains) model because it achieves good statistical\
    \ tradeoffs \nbetween fairness and efficiency. Presented works in [1] [46] \n\
    [41] used CTMC to capture the interaction between primary \nand SUs. Both queuing\
    \ and without queuing models are \nanalyzed and the throughput degradation due\
    \ to SUs \ninterference is compensated.  \nIn [57], a Markov chain analysis for\
    \ spectrum access in \nlicensed bands for cognitive radios is presented and forced\
    \ \ntermination probability, blocking probability and traffic \nthroughput are\
    \ derived. In addition, a channel reservation \nscheme for cognitive radio spectrum\
    \ handoff is proposed. \nThis scheme allows the tradeoff between forced termination\
    \ \nand blocking according to QoS requirements. Numerical \nresults show that\
    \ the proposed scheme can greatly reduce \nforced termination probability at a\
    \ slight increase in blocking \nprobability. \nA decentralized cognitive MAC protocols\
    \ that allow \nsecondary users to independently search for spectrum \nopportunities\
    \ without a central coordinator or a dedicated \ncommunication channel is proposed\
    \ in [58]. Recognizing \nhardware and energy constraints, the authors assume that\
    \ a \nsecondary user may not be able to perform full-spectrum \nsensing or may\
    \ not be willing to monitor the spectrum when \nit has no data to transmit. The\
    \ authors develop an analytical \nframework for opportunistic spectrum access\
    \ based on the \ntheory of partially observable Markov decision process \n(POMDP).\
    \ This decision-theoretic approach integrates the \ndesign of spectrum access\
    \ protocols at the MAC layer with \nspectrum sensing at the physical layer and\
    \ traffic statistics \ndetermined by the application layer of the primary network.\
    \ \nIt also allows easy incorporation of spectrum sensing error \nand constraint\
    \ on the probability of colliding with the \nprimary users. Under this POMDP framework,\
    \ the authors \npropose cognitive MAC protocols that optimize the \nperformance\
    \ of secondary users while limiting the \ninterference perceived by primary users.\
    \ A suboptimal \nstrategy \nwith \nreduced \ncomplexity \nyet \ncomparable \n\
    performance is developed. Without additional control \nmessage exchange between\
    \ the secondary transmitter and \nreceiver, the proposed decentralized protocols\
    \ ensure \nsynchronous hopping in the spectrum between the transmitter \nand the\
    \ receiver in the presence of collisions and spectrum \nsensing errors. \nThe\
    \ authors in [59] propose and analyze a dynamic spectrum \naccess schemes in the\
    \ absence or presence of buffering \nmechanism for the cognitive secondary subscriber\
    \ (SU). \nThey develop a Markov approach to analyze the proposed \nspectrum sharing\
    \ policies with generalized bandwidth size in \nboth primary system and secondary\
    \ system. Performance \nmetrics for SU are developed with respect to blocking\
    \ \nprobability, interrupted probability, forced termination \nprobability, non-completion\
    \ probability and waiting time. \nNumerical examples are presented to explore\
    \ the impact of \nkey systems parameters like the traffic load on the \nperformance\
    \ metrics. Comparison results indicate that the \nbuffer is able to significantly\
    \ reduce the SU blocking \nprobability and non-completion probability with very\
    \ minor \nincreased forced termination probability. The analytic model \nhas been\
    \ verified by extensive simulation.  \nThe authors in [60] use hidden Markov models\
    \ (HMMs) to \nmodel and predict the spectrum occupancy of licensed radio \nbands.\
    \ They proposed a technique that can dynamically \nselect different licensed bands\
    \ for its own use with \nsignificantly less interference from and to the licensed\
    \ users. \nIt is found that by predicting the duration of spectrum holes \nof\
    \ primary users, the CR can utilize them more efficiently by \nleaving the band,\
    \ that it currently occupies, before the start of \ntraffic from the primary user\
    \ of that band. The authors \npropose a simple algorithm, called the Markov-based\
    \ channel \nprediction algorithm (MCPA), for dynamic spectrum \nallocation in\
    \ cognitive radio networks. They present the \nperformance of the proposed dynamic\
    \ spectrum allocation \nalgorithm when the channel state occupancy of primary\
    \ users \nare assumed to be Poisson distributed. The impact of CR \ntransmission\
    \ on the licensed users is also presented. It is \nshown that significant SIR\
    \ improvements can be achieved \nusing HMM based dynamic spectrum allocation as\
    \ compared \nto the traditional CSMA based approach.  \nA \nqueuing \nanalytic\
    \ \nframework \nto \nstudy \nimportant \nperformance measures experienced by SUs\
    \ in a CR network \nwas developed in [61]. The authors studied queuing delay \n\
    and buffer statistics of SUs’ packets by modeling PUs’ \nactivity as a two state\
    \ Markov chain and SUs’ channel quality \nvariation as a finite state Markov chain\
    \ (FSMC). In order to \nallocate available channels among the SUs, an opportunistic\
    \ \nchannel allocation scheme is considered. The proposed \nframework facilitates\
    \ to design an admission controller for \nSUs’ network in order to maintain a\
    \ given quality service \n(QoS) requirement which is specified in the form of\
    \ \nstatistical delay guarantee. \nThe authors in [63] have proposed an approach\
    \ to dynamic \nspectrum access in which the occupancy state of each \nfrequency\
    \ band at each time instant is estimated, and \navailable bands are allocated\
    \ accordingly. Estimation is \nperformed from power spectral density measurements\
    \ which \nare assumed to obey a hidden Markov process (HMP). The \nvalue of the\
    \ hidden state represents the status of a given \nfrequency band which could be\
    \ free or occupied. The authors \nhave trained the system using real spectrum\
    \ measurements, \nand tested it on simulated data for which the occupancy state\
    \ \nof each frequency band at each time instant is known.  \nTable 2. HMP-Based\

    \ Pd increases as the SNR \nincreases. Pfa and Pd approach to 0 and 1, respectively,\
    \ when \nSNR is greater than 14 dB. Unlike Pfa and Pd which have \neither increase\
    \ or decrease trend, the probability of prediction \nerror Ppe has negligible\
    \ fluctuation around 0.038 for all SNR \nvalues. \nThe probability of prediction\
    \ error is computed as follows: \nPpe = Ppe/off Poff + Ppe/on Pon. Where Ppe/off\
    \ and Ppe/on are the \nconditional probabilities of prediction error given channel\
    \ off \nstate and channel on state; Poff and Pon are the probabilities of \noff\
    \ state and on state, respectively. \nMarkov modelling easily handles the computation\
    \ of the \nprobability of an event resulting from a sequence of sub-\nevents.\
    \ This type of problem does not lend itself well to \nclassical techniques. The\
    \ Markov models are simple to \ngenerate although they do require a more complicated\
    \ \nmathematical approach. So, there are several problems with \nthese models,\
    \ for example, they make the Markovian \nassumption that the emission and the\
    \ transition probabilities \ndepend only on the current state, the number of parameters\
    \ \nthat need to be set in a Markov models is huge and as a result \nof the above,\
    \ the amount of data that is required to train a \nMarkov models very large. \
    \ \n3.4. Spectrum Access using Multi Agent Systems \nThe idea of Distributed Artificial\
    \ Intelligence (DAI) is to \nmove from individual to collective behavior in order\
    \ to \naddress the limitations of traditional artificial intelligence \nwhen solving\
    \ complex problems requiring the distribution of \nintelligence over several entities.\
    \ The DAI includes three \nbasic research areas which are: distributed problem\
    \ solving, \nparallel artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems [52]. \n\
    We can find several definitions concerning the agent which \nare different only\
    \ in the type of application for which the \nagent is designed. The authors in\
    \ [53] gave the following \ndefinition: \"an agent is a piece of software that\
    \ can achieve a \nspecific task in an autonomous way (for the sake of the user\
    \ \nor the application)\". \nAll the agents have the possibility of coordinating,\
    \ \ncommunicating and co-operating with the system or with \nother agents. A common\
    \ approach consists in defining the \nagent by its properties, such as autonomy,\
    \ intelligence, \nmobility, etc... \nTwo principal types of agent, mobile agents\
    \ and intelligent \nagents are identified [54]. \nThe principal attributes of\
    \ a mobile agent are the mobility of \nthe code, the data and the state (state\
    \ of a process, a machine \nor a protocol). This makes it possible for software\
    \ entities to \nmove in an autonomous way through the network to achieve \nspecific\
    \ task, thereby taking advantage of proximity [53]. \nAn intelligent agent is\
    \ a software entity which carries out \noperations for the account of the user\
    \ (or for another \nprogram) with some degree of freedom and autonomy and \nwhich\
    \ exploits knowledge or representations of the desires \nand the objectives of\
    \ the user [55]. The authors in [53] give \nthe following definition: Intelligent\
    \ agents are software \nentities that are able to perform delegated tasks based\
    \ on \ninternal knowledge and reasoning, where aspects such as \ninter agent communication\
    \ and negotiation are fundamental. \nUsually mobility is not considered as an\
    \ issue. Another \ndefinition was given in [55]: \"an intelligent agent is an\
    \ \ninformation processing system, located in some environment, \nwhich is able\
    \ to carry out flexible and autonomous actions in \norder to meet its aims of\
    \ design\". \nA multi-agent system is a dynamic federation of agents \nconnected\
    \ by the shared environments, goals or plans, and \nwhich cooperate and coordinate\
    \ their actions [56]. It is this \ncapacity to communicate, to coordinate and\
    \ to cooperate \nwhich makes interesting the use of agents in cognitive radio\
    \ \nnetworks. \nThe association of MAS and the CR can provide a \ngreat future\
    \ for the optimal management of frequencies (in \ncomparison with the rigid control\
    \ techniques proposed by \nthe telecommunications \noperators). In \nthe \ncase\
    \ \nof use \nof unlicensed bands, the CR terminals have to coordinate and \ncooperate\
    \ to best use the spectrum without causing \ninterference. \nIn [39], the authors\
    \ propose an architecture based on agents \nwhere each CR terminal is equipped\
    \ with an intelligent agent, \nthere are modules to collect information about\
    \ the radio \nenvironment and of course the information collected will be \nstored\
    \ in a shared knowledge base that will be accessed by all \nagents. The proposed\
    \ approach is based on cooperative MAS \n(the agents have common interests). They\
    \ work by sharing \ntheir knowledge to increase their collective and individual\
    \ \ngain. \nAgents are \ndeployed \non the \nPUs \nand \nSUs \nterminals and cooperate\
    \ with each other in the works \nproposed in [36] [24] [25]. By cooperative MAS,\
    \ we mean \nthat PU agents exchanged t-uples of messages in order to \nimprove\
    \ themselves and the neighbourhood of SU agents. \nThey propose that the SUs should\
    \ make their decision based \non the amount of available spectrum when they find\
    \ a \nsuitable offer (without waiting for response from all PUs). In \nother words,\
    \ the SU agent should send messages to the \nappropriate neighbour PU agent and\
    \ of course the concerned \nPU must respond to these agents to an agreement on\
    \ sharing \nthe spectrum. After the end of the spectrum use, the SU must \npay\
    \ the PU. \nA comparison is made in [24] between an agent and a CR. \nBasically,\
    \ both of them are aware of their surrounding \nenvironments through interactions,\
    \ sensing, monitoring and \nthey have autonomy and control over their actions\
    \ and states. \nThey can solve the assigned tasks independently based on \ntheir\
    \ individual capabilities or can work with their neighbors \nby having frequent\
    \ information exchanges. \nTable 3. Comparison between an agent and a Cognitive\
    \ \nRadio \n \nAgent \nCognitive radio node \nAn agent is a virtual entity \n\
    that \ncan \nperceive \nits \nenvironment, \nact \nand \ncommunicate with other\
    \ \nagents. \nA cognitive radio terminal \ninteracts \nwith \nits \nradio \nenvironment,\
    \ detects the free \nfrequencies and then exploits \nthem. \nAgent is autonomous\
    \ and \nhas skills to achieve its \ngoal. \nThe cognitive radio node has \nenough\
    \ capabilities allowing \nit \nto \nmanage \nthe \nradio \nresources. \nTo make\
    \ the CR systems practical, it requires that several CR \nnetworks coexist with\
    \ each other. However, this can cause \ninterference. The authors of [22] think\
    \ that to remedy this \n75 \nInternational Journal of Communication Networks and\
    \ Information Security (IJCNIS)                                           Vol.\
    \ 5, No. 2, August 2013 \n \nproblem, the SU can cooperate to sense the spectrum\
    \ as well \nas to share it without causing interference to the PU. For this, \n\
    they propose schemes to protect the PU from interferences by \ncontrolling the\
    \ transmission power of the cognitive terminal. \nIn [29] [23], the authors propose\
    \ cooperation between PUs \nand SUs and between SUs only. Agents are deployed\
    \ on the \nuser’s terminals to cooperate and result in contracts \ngoverning spectrum\
    \ allocation. SU agents coexist and \ncooperate with the PU agents in an Ad hoc\
    \ CR environment \nusing messages and mechanisms for decision making. Since \n\
    the internal behaviours of agents are cooperative and selfless, \nit enables \n\
    them \nto \nmaximize the \nutility \nfunction of \nother agents without \nadding\
    \ costs result in \nterms \nof \nexchanged messages. \nHowever, the allocation\
    \ of resources is an important \nissue in CR systems. It can be done by making\
    \ the \nnegotiation among SUs [34] [38]. In \n[34] the \nauthors \npropose a model\
    \ based on agents for the spectrum trading \nin a CR network. But instead of negotiating\
    \ spectrum directly \nwith the \nPU and SU, a \nbroker agent is \nincluded. This\
    \ \nmeans that the equipment of PU or SU does not require much \nintelligence\
    \ as it does not need to perform the spectrum \nsensing. The objective of this\
    \ trading is to maximize the \nbenefits and profits of agents to satisfy the SU.\
    \ The authors \nproposed two situations, the first uses a single agent who will\
    \ \nexploit and dominate the network, in either case there will be \nseveral competing\
    \ agents. \nThe authors in [20] study the use of CR in wireless \nLANs and the\
    \ possibility of introducing the technology of \nagents, in other words they try\
    \ to solve the problem of radio \nresources allocation by combining resources\
    \ management \nWLAN in a decentralized environment, this by using MAS. \nFor this,\
    \ they propose an approach based on MAS \nfor sharing information and decisions\
    \ distribution among \nmultiple WLANs in a distributed manner. \nInterference\
    \ from the acquisition of the channels in a cellular \nsystem during Handovers\
    \ can be reduced according to \n[13] [4] using a CR to manage the handover. Indeed,\
    \ the \nmobility of the device imposes a different behaviour when \nchanging zones.\
    \ The terminal must ensure service continuity \nof applications and the effective\
    \ spectrum management. The \nauthors propose an approach that uses negotiation,\
    \ learning, \nreasoning and prediction to know the needs of new services \nin\
    \ modern wireless networks. They propose an algorithm to \nbe \nexecuted \nby\
    \ the mobile \nterminal during \nthe cognitive phase of handover. \nThe MAS contains\
    \ several intelligent agents interact with \neach other. Each agent can sense\
    \ and learn. The agent can \nselect behaviours based on local information and\
    \ attempt to \nmaximize overall system performance. In [7], the authors \ndescribed\
    \ a new \napproach \nbased \non \nmulti-agent \nreinforcement learning which is\
    \ used in CR networks with ad \nhoc decentralized control. In other words, they\
    \ set up \nseveral CR \nscenarios and \naffect each \ncase a \nreward or \npenalty.\
    \ The results of this approach have shown that \nwith this method, the network\
    \ can converge to a fair \nspectrum sharing and of course it reduces interferences\
    \ \nwith PUs. \nThe authors in [26] have developed a cooperative framework \n\
    for spectrum allocation that can generate highly effective \nbehavior in dynamic\
    \ environments and achieve better utility \nof the participating devices. The\
    \ proposed approach is based \non multi-agent system cooperation and implemented\
    \ by \ndeploying agents on cognitive radio and primary user \ndevices. Experimental\
    \ evaluations confirm the efficiency of \nthe algorithms proposed by the authors\
    \ for distributed and \ndecentralized environments.  \nFor the simulation, the\
    \ authors assumed two different fixed \nvalues of times (such as T1 and T2), where\
    \ T1 represents the \nshort-term case and T2 is the longer period. When T1 is\
    \ \nconsidered, the SU agents can ask for an amount of spectrum \nwithin one hour\
    \ limit (0 ≤  T1 ≤  60 Minutes) and similarly \nthis limit is within two hours,\
    \ as in case of T2 (0 ≤  T2 ≤  \n120 Minutes).  \nThe number of cooperation messages\
    \ transmitted and \nreceived in the entire system with the success rate (in \n\
    percentage) is shown in Table 4. According to this table, the \nvalues of exchanged\
    \ messages are almost leveled off for the \nmiddle periods (from 30 to 70 agents).\
    \ Further, Table 4 \ndepicts that the average number of messages (per agent) \n\
    remains between 4 and 5 even with the increased number of \nagents. The authors\
    \ assume also that the approach is linear in \nterms of messages and success rate.\
    \ Particularly when time \nlimit is T2 (around 90 to 120 agents), the performance\
    \ of the \napproach substantially degrades (reaching below 80%), but \nnevertheless\
    \ it remains steady. \nTable 4. Success rate and number of messages at T1 and\

    \ the \ncooperation between primary and secondary user devices. \nFurthermore,\

    \ \nallows studying the emerging aspect, the behaviors of \nheterogeneous CR networks.\
    \ \nAs shown above, using MAS seems to be the approaches that \nsuits well to\
    \ the spectrum access in cognitive radio networks \nbecause it guarantees the\
    \ autonomy of users as embedded \nagents can manage their own spectrum need in\
    \ a dynamic and \ndecentralized manner. But, in cognitive radio networks, we \n\
    often consider multiple secondary users competing in a non-\ncooperative way for\
    \ a limited set of frequencies left available \nby primary users. As a consequence,\
    \ game theory is the \nnatural framework to study the interactions among such\
    \ \nusers. It should be noted that auction is often modeled as a \ncompetitive\
    \ game, so, the hybridization of game theory and \nauction seem promising for\
    \ spectrum access, and so, \ncognitive radio can function at both cooperative\
    \ and \ncompetitive modes. However, game theory focuses on \nsolving the Nash\
    \ equilibrium and analyzing its properties and \nnot to consider how players should\
    \ interact to reach this \nequilibrium. On contrary, MAS seems to be a way to\
    \ \novercome this problem. We also note that, the results \nobtained using Markov\
    \ models are very promising and these \nmodels can offer a new paradigm for predicting\
    \ channel \nbehavior in cognitive radio networks, an area that has been of \n\
    much research interest lately. Table 5 makes a comparison \nbetween the four techniques\
    \ used for dynamic spectrum \naccess. \nTable 5. Comparison between the four techniques\
    \ used for \ndynamic spectrum access \nTechniques \nused for DSA \nStrengths \n\

    \ \nthe autonomy \nof users. \n \n- Have to use the other \ntechniques (Auction,\
    \ \nGame theory and Markov \nmodels) to perform more \ncomplex processing. \n\
    So, to summarize our survey, we can say that the four \ntechniques used for dynamic\
    \ spectrum access in the context \nof cognitive radio networks (auction, game\
    \ theory, Markov \nmodels and SMA) are completely complementary.  \nResearchers\
    \ in CR have been more interested in spectrum \nsensing, decision and sharing\
    \ than spectrum mobility. \nNevertheless, terminal mobility still arises as a\
    \ major issue. \nDSA will take into account nodes mobility. Future directions\
    \ \nof research must use multi-agent systems negotiation that \nenables mobile\
    \ CR terminals to switch to the best available \nspectrum band giving their applications\
    \ requirements. The \nfour techniques used for DSA in the context of CR networks\
    \ \nmust take into account nodes mobility. \n4. Conclusion \nIn this survey, we\
    \ have presented various techniques of \ndynamic spectrum access in cognitive\
    \ radio networks, \nstarting by auctions where the utility function of the \n\
    network is not optimized each time because it depends \non user \nbehavior and\
    \ \nthen \npassing by game \ntheory \nwhich is widely used in this area because\
    \ it can achieve \nequilibrium between users that provides efficient spectrum\
    \ \nmanagement. Then, we cited some works that used Markov \nmodels, which in\
    \ addition to the above methods provides a \nmodel of the interaction between\
    \ PUs and SUs. Finally, we \nfocused on the use of multi-agent systems in dynamic\
    \ \nspectrum access.  \nHowever, this last method has been exploited by a minority\
    \ \nof researchers (compared to game theory) to solve the \nproblem of spectrum\
    \ allocation. Different approaches using \nthe MAS in the CR are studied, those\
    \ offering cooperation \nbetween SUs only, others offer a cooperation between\
    \ \nprimary and SUs and those proposing to include a broker \nagent to negotiate\
    \ the spectrum, knowing that the most works \nstudied are using reinforcement\
    \ learning. \nOur paper explains in detail cognitive radio and its main \nfunctions\
    \ (spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum \nsharing and spectrum mobility)\
    \ including different methods \ndesigning dynamic spectrum access. We think that\
    \ this \nsurvey is a perfect introduction for graduate students and \nresearchers,\
    \ as well as a useful self-study guide for \npractitioners. The influence of the\
    \ main functions of \ncognitive radio on the performance of the upper layer \n\

    \ \n \nprotocols such as routing and transport are not investigated in \nthis\
    \ survey, the open research issues in these areas are not \noutlined.  \nHowever,\
    \ we think that our survey is a good complement to \nliterature review related\
    \ to routing in cogntive radio networks \n[66, 67] and to transport protocol for\
    \ cognitive radio [68, \n69]. \nIn our \nfuture \nwork, we \nthink \nwe \ncan\
    \ improve \nthe \nwireless links reliability and ensure good quality of service\
    \ \nto CR mobile terminals [3] [4] [6] by integrating multi-agent \nsystems. We\
    \ intend to work on multi-agent systems \nnegotiation [70] that enables CR mobile\
    \ terminals to switch \nto the best available spectrum band giving their applications\
    \ \nrequirements (Spectrum Mobility). We will deploy agents on \nboth PUs and\
    \ SUs to negotiate in order to have a better use \nof the spectrum. The use of\
    \ game theory and auction in this \ncontext is also possible [15]. \nReferences\

    that enables dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks. The cognitive radio
    is capable of opportunistically using the available portions of a licensed spectrum
    to improve the application performance for unlicensed users. The opportunistic
    use of the available channels in the wireless environment requires dynamic channel
    assignment to efficiently utilize the available resources while minimizing the
    interference in the network. A challenging aspect of such algorithms is the incorporation
    of the channels'' diverse characteristics, highly dynamic network conditions with
    respect to primary users'' activity, and different fragmented sizes of the available
    channels. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art channel
    assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks. We also classify the algorithms
    by presenting a thematic taxonomy of the current channel assignment algorithms
    in cognitive radio networks. Moreover, the critical aspects of the current channel
    assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks are analyzed to determine the
    strengths and weaknesses of such algorithms. The similarities and differences
    of the algorithms based on the important parameters, such as routing dependencies,
    channel models, assignment methods, execution model, and optimization objectives,
    are also investigated. We also discuss open research issues and challenges of
    channel assignment in the cognitive radio networks. Published in: IEEE Communications

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction OVER the last few years,
    significant developments in wireless technologies have made mobile devices, such
    as laptops, mobile phones, smartphones, and personal digital assistants, an essential
    part of the human life [1]– [3]. According to the SiliconIndia Magazine''s report
    [4], the number of cell phone subscriptions are estimated to increase from 6 billion
    in January 2013 to 7.3 billion in 2014, which is, interestingly enough, more than
    the world''s current population. Similarly, mobile-broadband subscriptions have
    increased from 268 million in 2007 to 2.1 billion in 2013, with an average annual
    growth rate of 40% [5]. This remarkable widespread access to mobile phones is
    based on the mobility [6]– [8] and wireless connectivity [9]– [13] that have become
    a driving force for the far-reaching deployment of wireless networks. The increase
    in wireless network deployment has saturated the spectrum and has led to spectrum
    scarcity [14]– [16]. Another fundamental reason for the scarcity of the spectrum
    and the saturation of unlicensed spectrum is inefficient spectrum assignment,
    in which a wireless spectrum is assigned to a licensee, also known as the primary
    user (PU), on a long-term basis using a fixed spectrum assignment policy [17].
    According to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), the utilization of the
    assigned spectrum varies temporally and geographically between 15% to 85% [18].
    This fixed spectrum assignment policy and the usage pattern cause over-utilization
    of the unlicensed spectrum and underutilization of the licensed spectrum. The
    shortage of the available spectrum and the inefficient spectrum usage require
    a new communication paradigm to exploit the available spectrum opportunities [19].
    The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) introduces the dynamic spectrum
    access (DSA) networking [20]– [25] that shifts the communication paradigm from
    the traditional fixed spectrum access to the DSA. Currently, the DSA is supported
    by a number of wireless standards, such as P1900.4 [26], 802.11y [27], 802.16h
    [28], and 802.22 [29]. The activities of such standards with respect to cognitive
    radio technology are critically reviewed in [30], which further highlights the
    issues for future standardization. As spectrum usage varies temporally and spatially
    in wireless networks, the spectrum band is fragmented into several spectrum segments.
    The spectrum segments that are unused by the PUs in a time interval, are known
    as spectrum holes in a cognitive radio network (CRN) [24]. These spectrum holes
    appear as usable channels to a secondary user (SU). To leverage the spectrum holes/channels
    for an effective network throughput, mechanisms for spectrum/channel assignment
    in CRNs must be developed. In this paper, we use spectrum assignment and channel
    assignment to represent the similar concept of channel mapping to radio interfaces
    of nodes in the CRNs. Channel assignment in CRNs is defined as a problem of determining
    an optimal mapping between the available licensed channels and the cognitive radio
    such that the performance of CRN is optimized. The objectives of the channel assignment
    in the CRNs are: To assign the available channels to cognitive radio interfaces
    of secondary nodes to achieve efficient spectrum utilization. To reduce the interference
    among secondary nodes. To minimize the interference to PUs. Hence, the channel
    assignment algorithms for CRNs should be designed to attain the desired goals.
    Similar to that in conventional wireless networks, the channel assignment in the
    CRNs also faces many design issues. These design issues are interference, connectivity,
    stability, throughput, and fault tolerance [31]– [36]. A trade-off exists between
    connectivity and interference: if a channel assignment algorithm assigns the same
    channel to the interfaces of several nodes, then the assignment attains greater
    connectivity, but the channel communication faces additional interference [35],
    [37]. Another important design concern for channel assignment is stability that
    is defined in terms of ripple effect and channel oscillation [32]. Stability describes
    the degree of resistance to the changes in the network environment. The ripple
    effect causes the already assigned links to reassign the channels when the channel
    assignment is performed for a given link; thereby, reducing the network throughput
    [38], [39]. The channel oscillation occurs when the channel assignment algorithm
    does not converge and the algorithm moves back and forth among various available
    choices [40], [41]. The ripple effect and channel oscillation usually occur in
    a dynamic channel assignment [40]. Throughput is a network performance measurement
    parameter that is significantly affected by the channel assignment in a network
    [42]. Lastly, the fault tolerance feature of a channel assignment enables the
    network to operate under node or link failure by employing self-healing mechanisms
    [43], [44]. Such key design issues are discussed in [40]. Aside from these design
    issues of channel assignment in the CRNs, the PU activities vary spatially and
    influence the available set of channels for the secondary users (SUs) [18], [45].
    Therefore, channel assignment in the CRNs becomes extremely challenging because
    of the varying number of available channels [46]. The major contributions of the
    survey are as follows: (a) a comparison of existing surveys on channel assignment
    algorithms in various wireless networks, (b) a classification of the state-of-the-art
    CRN channel assignment algorithms and a devisal of a thematic taxonomy, (c) a
    comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms in
    CRNs, (d) an investigation into the current channel assignment algorithms by discussing
    critical aspects, (e) a comparison of the CRN channel assignment algorithms by
    investigating the similarities and differences among them, and (f) an identification
    of the issues in existing solutions of CRN channel assignment in the DSA networks.
    The rest of the survey is organized into eight sections. Section II explains the
    fundamental concepts related to the CRNs. The section discusses the concepts of
    CRNs, as well as the channel assignment in traditional wireless networks and the
    CRNs. A comparison of existing surveys on channel assignment algorithms in various
    wireless networks is presented in Section III. Section IV presents the thematic
    taxonomy of the current channel assignment algorithms in the CRNs. Section V provides
    a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms. The
    section further investigates the strengths and weaknesses of the current channel
    assignment algorithms in the CRNs. Section VI provides the comparison summary
    of the state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms while highlighting the similarities
    and differences by using the parameters presented in the taxonomy. The discussion
    on the lessons learnt from the conducted survey is presented in Section VII. Section
    VIII highlights the issues related to the current channel assignment algorithms
    in the CRNs and discusses the challenges in realizing effective channel assignment
    in the CRNs. Section IX concludes the paper and highlights future research directions.
    SECTION II. Background This section provides a brief background on the CRNs and
    explains the channel assignment in traditional wireless networks and in the CRNs.
    For the ease of reading, we list all of the commonly used acronyms in Table I.
    Table I List of Acronyms and Corresponding Definitions A. Cognitive Radio Networks
    The CRNs are also known as secondary networks, DSA networks, or unlicensed networks
    [24]. The nodes in the CRNs are equipped with the cognitive radios (CRs) that
    are capable of changing the transceiver parameters based on the changes in the
    environment within which the CRN nodes operate [24]. The CRNs are further classified
    into two groups, namely: a) infrastructure-based CRNs [47]– [49] and b) infrastructure-less
    CRNs or cognitive radio ad-hoc networks (CRAHNs) [50]. The infrastructure-based
    CRNs have one central network entity, such as the base station for communication
    control. Examples of such networks are cognitive radio cellular networks (CRCNs)
    [47]– [49], [51]– [53] and wireless regional area networks (WRANs) [29], [54].
    A CRN may have a spectrum broker that maintains and distributes the spectrum resources
    among various CRNs. Fig. 1 shows an architecture of the CRN. The SUs can utilize
    both the available licensed portions of the spectrum owned by a PU and the unlicensed
    portions of the spectrum. The CR base station communicate with a secondary node
    at channel on which the secondary receiver node is tuned. The color of a wireless
    link in diagram shows the spectrum band whereas a number on the wireless link
    represents the channel ID. The devices on the horizontal spectrum separating line
    have multiple available channels. The operations involved in accessing and using
    a particular portion of a spectrum vary according to the type of spectrum band.
    The licensed band is normally used by the PUs; therefore, the SUs are required
    to detect the activity of the PUs. The channel capacity of licensed band for secondary
    node is dependent on the interference received at the nearby PUs. Moreover, the
    SUs must vacate the band upon detection of the PUs presence within the spectrum.
    In this case, the SUs switch to the next best available channel. To access the
    unlicensed band, the SUs must compete with the other SUs. Fig. 1. The CRN architecture.
    Show All The CRs are used by the researchers to improve the network capacity of
    various wireless networks. Studies on the CRs focus on the various issues in WRANs
    [29], [55], cognitive wireless local area networks (CWLANs) [56], CRCNs [51],
    [53], [57], cognitive wireless mesh networks (CWMNs) [58]– [63], CRAHNs [50],
    [64]– [67], cognitive radio vehicular networks (CRVNs) [68]– [72], and cognitive
    radio sensor networks (CRSNs) [73]– [76]. The CRs are expected to be used in various
    potential applications as discussed in [72], [77]– [79]. Di Felice et al. [72]
    present a taxonomy of the literature, highlight research problems, and identify
    the way to incorporate the characteristics of the vehicular environment into the
    spectrum management functions. Ozan et al. [77] focus on enabling underwater acoustic
    communications by employing CR technologies. Moreover, the authors investigate
    the achievable capacity gain by using CRs. Gabriel et al. [78] investigate the
    interference among the cognitive emergency wireless networks and define a fractional
    service area, or a metric for evaluating service provisioning capabilities in
    coexisting networks that share the same TV white space. The research presented
    in [79] highlights the significance of spectrum sharing in enhancing the capacity
    of public safety networks in disaster relief situations. B. Channel Assignment
    in Traditional Wireless Networks Channel assignment defines the mapping of channels
    to the radio interfaces to attain optimal channel utilization while minimizing
    the channel interference. With respect to the mapping nature, channel assignment
    is generally classified into three categories: (a) fixed or static [80], [81],
    (b) dynamic [82]– [84], and (c) hybrid [85]. In fixed channel assignment, the
    configuration of the channels is almost constant; whereas, in dynamic channel
    assignment, channel mapping must be continuously updated with the varying network
    conditions. A hybrid scheme configures some interfaces statically while the rest
    of the interfaces are configured dynamically. The channel assignment scheme can
    also be categorized based on the following implementation methods: (a) centralized
    [86], [87], (b) distributed [88]– [91], and (c) decentralized [92]. In the centralized
    channel assignment algorithms, a central node, such as a server, collects channel
    and link information from the nodes. The collected information is used to run
    the centralized channel assignment algorithm to determine the channel mapping
    for all of the links in the wireless network. Thereafter, the result is sent to
    the nodes in the wireless network. The nodes configure the interfaces according
    to the results. In the distributed channel assignment algorithms, each node computes
    the appropriate channels for all of the links considering the local information.
    Such a channel assignment may suffer from the ripple effect [93]– [95] and channel
    oscillation [96] problems. A distributed channel assignment may not deliver an
    optimal channel mapping because of the usage of local knowledge. The decentralized
    channel assignment algorithms are developed to attain the advantages of both the
    centralized and distributed channel assignments. A decentralized channel assignment
    is performed in cluster-based wireless networks, where a cluster head performs
    the intra-cluster channel assignment in a centralized manner. The cluster head
    utilizes the available knowledge of all of the nodes within the cluster to compute
    the intra-cluster channel assignment. Thereafter, the cluster head computes, in
    a distributed manner, the inter-cluster channel assignment using the information
    of the links with the neighboring cluster heads. Table II Comparison of Existing
    Surveys on Channel Assignment Problem in Wireless Networks C. Channel Assignment
    Algorithm in CRNs The channel assignment in CRNs is different from that in traditional
    wireless networks in terms of interference. One major challenge in maximizing
    the performance of CRNs is lessening the interference among the SUs, as well as
    the interference to the PUs. Interference affects the performance of wireless
    networks by increasing the noise at a receiver and decreasing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) [42]. The interference also increases the frame loss ratio, reduces
    the utilization of wireless resources, decreases the transmission rate of wireless
    interfaces, and lowers the receivers throughput. Channel assignment algorithm
    assigns the most appropriate channel to the radio interfaces of a CR node based
    on a certain criteria, such as fairness, spectrum utilization, and throughput,
    while avoiding the interference to the PUs operating in the same proximity. In
    the CRNs, the spectrum holes and available frequencies vary temporally and spatially
    [24]. These additional challenges make the channel assignment in the CRNs more
    complex than that in traditional wireless networks; the latter is itself an NP-complete
    problem [97], [98]. Moreover in general, the channel assignment in CRNs is dynamic.
    The CRNs cannot exploit the full advantages of the CR technologies if the channel
    assignment is static. Fig. 2. Taxonomy of channel assignment algorithms in CRNs.
    Show All SECTION III. Comparison of Surveys on Channel Assignment Problem in Wireless
    Networks The channel assignment problem has been studied in various wireless networks.
    Therefore, there exist surveys on channel assignment problem for different wireless
    networks [40], [94], [99]– [104]. However, we provide a comprehensive survey on
    the channel assignment problem in all types of CRN. In this section, we compare
    the existing surveys conducted on the channel assignment algorithms for various
    wireless network to differentiate our work from the existing surveys. Table II
    presents a comparative summary of existing surveys on channel assignment problem
    in wireless networks. The survey papers on channel assignment problem presented
    in [99], [100] cover multi-channel assignment protocols and discuss multi-channel
    communication in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), respectively. The works present
    a taxonomy of channel assignment algorithms for WSNs, thereafter, the authors
    compare the channel assignment protocols for WSN based on the proposed taxonomy.
    W. Si et al. [40] and H. skalli et al. [94] have done survey on multi-radio, multi-channel
    assignment problem in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). Their works only cover the
    channel assignment schemes for conventional WMNs. However, we cover the channel
    assignment problem in different types of CRNs such as CRAHNs, CRCNs, CRSNs, CWLANs,
    and CWMNs. The surveys conducted in [101], [104] cover the channel assignment
    in conventional cellular mobile networks. G. K. Audhya et al. [101] develop a
    taxonomy based on solving approaches. Thereafter, the authors compared the channel
    assignment solutions based on demand vectors and required bandwidth. M.P. Mishra
    et al. [104] classify the channel allocation algorithms based on channel assignment
    method and execution platform. However, the comparison of channel allocation algorithms
    is based on traffic distribution, implementation cost, network-awareness, efficiency,
    scalability, robustness, and acquisition delay. S. Chieochan et al. [102] conducted
    survey on channel assignment schemes for infrastructure-based 802.11 WLANs. The
    authors classified the channel assignment schemes into two categories: (a) channel
    assignment schemes in centrally managed environment and (b) channel assignment
    schemes in uncoordinated environment. Moreover, the paper presents the comparison
    of channel assignment schemes based on the following parameters: (a) nature, (b)
    deployment, (c) channel type, (d) solving approach, (e) interference modeling
    perspective, and (f) scalability. Tragos et al. [103] present the most basic approaches
    for modeling the spectrum assignment problem and the state-of-the-art spectrum
    assignment algorithms in the CRNs. The research work highlights open issues and
    challenges within the domain. Nevertheless, the work only focuses on the channel
    selection criteria and fails to discuss the issues arising from the channel assignment
    on the whole network performance. Our survey investigates the state-of-the-art
    channel assignment algorithms designed for different types of CRNs based on basic
    channel assignment design issues, such as the stability and the connectivity that
    are inherited from the channel assignment algorithms in the wireless domain. Our
    work critically reviews the state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms in
    the CRNs. We classify existing channel assignment algorithms through a thematic
    taxonomy. The devised taxonomy will help the researchers of the domain to understand
    the problem clearly and to consider all of the significant aspects of channel
    assignment problem in the CRNs while designing channel assignment solutions. We
    also investigate the similarities and differences of such channel assignment algorithms
    by comparing them based on important parameters, such as design dependencies,
    channel models, assignment methods, execution models, solving approaches, synchronization
    requirements, and objectives of the algorithms. The comparison of the channel
    assignment algorithms will aid the network operators and deployment managers to
    select and employ the channel assignment algorithm that can meet their requirements
    in terms of application performance. We also identify open issues for future research
    and challenges that must be addressed to enable effective channel assignments
    in CRNs. SECTION IV. Taxonomy of Channel Assignment Algorithms in CRNs Fig. 2
    shows the thematic taxonomy of channel assignment algorithms. The algorithms are
    categorized based on the following characteristics: (a) coordination mechanisms,
    (b) objectives, (c) solving approaches, (d) network types, (e) number of radios,
    (f) PU characteristics, (g) routing dependencies, and (h) channel model. A. Coordination
    Mechanisms The coordination mechanism attribute classifies the channel assignment
    algorithms based on the coordination requirements and characteristics. The coordination
    mechanism is further classified into five categories: (a) channel assignment methods,
    (b) control channel scope, (c) algorithm execution model, (d) synchronization
    requirement, and (e) signaling. 1) Channel Assignment Methods The channel assignment
    method attribute shows the nature of channel-to-radio relationship over time.
    The channel assignment methods are of three types: static, dynamic, and hybrid.
    In a static channel assignment, an algorithm runs once at the start of network
    deployment; therefore, the channels are permanently assigned to the interfaces
    of the CRN nodes. In a dynamic channel assignment, an algorithm recomputes the
    channel assignments with changes in the network conditions and assigns the computed
    channels to the interfaces of the CRN nodes. In a hybrid channel assignment, channels
    are statically allocated to some interfaces of the CRN node and to the rest of
    the interfaces, the channels are assigned dynamically. 2) Control Channel Scope
    The control channel is required by some of the channel assignment algorithms for
    negotiating control information with neighboring nodes. The control channel scope
    attribute indicates the common availability of a control channel in a CRN. The
    scope of the control channel in a CRN is of two types, namely: local and global.
    The local control channel is available and common among the CR nodes in local
    proximity; whereas, the global control channel is common among all of the CR nodes
    in a CRN and is difficult to maintain. 3) Algorithm Execution Model The algorithm
    execution model represents how the channel assignment algorithm is executed within
    the CRN. The channel assignment algorithm can be executed in three different ways:
    (a) centralized, (b) distributed, and (c) decentralized. In a centralized channel
    assignment, computations are performed on the central server node by collecting
    channel information from all of the nodes within the network. The distributed
    channel assignment is performed locally at each of the node in a distributed manner
    using only the information of the neighboring nodes. In a decentralized channel
    assignment, the channel assignment is performed by more than one but not all of
    the nodes within the network. The nodes that perform channel assignment, collect
    information from other directly connected local nodes, and compute channels for
    the links. Adopting a decentralized approach eliminates the risk of a single point
    of failure in the centralized channel assignment and distributes the load of channel
    assignment among multiple nodes. 4) Synchronization Requirement The synchronization
    requirement attribute shows that the coordination of the channel switching mechanism
    is required between transmitters and receivers such that these nodes can simultaneously
    communicate on the same channel when the channels are assigned dynamically. 5)
    Signaling The signaling attribute represents the method by which the control and
    data signals use the channel. In the inband signaling, the control signals travel
    along with the data signals on the same channel; whereas, in the out-of-band signaling,
    the control and data signals travel on different channels. The inband signaling
    overloads the channel when large amounts of data are exchanged. On the other hand,
    the out-of-band signaling requires a dedicated radio for the control channel or
    a synchronization mechanism to tune the control channel on the transmitter and
    receiver before exchanging the control information. B. Objectives The objectives
    attribute indicates the primary objective of channel assignment in a CRN. Current
    channel assignment algorithms in CRNs aim to attain a number of objectives, such
    as utilization optimization, interference minimization, network overhead minimization,
    fairness optimization, residual energy maximization, throughput maximization,
    connectivity maximization, secondary revenue maximization, and reliability maximization.
    C. Solving Approaches The solving approach attribute represents the solving method
    for the channel assignment problem in the CRNs. The channel assignment solving
    approaches adopted by the state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms in the
    CRNs are game theory, linear programming (LP), non-linear programming (NLP), heuristics,
    and Markov Random Field. Game theory [105]– [114] is a mathematical framework
    that is widely used in various fields of research to model the cooperation and
    conflict between intelligent rational decision makers. In a CRN, the channel assignment
    problem is formulated using game theory. The objective of the game theory-based
    channel assignment algorithm is to find the pareto-optimal solution for the channel
    assignment problem. The LP is a technique for optimizing a linear objective function
    subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints. The problem formulation
    in LP is simple and easy. Current channel assignment algorithms in the CRNs employ
    binary linear programming (BLP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to
    formulate the problem. The BLP involves problems in which the variables are restricted
    to be either zero or one. The MILP involves problems in which only some of the
    variables are constrained to be integers. The NLP tends to solve the channel assignment
    optimization problem, which is defined by the constraints of equalities and inequalities
    with an objective function to be optimized, where the objective function or some
    of the constraints are non-linear. Heuristic is a technique designed to quickly
    solve a problem when existing methods are slow. However, the heuristic-based channel
    assignment does not guarantee the best of all the possible solutions. Heuristics
    can be classified into three types: native-, hyper-, and meta-heuristics. Native-heuristics
    are simple heuristics. Hyper-heuristic channel assignment represents a combination
    of several simple heuristics that are incorporated into machine learning techniques
    to optimally solve the computational channel assignment problem. Hyper-heuristic
    channel assignment directly deals with the heuristics search space instead of
    the problem search space with the objective of finding good heuristics for solving
    the channel assignment problem. The meta-heuristic channel assignment implements
    an iterative generation procedure that guides a subordinate heuristic by intelligently
    combining various concepts for exploring and exploiting the search space. The
    meta-heuristic channel assignment uses learning strategies to structure information
    to efficiently find near-optimal solutions. The meta-heuristic channel assignments
    are used in problems where the native-heuristics get stuck at the local minima.
    Moreover, meta-heuristics converge quickly towards the good solutions; thereby,
    providing an efficient way of solving large complicated channel assignment problems.
    The MRF-based channel assignment algorithms implement an undirected graph to describe
    a set of random variables with a Markov property. D. Network Types Channel assignment
    algorithms are also categorized based on the network type. Examples include: CRAHN,
    CRCN, CRSN, CWLAN, and CWMN. The specification, functional organization, and configuration
    of the physical elements vary for each type of network. The network type attribute
    shows the typical environment for the execution of channel assignment. The requirements
    of a channel assignment vary within each network type. E. Number of Radios Channel
    assignment algorithms are also categorized according to the number of radios supported
    by the CR nodes within the networks. The channel assignment algorithms in the
    CRNs are proposed for single-radio, dual-radio, and multi-radio nodes. The channel
    assignment for multi-radio nodes assigns orthogonal channels to the interfaces
    of the nodes to avoid adjacent channel interference and to perform parallel transmissions
    [115]. F. PU Characteristics The channel assignment algorithms in the CRNs can
    also be classified in terms of incorporating the PU activity characteristics for
    the channel selection. The existing channel assignment algorithms incorporate
    either the estimated ON-OFF duration or the PU activity status. G. Routing Dependencies
    The routing dependencies attribute indicates the dependency of channel assignment
    on other networking modules, such as routing. Channel assignment in the CRN can
    also be classified based on the routing dependencies into the following groups:
    independent and dependent channel assignment. H. Channel Model The channel model
    attribute represents the type of channels used to solve the channel assignment
    problem. The channel sets come in two types: orthogonal channels and overlapping
    channels [116]. The orthogonal channels do not interfere with one another, even
    if they are simultaneously active in the same coverage area; whereas, overlapping
    channels interfere with one another, if they are being simultaneously used in
    the same coverage area. SECTION V. State-of-the-Art Channel Assignment Algorithms
    in CRNs Current channel assignment algorithms in the CRNs employ various strategies
    to improve the network performance and to enhance the opportunistic usage of the
    licensed spectrum. This section presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art
    channel assignment algorithms in CRNs. We analyze the surveyed techniques by investigating
    the strengths and weaknesses of the channel assignment algorithms. We classify
    the survey of channel assignment algorithms based on the network type for which
    the algorithms are designed. Fig. 3. The CRAHN architecture. Show All 1) CRAHN
    The CRAHNs do not have an infrastructure backbone. A CR user within a CRAHN can
    communicate with other CR users in an ad-hoc manner on both unlicensed and licensed
    spectrum bands. The CR user can either be static or mobile to form a CRAHN. The
    channel assignment in the CRAHN aims to assign channels to the radio interfaces
    of the CR nodes to achieve efficient frequency utilization while minimizing the
    interference among the SUs and the interference to the PUs. The channel assignment
    is performed by the CR nodes that increases the operational load on the resource-constrained
    CR nodes. The CR nodes in the CRAHN are mostly battery powered and are mobile.
    Consequently, the channel assignment algorithms have some specific design requirements,
    such as fault tolerance and low operational overhead. Fig. 3 illustrates the architecture
    of the CRAHN where SU nodes form an ad-hoc network. Cross-layer design: A cross-layer
    routing metric called the minimum cumulative interference and channel switching
    delay (MISD) was proposed in [117]. The MISD incorporates cumulative intra/inter-flow
    interference and channel switching delay along a route to improve the CRAHN performance
    in terms of the end-to-end delay, throughput, and routing overhead. The metric
    assigns weights to the routes so that a route with the minimum interference and
    number of channel switches is chosen. The algorithm selects the next hop and the
    operating channel using a cross-layer design that incorporates the network, MAC
    link, and physical layers. The drawback of the MISD is that instead of the actual
    switching delay that is induced in the flow along the path, only the number of
    channel switches along the route are considered. Each of the channel switch is
    assumed to induce the same amount of delay into the end-to-end latency, which
    is unrealistic. Another drawback is that the channel switching is considered only
    at a node because of the dissimilar channels on the receiving and transmitting
    links. The worst impact is due to the channel switching triggered by the PU activity.
    The channel switching, initiated by the activity of the PU, may restart the channel
    assignment and the routing process; thereby, inducing further delays. The channel
    switching initiated by the PUs can be alleviated by incorporating the PU activity
    ratio on the available channels in the channel selection process. Access contention
    resolution: Overlapping and non-overlapping channel assignment algorithms are
    employed in [116] to maximize the throughput within the CRAHN. In the non-overlapping
    channel assignment algorithm, a distinct set of channels is assigned to the SUs.
    The algorithm attains the maximum throughput limit, if the number of non-overlapping
    channels is sufficiently large. The greedy channel assignment algorithm allocates
    channels to the SUs in an iterative manner that attains the maximum increase in
    the throughput. In each iteration of the channel assignment algorithm, the SU
    calculates the increase in the throughput for the best available channel. In the
    overlapping channel assignment, the non-overlapping channel assignment is first
    performed; thereafter, the overlapping channel assignment is performed by assigning
    previously allocated channels to the remaining SUs in the CRAHN. The algorithm
    fails to incorporate the PU activity that causes the frequent channel switching
    at the SU. Moreover, the interface limitation and dynamic nature impose a strict
    restriction on the SUs; thereby, reducing the throughput of the CRAHN. Resource-minimized
    CA (RMCA): The RMCA [118] is designed for multi-radio CRAHNs that aims to maximize
    the flow rate and to support baseline network connectivity. The authors present
    two forms of the RMCA algorithm, centralized and distributed. The channel assignment
    problem is formulated as a two-stage MILP: traffic independent and traffic-driven.
    The traffic independent channel assignment aims to assign as few number of interfaces
    as possible to attain the baseline network connectivity. By utilizing the fewer
    number of interfaces, the network can better adapt to more traffic demands in
    the later traffic-driven channel assignment stage. The traffic-driven stage assigns
    the channel to the interfaces not assigned in the traffic independent stage. The
    traffic-driven stage aims to optimally adapt the network to the traffic demands.
    Moreover, the RMCA does not incorporate the history of the PU activity; thereby,
    causing channel switching and possibly triggering a new channel assignment process.
    Furthermore, the RMCA is vulnerable to the channel oscillation and the ripple
    effect problems because of the dependencies on the traffic load. Throughput-oriented
    CA: A joint rate control and channel assignment scheme for multi-user single transceiver
    CRAHNs was presented in [42]. The framework optimally selects the channel to maximize
    the sum of the rates of all of the CR transmissions across all of the channels
    at a given time subject to the SINR and interference constraints. The maximum
    rate single transceiver problem was originally formulated as a mixed integer non-linear
    programming (MINLP) problem that belongs to a class of NP-hard problems [119],
    [120]. The MINLP can be transformed into a uni-modular BLP problem that can be
    solved in polynomial time [121]. The complex optimization-based channel assignment
    solution consumes additional time to run in highly dynamic conditions where the
    PU activity is higher. Moreover, the procedure does not consider the history of
    the PU activity on a channel to avoid the frequent channel switching that degrades
    the CRAHN throughput and increases the end-to-end latency. Segment-based CA: A
    joint channel assignment, segment formation, and route discovery algorithm for
    single radio interface CRAHNs was proposed in [122]. The channel assignment was
    performed at the granularity of segments that are formed by the nodes with the
    same set of common channels. The algorithm copes with the spectrum variability
    problem by providing adaptive segment maintenance solutions, such as segment splitting
    and segment merging. Although the channel assignment algorithm improves throughput,
    the nodes must exchange control information with one another to maintain the segments.
    Moreover, the nodes require an initial handshake to determine the configuration
    information of the other nodes. Such discussion is not present in the framework.
    The work also does not incorporate the PU history to avoid frequent channel switching
    in the CRAHNs. Distance- and traffic-aware CA: A distance dependent MAC protocol
    (DDMAC) to maximize the number of simultaneous transmissions and the network throughput
    was reported in [34]. The DDMAC integrates a suboptimal probabilistic channel
    assignment algorithm that utilizes the dependencies between the transmission distance
    and the signal''s attenuation model from the traffic profile. The DDMAC considers
    the power constraints and interference conditions at various licensed bands. The
    DDMAC also incorporates both the average joint SINR of a channel and the transmission
    distance during channel assignment. Two channel assignment variants are proposed
    for the static networks with known traffic patterns and for dynamic networks with
    unknown traffic patterns. The channel assignment is only based on the estimated
    distance and traffic load between the transmitter and the receiver, and does not
    consider the PU''s history for selection. The DDMAC is also vulnerable to the
    ripple effect and the channel oscillation problems because of the dependencies
    on the traffic load. Moreover, the DDMAC includes the SINR value as a channel
    selection parameter that only represents the interference caused by the primary
    transmitter and does not cover the primary receiver state. Centralized and distributed
    CA: Ser et al. [123] present the centralized and distributed channel assignment
    algorithms based on the harmony search (HS) to cater to the interference level
    among nodes for optimized network performance. The centralized channel assignment
    involves the basic HS procedures, namely: a) initialization, b) improvisation,
    and c) evaluation. The distributed channel assignment assumes that all of the
    nodes have perfect priori knowledge of the network parameters and can separately
    run the HS instances. The HS approach requires appropriate initialization values.
    Aside from the above mentioned issue, the algorithm fails to consider the PU activity
    for the available primary channels selection. Moreover, the complexity of the
    algorithm is too high to converge quickly in a highly dynamic CRAHN. The algorithm
    is developed for single radio multiple channels where channel coordination among
    the nodes is required to avoid the multi-channel hidden node problem. However,
    the channel coordination that solves the multi-channel hidden node and node deafness
    problems is not addressed. The proposed distributed algorithm also suffers from
    the ripple effect of the channel assignment because of the incorporation of the
    interference level parameter value that changes with the number of active channels
    and traffic load. MRF-based CA: Anifantis et al. [124] apply the theory of Markov
    Random Fields (MRFs) and Gibbs sampling to provide distributed and adaptable radio
    channel allocation. The aim of the approach is to maximize the spectrum utilization
    by minimizing the probability of collisions because of simultaneous transmissions
    between the neighboring SUs. The distance traversed by the control messages is
    reduced to a single hop within the neighborhood. The parallel nature of the Gibbs
    sampler and the theory of MRFs facilitates the quick convergence to the global
    minimizers by leveraging only on the local information. However, the algorithm
    ignores the history of the PU activity to avoid the frequent channel switching.
    Aside from the aforementioned issue, the MRF-based framework is a compute-intensive
    solution that converges slowly in highly dynamic CRAHNs. Consequently, the performance
    of the CRAHN is degraded. Spectrum-aware CA: A distributed spectrum-aware dynamic
    channel assignment scheme [35] for the multi-radio multi-channel CRAHNs is proposed
    to optimize the conflicting objectives of maximizing connectivity and minimizing
    interference. First, the CR nodes find the set of available channels and then
    calculate the corresponding quality. The conflict arises as the connectivity is
    maximized by assigning the common channel among a large set of neighboring nodes
    while the interference is minimized by assigning a common channel to a small set
    of neighboring nodes. After the quality calculation, the CR nodes assign the best
    channel to the first interface and the second best channel to the second interface.
    However, the algorithm suffers from the ripple effect caused by the channel assignment
    of one of the nodes. Moreover, the proposed algorithm does not incorporate the
    PU activity to avoid the frequent channel switching. Robust interference minimizing
    channel assignment (RIMCA): The RIMCA [125] is proposed to utilize the multiple
    available channels and to minimize the interference among the SUs and the interference
    to the PUs. The SUs perform the channel selection considering the available local
    information obtained from either sensing or from the neighboring nodes. The only
    additional information required is the location of the PUs and SUs. The SUs compute
    the interference value at the PUs and SUs based on the location of the PUs and
    SUs, respectively. Each of the SU first selects the best quality channel that
    minimizes the total interference in the CRAHN. If the total interference at the
    location of the PU on the concerned channel is low, then the SU assigns the channel
    to one of the interfaces. The secondary nodes require the location of the PUs
    that imposes extra overhead. The exact interference at the PU cannot be estimated
    because the interference is the sum of interferences from different SUs around
    the concerned PU. Moreover, the proposed channel assignment scheme focuses on
    reducing only the channel switching time and not the frequency of channel switching,
    which is most important in avoiding frequent channel switching. Ant colony optimization
    (ACO)-based CA: He et al. [126] present a dynamic channel assignment algorithm
    that offers optimal resource allocation mechanism to satisfy the requirements
    of users and networks. The proposed solution employs the ACO-based algorithm to
    dynamically manage and assign channel resources. Although the proposed algorithm
    incorporates the interference to PUs and the interference among SUs, the algorithm
    does not focus on incorporating the pattern of PU activity to avoid those channels
    that are highly susceptible to PU activity. The algorithm also does not ensure
    the connectivity within the network. Effective CA: Wu et al. [127] propose three
    localized channel assignment algorithms to maximize the node connectivity. The
    first algorithm is a basic algorithm that only uses the available channel information
    on a node to select channels for the adjacent links. As no coordination exists
    between the two nodes of a link, the algorithm efficiency is low. To cope with
    the inefficiency of the node-based algorithm, a link-based algorithm is proposed
    to establish a coordination between the end nodes of a link. The algorithm reduces
    the number of rounds for a complete channel assignment on the links by establishing
    a coordination between the end nodes of each link. The link-based algorithm does
    not consider the priority of links, making it relatively a less efficient solution.
    Another node-link based selection algorithm is proposed, in which the algorithm
    applies the maximal matching, and exploits the priorities of links to deal with
    the inefficiencies of the counterpart. Although the node-link based algorithm
    outperforms its counterparts, the complexities involved in the maximal graph matching
    can worsen the channel assignment in highly dynamic CRAHNs. The algorithm does
    not consider the pattern of the PU activity; thereby, giving rise to frequent
    channel switching. Dynamic source routing: Dai et al. [128] propose a channel
    assignment algorithm for the CRAHNs based on the SINR. The channel is selected
    based on the SINR values and is then assigned to the communicating nodes. Dynamic
    source routing is performed along with channel assignment. The source node estimates
    the SINR of a node on a certain channel by using the information collected in
    a route reply message of the destination node. The drawback of the proposed solution
    is that the channel assignment is based on the SINR, which is a dynamic parameter
    and only captures the characteristics of received signals. The SUs also use the
    assigned channels to transmit data, which may interfere with PUs whose presence
    is inaccurately captured by the SINR value on a particular channel. The SINR value
    varies with the change in distance of the interferer. Therefore, the PUs close
    to the SUs can be approximated by the SUs'' SINR value on that channel. However,
    the same cannot be achieved for the distant PUs. The proposed channel assignment
    algorithm also does not incorporate the estimated pattern of the PU activity to
    avoid the frequent channel switching. Risk-based CA: With the objective of minimizing
    the overall risk, Li et al. [44] propose a heuristic to assign the channels in
    the licensed spectrum band to different cut sets in the parallel series system.
    Each cut set represents the SU. The algorithm is implemented in both single path
    and multiple path situations by adopting the concept of cut set hazard. The algorithm
    is also extended to the decentralized channel assignment scenario. The algorithm
    considers channel reuse that incurs the correlation of failures in a CRAHN system.
    In [44], the backup channels are set up in the frequency spectrum because the
    links among the SUs are unreliable as a result of the PU activities. The affected
    SUs scan for another idle channel for the transmission whenever the PUs emerge.
    However, such an approach may incur significant overhead because finding a new
    idle channel for backup is time consuming. Although the authors propose a protection
    mechanism at the link layer for CRAHNs, the implementation of the network model
    is specific. Moreover, the reliability metrics, such as availability, blocking
    probability, mean time to failure, and mean time to repair are not analyzed. The
    authors use the steady-state probability of channel availability instead of considering
    the transition probabilities during the analysis. Joint power CA: A game theoretic
    solution for the end-to-end flow allocation with joint channel and power assignment
    in multi-hop CRAHNs under the physical interference model is presented in [129].
    The work aims to model the competing flow behavior using game theory and to subsequently
    provide strategies that maximize the utility function. The utility function covers
    the aggregate capacity of the active flows or the number of active flows. Three
    different games are proposed for the joint channel and power allocation. Two of
    the games result in high computation and communication overhead because the flows
    are modelled as players. The third game is less complex than the flow-based games
    because the individual link of each of the flows are modelled as a player. These
    games do not incorporate the PU history that is necessary to avoid frequent channel
    switching in highly dynamic CRAHNs. Moreover, structuring the game such that an
    equilibrium is always reachable is difficult. Genetic algorithm-based CA: Ye et
    al. [130] present a spectrum allocation model for the CRAHNs based on the genetic
    algorithm, as well as an analysis of sum-bandwidth performance using the max-sum-bandwidth
    rule for spectrum allocation. A significant effort is put to the interference
    restrictions in channel assignment. The population is composed of sets of feasible
    and infeasible assignments. Meanwhile, a penalty function is added to the fitness
    function to punish the chromosomes that do not satisfy the interference restrictions.
    The model can handle arbitrary constraints and objectives while discarding the
    bad proposals. Nevertheless, identifying an optimal solution is relatively time
    consuming, and the risk of finding local minimals is possible. Moreover, the proposed
    spectrum allocation model also does not consider the fairness of the user access.
    Maximum flow segment-based CA: A new maximum flow segment (MFS)-based algorithm
    for channel assignment in the CRAHNs is proposed in [131]. The channel assignment
    algorithm aims to reduce the number of channel switches along a route. The routing
    metric selects a set of common channels that can cover the maximum number of SUs
    along a route that reduces the number of channel switches required to transmit
    a packet along the route. The algorithm attains a low end-to-end delay, high throughput,
    and high route robustness. Nevertheless, a minimum channel switching is guaranteed
    for sub-routes between adjacent decision nodes. A decision node is responsible
    for identifying the MFS and assigning the channel for the downstream route. However,
    the algorithm is not aimed at achieving optimal performance in terms of the frequency
    of channel switching when considering the whole map. For example, a combination
    of second-best sub-route decisions may collectively lead to a satisfactory reduction
    of frequency hopping. Moreover, the proposed algorithm does not incorporate the
    history of the PU activity; thereby, causing channel switching and possibly triggering
    a new channel assignment process. Path-centric CA: A path-centric channel assignment
    algorithm for the CRAHNs is proposed in [132]. The proposed algorithm takes a
    different perspective from the traditional channel assignment algorithms in multi-channel
    wireless networks, by integrating the routing and channel assignments. The proposed
    solution determines the channel assignment for each node jointly with routing
    to achieve globally optimized performance instead of focusing on the local node
    with non-coordinated channel assignment. The algorithm does not incorporate the
    history of the PU activity during channel selection that results in the selection
    of short time spectrum opportunities. The selection of such opportunities increases
    the channel switching frequency. The algorithm is also slow to converge in a highly
    dynamic PU environment. Moreover, the algorithm does not offer protective measures
    against the ripple effect of channel assignment within the network. Probabilistic
    CA: Salameh et al. [133] present a multi-channel parallel transmission algorithm
    for channel assignment for the CRAHNs. The algorithm incorporates the durations
    of the available primary channels and the randomness of link qualities to provide
    a statistical performance guarantee for the SUs. Moreover, the algorithm also
    considers the residual idle duration of the available channels in the channel
    selection process, which improves the spectrum utilization, saves energy, and
    reduces the number of channel switches. The channel assignment problem is formulated
    as a BLP that is complex in nature and results in high time complexity. In highly
    dynamic CRAHNs, the algorithm does not converge quickly in response to the PU
    activity. Receiver-centric CA: A receiver-centric channel allocation model is
    proposed in [33] for the CRAHNs. The proposed model more accurately formulates
    the co-channel interference constraint in the CRAHNs compared to the traditional
    transmitter-centric model. Liu et al. [33] extend the traditional graph-theoretic
    and game-theoretic channel assignment algorithms in CRAHNs to the receiver-centric
    model with some important modifications. The extended game-theoretic algorithm
    is well-suited to the cognitive channel assignment problem because the decision
    of a SU regarding the spectrum selection directly affects the performance of the
    neighboring SUs. The proposed channel assignment solution does not incorporate
    the pattern of the PU activity in channel selection that is necessary to avoid
    the frequent channel switching. Cross-layer channel assignment and routing (CCAR):
    CCAR [134] aims to maximize the global throughput in the CRAHNs. The aim is attained
    by finding the maximum bottleneck link capacity along the route. The authors formulate
    the problem as MILP problem. An edge graph-based heuristic algorithm is proposed
    to solve the formulated problem. To simplify the formulated problem, rules are
    defined based on real-network. The defined rules ensure that only one path exists
    between source and destination node. Thereafter, interference is estimated that
    is introduced because of the formed routing paths. The estimated interference
    is used to select the channel for a given link along the route. The dependency
    of the channel assignment on the routing increases the complexity. Hence, the
    algorithm does not converge quickly in response to changes in the CRAHN. Joint
    link & CA routing optimization A joint link and channel assignment routing optimization
    scheme [135] aims to find the near-optimal route. The authors propose an interference-impact
    metric to compute the impact of a route interference on the adjacent routes. The
    routing problem is formulated as an integer non-linear programming problem. The
    formulation of the problem captures the route reliability and path stability.
    The optimization problem aims to minimize the interference impact-ratio while
    ensuring the throughput guarantees and route reliability. The joint link and channel
    assignment routing optimization is a two-step process that finds the near optimal
    solutions of the problem. In the first step, on-demand route discovery is used
    with removal of weak routes to find the reliable candidate paths. In the second
    step, a joint channel assignment and routing algorithm with sequentially-connected-link
    coordination is used to form the route. The proposed scheme fails to incorporate
    the history of the PU activity during channel selection that results in the selection
    of short span spectrum opportunities. The selection of such short span spectrum
    opportunities increases the channel switching frequency. Moreover, the complex
    joint link and channel assignment routing scheme converges slowly in a highly
    dynamic PU environment. Cross-layer optimization framework: The cross-layer optimization
    framework [136] incorporates the SINR constraints with channel assignment and
    routing. The optimization problem is formulated as MINLP problem with the aim
    to maximize the minimum throughput of flow. To solve this MINLP problem, an heuristic
    algorithm is proposed that relaxes the original problem, performs rounding, and
    then optimizes throughput. The proposed framework finds multiple paths for each
    traffic flow. The cross layered framework considers two type of interference constraints:
    primary interference constraints and secondary interference constraints. The primary
    interference constraints ensure that links sharing a common node cannot transmit
    or receive simultaneously on a channel. The secondary interference constraints
    ensure that a transmission is successful if and only if SINR on the receiver side
    is greater than minimum required threshold. The proposed cross-layer optimization
    framework does not incorporate history of PU activity in the channel selection
    that may results in frequent channel switching because of the selection of short
    span spectrum opportunities. Transmission opportunity-based CA: An economic-robust
    transmission opportunity-based auction scheme [137] is proposed for multi-hop
    CRNs. The authors have considered a spectrum trading market where PU is an auctioneer
    that leases its idle licensed spectrum bands to SUs. The SUs submit their bids
    for transmission spectrum opportunities to auctioneer. The auctioneer allocates
    the idle spectrum to winning SUs. The transmission opportunity auction process
    comprises of three procedures: transmission opportunities allocation, transmission
    opportunities scheduling, and pricing. These procedures are performed iteratively
    and sequentially until all SUs requirements are fulfilled. In transmission opportunities
    allocation, auctioneer runs the transmission allocation optimization algorithm
    to compute the link-band pairs that can be simultaneously active and give highest
    total bid. In transmission opportunities scheduling, the minimum length scheduling
    problem is formulated. Finally, the auctioneer computes the price for each SU
    and its own revenue. The transmission opportunity-based auction scheme does not
    consider the pattern of the PU activity; thereby, giving rise to frequent channel
    switching. Fig. 4. The CRCN architecture. Show All 2) CRCN The CRCN is a centralized,
    infrastructure-based cognitive wireless network where a CR base station is responsible
    for assigning channels and controlling the communication among the SUs. The spectrum
    sensing is performed either by a CR base station or by both base station and terminal
    secondary nodes in a cooperative manner to detect the PUs. Fig. 4 illustrates
    the architecture of the CRCN. The CR base station has multiple available channels
    that belong to licensed band 1, licensed band 2, and unlicensed band. QoS-aware
    CA: Xin and Xiang [57] formulate a joint QoS-aware admission control, channel
    assignment, and power allocation scheme as a non-linear optimization problem.
    A network operator can attain different secondary revenues by providing various
    QoS levels to the SUs based on the requirements. The objective is to maximize
    the total secondary revenue of the CRCNs while guaranteeing the QoS requirements
    for both the PUs and SUs. However, the aforementioned problem is NP-hard that
    requires a fair amount of time to calculate. Therefore, the optimization approach
    is difficult to implement in an actual channel assignment problem because of the
    high construction cost and the joint complexity of admission control, channel
    assignment, and power allocation. The algorithm is based on the SINR value that
    is highly dynamic and is difficult to exchange in real-time. In addition, the
    proposed scheme only considers the single-hop scenario that is a relatively simple
    scenario. Downlink CA: Hoang et al. [138] propose a downlink channel assignment
    and power control algorithm to maximize the spectrum utilization in the CRCNs,
    which employs an opportunistic spectrum access and proposes a scalable two-phase
    channel/power allocation scheme. An interference graph is introduced to solve
    the MILP problem by assuming that each of the subscriber of the cognitive network
    can either be active or idle. Only the active subscribers require the downlink
    transmission. The radio frequency spectrum is divided into a set of multiple orthogonal
    channels and is shared between the primary and secondary networks using the orthogonal
    frequency division multiple access. A dynamic interference graph allocation is
    proposed, in which a channel is allocated to one SU at a time until either all
    of the SUs are served or a feasible assignment is no longer possible. However,
    the approach requires a high signaling level that consumes a significant portion
    of available network resources. The joint channel assignment and power control
    algorithm is so complex that it converges slowly in a highly dynamic CRCN channel
    assignment. Moreover, the algorithm does not incorporate the history of the PU
    activity to avoid the selection of a communication channel with a high PU activity.
    CA for cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS): A centralized algorithm is presented
    in [43] for the channel assignment of cooperative spectrum sensing among the SUs
    to increase the number of available channels that satisfies the sensing performance
    requirement. The algorithm is based on the information from each of the SUs, including
    the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) over all of the primary channels. Thereafter,
    a greedy algorithm is employed to reduce the reporting information from the SUs
    to the base station. The algorithm takes communication overhead into the account.
    However, the SNR is not a good metric for the channel selection because it is
    highly dynamic, and the proposed scheme suffers from the overhead resulting from
    the frequent exchange of the SNR. Moreover, the algorithm does not incorporate
    the history of PU activity in channel selection. Furthermore, the algorithm does
    not consider the different requirements of the SUs. 3) CRSN In the CRSNs, the
    sensor nodes are equipped with CR that can adopt communication parameters, such
    as transmission power, carrier frequency, and modulation. However, the CR sensor
    nodes have inherited the constraints of conventional sensor nodes, such as the
    limitations on power, communication, processing, and memory resources, that limit
    the benefits of leveraging the CR technology. The CRSNs exhibit different network
    topologies depending on the application requirements, such as ad-hoc CRSN, clustered
    CRSN, heterogeneous and hierarchical CRSN, and mobile CRSN. The channel assignment
    in the CRSNs aims to assign channels to the radio interfaces of the CR sensor
    nodes to attain efficient frequency utilization while minimizing the interference
    among the CR sensor nodes and the interference to the PUs. Moreover, the channel
    assignment in CRSNs incorporates the residual energy of nodes to increase the
    lifetime of CRSNs. Fig. 5 illustrates the architecture of the CRSN, which shows
    the channel assignment in the CRSN. Residual energy-aware CA: An energy efficient
    channel assignment for a cluster-based multi-channel CRSNs is presented in [139].
    First, a cluster head (CH) selects and pairs each sensor node and channel with
    uniform probability. Thereafter, a greedy channel search employs the predicted
    residual energy (R-coefficient) that is determined by the PU behavior and sensor
    energy information for optimization. The objective is to maximize the sum of the
    R-coefficients. However, the algorithm does not ensure network connectivity that
    is essential in the sensor networks. Moreover, the CH selection is an energy-
    and a time-consuming task. The intra-cluster channel assignment does not consider
    the interference caused by the active links of neighboring clusters. A detailed
    coordination of channel switching among the communicating peers is necessary to
    ensure that these communications peers are on the same channel at the same time.
    The CH selection also entails a high centralization overhead and a single point
    of failure. Moreover, the channel selection does not consider the estimated PU
    activity ratio during the channel assignment process. Dynamic CA: A dynamic channel
    assignment and routing (DCAR) framework for maintaining efficient and reliably
    connected topology for each of the channel is proposed in [140]. The authors consider
    network connectivity and the PU channel utilization in a distributed manner. The
    approach enables fast data collection and dissemination with short delay and high
    reliability while mitigating interference to the PUs. The DCAR framework does
    not incorporate the estimated PU activity ratio because of that the CR nodes suffer
    from frequent channel switching. The framework also requires a strict synchronization
    mechanism to sustain communication. The framework must also be incorporated with
    energy related parameters to mitigate the problem of battery limitations. Fig.
    5. The CRSN architecture. Show All Fig. 6. The CWLAN architecture. Show All 4)
    CWLAN The CWLANs consist of a CR access point that can operate in licensed and
    unlicensed bands. The CWLAN standard IEEE 802.11af that is also known as “Super
    Wi-Fi,” “WhiteFi,” or “Super” is currently being developed [141]. The CWLAN consists
    of an IEEE 802.11af access point, a registered location secure server, and client
    stations. The channel assignment in CWLANs is performed by the access point in
    a centralized manner. Fig. 6 shows the architecture of the CWLAN. The CR access
    point has multiple available spectrum bands that are used to communicate with
    the CR nodes. Cognitive dynamic fair CA: A channel assignment proposed in [142]
    is based on the analysis of the IEEE 802.11 traffic load on different channels.
    All of the available channels are being monitored by a device during the test
    phase. Thereafter, a particular channel is chosen based on observations of traffic
    and channel type; however, the non-overlapping channels are preferred. The proposed
    channel assignment selects the best available channel to improve the performance
    of the system that includes not only a single access point but also the neighboring
    networks. The drawback of the proposed channel assignment solution is that the
    channel interference is incorporated from all of the neighboring networks during
    channel selection; however, the solution does not incorporate the PU activity
    on the channel. Consequently, such channel selection results in frequent channel
    switching that reduces the network throughput. Q-learning-based CA: A dynamic
    channel assignment algorithm with fiber-connected distributed antennas is proposed
    in [56]. The cognitive access points find and assign the best channels to minimize
    the external interference and improve the network-wide performance. The proposed
    framework integrates the back-propagation with the Q-learning algorithm by replacing
    a lookup table with a multilayer feed-forward neural network. The neural network
    consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The limiting
    factor of the proposed solution is that it does not incorporate the history of
    the PU activity during channel selection. Each of the CR node must exchange information
    on the available channels with the access point; thereby, increasing the communication
    overhead. Fig. 7. The CWMN architecture. Show All 5) CWMN Similar to the conventional
    wireless mesh networks, the CWMNs can dynamically self-organize and self-configure
    by incorporating nodes that can automatically establish and maintain mesh connectivity.
    However, the CR mesh nodes including both the CR mesh client and CR mesh router,
    which can also search for, share, and operate available licensed spectrum to improve
    the network performance. Channel assignment in the CWMNs aims to assign the available
    channels to the radio interfaces of the CR nodes to efficiently utilize the spectrum
    while minimizing the interference among the SUs and the interference to the PUs.
    The CR mesh nodes can have multiple radios so that the channel assignment can
    leverage the availability by assigning orthogonal channels on the interfaces of
    a CR mesh node to improve the network performance. The CWMNs differ from other
    CRNs, in which the CR nodes are connected to more than one node to form the mesh.
    The high degree of connectivity increases the interference in the networks, requiring
    channel assignment in the CWMNs to balance the trade-off. Fig. 7 illustrates the
    architecture of the CWMN. Cognitive spectrum assignment protocol (CoSAP): A distributed,
    cognitive, and localized channel assignment protocol called the CoSAP is presented
    in [143]. The CoSAP can be used to enhance the network capacity in a cognitive
    network environment by exploiting the available spectrum opportunities. The protocol
    incorporates the interference effect by assigning weights to the edges of the
    distributed conflict graph. The weights are assigned based on the extent of the
    interference calculated from the physical interference model. Moreover, the CoSAP
    decouples the channel assignment from the traffic load and can easily take the
    services of the existing routing and MAC protocols for the wireless mesh networks.
    However, the CoSAP cannot ensure connectivity with the underlying network topology
    and traffic load assumptions. Moreover, the CoSAP does not incorporate the PU
    activity and suffers from frequent channel switching. The algorithm also converges
    slowly because of the multiple tasks that must be performed at each node. These
    tasks include the collection of the m -hop channel information from the 1-hop
    neighbors, selection of channels considering the collected m -hop information,
    and updating the 1-hop neighbors about the local channels. Route tree-based CA:
    A tree-based algorithm with channel selection mechanism that uses statistic-based
    metric and eliminates the need for a common control channel is presented in [144].
    The metric assigns priorities to the channels based on the number of SUs already
    allocated to these channels. Subsequently, the channel selection is performed
    based on the channel priority to minimize the interference to other SUs. A high
    priority indicates a low number of SUs using a particular channel. The algorithm
    increases the throughput by achieving the load balancing among the available channels
    at different SUs. The approach increases the number of simultaneous transmissions
    in multiple channels. The tree-based algorithm requires a tree construction and
    maintenance for the communications. The limiting factor of the algorithm is that
    the channel selection only focuses on avoiding the over allocation among the neighboring
    SUs. The pattern of the PU activity on the channel is not considered in the channel
    selection, resulting in frequent route breakage in areas with high PU activity.
    The algorithm integrates the route discovery with the channel decision that increases
    the complexity of the channel selection. CA and Routing: A two-step joint channel
    assignment and routing update algorithm for the CWMNs to reduce the signaling
    overhead was proposed in [145]. Each of the CR node, first, attempts to perform
    a simple recovery algorithm without exchanging the control information in a distributed
    fashion when the PU tries to access the channel. Only when the recovery fails,
    then the CWMN re-optimizes the channel assignment and routing. The algorithm maximizes
    the spectrum utilization and reduces the number of channel switching by considering
    the pattern of the PU activity on a channel. However, the proposed solution only
    incorporates the pattern of the PU activity in a channel selection. The solution
    neither ensures the connectivity nor reduces the interference among the SUs. Given
    the involvement of the two sequential phases in route recovery, additional time
    is consumed to perform the channel assignment and routing in case of route recovery
    failure. Urban-X: Kim et al. [32] propose Urban-X, which is an architecture that
    incorporates the channel and residential traffic state of external users to maximize
    the network throughput. In the Urban-X, the channel assignment is decided by considering
    the external interference, in addition to the number of flows at each of the node.
    The Urban-X uses the PU activities and workload as important parameters in the
    channel assignment algorithm. The workload also needs to be monitored along with
    the PU activity detection and measurement. However, the framework requires a relatively
    long sensing period to achieve an accurate estimation. The workload in the CWMN
    is highly dynamic; thereby, making the workload estimation a complex task in real
    network scenarios. The average delay in the Urban-X is relatively high because
    the architecture keeps each radio on each of the channel for a predefined period
    of time, even when there is no data to be sent. Therefore, the Urban-X faces a
    considerable delay resulting from the data waiting in the queues of the other
    channels. Channel assignment with route discovery (CARD): The CARD is employed
    to deal with the application of the cognitive mesh routers for a fixed channel
    assignment to mesh clients under each of the router''s domain [31]. The channel
    selection reduces the intra-hop and inter-hop interference by assigning channels
    for the channel request on the same hop from different sub-bands. A modified form
    of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm is employed to perform the channel assignment
    and routing in the CWMNs. The utility function for the terminal nodes is calculated
    by a parent. The function is the ratio of the total number of packets at the parent
    node to the number of packets for a specific terminal node. The alpha-beta pruning
    algorithm is also modified to support multiple radios. The alpha-beta pruning
    requires all of the paths to have an equal fixed depth that restricts the use
    of the algorithm in specific scenarios. The proposed channel assignment algorithm
    does not incorporate the PU activity in channel selection, which may result in
    frequent channel switching. Uplink CA: An uplink channel allocation scheme for
    single-cell CWMNs is presented in [146] to minimize the network setup time, which
    is based on the overhead time incurred on the channel assignment at the mesh routers.
    The channel assignment scheme is based on the physical layer network coding (PNC)
    that allows two SUs to synchronously transmit over a single channel. The scheme
    also does not require coordination among the requesting channels. A drawback of
    the proposed solution is that the channel assignment is performed by a central
    entity that requires information related to the available channels on all of the
    SUs in a CWMN, which results in a huge amount of control information exchange.
    Moreover, the perfect synchronization and high transmission power in the PNC is
    undesirable. The proposed algorithm also does not incorporate the history of the
    PU activity; thereby, causing channel switching and possibly triggering a new
    channel assignment process. ZAP: The ZAP is a simple, adaptive, and distributed
    channel assignment algorithm that incurs low communication overhead [147]. The
    ZAP requires a common control channel to eliminate the contention for the channel
    access between the control and data messages. The operations of the ZAP protocol
    involves topology management, local assignment, an interaction mechanism, and
    a scheduler. The topology management deals with the topology-related information,
    such as network and conflict graphs. The local assignment computes the initial
    channel assignment based on the local knowledge of the node. The interaction mechanism
    merges the channel assignment suggested by different nodes. The scheduler handles
    the control switching among the states based on the internal and external stimuli
    to the node. The ZAP computes the suboptimal solution for channel assignment using
    the native-heuristics. Moreover, the ZAP does not incorporate the estimated pattern
    of the PU activity on the available channels during the channel selection. Unified
    CA: A dynamic and distributed unified channel assignment algorithm is proposed
    in [148] to maintain the fairness between the unicast and broadcast traffic by
    incorporating the connectivity and interference parameters. The performance of
    the unicast traffic is optimized when the number of neighboring nodes using a
    particular channel is minimum; whereas, the broadcast traffic attains an optimal
    performance when the number of neighboring nodes on the same channel is maximum.
    A weight is associated with each type of parameter to represent the traffic ratio.
    A heavy unicast traffic in the network indicates that higher weight is given to
    the interference parameter and vice versa. The proposed solution does not incorporate
    the history of the PU activity in its channel selection criteria that fails to
    avoid the frequent channel switching. The algorithm''s performance suffers because
    of the changes in the channel assignment resulting from the rapid fluctuation
    in both types of traffic. We have identified the characteristics of the state-of-the-art
    channel assignment algorithms in the CRNs based on the comprehensive survey discussed
    above. We classify these algorithms according to the characteristics that we have
    identified. The thematic taxonomy developed from the comprehensive survey is presented
    in the next section. SECTION VI. Comparison of Channel Assignment Algorithms in
    CRNs This section presents the comparison of channel assignment algorithms in
    CRNs. The comparison is based on thematic taxonomy presented in Section IV. The
    comparison of the channel assignment algorithms can be classified into three different
    categories: a) channel selection characteristics and requirement-based comparison,
    b) general comparison, and c) channel assignment objective-based comparison. Table III
    Comparison of Channel Assignment Algorithms Based on the Channel Selection Characteristics
    and Requirements A. Channel Selection Characteristics and Requirement-Based Comparison
    Table III shows comparison of the channel assignment algorithms based on the channel
    selection characteristics and requirements. The parameters used for this comparison
    are: a) assignment method, b) synchronization requirement, c) channel model, d)
    PU characteristics, e) signaling type, and f) control channel scope. The algorithms
    proposed in [31], [144] statically assign channels to the interfaces of CR nodes;
    whereas, the channel assignment algorithms presented in [33]– [35], [42]– [44],
    [56], [57], [116]– [118], [122]– [140], [142], [143], [145]– [148] assign the
    channels dynamically and recompute the channel assignment according to the changes
    in the network conditions. However, the algorithm discussed in [32] follows the
    hybrid approach, wherein the static channels are allocated to some of the interfaces
    of the CRN node and the channels are dynamically assigned to rest of the interface
    channels. On the one hand, static channel assignments are relatively easy to deploy
    but are incapable of dealing with the wide variation within the wireless environment.
    On the other hand, dynamic channel assignments necessitate nodes to switch the
    corresponding interfaces dynamically from one channel to another when the network
    condition changes. Nevertheless, hybrid channel assignments can adapt quickly
    to the changes within the traffic pattern, as well as to the interferences on
    the wireless medium from both internal and external sources. The channel assignment
    algorithms also differ from the rest of the channel assignment algorithms in CRNs
    in terms of synchronization requirements. The channel assignment algorithms presented
    in [32]– [35], [42]– [44], [56], [57], [116]– [118], [122]– [140], [142], [143],
    [145]– [148] require synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver
    to properly receive the messages because of dynamically changing channels; whereas,
    the CARD [31] and the tree-based channel assignment [144] do not require any synchronization
    between the transmitter and the receiver nodes because of static channel assignment.
    The channel assignment algorithms also have difference in terms of channel type
    such as orthogonal and overlapping channels. The channel assignment algorithms
    presented in [31], [32], [34], [35], [42]– [44], [56], [57], [117], [118], [122]–
    [132], [134]– [138], [140], [143]– [148] assume orthogonal channels; whereas,
    the channel assignment solutions proposed in [33], [133], [139], [142] assume
    overlapping channels available in the network. The algorithm presented in [116]
    uses both types of channels. The use of only orthogonal channels does not utilize
    the available spectrum efficiently. For example, IEEE 802.11b standard with 2.4
    GHz band defines three of eleven channels as orthogonal. The configuration of
    three orthogonal channels with the rest having a tolerable level of interference
    can significantly improve the system performance. Therefore, channel overlaps
    and adjacent channel interference must be considered in the design of a multi-channel
    protocol. Overlapping channels consume a small band while providing efficient
    spectrum utilization. The careful usage of overlapping channels can mitigate the
    effects of adjacent spectrum interference. The PU characteristics is the most
    important parameter that characterises the PU activity in CRNs. The channel assignment
    algorithms either model the primary channel status or the duration of primary
    channel occupancy. The channel assignment algorithms proposed in [32], [133],
    [145] consider the estimated PU activity duration; whereas, the rest of the channel
    assignment algorithms presented in Table III only check for the available channels
    to assign them on the interfaces. Although the incorporation of the PU activity
    duration in channel selection makes the channel assignment resilient to the PU
    activity, such algorithms have high complexity because of the estimation of the
    PU activity. The incorporation of only the PU activity status makes the channel
    assignment process simple, but the resilience of selected channels to PU activity
    cannot be guaranteed. The assigned channels in CRNs can be used to exchange either
    data only or both data and control messages. The exchange of control information
    on the same channel on which the data is being exchanged is called inband signaling.
    The exchange of control information on a separate dedicated channel is called
    out-of-band signaling. The algorithms presented in [56], [57], [122], [123], [126],
    [136], [138], [142], [144]– [146] use the inband signaling where data and control
    information travel on a data channel. The channel assignment algorithms proposed
    in [31]– [35], [42]– [44], [116]– [118], [124], [125], [127]– [135], [139], [140],
    [143], [147], [148] implement out-of-band signaling. The channel assignment algorithms
    also vary in terms of the control channel scope. The scope of the control channel
    can be local and global. The research works presented in [118], [124], [125],
    [132], [133], [138], [139] use the locally common control channel to exchange
    the control information within the one-hop neighborhood; whereas, the channel
    assignment algorithms proposed in [31]– [35], [42]– [44], [116], [117], [125],
    [127]– [131], [134]– [136], [140], [143], [147], [148] use the globally common
    control channel to exchange coordination information among all of the CRN nodes
    via multi-hops. Nevertheless, the channel assignment algorithms proposed in [56],
    [57], [122], [123], [126], [137], [142], [144]– [146] do not employ a control
    channel. B. General Comparison of Channel Assignment Algorithms Table IV presents
    the general comparison of channel assignment algorithms in CRNs. The comparison
    is based on the following parameters: a) network type, b) routing dependency,
    c) number of radios, d) execution model, and e) solving approach. Table IV General
    Comparison of Channel Assignment Algorithms in CRNs The channel assignment algorithms
    in CRNs are designed for different types of networks. Each type of networks has
    its own specific characteristics such as CWMN has redundant links, hence imposes
    unique set of requirements for channel assignment algorithm. The algorithms presented
    in [33]– [35], [42], [44], [116]– [118], [122]– [137] are for the CRAHNs. As the
    CRAHNs are multi-hop highly dynamic CRNs, the majority of the channel assignment
    algorithms proposed for the CRAHNs aim to maximize the channel utilization and
    network throughput by minimizing the interference among the different links. The
    algorithms do not support the features to cope with the ripple effect that is
    also critical to manage in multi-hop networks. The channel assignment frameworks
    in [43], [57], [138] are designed for the CRCNs. The CRCNs have CR base station;
    therefore, a majority of the channel assignment algorithms proposed for the CRCNs
    follow the centralized execution model. However, the algorithm presented in [57]
    is a distributed algorithm. The channel assignment algorithms proposed in [139],
    [140] are designed for the CRSNs. Because the CRSNs have constraint of limited
    battery power, the proposed algorithms aim to maximize the system utilization
    [140], and to optimize the residual energy [139]. The algorithms in [31], [32],
    [143]– [148] provide channel assignment solutions for the CWMNs. The CWMNs provide
    multi-hop connectivity and are composed of redundant links among the nodes. Therefore,
    the channel assignment algorithms for the CWMNs incorporate the features to minimize
    the signaling overhead, interference, and number of channel switches, and to maximize
    the throughput and spectrum utilization. Lastly, the research works in [56] and
    [142] are proposed for the CWLANs. The CWLANs have the CR access point. Therefore,
    the proposed channel assignment algorithms for the CWLANs follow the centralized
    execution model. The channel assignment algorithms are also compared using the
    routing dependency. The channel assignment algorithms presented in [33]– [35],
    [43], [56], [116], [123]– [127], [130], [133], [137]– [139], [142], [143], [146]–
    [148] work independent of routing; whereas, the channel assignment algorithms
    proposed in [31], [32], [42], [44], [57], [117], [118], [122], [128], [129], [131],
    [132], [134]– [136], [140], [144], [145] run jointly with the routing algorithm.
    The dependent design of channel assignment algorithms makes the channel assignment
    process relatively complicated and difficult to implement. Therefore, such channel
    assignment algorithms are not scalable. Nevertheless, the channel assignment algorithms
    benefit from a dependent design through the integration of information on routing,
    rate, and power in the optimal channel assignment in a wireless environment. Although
    the independent design channel assignment is easy to implement, it usually produces
    a relatively less optimal result. Another important parameter that we used to
    compare the channel assignment algorithm is number of radios supported by nodes
    in the CRNs. The assignment of orthogonal channels on different interfaces of
    a node enables the parallel transmission from the node. The channel assignment
    solutions proposed in [33], [42]– [44], [56], [57], [116], [122], [123], [126]–
    [133], [135], [137]– [140], [142], [144]– [146] are designed for single-radio
    CRNs; whereas, the algorithms presented in [124], [147] are designed for dual-radio
    CRNs. The channel assignment algorithms proposed in [31], [32], [34], [35], [117],
    [118], [125], [134], [136], [143], [148] are designed to leverage the multi-radio
    support of CRNs. The single-radio channel assignment algorithms are simple to
    implement because the interference handling is easy; whereas, the multi-radio
    increase network capacity by isolating the collision domains into multiple non-overlapping
    channels within the unlicensed bands. The multi-radio channel assignment reduces
    the number of channel switches and enables parallel transmissions. The execution
    model can also vary for different channel assignment algorithms. The channel assignment
    algorithms proposed in [44], [56], [118], [123], [132], [136]– [139], [142], [146]
    are implemented in a centralized manner. That is to say that, the computations
    are performed on the central server node or on the base station by collecting
    the available channel information from all of the CR nodes in the network. The
    channel assignment algorithms presented in [117] perform the channel assignment
    in a decentralized manner. However, the algorithms proposed in [31]– [35], [42],
    [44], [57], [116], [118], [122]– [131], [133]– [135], [140], [143]– [145], [147],
    [148] follow the distributed channel assignment. In centralized channel assignments,
    a large amount of information is exchanged between the central controller and
    the CR nodes to coordinate the available spectrum. Consequently, such a channel
    assignment entails a significant amount of signaling overhead. Although the configuration
    of the centralized channel assignment is relatively simple, the centralized approach
    is inefficient in a large, highly dynamic network. In distributed channel assignments,
    users are allowed to decide on how to use the spectrum solely based on the local
    information. The distributed channel assignment may face ripple effects and network
    isolation, if proper consideration is not given to address such issues. Moreover,
    the distributed channel assignment cannot provide an optimal solution. The decentralized
    channel assignment takes the benefits of both of the centralized and distributed
    channel assignments. The channel assignment problem in CRNs can be solved by using
    various solving approaches such as game theory, LP, NLP, heuristics, and Markov
    random fields. The channel assignment algorithms presented in [31], [33], [129]
    formulate the problem as a game. The research work presented in [129] maximizes
    the network utility by considering two different criteria: a) the number of traffic
    flows that can be established in the CRN and b) aggregate capacity in bits per
    second of the established flows. The CARD [31] aims to optimize the network capacity;
    thereby, maximizing the throughput. However, the channel assignment algorithm
    proposed in [33] minimizes the co-channel interference. Game theory provides a
    powerful decision making framework for the channel assignment. However, the game
    theory-based channel assignment algorithms have high runtime complexity. A considerable
    attention is also required in formulating the game and the corresponding utility
    functions to attain equilibrium, because the equilibrium is not always guaranteed.
    The channel assignment algorithms proposed in [118], [133], [134], [137]– [139]
    formulate the problem as an LP. The algorithms presented in [133] and [139] formulate
    and solve the channel assignment problem in the CRN using the BLP approach; whereas,
    the algorithms proposed in [118], [134], [138] solve the problem using the MILP
    approach. The channel assignment algorithms presented in [42], [57], [116], [135],
    [136], [145] solve the channel assignment problem using the NLP techniques that
    belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. The channel assignment algorithms proposed
    in [42], [136], [145] formulate the problem as MINLP. The CA and routing [145]
    further uses a heuristic to find the near optimal solution in a polynomial time;
    whereas, the throughput-oriented CA [42] transform the MINLP into the BLP that
    introduces some assumptions to transform the continuous MINLP variables into binary
    variables that is not valid in all cases. Similar to the channel assignment algorithm
    proposed in [145], the solutions presented in [57], [116] use heuristics to find
    the near-optimal solution. The algorithms proposed in [32], [34], [35], [43],
    [44], [117], [122], [125], [127], [128], [131], [132], [140], [142]– [144], [147],
    [148] use native-heuristics. The channel assignment solution presented in [56]
    uses the hyper-heuristics. The difference between the hyper-heuristic and meta-heuristic
    channel assignment schemes is that the meta-heuristic channel assignment directly
    deals with the channel assignment problem search space with the objective of finding
    near-optimal solutions. The algorithms presented in [123], [126], [130] solve
    the channel assignment problem by using meta-heuristics. The research work presented
    in [124] uses the MRF to solve the channel assignment problem. The MRF-based channel
    assignment solution has only local dependencies. However, computing probabilities
    and parameters estimation in the MRF-based channel assignment solution are difficult;
    thereby, increasing the complexity of the problem. Table V Comparison of Channel
    Assignment Algorithms Based on Objective C. Objective-Based Channel Assignment
    Algorithm Comparison In Table V, a number of channel assignment algorithms focus
    on maximizing the spectrum utilization [43], [116], [124], [125], [133], [138],
    [140], [142], [146]; whereas, the channel assignment algorithms presented in [118],
    [126], [130], [133], [144] optimize the system utilization. However, the rest
    of the channel assignment algorithms are not aimed at utilization maximization.
    Interference minimization-based channel assignment algorithms tend to reduce the
    interference among the wireless links of nodes within the CRNs. Only the channel
    assignment algorithms presented in [31]– [33], [35], [56], [117], [125], [135],
    [143], [144], [147] minimize the interference. High interference on a node complicates
    the identification and receipt of the desired signals. Consequently, additional
    energy is consumed, as the sender node needs to retransmit the data. In addition
    to maximizing throughput, minimizing interference assists in reducing the node
    energy consumption by decreasing the amount of energy spent in an effort to avoid
    collision. Throughput maximization involves optimizing the average rate of successful
    message deliveries over a communication channel. The channel assignment algorithm
    discussed in [31], [32], [34], [42], [56], [116]– [118], [123], [128], [132],
    [134], [136], [142]– [144] focus on maximizing the throughput; whereas, the rest
    of the channel assignment algorithms do not optimize throughput. Connectivity
    maximization-based channel assignment algorithms focus on increasing the connectivity
    among the neighboring nodes in CRNs. Connectivity is guaranteed by assigning the
    same channel to a large set of links among nodes within the local proximity. Strong
    connectivity is achieved when many links are assigned to the same channel. However,
    additional interference is induced. The algorithms proposed in [35], [127], [129],
    [140] focus on the increasing network connectivity while assigning channels. The
    joint power channel assignment [129] and route tree-based channel assignment [144]
    minimize the signaling overhead. However, segment-based channel assignment [122]
    and maximum flow segment [131] reduce the channel switching overhead within the
    CRN. Aside from minimizing signaling overhead, network overhead minimization-based
    channel assignment algorithms produce low network overhead for channel assignment
    computation. The fairness optimization-based channel assignment algorithm focuses
    on maximizing the fairness among different kinds of traffic, such as broadcast
    and unicast. The channel assignment presented in [148] focuses on optimizing the
    fairness among unicast and broadcast traffic. The unicast traffic performs well
    if the same channel is not assigned to a number of interfaces in the proximity;
    whereas, the performance of the broadcast traffic degrades for the same scenario.
    Residual energy maximization is an important aspect of channel assignment algorithms
    in CRSNs, CRAHNs, and CRCNs that deals with the reduction of the power consumption
    while prolonging the battery and network lifetime. The channel assignment algorithms
    proposed in [133], [138], [139] aim to maximize the residual energy. Secondary
    revenue maximization is also an important concern within the CRCNs. The channel
    assignment in such networks aims to maximize SU and PU revenue while selecting
    the channel for interfaces in the networks. Only the channel assignment algorithms
    presented in [57] and [137] optimize secondary and primary service provider revenue
    respectively. Reliability maximization-based channel assignment algorithms tend
    to minimize the probability of failure during channel assignment computation.
    The algorithms presented in [44] and [43] maximize the reliability of the channel
    assignment. The comparison summary of the channel assignment algorithms in the
    CRNs with respect to the identified objectives is presented in Table V. SECTION
    VII. Discussions Summary of CRNs CAs Herein, we briefly summarize the lessons
    learnt from the conducted surveys. A. CRAHNs CA The channel assignment algorithms
    in the CRAHNs aim to maximize the channel utilization and network throughput by
    minimizing the interference. However, the algorithms lack the features to cope
    with the ripple effect and the channel oscillation problem. The channel assignment
    algorithms such as RMCA [118] and DDMAC [34] that depend on the traffic load and
    interference level parameter values are vulnerable to the channel oscillation
    and the ripple effect problems. The channel oscillation and the ripple effect
    cause the channel assignment algorithm to slowly converge. Moreover, the complex
    optimization based channel assignment solution and MRF-based framework are compute-
    and time-intensive solutions that converge slowly in highly dynamic conditions
    where the PU activity is higher. Consequently, the performance of the CRAHN is
    degraded. Some channel assignment algorithms such as RIMCA require interference
    estimation on the PUs for taking the channel selection decision. The exact interference
    at the PU cannot be estimated because the interference is the sum of interferences
    from different SUs around the concerned PU. Moreover, Such channel assignment
    algorithms only focus on the channel switching time and do not consider the channel
    switching frequency that is important in avoiding frequent channel switching.
    The majority of the channel assignment algorithms for the CRAHNs do not consider
    the PU activity duration that is imperative in the selection of the less PU-susceptible
    channels. The shorter PU activity duration reduces the channel switching at SU.
    The channel switching, triggered by the PU activity, may restart the channel assignment
    and the routing; thereby, inducing further delays and reducing the network throughput.
    The dynamic nature of CRNs and interface limitation are other common factors that
    reduce the network throughput. The channel assignment solutions such as DDMAC
    select the channel assignment based on SINR value that only captures the interference
    caused by the primary transmitter and does not consider the primary receiver activity.
    As CRAHNs can be multi-hop networks, the expected interference among different
    links must also be considered while assigning the channel. However, the incorporation
    of the expected interference originating from previously assigned channels on
    neighboring links increases the complexity of the channel assignment process.
    B. CRCNs CA The channel assignment algorithms in the CRCNs aim to maximize the
    secondary revenue, optimize spectrum utilization, and increase the number of available
    channels. The channel assignment algorithms that are integrated with other networking
    features, such as admission control and power allocation, are complex in nature
    and converge slowly because of the complexity involved in the solution. In the
    SNR-based channel assignment algorithms, the CR node is required to exchange the
    SNR value of all of the available channels with the base station that also increases
    the overhead. None of the channel assignment algorithms consider the PU-estimated
    activity duration while selecting the channel that increases the selection probability
    of the highly susceptible channel in terms of the PU activity. C. CRSNs CA The
    current channel assignment algorithms in the CRSNs aim to maximize the sum rate
    of the data transfer, residual energy, and network connectivity. The incorporation
    of the residual energy, PU activity, and connectivity parameters of the channel
    assignment increases the complexity of the channel selection process that consequently
    consumes the battery power. Therefore, the CRSNs demand lightweight energy- and
    spectrum-aware channel assignment algorithms that can assist in extending the
    network lifetime. D. CWLANs CA The channel assignment in the CWLANs is based on
    the observed traffic, the channel types, and on the optimization of external interference.
    The current channel assignment algorithm minimizes the interference within the
    CWLANs and with the neighboring CWLANs. However, such channel assignment algorithms
    do not consider the history of the PU activity during channel selection; thereby,
    increasing the probability of selecting a highly susceptible channel in terms
    of the PU activity. E. CWMNs CA The channel assignment algorithms in the CWMNs
    are designed to attain the following objectives: to optimize the network capacity
    and performance; to minimize the signaling overhead, interference, and the number
    of channel switches; to maximize the throughput and spectrum utilization, and
    to maintain the fairness between unicast and broadcast traffic. A large set of
    channel assignment algorithms in CWMNs does not incorporate the estimated PU duration;
    thereby, resulting in the selection of channels susceptible to a high PU activity.
    Contrary to the channel assignment algorithms in the CRCN and CWLAN, the channel
    assignment in the CWMNs is performed in a distributed manner. The channel assignment
    in the CWMNs mainly focuses on reducing the intra- and inter-flow interference,
    and maximizing the throughput and spectrum utilization. SECTION VIII. Issues and
    Challenges in the CRNs Channel Assignment Algorithms The following discussion
    highlights the issues in the existing channel assignment algorithms that must
    be addressed. The gaps in the research on attaining an efficient channel assignment
    in the CRNs is also discussed. Table VI presents the open issues addressed in
    the state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms. Table VI Open Issues Addressed
    in the Channel Assignment Algorithms A. Channel Characterization In the CRNs,
    characteristics of the available channels vary spatially and temporally. The available
    channels must be characterized in terms of the time-varying radio environment
    and spectrum parameters, such as bandwidth and operating frequency for the selection
    of a suitable channel among the available heterogeneous channels in a CRN. Therefore,
    the parameters that can represent the characteristics of a particular spectrum
    band must be defined. These parameters are interference, path loss, and wireless
    link errors. The exact estimation of the interference amount at a primary receiver
    on a particular channel is a challenging task. Interference is estimated to derive
    the permissible power of the SU transmitter that is used in the estimation of
    the channel capacity. The path loss depends on the frequency and distance. In
    the CRN, the available channels can be part of either a high or a low frequency
    range. The communication on the high frequency channels faces relatively high
    path loss that decreases the transmission range. Moreover, the distance between
    the CRN nodes is not uniform. Therefore, the reception of data from the distant
    CR nodes can suffer considerably from the path loss, when compared to the reception
    of the data from the near CR nodes on the same channel. The wireless link error
    rate is also based on interference that varies with the temporal characteristics
    of the operating environment. Therefore, accurate interference modeling [149]
    is vital for the selection of an actual optimal channel among the available heterogeneous
    channels. The interdependencies of the channel characterization parameters and
    highly dynamic CRNs with heterogeneous spectrum holes make the channel characterization
    a challenging research issue within the CRNs. Therefore, research efforts are
    required to characterize the available heterogeneous primary channels in the CRNs.
    Intelligent feature extraction and classification methods such as neural networks,
    pattern recognition, or statistical classification can be used to characterize
    the available heterogeneous channels in the CRNs. B. Channel Capacity Estimation
    Various QoS-demanding mobile applications that impose strict requirements on wireless
    networks have recently been developed. The operating conditions within the CRNs
    vary temporally and spatially. Therefore, channel characteristics, such as interference,
    path loss, and wireless link errors may also vary. Channels with sufficient capacity
    must be selected to meet the requirements of the QoS-demanding mobile applications.
    The channel selection process involves monitoring of the channel characterization
    parameters, computing the estimated residual channel capacity for all of the available
    channels using the monitored parameter values, and selecting the channel with
    sufficient estimated capacity. The monitoring of the channel parameters requires
    configuring the channel on the radio interface and monitoring the channel actively
    for a time instance. The problem becomes complicated when a single radio is available
    to monitor a large set of available channels; thereby, reducing the network throughput
    and increasing the energy consumption at the CR node. Therefore, the monitoring
    of versatile channel characteristics and computing the estimated residual channel
    capacity in the CRNs become challenging tasks because of the heterogeneous available
    channels, temporally and spatially varying PU activities, and limited resource
    availability. Although the work presented in [150] enhances the channel estimation,
    the proposed work still does not consider the interference caused by multi-hop
    communicating nodes. The real-time measurements must be combined with analytical
    calculations by considering the major factors that may affect the residual channel
    capacity including the link data rate, packet sizes, hidden nodes and channel
    errors. The estimation methods must not inject extra control data to monitor the
    link capacity. C. Primary Receiver Detection Zhao et al. [151] define channel
    in CRN as an opportunity if the secondary transmitter does not interfere with
    the communication of the primary receiver, and if the primary transmitter does
    not interfere with the secondary receiver on the channel. Various methods have
    been proposed to detect the primary transmitter. Examples include: matched filter
    detection [152], energy detection [153]– [155], and cyclostationary feature detection
    [156]– [158]. The passive nature of the primary receivers, such as TV receivers
    make primary receiver detection a complex task. In [159], the advantage of local
    oscillator (LO) leakage power is discussed in the detection of a primary receiver.
    The LO leakage power-based receiver detection requires the deployment of a low-cost
    sensor to sense the power leakage of the primary receiver that is infeasible for
    all of the secondary networks. To avoid the interference with the PUs, the activities
    of both the primary transmitter and the primary receiver must be detected correctly.
    Existing channel assignment does not incorporate, distinctly, both type of PUs
    in channel assignment algorithms. The aforementioned incorporation is essential
    for efficient spectrum utilization and interference-free channel assignment. However,
    the incorporation of both types of PU activities in channel selection increases
    the complexity of the channel assignment problem. Moreover, the detection of a
    primary receiver using the low-cost sensor imposes overhead in terms of sensor
    deployment and maintenance. The overhead can be reduced by combining the real-time
    detection mechanism with analytical models for predicting the primary receiver
    activity. D. Channel Sensing Accuracy in Single Radio Multi-Channel CRNs Sensing
    is a key functionality in the detection of a PU within a CRN. To sense a particular
    channel for the PU detection, the CR node must tune a radio interface to that
    channel. The accuracy of sensing depends on the frequency and time span of sensing.
    However, a trade-off exists between the sensing accuracy, throughput, and energy
    consumption [160]. The throughput decreases and energy consumption increases with
    the increase in the sensing frequency and duration. The problem worsens in case
    of the single radio CRNs, in which a node must sense multiple channels on the
    same radio along with transmitting and receiving data. The sensing accuracy is
    essential in reducing the interference with the PUs and in improving the available
    channel utilization. However, the multi-objective optimization of the conflicting
    parameters is a challenging task in highly dynamic CRNs. The channel assignment
    algorithms must consider these multiple conflicting objectives while selecting
    a channel for a radio interface. E. Channel Switching in Multi-Hop CRNs Frequent
    channel switching increases the packet loss ratio and induces a delay in the end-to-end
    communication within the multi-hop CRNs [161]. Channel switching occurs because
    of the PU activity or because of the need to tune into the channel of the receiver
    node. The channel switching due to the PU activity can be minimized by incorporating
    the PU history in the channel assignment algorithm; whereas, the channel switching
    due to tuning of the interface to the same channel of the receiver node can be
    reduced by selecting the channel that is common among a large set of nodes. Increasing
    the nodes on a common channel to avoid channel switching increases connectivity
    but also aggravates interference. Only a few existing channel assignment algorithms
    [117], [122], [131] focus on minimizing the channel switching. In these channel
    assignment algorithms, channel switching is the only objective attained without
    incorporating other network performance metrics. Therefore, minimizing channel
    switching while optimizing other performance metrics is still an open research
    issue. The channel-switching can be minimized while optimizing other performance
    metrics by incorporating the PU activity history, multi-hop interference, and
    performing hybrid channel assignment in CRNs. F. Stability Similar to the channel
    assignment for the traditional wireless networks, the channel assignment algorithms
    within the CRNs also undermine the network stability. The highly dynamic PU activity
    in the CRNs makes the network stability quite challenging. The network stability
    can be ensured by addressing two phenomena, namely: ripple effect and channel
    oscillation. When the CR nodes discover that an available channel is under-utilized,
    the CR nodes simultaneously switch to the channel and begin the transmission on
    the available primary channel, and then switch back after discovering that the
    channel is overloaded. Because of the changes in the channel assignments of the
    CR nodes, the channel assignments of the neighboring CR nodes also change. The
    phenomena of ripple effect and channel oscillation also reduce the network throughput
    and increase the packet drop ratio. The network stability can be ensured by designing
    the hybrid channel assignment algorithms and incorporating the PU activity history
    within channel selection process. G. Network Connectivity in Joint Power Control
    Channel Assignment In CRNs, rate control through power adjustment can be effective
    in reducing interference, but it can lead to frequent disconnections. Hence, ensuring
    the network connectivity while reducing the interference through power adjustment
    is still an open research issue. Although multiple research works focus on rate
    control, a general algorithm that can ensure multi-hop connectivity while controlling
    the rate through power adjustment has not been proposed. The general solution
    can be devised by developing a multi-objective function that is based on network
    connectivity parameters and rates. However, the rapid convergence of a channel
    assignment algorithm in highly dynamic CRNs while ensuring the network connectivity
    and avoiding the interference through data control is a complex non-trivial objective.
    H. Channel Synchronization To enable the successful communication between two
    neighboring nodes, the sender and receiver node of the transmission should be
    tuned on the same channel at the time of communication. In CRNs, secondary nodes
    have to vacate the channel on which a PU is detected and switch to another available
    channel. Hence, the communicating nodes have to synchronize the new channel on
    which the rest of the communication is being carried out. The synchronization
    for tuning of the same channel may require exchange of information on common control
    channel. However, the availability of common control channel can not always be
    guaranteed. The synchronization of channels in highly dynamic CRNs where common
    control channel is not available is challenging research area. The main reason
    behind the complexity of the problem is availability of different set of channels
    on each node, non-availability of common control channel, and highly dynamic CRN
    environment. I. Channel Availability Estimation The duration of primary channel
    availability also affects the secondary nodes communication in CRNs. The secondary
    nodes have to vacate the communicating channel when the PU is detected on the
    channel and have to switch to another available channel. The selection of short-span
    primary channels in the CRNs causes the frequent channel switching. The selection
    of such short-span primary channels can be avoided by estimating the PU activity
    span on available channel. However, the estimation of PU activity span on a certain
    channel requires the monitoring of the PU activity on the channel for a certain
    time interval. The secondary node has to tune the channel on one of its interfaces
    to learn the PU activity pattern. The process of learning the PU activity pattern
    becomes a challenging task, particularly on a single radio node, due to frequent
    channel switching involved to monitor the multiple channels. J. Heterogeneous
    Channel Capacity and Channel Encoding In CRNs, physical channel capacity and channel
    encoding vary on different frequency bands. The encoding scheme need to be adjusted
    if the frequency band is switched on a radio interface of a secondary node. The
    change in encoding scheme results in variable data rate that can be a problem
    for multimedia traffic. The availability of heterogeneous channel capacity and
    varying channel encoding make the performance of the secondary user''s application
    highly dynamic. Hence, in such dynamic channel conditions, it becomes a challenging
    task for secondary service provider to provide the guaranteed service to secondary
    users. To address the issue arised from the heterogeneous channel capacity and
    channel encoding, the available channels need to be organized into set of similar
    channel capacities and encodings. K. Broadcast Support In CRNs, multiple channels
    are available that can be assigned on interfaces of secondary nodes to enable
    the communication. The availability of channels varies temporally and spatially.
    Several state-of-the-art channel assignment protocols in CRNs focus merely on
    enabling the unicast transmission between a sender and a receiver node. However,
    the broadcast communication is commonly used for disseminating control information
    in many scenarios such as to advertise a service to one-hop neighbors or to a
    whole network. The broadcast communication in CRNs has to be enabled in two different
    situation: a) when all receivers are tuned on the same channel and have to send
    just one copy of message and b) when all the broadcast receivers are not tuned
    on the same channel and have to send as many copies of the message as the number
    of channels being tuned by receivers. Although first scenario minimizes the number
    of broadcast transmissions, the unicast transmission on such scenario suffers
    with interference due to multiple simultaneous active links on the same channel.
    The second scenario provides the flexibility in channel assignment. However, devising
    a channel assignment algorithm that can optimize the overall network throughput
    considering the network traffic type is a challenging research area. Such channel
    assignment algorithms can be designed by estimating the broadcast and unicast
    traffic on available channels in the CRNs, which has high complexity especially
    in case of CRNs with single radio nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion Channel assignment
    is a key design issue with the CRNs that maximizes the CRN performance by reducing
    the interference to PUs, as well as the interference among SUs. The objective
    of minimizing interference in the CRNs is attained by employing an efficient,
    adaptive channel assignment algorithm that can react and converge immediately
    with the PU activity. Designing and deploying an efficient, adaptive channel assignment
    algorithm with a CRN is a challenging research perspective because of the heterogeneous
    spectrum availability and highly dynamic network conditions with respect to PU
    activity, incorporation of diverse channel characteristics, and channels of different
    sizes. In this paper, we classified the existing channel assignment algorithms
    in the CRNs by presenting a thematic taxonomy and presented a comprehensive survey
    of state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms. The available literature on
    the channel assignment in CRNs is proposed for different networks, such as CRAHNs,
    CRCNs, CRSNs, CWLANs, and CWMNs. The channel assignment requirements for each
    of the networks varies according to the network type; therefore, we studied the
    literature by classifying the state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms based
    on the network types. The critical aspects of current channel assignment algorithms
    in CRNs were also analyzed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms.
    Moreover, the similarities and differences of the channel assignment algorithms
    based on significant parameters, such as channel model, assignment methods, routing
    dependency, objective, execution model, and PU characteristics, were also investigated
    in this work. Open research issues, such as channel characterization, channel
    capacity estimation, sensing accuracy, primary receiver detection, and channel
    switching were also discussed. Moreover, future research directions were provided
    by highlighting the significance of each of the research challenge. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    EPUB Formulae display:? ABSTRACT Due to exponential growth in demand for radio
    spectrum for wireless communication networking, the radio spectrum has become
    over-crowded. The fixed spectrum allocation policy of the radio spectrum leads
    to inefficient utilisation of the available spectrum, which diverted the attention
    of researchers towards different intelligent techniques to access the spectrum
    dynamically and efficiently. The concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) has been considered
    as a promising technology to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity through the
    utilisation of various unutilised spectrum bands. In a future network deployment,
    multiple radio access networks may coexist having different characteristics. Hence,
    it becomes a challenge for CR networks to select the optimal network out of available
    networks. For efficient realisation, CRs requires intelligent spectrum management
    techniques for Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM). Till now, there does not exist
    a literature survey that addresses the spectrum management with machine learning
    techniques in an intelligent manner. Hence, this paper presents the detailed classification
    and comprehensive survey of various machine learning techniques for intelligent
    spectrum management with their paradigms of optimisation for cognitive radio networks.
    The paper also provides new directions and open issues for the research community
    to work further in CR networks. KEYWORDS: Cognitive Radiodynamic spectrum managementheterogeneous
    networksintelligent techniquesmachine learning Introduction The exponential growth
    in the demand for extra spectrum resources become more prominent to support numerous
    wireless services leads to the advent of new technologies for high-speed data
    networks (X. Zheng et al., 2008). According to Cisco, global mobile data traffic
    will increase sevenfold between 2017 to 2022 (Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global
    Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2017–2022, 2018). But radio spectrum is an
    inherently limited resource in which frequency bands are exclusively assigned
    to the licenced users called Primary User’s (PUs) for a long term basis which
    leads to spectrum scarcity in a particular spectrum band. In contrast, a survey
    of spectrum utilisation being conducted by the Federal Communication Commission
    (FCC) has indicated that many portions of the radio spectrum are not in use, called
    spectrum holes, for a significant amount of time which leads to under-utilisation
    of the assigned spectrum. To overcome this problem, FCC reforms the spectrum allocation
    policy and allows unlicensed users, also known as secondary users/Cognitive Radios
    (CRs) to borrow unused radio spectrum from licenced users through Dynamic Spectrum
    Access (DSA) (FCC, 2003). The CR as an intelligent radio that can be reprogrammed
    and reconfigured dynamically. Such intelligent radio automatically detects available
    channels in the wireless spectrum, changes accordingly its transmission and reception
    parameters to switch between available vacant spectrum bands dynamically. This
    process is known as Dynamic Spectrum Access which can be realised only with CR
    networks (Akyildiz et al., 2008). Figure 1 presents a system model showing the
    available spectrum holes of various networks such as Television, GSM, Satellite,
    and Wi-Fi. CR requires a spectrum hole for its application which requires intelligent
    techniques to access the spectrum dynamically. The intelligent spectrum management
    includes spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility.

    CRs having multiple requirements. Display full size Figure 2. The fixed spectrum
    allocation policy. Display full size Figure 3. The dynamic spectrum allocation
    policy. Display full size Figure 2 shows the currently fixed spectrum allocation
    policy decided by governmental agencies. Due to this fixed spectrum allocation
    policy, some frequency bands are highly utilised and some are lightly utilised.
    It is observed from Figure 2 that networks 1 and 2 are lightly utilised whereas
    networks 3 and 4 are highly utilised. It is shown that there exist large numbers
    of spectrum holes of heterogeneous networks that can be utilised with dynamic
    spectrum allocation policy. Figure 3 shows a dynamic spectrum allocation policy
    where CR access the unused spectrum. Thus, the demand for extra spectrum bands
    for wireless applications can be solved with flexible usage of available spectrum
    holes. As an intelligent wireless network, CR shares the spectrum with PUs in
    an opportunistic manner to avoid interference among multiple spectrum users with
    its learning abilities to adapt and act in a dynamic environment (Xu et al., 2014).
    To address the problem of spectrum scarcity, each CR:(Akyildiz et al., 2008).
    Determine the presence of spectrum holes called spectrum sensing. Determine available
    channels including spectrum selection, routing protocol, and reconfiguration called
    spectrum decision. Allocation of resources and serve its users without causing
    interference to PUs called spectrum sharing. Vacate the channel on the arrival
    of PUs called spectrum mobility. The most important issue is how to access the
    spectrum dynamically without interference with PUs. This requires CR which is
    intelligent by nature and having learning capability to learn from past experiences,
    which is an essential part of intelligence. Haykin envisioned CR as an intelligent
    wireless communication system that is based on the methodology of understanding
    by building to achieve two goals: highly reliable communication and efficient
    utilisation of radio resources (Khozeimeh & Haykin, 2012). To perform these tasks,
    CRs must be equipped with intelligence like a human (Zafari et al., 2019). The
    implementation of such capabilities requires functional architecture like the
    brain to access the spectrum efficiently i.e. Cognitive Engine (CE) (Dong et al.,
    2012). The CE acts as a brain of CR to perform various cognitive functions intelligently
    and provides learning capabilities to implement the cognitive cycle by making
    use of machine learning algorithms. The CR technology is based on Software Defined
    Radio (SDR), which allows the radio to reconfigure through software, based on
    the interaction with the surrounding environment in which it operates. However,
    in recent years machine learning algorithms in CR networks gains a lot of attention
    from researchers (Kotsiantis, 2007) (Thilina et al., 2013). A look at a recent
    literature survey on CR networks reveals that various leaning techniques are proposed
    that have been applied to numerous CR applications (Yau et al., 2012)(A. He et
    al., 2010). Some authors presented machine learning techniques, particularly focused
    on spectrum sensing and decision making in CR networks (Abbas et al., 2015). Further,
    CR has to work under unknown environments where complete Channel State Information
    (CSI) is not present or only partial CSI is available but it has to estimate the
    behaviour from other CRs present in network to coordinate its actions. Another
    author surveyed machine learning techniques for decision making and feature classification
    in different environmental conditions. In general, learning becomes an indispensable
    part of CR if the input-output relation of the system is not known, or as in the
    case of CR networks, due to channel uncertainty. Thus, learning becomes a necessary
    tool to estimate that channel characteristics to reduce error probability (Zafari
    et al., 2019). In CR’s, several parameters need to be adjusted simultaneously
    such as availability of spectrum (Tripathi et al., 2011), transmit power (G. Yang
    et al., 2015), adaptive coding and modulation schemes (Zafari et al., 2019), antenna
    selection, rate control (Hanif et al., 2011), spectrum handoff (Thakur et al.,
    2017), etc., and it is not possible to identify and adjust all these parameters
    simultaneously. Thus, learning techniques can be applied to perform specific CR
    tasks with efficiency and accuracy. An overview of an existing literature survey
    is presented in Table 1. The survey reveals that most of the authors have shown
    their interest in the specific issue of spectrum management. Most of the authors
    provide different types of solutions to address the spectrum scarcity problem.
    Some of the authors specifically discuss a problem related to spectrum management
    whereas no work has been presented with machine learning techniques for dynamic
    spectrum management which includes spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum
    sharing, and spectrum mobility. In this survey, spectrum management with intelligent
    techniques, considering learning as an important parameter has been discussed.
    In particular, we provide an in-depth discussion on different types of intelligent
    techniques such as Artificial Neural Network, Metaheuristic Algorithms, Support
    Vector Machine, Bayesian Learning, Game Theory, and Hidden Markov Models. The
    pros and cons of each technique in the context of spectrum management have also
    been discussed. We firstly present a spectrum management framework. Then we introduced
    various intelligent techniques used in CR networks as well as a survey of state-of-the-art
    achievements of these techniques for dynamic spectrum management in CR networks.
    The major contributions of this paper are summarised as follows: This paper presents
    a comprehensive survey of various intelligent techniques and presents their applications
    in CR networks. The target of this paper is to provide a focused survey of these
    techniques and evaluates its performance in spectrum management as major CR tasks
    which include spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum
    mobility. This paper presented state-of-the-art achievements in applying intelligent
    techniques to CR networks along with their strength and limitations to provide
    an overview of active research in the area of CR networks. The paper discusses
    research issues and challenges that are still an open issue and need the attention
    of researchers. Table 1. Comparison with an existing literature survey Download

    the spectrum management framework for CR networks. The taxonomy of various intelligent
    techniques is presented in Section 3. The evaluation of intelligent techniques
    along with their strengths and limitations are presented in Section 4. Section
    5 presents research issues, challenges, and future directions in the area of spectrum
    management. Finally, the concluding remarks are given in Section 6. Spectrum management
    framework To address the critical challenges associated with the co-existence
    of PUs and CRs in CR networks, CRs are required with the following functions in
    spectrum management: Interference Management: The important role of CR is to resolve
    the interference issues with PUs which can be resolved in two manners: Proactive:
    In this, the CR switches its communication before the arrival of PUs. Reactive:
    CR switches its communication after the arrival of PUs. Quality of service (QoS)
    Awareness: In heterogeneous networks, the selection of an appropriate spectrum
    band is necessary to provide QoS aware communication CR technologies provide intelligent
    spectrum management capabilities that could meet the ever-increasing demand of
    spectrum, thus empowers radio with etiquette to avoid interference. The complete
    spectrum management framework is presented in Figure 4. It shows that CR spectrum
    management framework has four main steps: Figure 4. The complete spectrum management
    framework. Display full size Spectrum Sensing: The first step of spectrum management
    starts with spectrum sensing on the arrival of CR. Spectrum sensing provides the
    ability to detect the spectrum holes (in terms of the frequency band, location,
    duration of availability) and PU activity by periodically sensing the spectrum
    and use it without interference with PUs (Noorshams et al., 2010). Spectrum Decision:
    Spectrum decision includes spectrum analysis and decision making. It deals with
    the selection of appropriate spectrum bands according to the required QoS. The
    spectrum hole is characterised, with various parameters such as multipath environment,
    operating frequency, interference, link delay (Pourpeighambar et al., 2017) and
    number of PUs using the spectrum, being considered (X Liu et al., 2013). After
    spectrum analysis, the decision has been made to access the spectrum hole. Various
    optimisation techniques can be applied to obtain optimal decisions depending upon
    the radio environment whether it has to optimise single objective or multiple
    objectives (Ramzan et al., 2017). Spectrum Sharing: The main function of spectrum
    sharing is to avoid collision among the CRs as multiple users trying to access
    the spectrum while maintaining QoS. Spectrum sharing deals with coordination among
    CRs to access the shared channels, resource allocation, and spectrum access (Kour
    et al., 2018)(Akyildiz et al., 2008). The spectrum allocation includes the assignment
    of spectrum band in a cooperative (Bayrakdar, 2020). or non-cooperative manner
    using handshaking protocols of transmitter and receiver (X Liu et al., 2013).
    The spectrum access includes collision avoidance among CRs in the access phase
    Spectrum Mobility: Spectrum mobility deals with spectrum handoff and connection
    management. CRs are usually regarded as visitors which often need to switch from
    one spectrum hole to another on the arrival of PUs in a dynamic environment (Christian
    et al., 2012). Spectrum mobility utilises a reactive and proactive approach for
    the detection of PUs whereas connection management ensures that CR continuously
    transmits its data in a new spectrum hole (Thakur et al., 2017). Intelligent techniques
    in cognitive radio networks A CR as an intelligent wireless device, which is aware
    of its environment, capable of learning and adapt from its surrounding environment
    and learning considered to be an indispensable component of an intelligent system
    which is considered to be a basic tool of CRs for dynamically access the available
    spectrum without interfering with PUs. CR must have the capability to learn from
    current observations and past experiences. However, CR has to work under different
    radio environments in which CR might have full or partial CSI or sometimes under
    a completely unknown environment. However, not being idealistic, due to fluctuations
    in the wireless channel, channel estimation errors, and quantisation errors, it
    is not possible to obtain perfect CSI. Thus, CR might apply an intelligent algorithm
    to estimate its actions concerning other CRs for spectrum management. Various
    techniques in CR networks are shown in Figure 5. Intelligence with artificial
    neural networks Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) provides Artificial intelligence
    (AI) which aims to incorporate intelligence in machines so that machines can perform
    like an expert. Also, machine learning, a subclass of AI, gained a lot of attention
    from the researchers in CR networks. Learning can be classified as supervised,
    unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (Jiang et al., 2017)(Duda et al., 2001).
    Supervised learning learns from the training set and requires prior information
    about the environment. On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require
    any training set and it performs self-adapting actions without any prior knowledge
    about the environment. Figure 5. Intelligent techniques in CR networks. Display
    full size Reinforcement learning or learning with critic, the learning agents
    learn by observing actions of other agents, and its performance is influenced
    by learning regime and operating environment (Duda et al., 2001)(Dandurand & Shultz,
    2009). However, it is a particular point of interest here that how these intelligent
    algorithms have been applied to access the spectrum dynamically. In this section,
    we present various ANN techniques that can be applied to CR networks. Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) Artificial Neural Network (ANN or simply NN) consists of
    several interconnected neurons, identical to the human brain, which is made up
    of real biological neurons. The first artificial neuron was introduced in 1943
    by the neurophysiologist W. McCulloch and logician Walter Pits. ANN composed of
    a large number of artificial neurons which are interconnected to each other that
    mimics the behaviour and natural processing of biological neuron .i.e., learning
    and organisation (Tsagkaris et al., 2008). The human brain can perform fast due
    to its special ability of parallel data processing and NN tries to mimic the behaviour
    of solving narrowly defined problems. As stated earlier, NN consist of a pool
    of neurons, and these neurons are configured in the form of layers and connected
    to other nodes with links defined by the weight w j k , which determines the effect
    of the signal of a neuron j on a neuron k . In NN, three types of layers are present,
    which are distinguished as the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The
    input layer consists of neurons, which receive data whereas output layers consist
    of neurons, which send data out from the NN layer and the hidden layer consists
    of neurons whose input, and output remain in NN. Each neuron within NN uses some
    activation function to process the input signals s k it receives from (a) neighbours
    belonging to different layers (b) external sources. The type of activation function
    used depends on the problem to be addressed. Types of NN and Machine Learning
    In this section, we describe different NN models. Supervised NNs In supervised
    NNs, the input and output are known and its objective is to discover the relationship
    between two. The two main NN models are as Feed Forward NNs (FFNNs) and Recurrent
    NNs (RNNs). FFNNs are further classified as: Single layer FFNNs (SL-FFNNs) and
    Multilayer FFNNs (ML-FFNNs). Feed Forward NNs In FFNNs, neurons feed their values
    in the forward direction. It is of two types describes as: Single-layer FFNN (SL-FFNNs):
    It consists of single-layer of neurons. Due to its single-layer network, learning
    and training mechanism is easy but it has limited utility, as it is not able to
    solve real-world complex problems. Multilayer FFNN (ML-FFNNs): It consists multiple
    layers (hidden layers) between input and output layer. These hidden layers solve
    complex problems using the activation function. As stated earlier, some activation
    function is required to process the information, and the selection of activation
    function depends on the problem to be solved. Table 2 shows various types of activation
    functions to address different problems. Table 2. Types of the activation function
    Display Table Various type of ML-FFNNs using different activation functions leads
    to slight variation in the network. (Tumuluru et al., 2010), designed a multilayer
    spectrum predictor using a neural network, which does not require prior knowledge
    of traffic characteristics of PUs. CR may predict channel status based on sensing
    history which further saves sensing energy. (Liu et al., 2015) proposed ML-FFNN
    based dynamic Chinese restaurant game for spectrum sensing, which considered CR
    as customers to learn the table state (available spectrum hole) in the restaurant
    (network). Some important examples of ML-FFNNs include Radial Basis Neural Networks
    and Convolutional Neural Networks which are described below: Radial Basis Neural
    Networks (RBNN): RBNN composed of three layers: input layer, hidden layer, and
    output layer. The hidden layer consists of neurons using a Gaussian transfer function
    gives the output as Y j = ∑ j w j exp − r x − r μ 2 σ j 2 (1) In Gaussian transfer
    function, x → is input, μ ⃗ j and σ j represents centre vector and width of j
    t h neuron in hidden layer respectively, which need to be calculated for each
    neuron, ||.|| denotes Euclidean distance. However, an initial value of the centre
    vector and width affects the prediction ability of the network. An unsupervised
    learning technique i.e. K-means clustering (K-RBF) algorithm can be used to obtain
    the values of centre vector and width of the hidden neurons associated to construct
    and train RBNN in a more accurate way. The output of the transfer function weighted
    and summed as shown in Equation (1) . Zhang (S. Zhang et al., 2013) proposed K-RBF
    for spectrum sensing based on previous information of the PU spectrum which reduced
    prediction error to one-third as compared to RBF. Researchers proposed a design
    of CE based on the RBF and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for multi-objective optimisation.
    RBF has strong learning capability while GA is good at multi-objective optimisation
    (Y. Yang et al., 2012). Convolutional Neural Networks (Conv-Nets or CNN): CNN
    is another variant of ML-FFNN that has been used effectively in the areas of image
    recognition and classification. CNN exploits spatially local correlation by enforcing
    local connectivity with adjacent layer neurons, which does not take entire data
    from preceding layers. LeNet was the very first CNN which become an important
    tool for machine learning. Key operations of CNN include convolution, non-linearity
    (ReLU), pooling (or sub-sampling), and classification (Fully connected layer).
    For example, when an image is passed to CNN, features are extracted from the image
    using convolution preserves the spatial relationship between pixels of an image
    by utilising a small square of input data. Another operation i.e. ReLU has been
    performed after convolution, which introduces non-linearity in CNN. ReLU stands
    for Rectifier Linear Unit, which is an element-wise non-linear operation (applied
    per pixel) and replaces negative pixels in feature map by zero. Pooling operation
    can be done after convolution+ReLU operation, which can be done in different ways
    such as sum, average, max, etc. This operation reduces the dimensionality of each
    feature map by only retaining important information. Finally, the classification
    process is done. The output extracted from previous operations extract high-level
    features that are used for feature classification of the input image. The term”
    Fully connected” means every neuron of the preceding stage is connected to every
    neuron of the succeeding stage that classifies and forms various classes based
    on the training dataset. Further, CNN can be trained using gradient descent and
    backpropagation (Lecun et al., 1998). Backpropagation calculates the gradients
    of error concerning all weights in the network and updates weights and parameter
    values using gradient descent to minimise an output error. Lee (Lee et al., (
    2019) cooperatively implemented the CNN spectrum sensing technique, in which optimal
    strategy is used for combining sensing results of individual CRs obtained using
    CNN. Sensing based on deep neural networks is used to learn from a large set of
    data through a backpropagation algorithm. Deep sensing provides optimised combining
    strategy based on spectral and spatial correlations of channel i.e. based on the
    location of CRs and PUs characteristics. Selim et al. ( 2018) presented the CNN
    spectrum monitoring framework for radar bands in spectrum sharing scenarios. The
    main idea behind this framework is to detect the presence of radio signals in
    the radio spectrum even when this signal is overlapped by other signals due to
    simultaneous transmission. (b) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) The idea behind
    RNN is to make use of sequential information, with the output being dependent
    on previous computations. Here, the neurons are connected in a cyclic manner,
    which allows exhibiting dynamic temporal behaviours shown in Figure 6. Unlike
    FFNNs, RNN does not propagate information directly to the next connected layer
    but use their internal memory to process the input. Figure 6. Recurrent neural
    network. Display full size RNN are called recurrent because they perform the same
    operations for every element in the input sequence. Let X t , O t and H t be the
    input, output, and state of the hidden layer(s) on time t . In simple mathematical
    form, RNN can be expressed as O t = F ( H t , θ ) (2) H t = F ( H t − 1 , X t
    ; θ ) (3) where the parameter θ defines weight and bias for the network. Equation
    (2) states that output O t at a particular time t depends upon the state of the
    hidden layer H t and θ . Further, H t depends upon its previous states H t − 1
    and input X t at a time t as stated in Equation (3) . To train RNN, the backpropagation
    algorithm through time approach is used which ‘unfold’ RNN in time and converted
    into FFNNs consisting of identical copies of RNN. RNN consist of a large number
    of layers as compare to ML-FFNNs and also training process is based on the passage
    of information through these layers and propagation of unsuitable information
    through the network leads to the accumulation of large error which leads to inaccurate
    results. Usually, the gradient descent method is used for backpropagation training.
    Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN): DRNN (Tang & Li 2017) consists of multiple
    hidden layers that enable the prediction of the spectrum of multiple time slots
    in CR networks since existing methodology only predicts the spectrum of a single
    slot. Here, the channel state is divided into slots and forming time series of
    channel state. Due to multiple hidden layers in DRNN, it is difficult to train
    using a gradient descent method, which leads to slow convergence and gradient
    disappearance. To avoid these problems, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimation
    of weights is used which overcomes the problem of slow convergence and vanishes
    gradients in a gradient descent method. Unsupervised NNs As the name indicates
    unsupervised NNs only know the input and the main objective is to discover patterns
    in features of input data. The system learns using certain test dataset and allows
    a lower-dimensional representation of input data. Unsupervised ML-FFNNs (Auto-encoders)
    Auto-encoders are the type of FFNNs specially designed for dimensionality reduction.
    In other words, auto-encoders provide the same output as the input. In auto-encoders,
    encoder function learns from input to representation and decoder function back
    from representation to input i.e. reconstruction. Denoising auto-encoders (Bengio
    et al., 2013) are the extension of basic auto-encoders, which attempts to address,
    identify function risk by introducing noise. Random noise is added to the input
    in the form of percentage and then this noisy data is fed in auto-encoder, which
    finds correlations within the input data to find correct data instead of noise
    added data. In Sparse auto-encoders, a sparsity constraint on the hidden layer
    is applied for extracting interesting features from unlabelled data even if numbers
    of hidden layers are large. Authors proposed a novel modulation classification
    method using denoising sparse auto-encoder as a classifier to improve spectrum
    sensing, i.e. to avoid interference with PUs (Zhu & Fujii, 2016). Moreover, the
    denoising process improves the performance of noise suppression by training the
    network with a corrupted database. Further, Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) emerged
    as a powerful unsupervised learning framework for generating complicated data.
    They can learn a low dimensional representation of high dimensional data (Doersch,
    2016). Contractive Auto-encoders (CAE) make use of explicit regulariser which
    learns a function even in slight variations of input values. CAE adding a well-chosen
    penalty term to cost function which enables an auto-encoder to perform better
    (Rifai & Muller, 2011). (b) Unsupervised Recurrent NNs (URNN) URNN is a complex
    type of NNs, which are inspired by ideas from statistical physics which model
    system as an energy function. RNNs are computationally powerful and learn from
    the temporal behaviour of given training data. Compared to the FFNN, RNN is more
    powerful in representing complex dynamics and having a compact size. Two main
    types of URNNs are Hopfield Network and Boltzmann Machine, which are described
    next. Hopfield NNs: Hopfield NNs is a dynamic auto-associative model, which can
    store information in a dynamically stable structure. Each Hopfield network has
    some energy function (Lyapunov function) associated with it, which always tries
    to converges to a local minimum of the function. Hopfield NNs is biologically
    plausible, as its working is similar to the human retina. Hasegawa (Hasegawa et
    al., 2014) proposed an optimisation algorithm for decision making on radio resources
    in centralised and decentralised CR networks. In a decentralised network, the
    energy minimisation dynamics of Hopfield NNs are considered. Boltzmann Machine(BM):
    BM is a stochastic RNN, like the Hopfield network, in which the network unit finds
    a global minimum of the energy function. BM is designed for discrete variables
    having the disadvantage of being slow. Another problem with BM is it stops learning
    correctly when the machine statics grows exponentially with the size of the machine
    and with the magnitude of connection strength. Other variants of BM are Restricted
    Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). Restricted Boltzmann
    Machine (RBM): As the name indicates, a restriction is imposed with neurons that
    they have symmetric connection between different groups of nodes but no connections
    between the same group of nodes which allows more efficient training algorithms
    than BM. MohanaPriya and Shalinie ( 2017) presented a secure routing protocol
    for CR networks. The RBM algorithm self learns the routing procedure between source
    and destination node. Further, it provides energy-efficient routing to prevent
    flooding attacks. Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM): DBM (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009)
    have the potential to learn complex internal state representations, which is useful
    in speech recognition problem. It also develops high-level representations to
    tune its model for a specific task from unlabelled data as well as from limited
    labelled data. Unsupervised competitive NNs Unsupervised competitive learning
    is a form of unsupervised training where output neurons are said to compete for
    input patterns. It employs a winner-take-all strategy since only winning neuron
    is updated. Two major techniques of unsupervised competitive learning are a. Self-Organising
    Maps/Kohenon Maps Self-Organising Maps (SOM) are the special class of ANN, which
    is inspired by the cortex of the human brain. SOM makes use of competitive learning
    in which neurons compete with each other to win and then the winner neuron displaced
    to feature space to form clusters. The competition is induced by inserting negative
    feedback between neurons, which forces neurons to organise themselves. For obvious
    reason, such a network is called self-organising maps. SOM was introduced by Kohenon
    used to assist CRs to choose among various configurations to operate by considering
    bit rate predictions (Tsagkaris et al., 2012). Khozeimeh and Haykin ( 2012) proposed
    a self-organising dynamic spectrum management technique for CR networks in which
    CRs continuously senses the environment, extract PUs and neighbouring CRs activity
    patterns, and store to obtain knowledge that significantly reduces the probability
    of collision. b. Adaptive Resonance Theory Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is
    another class of unsupervised competitive NNs that is designed for object identification
    and recognition based on matching between observer expectations and sensory information.
    This ART matching criterion is set by vigilance parameter, ƿ (threshold of recognition).
    High vigilance permits weight updation of winning recognition neuron while low
    vigilance inhibits weight updation of recognition neuron and search procedure
    is carried out(Carpenter et al. 2016). Another variant of ART is ART 1 and ART
    2. ART 1 is the simplest type of ART which accepts an only arbitrary sequence
    of binary input patterns whereas ART 2 supports analog inputs patterns as well
    as binary input patterns (Carpenter & Grossberg, 1987). In CR networks, a channel
    sensing algorithm based on ART-2 is proposed for cognitive wireless mesh networks
    in which the spectrum is divided into disjoint sub-bands and sensing is performed
    in each sub-band. This sensed information is further fused in a fusion centre,
    which is defined as a pattern classification problem. In this algorithm, only
    pattern phase information is considered which leads to wrong pattern classification
    (Zhu et al., 2008). Further modified ART-2 is described which considers amplitude
    as well as phase information. Reinforcement learning and NNs Reinforcement Learning
    (RL) is another AI approach that enables an agent (decision maker) to observe
    its state, choose an action in a particular state to obtain rewards. The transition
    from one state to another depends on several factors such as previous state, action
    taken, and next state. The main goal is to estimate the reward function for each
    state-action pair accumulates knowledge and maximise reward function. To apply
    the RL model (single-agent approach), identified by state, action, and reward.
    In the multi-agent approach, the set of agents is enabled to learn about each
    other information to maximise its reward function. Unlike supervised NNs, it does
    not have any prior knowledge about its input and output. It learns online from
    the environment and builds the knowledge to achieve its objectives. RL in the
    context of CR networks which provides intelligence in terms of dynamic channel
    selection, spectrum sensing, routing, spectrum allocation (Y. Wang et al., 2019),
    power control mechanism (K.L.A. Yau et al., 2014). Further, enhanced RL techniques
    in CR networks have also been presented. The authors in (Saleem et al. 2015) addressed
    routing issues by clustering mechanisms using the RL approach. Further, routing
    based clustering improves network stability and scalability. Moreover, spectrum
    aware cluster-based routing is presented which overcomes the challenges of multihop
    routing. In RL, an agent maps the situation (channel state) to maximise its reward
    function on a long term basis. The agent learns continuously and the environment
    responds to the state through its action by state transition after each epoch.
    The agent uses optimal policy to decide each time while taking the next step which
    maximises its rewards. To obtain an optimal policy, the Dynamic Programming approach
    can be used when perfect information about the system is available. The system
    is modelled using Markov property which makes the RL model equivalent to Markov
    decision Process (MDP). On the other hand, when perfect system information is
    not available, but the sequence of past state, action, and rewards are available
    then the Monte-Carlo method can be applied to obtain an optimal policy. Another
    approach named Temporal Difference (TD) learning approach does not form the system
    model and obtain its optimal policy based on prediction. Q-Learning (Q-L) and
    SARSA are the most widely used TD learning techniques (Sutton & Barto, 1998).
    These schemes are implemented for resource allocation in CR networks and it is
    observed that SARSA converges slower than Q-L as shown in Figure 7. This is due
    to the reason that Q-L follows a greedy approach for action selection according
    to off-policy whereas SARSA selects its action corresponding to the current policy
    obtained. Figure 7. Comparison between the performance of Q-L and SARSA schemes.
    Display full size Lo et al., ( 2010) proposed RL based cooperative spectrum sensing
    model in which CR learns to find an optimal set of cooperative neighbours which
    reduces sensing delays. Further, RL based optimum solution is provided which improves
    spectrum sensing under the shadowing effect. The reward function depends on reporting
    time delay i.e., the time duration between CRs request of cooperation to neighbouring
    node and arrival to sensing outcome. The authors in (Li, 2009) proposed Q-Learning
    to address resource allocation problems in a multi-agent environment. Koushik
    (Koushik et al. 2018) discussed RL based spectrum handoff and issues related to
    RL during handoff. In this paper, the authors presented hardware implementation
    of RL and Transfer Learning (TL) schemes to update its Q-value table greedily
    and shown that RL takes longer time to converge than TL which has expert node
    to transfer its knowledge in form of Q-table. Figure 8. Illustration of fuzzy
    logic in CR networks. Display full size Combinational NNs Neuro-Fuzzy NNs Fuzzy
    logic is an attractive technique, particularly where it is difficult to express
    the mathematical model of real-world problems. In fuzzy Sets, elements are assigned
    a certain degree of belongingness. The numbers in the range [0,1] are used to
    represent the degree of belongings. Fuzzy logic becomes a useful scheme to represent
    uncertain data. The fuzzy logic controller consists of three main components as
    shown in Figure 8. Fuzzy Interface: Converts real-world values to suitable fuzzy
    sets. Interference Engine: Interference engine uses a knowledge base to decide
    output for a specific combination of input fuzzified variables and maps into output
    variables. Defuzzy Interface: Converts output fuzzy sets to real-world values.
    The authors (Salgado et al., 2016) proposed a fuzzy algorithm is proposed for
    decision making and particularly for backup channels for spectrum mobility. This
    proposed algorithm based on multiple criteria decision-making techniques considers
    four parameters: availability probability of channel, estimated channel time availability,
    the signal to interference plus noise ratio of the channel, and bandwidth of the
    channel. Normalised weights (describes a relative degree of importance) are assigned
    according to the importance of each criterion for the selection of a backup channel.
    The pre-selection of back up channels decreases delay during spectrum mobility.
    The authors (Matinmikko et al., 2009) proposed a fuzzy-based cooperative spectrum
    sensing technique. In this technique, spectrum sensing decision from the individual
    node is considered as input, fuses to form output based on combined sensing result.
    Spectrum sensing performance has been characterised based on the probability of
    false alarm and probability of detection in a fading environment. However, fuzzy
    logic represents uncertain data, but it is difficult to design the degree of belongingness
    set. So Fuzzy logic combined with neural networks and forms the neuro-fuzzy combinational
    model. Neuro-fuzzy based spectrum mobility technique due to its capability to
    deal with uncertain environmental conditions as well as in the heterogeneous environment.
    This technique considers interference, bit error rate, and signal strength to
    find the quality of the channel in terms of fuzzy patterns. Based on generated
    fuzzy patterns, neural .networks trained to estimate channel gain, not only for
    spectrum mobility but also for spectrum assignment in a heterogeneous network
    (Maheshwari & Singh, 2015). b. Wavelets NNs Wavelet NNs replaces standard activation
    function (like a sigmoid function) by wavelet activation function. A wavelet is
    a small function that grows and decays in a finite amount of time. Unlike Fourier
    transform, wavelet NN can distinguish between stationary and non-stationary signals.
    Figure 9. A daughter wavelet neuron. Display full size However, wavelet NNs uses
    wavelet function (called mother wavelet) to derive daughter wavelet function ψ
    λ , t ( u ) through linear translation factor, t and scale/dilation factor, λ
    as shown in Figure 9. The daughter wavelet is expressed as ψ λ , t ( u ) = ψ t
    − u λ (4) An author in (Eltholth, 2016) proposed a spectrum predictor model, which
    is based on a discrete wavelet transform nature that produces a time-frequency
    representation of the analysed signal. The analysed time series is broken into
    sub-series, which represents the previous occupancy status of a certain set of
    sub-channels. Thus, design an accurate wavelet NNs based spectrum predictor model
    with less complexity. Wavelet approach for wideband spectrum sensing is sub-divided
    into small bands and characterised by frequency irregularities. Wavelet transform
    and multiscale wavelet approach have been used to detect local irregularities
    that carry information about power spectral density and structure irregularities
    of sub-bands that identify spectrum holes (Tian & Giannakis, 2006). Other NNs
    Quantum NNs Quantum NNs (QNNs) is based on quantum mechanics exploiting quantum
    information processing to improve classical ANN. In classical ANN, much of the
    power is required due to its massively parallel, distributed information processing
    and non-linear transformation operation performed by nodes. On the other hand,
    QNN makes use of powerful quantum parallelism, which provides quantum computing
    to process huge data sets. The author (Liu, 2016) presented QNN based spectrum
    sensing algorithm in which quantum neuron with multiple energy levels is considered
    as the excitation function of hidden layer neurons. Further, the improved version
    has been presented to increase convergence speed and stability. Table 3 summarises

    (SVM) is supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression
    analysis. It is based on statistical learning theory with structural risk minimisation
    (Awe et al., 2013). It is initially preferred for the classification of complex
    problems. For a given training set, the input training vector belongs to one or
    another class of two groups. These two groups are separated by an optimal hyperplane
    that has the largest distance to the nearest training set of any class (maximal
    margin classifier) that achieves good separation. It is easier to train SVM when
    the classes are linearly separable. In non-separable classification, non-linear
    SVM is obtained by introducing a kernel function. The function is said to be valid
    kernel if it satisfies Mercer’s Theorem (Hofmann, 2006), which provides necessary
    and sufficient characterisation of a function as a kernel function. A kernel represents
    a similarity measure in the form of a similarity matrix (Gram Matrix) between
    its input objects. The gram matrix fuses all the necessary information for learning
    algorithms merged in the form of the inner product. For more details, refer (Burges,
    1998). SVM to develop a real-time approach to sense PU as shown in Figure 10.
    The input composite signal includes signal and noise, which is independent of
    each other in the time domain. The sampled data is classified as PU or not based
    on testing and training of the SVM classification model. Figure 10. A diagram
    showing the basic idea of SVM for spectrum sensing. Display full size For linear
    classification, a kernel function is proposed to map input low dimensional vector
    into high dimensional features space (Zhang & Zhai, 2011). Y. Wang (Wang et al.,
    2014) proposed a spectrum mobility prediction scheme that considers time-varying
    and space varying characteristics of mobile CRs simultaneously. The joint feature
    extraction pattern is proposed which executes spectrum mobility prediction through
    the classification of SVM with fast convergence speed. The authors in Huang et
    al., ( 2009) presented an SVM based learning engine that is divided into three
    parts as environmental awareness, knowledge actuation, and decision making. The
    learning engine acquires knowledge about the environment through learning that
    puts intelligence in CRs. Table 4 summarises DSM with SVM in CR networks. Table

    with metaheuristic algorithms a. Genetic algorithm (GA) GAs are stochastic search
    algorithms, which effectively solve machine learning and image processing problems
    (Jedlicka & Ryba, 2016). The main advantage of using GA is parallelism, which
    speeds up its simulation results. The computation in GA starts with the collection
    of chromosomes, which has certain characteristics. The algorithm can be implemented
    using the following steps as shown in Figure 11 (Siddique & Azam, 2010). Initialise
    the population of chromosomes. Evaluate the fitness level of each chromosome to
    rank them. Construction of the new population until the production of next-generation
    completes using the following steps: Selection: The best chromosome is selected
    from the currently available population based on its fitness level. Crossover:
    With crossover probability, selected chromosome reproduces to generate a new individual.
    Mutation: Newly generated individuals will be mutated at a definite point in the
    chromosome. The above steps are repeated until the desired results are obtained.
    In CR networks, the GA uses biological behaviour representing each channel by
    a chromosome. Each gene of the chromosome represents specific parameters. In the
    spectrum decision process, it is all about the fair distribution and utilisation
    of available resources, and for fair resource distribution, optimal distribution
    is required. According to L.Doyle, ‘An optimization process can be defined as
    the process involved in selecting the best choice from the list of available choices
    to reach some kind of goal or at least as near as possible to goal’ (Doyle, 2009).
    In CR networks, spectrum allocation also involves an optimisation task to assign
    spectrum holes to CR found during the spectrum sensing process. Figure 11. Illustration
    of genetic algorithm for CR networks. Display full size The spectrum allocation
    scheme for CR networks using GA in which each gene of chromosome represents different
    parameters (data rate, frequency, bandwidth, error rate, and modulation/coding
    scheme) which is associated with specific weight (Siddique & Azam, 2010). The
    weight for each gene represented in binary form. Like the weight for each gene
    in the chromosome fitness point for each gene is assigned. Once the fitness of
    each gene in the chromosome is calculated, the next step is the construction of
    a new population, which involves selection, crossover, and mutation process. The
    whole process is repeated until the optimum solution among the available solution
    set is achieved. The authors in (Morabit et al., 2015) presented spectrum decisions
    based on GA to provide a new spectrum band as requested by CR in the network.
    GA defines radio in terms of genes and chromosomes and considers user quality
    of service (QoS) as an input to the GA procedure. Further, chromosome population
    size is defined by available spectrum resource size and chromosome genes define
    the efficiency of spectrum allocation. b. Ant colony optimisation (ACO) ACO considered
    as computational technique proposed by Dorigo which is based on the searching
    behaviour of Ants (Dorigo et al. 1997). Although real arts are blind, the search
    their food source via the shortest path by play on the information through a substance
    called pheromones. The ants on its transmission route release this liquid substance,
    which is accumulated on the shortest route and soon ants, start to follow the
    smallest route. The behaviour of real ant has inspired the ant system, which resolves
    many complex problems successfully. The characteristics of the ACO algorithm i.e.
    parallel computation, self-organisation, and positive feedback that can help CR
    to achieve self-adaption and learning capability to achieve global optimisation
    (Q. He et al., 2013) (Bayrakdar & Çalhan, 2018). Different steps in the ACO algorithm
    are as follows: Ant probability distribution rule: In the ant system, artificial
    ants release the solution through moving among vertex follow the principle as:
    p i j k ( t ) = [ τ i j ( t ) ] α [ η i j ( t ) ] β ∑ s ∈ C [ τ i j ( t ) ] α
    [ η i j ( t ) ] β i f j ∈ C (5) where p i j k ( t ) is state transition probability
    of ant moving from vertex i to j at the time t . C is a set of vertex and s is
    unselected vertex in the traversing process. τ i j ( t ) and η i j ( t ) are pheromone
    intensity and heuristic visibility (cost) of a direct route between the node i
    and j . The parameters α and β controls the importance of pheromone and heuristic
    information respectively. 2. Local optimisation procedure: To avoid residual pheromone
    submerging heuristic information, pheromone will keep updated after one ant finishes
    a path searching with follows the principle as: τ i j ( t + 1 ) = ( 1 − ρ ) .
    τ i j ( t ) + ρ . τ 0 (6) where τ 0 is the initial pheromone value and ρ is the
    evaporation coefficient of pheromone. 3. Global optimisation procedure: When all
    ants complete the cycle, the pheromones will be globally updated as: τ i j ← (
    1 − α ) . τ i j + α . 1 G max (7) where α is constant and G max is the maximum
    objective function. 4. Stopping procedure The procedure is stopped after completing
    a predetermined number of cycles to achieve the globally best solution. The author
    in (Jhajj, 2017) discussed the ACO technique to find the optimal sensing time
    of CR. As CR has a fixed time frame for its sensing the environment and transmission
    of data, an optimal sensing time is required that will maximise throughput with
    minimum interference with PUs. This optimal sensing time can be found by ACO which
    implements the above steps to find an optimised solution. The ACO has been proposed
    for reconfiguration decision making in CR networks (Q. He et al., 2013). Reconfiguration
    means configure terminals and network devices to intelligently adapt to environmental
    conditions, which is a challenging task. ACO deals with complex environmental
    conditions as well as target multi-objective optimisation through parallel computation.
    Moreover, ACO learns from the environment and reconfigure spectrum decision through
    self-organisation process. Three types of reconfiguration schemes have been considered
    i.e. parameter variation reconfiguration scheme, radio resource management reconfiguration
    scheme and network access reconfiguration scheme and showed the improved performance
    in the heterogeneous network. A dynamic channel assignment as an optimisation
    problem to maximise the reward of CRs is formulated in (He & Zhang, 2012). The
    algorithm also considers interference with PUs and SINR constraints of CRs to
    maximise the spectrum utilisation. Table 5 summarises DSM with metaheuristic algorithms
    in CR networks. Table 5. Summarises DSM with a metaheuristic algorithm in CR networks

    signifies the importance of prior distribution which represents knowledge of unknown
    parameters in uncertain environmental conditions. It is assumed that no prior
    information is available about the spectrum but some prior information is available
    about the status of the channel which should be explored through learning. Bayesian
    inference is an approach where Bayes’ rule is used for driving posterior distribution
    from the prior distribution which further considered as prior for another posterior
    distribution and so on. In CR networks, CRs can compute the prior distribution
    of a system parameter θ , denoted by P ( θ ) , which represents the spectrum occupancy
    status of PUs. Though spectrum sensing, data observed in n time slots X = [ x
    1 , x 2 , . . . . . . . . x n ] . The likelihood functions of the parameter θ
    , P ( X / θ ) , for observed data, conditional on parameter θ . After acquiring
    prior probability distribution and the likelihood function, Bayesian inference
    can be used to derive posterior density function, P ( θ / X ) which is conditioned
    on data X . Bayes’ Theorem can be simply expressed as P ( θ / X ) = P ( X / θ
    ) . P ( θ ) / P ( X ) (8) In CR networks, Likelihood function denotes the probability
    of busy/idle previous states for a busy/idle current state. In Baye’s theorem,
    the posterior distribution combines the information in both the prior distribution
    function and the likelihood function, which represents stronger information and
    narrower possible values for θ . The Bayesian network has 2 types of models, Bayesian
    Parametric (BP) Model, and Bayesian Non-Parametric (BNP) Model. BP model has a
    finite set of parameters θ to compute prior distribution and In the BNP model,
    it does not mean a lack of parameters but an infinite-dimensional set of parameters
    is assumed to compute prior distribution. Recently BNP model applications in CR
    networks get a lot of attention of researchers because it provides flexibility
    to model to learn in an unknown environment. A Bayesian approach based spectrum
    sensing in CR networks is presented in (Jacob et al., 2014). The authors presented
    Bayesian inferences over single and multiple sensing frames to calculate the posterior
    distributions of unknown parameters, which forms the basis of Bayesian learning
    (Manco-vásquez et al., 2014). In Bayesian inference over multiple frames, learning
    from past samples has been done using threshold-based approximation and Kullback
    Leibler based approximation. Further, A Bayesian approach based decision-making
    engine in CR networks is proposed in (Huang et al., 2010). CE learns from an environment
    and form rules to reconfigure transmission parameters (modulation, code rate)
    which ensures QoS of CRs. The reconfiguration can be achieved with parameter learning,
    structure learning, and inference algorithms that form rules to adapt to environmental
    conditions . Table 6 summarises DSM with a Bayesian approach in CR networks. Table

    Intelligence with Hidden Markov Model Hidden Markov Model (HMM) represented as
    a stochastic process that can be modelled as a Markov chain, whose actual states
    are hidden, to analyse the temporal or dynamic behaviour of PU activity pattern.
    In HMMs, several hidden states represent the probability of distribution over
    a sequence of observations. The HMM gets its name from two properties in which
    it assumes: 1) Observations at the time t generated by some process whose state
    S t is hidden from the observer. 2) State of hidden process S t satisfy Markov’s
    property which states that for a given S t − 1 , the current state S t is independent
    of all states before ( t − 1 ) i.e. For a given S t , the output Y t is independent
    of all other time indices states and observations. HMM has found remarkable applications
    in CR networks since many environmental parameters are partially observed or act
    as hidden states. Various authors proposed HMM-based spectrum sensing schemes
    (Saad et al., 2016), (Ghosh et al. , 2009). HMM-based spectrum prediction for
    industrial applications that accurately predict through multiple slots is proposed
    in (Saad et al., 2016). Large numbers of hidden layers are considered which interpret
    as different PUs activity levels and formulate the prediction problem as a maximum
    likelihood classification approach. Akbar et al., 2007 presented a Markov based
    channel prediction algorithm and considers channel state occupancy of PUs as Poisson
    distributed. Pham et al. ( 2014) presented the HMM based spectrum handoff model
    in CR networks. The proposed approach infers the efficiency of HMM in correcting
    the sensing sequence and prediction of channel status. Further, the proposed algorithm
    applied to the spectrum mobility function in CR networks. An HMM based channel
    selection framework that minimizes the delay incurred during channel selection
    is proposed in (Senthilkumar & Geetha Priya, 2016). The proposed approach achieves
    a significant reduction in data loss and an increase in transmission speed, by
    obtaining the best-matched channel for the users. Table 7 summarises DSM with
    HMM in CR networks. Table 7. Presents DSM with HMM in CR networks Download CSVDisplay
    Table Intelligence with game theory Game theory technique accounts for multi-agent
    decision making, in which the decision of each player for action is based on the
    history of actions performed by other players. This involves the learning process
    by each player, which may ultimately lead to a stable state. Every game involves
    a set of players, actions, and payoff functions (or utility function). A player
    gets more rewards if it has a higher payoff function. Mathematically, a game can
    be represented as: G = ( N , A , P ) (9) where N represents a set of players,
    A represents a set of actions, and P represents payoff functions. In CR networks,
    the players in the games are CRs, which take actions based on observations of
    its environment in which it operates. As time progresses, CR learns from past
    actions and from observing the action of other CRs and modify its actions accordingly.
    Several types of game theory approach in CR networks are shown in Figure 12. Game-Theoretic
    Approaches: Two types of game-theoretic approaches are cooperative and non-cooperative
    games. In cooperative games, a group of players can make binding commitments and
    act jointly whereas, in non-cooperative games, the individual player acts selfishly.
    In cooperative games, cooperation among the players strengthens the position of
    the player in a game. Here the group of players forms a coalition act as a single
    entity. In non-cooperative, each user takes care of its benefit and selects optimal
    actions to maximise its payoff function. The author in (Yu, 2013) presented cooperative
    games for spectrum sensing and sharing and found that the applicability of various
    games depends on several factors. A non-cooperative game can be classified based
    on information i.e. either complete information or an incomplete information game.
    In the complete information games, each player observes other players’ information
    i.e. payoff and their action. On the other hand, with incomplete information,
    the game can be modelled as Bayesian game for decision making in which outcome
    can be estimated based on Bayesian analysis (Wang et al., 2010). Several types
    of games have been adapted to model various situations in CR networks. For example,
    in repeated games, each stage is usually repeated. Let us consider N the set of
    CRs in the network and a ( k ) denotes the action taken by a player at k t h the
    stage of the game. In each stage k , players tend to maximise their payoff function,
    while considering the history of action collected in h ( k ) = ( a ( 1 ) , a (
    2 ) , . . . . . . . . , a ( k ) ) . In other words, players map their actions
    from history a i ( k ) = f i ( h ( k − 1 ) ) . In CR networks, their action is
    the selection of channel available and mapping of action depends on the history
    of PUs activity as well as activity pattern of other CRs. In dynamic/repeated
    games, players came across a similar game number of times. The cooperation among
    the players in repeated games can be introduced to get long term benefits. The
    repeated games are applied for spectrum sharing scenarios where multiple CRs exists
    in (Li et al., 2010). In this context, repeated games apply punishments to achieve
    a desirable outcome. When the PUs activity is considered as stationary with an
    unknown environment then Stochastic games, also known as Markov games, are introduced
    to model the network. The authors in (W. Wang et al., 2018) addressed the routing
    problem using stochastic games. Stochastic routing game is decomposed into several
    stages and at each stage stochastic learning is proposed to learn equilibrium
    strategy of channel selection. Figure 12. Various game theory approaches in CR
    networks. Display full size The Stackelberg game can be modelled for implementing
    spectrum sharing where PUs can involve CRs as cooperative relays (H. Wang et al.,
    2010). In auction games, PUs act as auctioneer, selling idle spectrum bands to
    CRs which are allowed to select the appropriate bidding strategy for each channel
    to maximise their utility function. The concept of auction games has been applied
    to spectrum sharing in CR networks (Khaledi & Abouzeid, 2013), as well as in spectrum
    sensing (Sendrei et al., 2015). Table 8 summarises DSM with game theory in CR

    Table Table 9. Presents the evaluation of various intelligent techniques along
    with their strengths and limitations Download CSVDisplay Table Intelligent techniques
    evaluation: strength, limitations, and challenges Intelligent techniques having
    many advantages but their implementation still facing some challenges. The intelligent
    techniques applications in CR networks, strengths, limitations, and implementation
    challenges are summarised in Table 9. Supervised NNs: Basically, supervised NNs
    accomplished its task under supervision which requires complete knowledge about
    the environment in which it has to operate. However, in the context of CR networks,
    CRs may not have complete knowledge about the radio environment in which it has
    to access the spectrum. NNs provides a high level of feature classification but
    also required data labelling. It requires training under different environmental
    conditions and outcome depends on the selection of initial parameters. Therefore,
    the selection of data for training must be task-oriented and free from noise.
    Also, with the increase of network size, the training process slows down which
    may lead to slower convergence. To improve its efficiency, multiple hidden layers
    are introduced which requires large training data which further slows down its
    training process. Unsupervised NNs: A major challenge CRs can face a lack of knowledge
    of the surrounding radio environment. Even in this situation, CRs are expected
    to adopt changes in the environment so that they may not collide with PUs. CRs
    must be able to extract knowledge about PU activities which makes unsupervised
    NNs an appealing approach in CR networks. In unsupervised NNs, learning is based
    on a correlation among input data, and no information about the correct output
    is available. So unsupervised NNs are used indirectly for spectrum management
    in CR networks like modulation classification, optimisation algorithm for spectrum
    decision, and routing algorithms. Unsupervised Competitive NNs: As the name indicates,
    it is a form of unsupervised learning where output and input neuron compete and
    employs winner take all strategy. SOM is one of the members of this class that
    make use of competitive learning in which neurons compete with each other to win
    and winner neuron displaced to feature space to form clusters. The authors in
    (Khozeimeh & Haykin, 2012) presented SOM based DSM for cognitive ad-hoc networks.
    In this proposed scheme, PU and CR activities patterns are extracted and stored
    in memory which significantly reduces the probability of collision. SOM seems
    to be more realistic as it does not require prior knowledge about the radio environment.
    Further, the application of SOM with a different type of input pattern does not
    require redesigning the existing learning mechanism. SOM can be easily interpreted
    and understood. Moreover, it requires sufficient data to form meaningful clusters.
    Another member of this category is ART which designed for object identification,
    recognition, and pattern classification problem. It has stable and self-regulating
    control structure but it does not always guarantee stability and it has to empirically
    fix its vigilance parameter. This technique is not suitable directly for DSM in
    CR networks. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement Learning is distinct from supervised
    and unsupervised learning as it focuses on online learning rather than offline
    learning. RL learns from positive and negative reinforcement (or rewards) to set
    its training examples. RL seems to be one of the promising intelligent techniques
    to solve the spectrum management problem in CR networks. RL is used in spectrum
    sensing, spectrum decision (in the multi-agent environment and with multiple objectives),
    spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility. One of the major drawbacks of the RL
    technique is slow convergence. The authors presented hardware implementation of
    RL and Transfer learning for spectrum handoff in (Koushik et al., 2018) and found
    that RL takes a long time to adjust its learning parameters as compare to Transfer
    learning Combinational NNs: Combinational NNs have neuro-fuzzy NNs and wavelet
    NNs in this category. Fuzzy logic is an attractive technique that uses human-understandable
    fuzzy logic instead of using complicated mathematical modelling. The main advantage
    of fuzzy logic is that it is faster to train and also it requires less computational
    resources. With fuzzy logic, the solution can be obtained when the system has
    incomplete environmental knowledge. Some disadvantages of fuzzy logic are difficult
    to create its model as with increasing dimensions may lead to inefficient results.
    Further, it is difficult to estimate its membership function according to user
    requirement and it requires more tuning. Support Vector Machine: SVM comes under
    the supervised learning category which is used for object classification, pattern
    recognition, and regression analysis problem. SVM technique provides superior
    performance in many applications due to its generalisation ability and robustness
    against noise. SVM maps input vector from low dimensional feature to high dimensional
    features which make them linearly separable. For non-linear mapping, a kernel
    function is used. In CR networks, SVM is used as a classifier for signal classification.
    The sampled data is classified as PU or not based on the training of SVM. Unlike
    ANN, it is not suffered from overfitting problem and provides good performance
    in small problems. But in complex problems, it provides poor performance and may
    require a high training set which increases its computation complexity and storage
    requirements. Also, SVM requires large labelled data for training and complete
    knowledge of the radio environment which may divert the focus of researchers.
    Metaheuristic Algorithms: These algorithms solve multi-objective optimisation
    problems through parallel computation. GA provides multi-objective optimisation
    based on a fitness function but it may not always converge to the global optimum
    in case of large performance metrics. The performance of GA highly depends on
    fitness function which may be based on prior knowledge. Wrong prior knowledge
    may lead to the generation of bad chromosomes. Thus, the selection of better genes
    (each gene represents bandwidth, modulation scheme, data rate, etc.) to generate
    the next genes are very critical. Further, GA is considered a very slow process
    since fitness function is calculated through selection, crossover, and mutation
    process. GA improves its convergence speed either by combining with RBNNs or by
    increasing the number of genes. In ACO, parallel computation, self-organisation,
    and positive feedback can help CR to achieve self-adaption and learning capability
    to achieve global optimisation. ACO algorithm involves local optimum value based
    on which global optimum value is obtained. ACO can easily adapt environmental
    changes but its performance is poor for local searches. Bayesian Approach: Bayesian
    approach relies on a probabilistic model which signifies the importance of prior
    distribution to derive posterior distribution using Baye’s theorem. The Bayesian
    approach requires prior knowledge about the radio environment. Incorrect information
    may lead to skew inferences. It has high computational complexity due to high
    dimensional integrals. Bayesian learning can combine with other techniques such
    as HMM for channel quality prediction in CR networks. Dynamic Bayesian games are
    used for decision making. Further, the Non-Parametric Bayesian model-based Dirichlet
    process mixture model for unsupervised classification techniques can be used.
    Hidden Markov Model: HMM is a stochastic model based on the Markov model which
    is highly relevant to the CR network applications as environmental parameters
    that are partially observed and act as hidden states. The selection of appropriate
    models for training is a very important task in HMM. Due to the presence of multiple
    hidden layers, it is difficult to decode the sequence. HMMs have been extensively
    used in CR networks for spectrum sensing, channel selection, and spectrum mobility.
    One of the major drawbacks while using HMM is that it requires a training sequence.
    But its training process is quite complex. It can be combined with other techniques
    such as GA to improve its training efficiency. Game Theory: Game Theory is a mathematical
    model which provides a solution for self-centred multi-agent systems where the
    decision of individual agent affects other players decision. Particularly in CR
    networks, each CR act as a player and their action may include the selection of
    parameters according to user requirements. The goal of game theory is to provide
    the best outcome (optimal solution) while considering the interest of all players.
    Game-theory has been applied in several applications in CR networks such as spectrum
    sensing, decision making, spectrum access, etc. One of the major drawback while
    using game theory is to make a model which requires statistical information about
    the radio environment. As the environment is dynamic, which leads to the shift
    optimal solution before the convergence. It is difficult to structure a game that
    always provides an optimal solution. Another drawback is a limited number of players.
    As players increases, it may decrease its convergence speed which is another important
    factor need to be considered. Further, the game theory requires complete knowledge
    of the environment and also need labelled data for training. Incomplete or imperfect
    information can lead to uncertainty. Table 9 presents the evaluation of various
    intelligent techniques along with their strengths and limitations. Research issues,
    challenges, and future directions The intelligent techniques provide a promising
    solution towards the realisation of the DSM but there are certain research issues
    and challenges in DSM that need to be addressed carefully. New radio capabilities
    breed new demands for spectrum access, which presents an open challenge in CR
    networks. Some of these research issues, challenges, and future directions are
    summarised below: Wideband and higher frequencies: With the increasing demand
    for wireless traffic and applications, not only the higher spectrum efficiency
    but also more bandwidth resources are required which presents a major challenge
    in CR networks. As the number of users increases in current wireless systems,
    scalability becomes an extremely important issue. For such purpose, novel brain
    empowered/intelligent techniques need to be designed together with reconfiguration
    capability to achieve the best performance. Interference management: Due to coexistence
    among heterogeneous networks provide a new challenge in DSM. First and foremost,
    consideration is how well the devices are coexisting together. There is also a
    need to develop adaption in modulation schemes as well as other parameters, which
    enables devices to avoid interference. Moreover, cooperation between different
    networks and among CRs further mitigate the effect of interference. The amount
    of cooperation between heterogeneous networks and among CRs is also an additional
    challenge that needs to be addressed. Privacy and security: The deployment of
    new spectrum access technologies and their realisation raises new security challenges
    that have not been studied previously. Furthermore, regulators and policymakers
    have to consider what data from spectrum usage can be collected to access spectrum
    utilisation without trespassing on the user’s privacy. There is a need to ensure
    the correct implementation of the deployed system and when they are not, enforcement
    procedures will be needed to solve the DSM problem. Intelligent techniques based
    on green CR networks: The recent exponential growth of wireless technologies used
    in daily life needs to consider issues related to health and the environment.
    Hence, the designing of the future CRs need to be energy efficient to cut carbon
    emission. There exist limited work for DSM with consideration of green communication.
    Thus, there is a need to design DSM techniques considering green communication.
    Massive MIMO with intelligence: Massive MIMO uses a large number of antennas to
    provide an extra degree of freedom and diversity to improve its performance. To
    use this extra degree of freedom efficiently, intelligence needs to be incorporated
    to improve the perception capability and reconfigurability of CRs. Regulatory
    and policy reform challenges: Beyond technical issues, there are also policy reform
    challenges in DSM. Future deployed systems may employ spectrum dynamically in
    which PUs can sell their spectrum to CRs temporarily. Thus, the service level
    agreements for spectrum sharing need to be reconsidered. Furthermore, strategies
    need to be designed for dynamic spectrum auctions and markets. Multi-objective
    optimisation: In CR networks, multi objectives are conflicting with each other
    such as minimisation of power consumption, maximisation of throughput, minimisation
    of BER, etc. The optimisation of multiple objectives is a challenging task that
    needs to be addressed carefully. Other challenges include lack of incentives for
    spectrum sharing, authorisations constraints, and hardware, software, and protocols
    related issues need to be considered which require interdisciplinary collaboration
    among researchers of diverse backgrounds to address these challenges. Conclusion
    The paper has provided a comprehensive review and the classification of intelligent
    techniques for DSM in CR networks. For efficient realisation, CRs are combined
    with intelligent techniques so that dynamic and intelligent spectrum management
    can be done. The intelligent spectrum management schemes are surveyed in the context
    of spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility.
    The main emphasis of the work is to elaborate on the role of intelligent techniques
    in CR to enhance its learning capability. We have presented state-of-art achievements
    in applying intelligent techniques for DSM along with their strength and limitations.
    It provides an overview of active research in the area of dynamic spectrum management
    in CR networks. Unluckily, available techniques for spectrum management still
    lack the ample reflection of various network parameters in real-world scenarios
    which are quite complex to model, so some model-free schemes would become increasingly
    important. In future work, eliciting and encouraging cooperative behaviour through
    rewards and mechanism design will become important and looks promising to be an
    important area of further research. Disclosure statement No potential conflict

    networks hold the key to achieving better radio bandwidth utilization and improving
    the quality of wireless applications. The next step in this fast emerging paradigm
    is the multi-hop cognitive radio network. Well designed multi-hop cognitive radio
    networks can provide high bandwidth efficiency by using dynamic spectrum access
    technologies as well as provide extended coverage and ubiquitous connectivity
    for the wireless end users. However, the special features of multi-hop cognitive
    radio networks also raise several unique design challenges. In this article, we
    survey these unique challenges and open research issues in the design of multi-hop
    cognitive radio networks as well as discuss potential approaches to address these
    challenges. This article specifically focuses on the medium access control (MAC)
    and network layers of the multi-hop cognitive radio protocol stack. Issues considered
    include efficient spectrum sharing, optimal relay node selection, interference
    mitigation, end-to-end delay, etc. Published in: IEEE Communications Magazine

    April 2013 ISSN Information: DOI: 10.1109/MCOM.2013.6495776 Publisher: IEEE Introduction
    With the ever increasing demand for new wireless services and applications, the
    need for spectrum is increasing exponentially in wireless networking. This increased
    need for bandwidth in some frequency bands coupled with under utilization in other
    bands has paved the way toward Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) policies for
    the use of radio spectrum in wireless networking. In contrast to the legacy fixed
    spectrum allocation policies, DSA allows license-exempt end-users (secondaries)
    to access the licensed spectrum bands when not in use by the licensed owners,
    also known as primary users (PU) of the bands. DSA is expected to enable more
    efficient use of frequency channels without impacting the primary licensees. Thus
    the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently defined provisions to open
    the sub-900 MHz TV bands for unlicensed services, provided that the secondaries
    pro-actively detect the return of and avoid disruption to the PU. The newly proposed
    cognitive radio (CR) technology is anticipated to make DSA a reality. In its most
    general form, the CR was envisaged as an autonomous agent that perceives the user''s
    situation and proactively assists in performing some tasks. Ideally in our scenario,
    the nodes in a cognitive radio network (CRN) will not only search for spectrum
    holes and use them when needed, but also act intelligently with enough coordination
    to enhance the overall system performance of the entire network. Several layers
    of the network protocol stack will need to be enhanced to accommodate the additional
    functionalities of CRs. The physical (PHY) layer will need to sense for spectrum
    holes (scanning the spectrum and processing wide-band signals) and continuously
    adapt its operating power, spectrum band, and modulation without human intervention.
    The medium access (MAC) layer must intelligently cooperate in sensing the spectrum
    and coordinate dynamic spectrum access. Subsequently, the network layer must be
    aware of several parameters gathered in the MAC and PHY layers to perform spectrum-aware
    routing. Unlike infrastructure-based networking, multi-hop point-to-point architecture
    can create wide-area CR back-haul networks where traffic can flow among the peers
    directly using relay/for-warding via multiple hops resulting in higher capacity,
    ubiquitous connectivity, and increased coverage. However, currently there is little
    understanding of how such a cognitive mesh architecture will operate so as to
    make the system feasible under DSA. Accordingly, the issues in the design of multi-hop
    CRNs must be better studied for the concept of CRNs to reach its full potential.
    An example multi-hop CRN is depicted in Fig. 1. In DSA, the ability to switch
    between multiple frequencies allows better spectrum efficiency, and also lower
    radio interference by simply switching to orthogonal frequency bands when needed.
    Hence a multi-hop CRN can: Increase efficient spectrum utilization. Reduce interference
    among users. Increase network throughput through usage of multiple simultaneous
    packet transmissions on different channels. Increase ubiquitous connectivity.
    Increase service area coverage. However, without careful design of MAC and routing
    protocols specifically for multi-hop CRNs, the very features of these networks
    can turn into disadvantages. In this article, we study current open research issues
    in dynamic spectrum access and management in multi-hop, wide-area CRNs. We devote
    particular attention to the challenges arising in the MAC and Network layer and
    discuss potential solutions and directions that will further enhance the performance
    of multi-hop CRNs. Figure 1. Wireless multi-hop CRN.j Show All The rest of the
    article is organized as follows. We present an elaborate discussion of the MAC
    and Network layer challenges in multi-hop CRN. The approaches to solving the MAC
    layer challenges are discussed. We discuss existing solutions as well as new directions
    to solve the network layer challenges. Conclusions are drawn in the last section.
    Cognitive Radio Networks vs. Multi-Channel Ad Hoc Networks . CRNs based on DSA
    allow unlicensed secondary users to share licensed spectrum in a time and space
    variant manner with minimal interference to PUs. Although the ability of multi-hop
    CRNs to operate over multiple spectrum bands gives the impression that these CRNs
    are similar to traditional ad-hoc networks with multi-channel support, in reality
    there are numerous features that make CRNs unique. We describe these below. Dynamic
    availability of spectrum The importance of protecting the primary transmissions
    from secondary CRNs (FCC primary-sec-ondary spectrum etiquette) is a major unique
    criterion resulting in a spatio-temporally dynamic spectrum environment for the
    CRNs. Hence, the CR nodes may find the spectrum availability to be high at some
    time and place, and very low at another time in the same place. This is in contrast
    with traditional multi-channel ad-hoc networks, where the networks operate on
    a pre-decided set of channels that remains unchanged over time. Essentially, the
    choice of channels (single or multiple) is only impacted by self-coexistence constraints
    and not on the activity of an extraneous entity like the PU in CRNs. Wide rage
    of frequencies The second point of difference is the potentially wide range of
    frequencies available to the CRN, which are envisioned to operate on a wide range
    of both unlicensed and licensed bands. Examples include the 54–862MHz (noncontiguous
    TV and FM radio spectrum bands), and public safety bands in the 700MHz range (example:
    764–776MHz and 794–806MHz) as well as 4.9GHz bands, 5GHz range bands. Also in
    traditional multi-channel ad-hoc networks, the number of supported channels is
    fixed and low (mostly less than ten or at most in the order of tens), whereas
    it ranges in the order of thousands for a CRN. In traditional ad-hoc networks,
    with a pre-decided set of channels, nodes exchange information as necessary by
    periodic beacon messaging. However, in CRNs, with such a wide range of frequencies
    and dynamically varying PU activity, it is not possible to beacon over all the
    channels, so coordination among the CR nodes is a unique challenge. Figure 2.
    Overview of design challenges in wireless multi-hop CRN and how they are interconnected.
    Show All Heterogeneity of radio frequencies The varying physical propagation characteristics
    of electromagnetic waves over different spectrum bands is another concern for
    CRNs. A low frequency signal (e.g., 700MHz) can travel farther and penetrate walls
    and other obstacles, but its information capacity is lower and the accuracy in
    determining direction of arrival is poorer. However, a higher frequency signal
    (e.g., 5.0GHz) can only travel a shorter distance, but will be able to carry more
    information and will exhibit better directionality. The diversity in spectrum
    bands and their policies for accessing them implies that the CR nodes must adapt
    their bandwidth, carrier, power, and modulation techniques as well. This type
    of heterogeneity does not arise in the traditional multi-channel ad-hoc networks,
    where the allowable channels are generally from one spectrum band with similar
    physical characteristics. For example, the multi-channel IEEE 802.11 ad-hoc networks
    based on 2.4GHz spectrum band operate on 13 channels, although effectively three
    out of these 13 channels are orthogonal and can be used for simultaneous transmission
    without excessive interference. These channels possess similar propagation characteristics
    in terms of coverage, power management, modulation, etc. The legacy radio nodes
    are statically configured to operate over these channels with fixed propagation
    characteristics and cannot operate on any other channel with different physical
    characteristics. Dynamically changing topology and incomplete information: As
    the ad-hoc networks lack any centralized controller support, the nodes in the
    ad-hoc networks must rely on their neighbors to gather topology information. In
    traditional ad-hoc networks, this is simply achieved by nodes exchanging beacon
    information periodically over the pre-defined operational channel. However, in
    the CRNs, as there is a wide range of frequencies available dynamically, transmitting
    beacons over all possible channels is not a feasible solution. So the CR node
    is only able to gather incomplete information about the topology of the network.
    Moreover, the spatiotemporal dynamics of spectrum availability and heterogeneity
    in the available spectrum in CRNs bring in the additional challenge of dynamically
    changing topology based on PU activities. Hence, traditional spectrum access solutions
    will not work in multi-hop CRNs. New solutions that adapt to the dynamic conditions
    of the network will have to be devised. Design Challenges in Multi-Hop CRN Although
    multi-hop CRNs have the potential to achieve efficient spectrum usage, interference
    mitigation, higher throughput, and extended coverage, there are several open research
    issues in the design of multi-hop CRNs that need to be addressed first before
    they can be successfully deployed. First, multi-hop CRNs face all the challenges
    that are inherent in single hop CRNs. For example, CR devices are inherently heterogeneous
    in nature due to the diversity in wireless access technologies, user terminals,
    types of services and applications, as well as the spectrum bands. Apart from
    these, multi-hop CRN design must deal with challenges that arise from the multiple
    hop nature of the communications. For example, it is not just sufficient to identify
    unused spectrum bands but to also regulate resource sharing (dynamic spectrum
    sharing/accessing) among all flows in the network, and more importantly accomplish
    efficient end-to-end communication by establishing routing amid the dynamically
    changing sets of cognitive relay nodes. Moreover, since PU transmissions must
    be protected, the biggest challenge for the CRNs is to enhance and ensure quality
    of service (QoS) of secondary networks themselves without jeopardizing the PU''s
    perfor-mance. In what follows, we will address some of the open research challenges
    arising in the design of MAC and Network layers of a multihop CRN and how they
    are interconnected (Fig. 2). MAC Layer Challenges in Multi-Hop CRN In a wireless
    multi-hop network comprised of CR-enabled devices, nodes can tune to different
    spectrum bands at any point in time. This varying channel activity gives rise
    to several MAC-layer issues. Co-ordination Challenges in Neighbor Discovery Neighbor
    discovery period is defined as the time taken by a node to discover its neigh-bor(s).
    Neighbor discovery is invoked when a node does not have any information about
    its “closest” neighbor(s) and needs to find a neighbor for transmission or information
    exchange. When a CR node switches on or moves to a new frequency channel, it performs
    listen before talk to detect the presence of the PU as well as nearby neighbor
    (relay) node(s) within its communication range in order to establish a route to
    the intended destination. Since it is possible for each node in the network to
    choose its own spectrum band, it is necessary for the given CR node to listen
    in the preferred channel(s) of each of the relay node(s). Hence the number of
    channels to scan can be potentially large. Moreover, due to the dynamic nature
    of the configuration of a multi-hop network, the relay node(s) can switch channels
    even within the discovery period. A coordination policy that keeps the neighbor
    discovery period to a minimum is needed between the probing node and the respondents.
    Figure 3. a) Relay nodes accessing different frequency channels making simultaneous
    transmissions possible; b) Relay nodes accessing same frequency channels making
    simultaneous transmissions not possible. Show All Heterogeneity in Radio Frequency
    Ranges . The physical propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves over
    different spectrum bands can be another concern for multi-hop CRNs. Radio frequency
    range is defined as the maximum distance up to which a signal can be transmitted
    and successfully received. As mentioned earlier, given constant transmit power,
    a low frequency signal can travel farther and penetrate walls and other obstacles,
    but its information capacity is lower and directionality poorer, compared to a
    higher frequency signal. Thus, transmissions on different frequencies will have
    different multi-path effects and attenuation resulting in heterogeneous radio
    frequency range. Also, the FCC regulates the maximum transmit power depending
    on the physicallocation of the frequencies in the spectrum band. These factors
    together imply that the selection of an optimal relay node at the MAC layer now
    involves the selection of optimal spectrum bands as well and hence becomes a multi-variable
    optimization problem. Moreover the FCC regulates the maximum transmit power depending
    on the physicallocations of the different frequency channels in the spectrum band,
    which also contributes to the heterogeneity in radio frequency range. Thus, the
    selection of optimal relay node(s) at the MAC layer also involves the selection
    of the best spectrum bands for control signaling and data transmission. Deafness
    Problem Consider a CR source, S 1 , that wants to transmit to a destination node,
    D 1 , using multiple hops, as shown in Fig. 1. Upon detecting the presence of
    the PU, any or all of the relay node(s) can trigger dynamic frequency switching
    and move to a new channel. Let us assume that the relay node A forwards S 1 ''s
    packets to relay node B using a spectrum band color coded blue in the figure.
    Suppose a primary TX now returns to the “blue” band near the relay node B , but
    outside the sensing region of A or S 1 . B can detect the incumbent transmission
    in-band and will switch to a new channel. As A is outside the range of the primary
    TX, it can neither detect the primary, nor guess that a frequency switching has
    occurred, resulting in the “deafness” problem. Hcnce. A would continue to re-transmit
    the same packet several times, assuming packet loss due to unreliable wireless
    medium. Hence, synchronization is required in the channel switching protocols
    in the MAC layer to guard against the deafness problem. Distributed Spectrum Access
    at Relay Nodes Figure 3(a) shows a communication flow from source S to destination
    D through the relay nodes R 1 and R 2 . For simplicity, let us assume only two
    frequency channels are available for this CRN. Now if S→ R 1 and R 2 →D access
    different frequency channels (colored yellow and blue respectively), simultaneous
    transmissions can take place. However, if the relay nodes are allowed autonomous
    and independent channel access, there is a finite probability that both the communication
    links ( S→ R 1 and R 2 →D ) will choose the same frequency channel, leading to
    interference and subsequent failure of communication, as shown in Fig. 3(b). As
    the number of multi-hop communication flows increases, there is likely to be an
    increase in the number of links attempting parallel transmissions in a certain
    region and a simultaneous decrease in available frequency channels. This will
    lead to an increase in the number of failed transmission attempts. Thus, it is
    clear that distributed MAC layer scheduling is necessary at the relay nodes in
    multi-hop CRNs. Figure 4. Suboptimal path selection. Show All Network Laver Challenges
    in Multi-Hop CRNS . In conventional networks, whenever a new node switches on,
    it announces its presence by broadcasting beacons and listens to broadcast announcements
    (if any) from its peers on a single static frequency. In multi-hop CRNs, generally,
    there is no pre-defined channel for the newly arriving nodes, which gives rise
    to several key routing issues that are unique to multi-hop CRNs. Suboptimal Route
    Selection A major challenge for routing in multi-hop CRNs is the current lack
    of coordination between neighbor/route selection and spectrum decision. Unlike
    in traditional ad-hoc networks, the optimal CR node in the sense of transmission
    range (or delay) may not be the closest functional neighbor (relay) in multi-hop
    CRNs. Choosing the closest node will result in a suboptimal route for data forwarding
    in the multi-hop CRNs, as depicted in Fig. 4. Thus, not only the distance between
    the source CR and the relay nodes, but also their operating frequency bands play
    a key role in deciding network connectivity. Depending on the presence of PUs,
    relay nodes will dynamically access and switch between frequency channels, which
    will introduce dynamic routing even within the same topology. So the transmission/routing
    strategies will need to be coordinated with the spectrum decisions made at both
    the source CR and at the relay nodes in order to optimize routing decisions in
    multi-hop CRNs. Varying Interference Traditionally, multi-hop routing requires
    finding the best signal-to-interference routes for communication before the start
    of transmission. However, in a multihop CRN, the interference from the surrounding
    may vary rapidly throughout the communications as the CR nodes in the interference
    range change their band of operation dynamically and potentially rapidly. Switching
    Delay at a Single Relay Node In multi-hop CRNs, if a single relay node serves
    too many communication flows operating at different frequency bands, it must constantly
    switch between frequency bands in order to serve all flows. Thus, additional switching
    delay will be introduced at the relay node. This delay can become significant
    as the diversity of frequency bands across all communication flows increases,
    thereby making the relay node a bottleneck in the network. As an example, node
    R 1 in Fig. 5a accommodates three different communication flows ( S 1 → D 1 ,
    S 2 → D 2 , S 3 → D 3 ).  R 1 relays flow S 1 → D 1 by receiving packets on the
    yellow frequency and transmitting on the gray, flow S 2 → D 2 by receiving packets
    on the blue frequency and transmitting on the green band, and flow S 3 → D 3 by
    receiving packets on the red frequency and transmitting on the green band, respectively.
    This implies that to serve all three communication flows, the relay node R 1 has
    to switch between the yellow, blue, red, green, and gray bands. Thus, it is clear
    that delay at R 1 is dominated by switching delay. This frequency switching and
    re-synchronization causes data transmission to pause, thereby adversely affecting
    data throughput. Figure 5. a) Switching delay at relay node R1 due to multiple
    communication flows ( S 1 → D 1 , S 2 → D 2 , S 3 → D 3 ): R 1 becoming bottleneck;
    and b) switching delay along one single communication flow due to multiple relay
    nodes operating over different frequency channels. Show All CR prototypes have
    been designed with sensing and switching times in the order of seconds [1] as
    well as tens of milliseconds [2]. Figure 6 shows the effective throughput of the
    CR prototype built in [2] for varying switching intervals (1, 2, 3, 5, and 10
    seconds). For benchmarking purposes, we calculate the ideal maximum throughout
    achieved under the same environment and conditions without any frequency switching
    (dotted line in the figure, maximum throughput 3.353 MB/second). As evident from
    the figure, with frequent switching, the effective throughput decreases. Even
    with the very low switching time (of the order of milliseconds), this would be
    detrimental to the secondary networks'' performance. otherwse . Although using
    multiple transceivers may potentially reduce the number of switching across communication
    flows at a relay node, it could be energy consuming and inefficient in terms of
    processing at the operating systems level because the operating systems of CR
    nodes are interrupt-driven. Also, having multiple transceivers in one radio device
    does not automatically imply concurrent transmissions over multiple channels.
    Frequency Switching Delay Along Multiple-Hops While the previous metric measured
    the delay at one single relay node, it is also essential to consider the cumulative
    delay incurred over all hops of a single flow. In Fig. 5b the complete end-to-end
    communication from S 1 → D 1 employs five distinct frequency channels. To serve
    this communication flow, each of the intermediate relay nodes ( R 1 , R 2 , R
    3 , and R 4 ) receives packets on one frequency channel, switches its transceiver
    to another channel, and then transmits the packets out to the next relay neighbor.
    The delay in this multi-hop communication is dependent on the cumulative channel
    switching delays at the transceivers along the flow. Hence, routing protocols
    must aim toward minimizing cumulative delay along the entire path as well. MAC
    Layer Solutions and Approaches In this section we analyze several approaches to
    address the MAC layer challenges and present future research directions. Consider
    a generic multi-hop wireless network formed by a group of CR-enabled nodes (Fig.
    1). The CR transceivers of these nodes can operate on any of the channels from
    the set of all available channels, N . However, the set of available channels
    at any given time and space can vary depending on the primary''s usage pattern.
    With this network model, we first discuss the approaches to address the MAC layer
    challenges. In the next section we present methods to overcome multi-hop routing
    issues. In multihop CRNs, with all nodes accessing the spectrum bands dynamically
    and independently, some coordination among the nodes for neighbor discovery is
    necessary; otherwise the advantage of DSA would be offset by random and greedy
    access to frequency bands. A popular approach is to reserve one mutually agreed
    upon frequency band as the common control channel (CCC). When a newly arriving
    CR has data to send to a remote destination, it transmits control signal requests
    on the CCC for discovering neighbor (relay) nodes in the vicinity. Pros: One or
    more relay nodes listening in the CCC will receive the control requests and reply
    to the requesting CR. In this neighbor discovery process and initial handshake,
    a common data channel available to both the transmitter and relay nodes is picked
    and both the nodes switch to the new channel to start data communication. Cons:
    Multiple CR nodes attempting to capture the CCC simultaneously will lead to collisions
    resulting in delay. A multi-transceiver, multi-channel MAC protocol [3] was proposed
    to avoid this problem, using at least two transceivers (one dedicated for transmitting
    and the other for receiving) at each of the relay nodes. An available channel
    is chosen as the home channel (HCH), to which the receiver of the relay node''s
    transceiver is tuned. Pros: Relay nodes try to avoid sharing HCH with any of the
    neighbors within two hops for interference reasons and periodically broadcast
    their HCH information using the CCC. A newly arriving CR would perform listen
    before talk in the CCC to collect information about relay nodes in the vicinity.
    Upon discovering a relay node, the transmitter CR would simply tune itself to
    the HCH of the relay node. Cons: Though this CCC-based neighbor discovery is simple,
    using multiple transceivers at each of the CR nodes is energy consuming and inefficient
    in terms of processing data at each node (as explained earlier). Moreover, the
    CCC needs to be always available to all the CR nodes. In an opportunistic DSA
    scenario, the availability of the CCC itself may not be guaranteed over the entire
    network. Figure 6. Average effective throughput with various frequency intervals.
    Show All A possible solution is to identify a minimum set of control channels
    by each of the relay nodes that would cover all the neighbors of the relay nodes
    [4]. Control information can then be periodically broadcast over these channels
    by the relay nodes to advertise themselves. To mitigate energy consumption, a
    transceiver can always go to sleep mode when not transmitting. As discussed in
    the previous section, different channels exhibit different physical characteristics
    of electromagnetic propagation, thus making the frequency channels heterogeneous
    in terms of transmission, which can potentially result in dynamically changing
    neighbor (relay) nodes. For example, suppose a relay node uses a low frequency
    (hence high range) CC. A transmitter CR in the multi-hop CRN may discover this
    relay node by tuning to the CC. Let us assume that the transmitter CR node and
    the relay node agree on a high frequency channel (lower range) for data transmission.
    It is now possible that the range of the data channel is too small for the relay
    node to be able to hear the transmission, causing a break in the route. Cons:
    Route disruption due to heterogeneous transmission range will inevitably result
    in another cycle of relay node discovery process and loss of data packets. A potential
    solution would be to use adaptive modulation schemes on different channels to
    equalize the transmission range of all frequency channels. Cons: This, however,
    will imply that all channels will now operate at the shortest transmission range
    among the group of channels, resulting in more hops per flow and consequently
    more delays. This could be avoided by using low transmission range frequency channels
    for control signaling and handshaking, while setting aside higher transmission
    range channels for data transmission. Cons: While this conservative approach will
    ensure that the route is not broken between the transmitter CR and the relay nodes
    for data transmission channels, potential relay nodes within radio hearing range
    on these frequencies may be missed. More work will be needed to determine optimal
    CC assignments that will result in the best overall network performance. Changing
    availability of channels: To achieve high network throughput, all the CR nodes
    and communication links have to be assigned a combination of frequency channels
    such that interference is mitigated and the maximum number of parallel communications
    can be accommodated, requiring co-ordination among nodes. The MAC layer scheduling
    problem for single-hop, single radio interface networks has been modeledas a distributed
    vertex coloring or edge coloring problem or a combination of the two [5], [6].
    In the case of multi-hop networks, however, the problem is a little more complex
    since transmissions between nodes that are two or more hops away may also cause
    interference. Joint allocation of frequency channels and time slots would allow
    for efficient and more parallel transmissions than the MAC layer scheduling solutions
    that offer only time slot or channel assignment. In [7], the problem of joint
    <timeslot, channel> assignment for multi-hop CRN is formulated as an Integer-Linear
    Program and a distributed heuristic for MAC layer scheduling is proposed. In the
    first phase of the algorithm, a node decides on its <timeslot, channel> tuple
    for all its outgoing flows. In the second phase, the information is propagated
    throughout the network. Using local topology information, nodes rank themselves
    based on one of three metrics (degree, channel set cardinality, or a hybrid metric
    combining the two) and higher rank nodes obtain priority for acquiring <times-lot,
    channel> tuples over lower rank nodes. Deafness Problem: The hidden incumbent
    (deafness) problem was first mentioned in IEEE 802.22 2006/2007 draft [8] and
    an “Incumbent Detection Recovery Protocol” (IDRP) was proposed to address this
    issue. However, the IDRP was proposed mainly for single hop centralized infrastructured
    CRNs where the core components are base stations (BSs) and consumer premise equipments
    (CPEs). A BS typically manages its own cell by controlling on-air activity within
    the cell, including access to the medium by CPEs. The IDRP was based on the use
    of backup (candidate) channels, information about which is entirely stored in
    the BS and periodically updated. Cons: The IDRP cannot be directly applied to
    multi-hop ad-hoc CRNs as there are no BSs controlling the on-air activity and
    each CR acts independently and autonomously. Moreover, with the dynamic availability
    of spectrum bands and incomplete topology information, gathering and periodically
    updating information about candidate channels can cost too much in terms of CPU
    cycles. Also, with the presence of various other PUs (TV, AM/FM, public safety
    radios), it is highly probable that two or more communicating CRs suffer from
    the deafness problem simultaneously but due to different PUs. A modified and more
    sophisticated distributed protocol must therefore be devised for channel switching.
    This is still an open area of research. Routing in Multi-Hop CRN As explained
    in the previous section, a myriad of challenges are caused by the ability of the
    CR nodes to dynamically switch between frequency bands. These challenges imply
    that the routing algorithms developed for multi-hop CRNs need to address issues
    that are not encountered in conventional wireless networks. Examples of the parameters
    (discussed in greater detail earlier) that need to be taken care of include: switching
    delay at each of the relay nodes along a communication flow; congestion/queuing/switching
    delay at a single relay node; and the fluctuating interference in the surrounding
    areas. Note that this problem is inherently cross-layer in nature and calls for
    joint consideration of MAC layer scheduling and on-demand network layer routing.
    Such cross-layer, on-demand routing algorithms coordinated with frequency band
    selection have been proposed in [9], [10]. The routing protocols in the above
    mostly consist of three phases: MAC based multi-flow multi-frequency scheduling
    On-demand routing Local coordination Multi-flow multi-frequency scheduling: For
    any intermediate relay node acting as a gateway for multiple communication flows
    operating on different frequency channels, scheduling flow by flow would introduce
    unnecessary additional switching delays if a subset of flows use identical frequency
    bands. For example, let a relay node, A, forward data for two communication flows
    simultaneously. Suppose A receives the incoming flows on frequency channel f 0
    while forwarding data on frequency channel f 1 and f 2 , respectively for the
    first and second communication flows. Now, if A employs flow by flow scheduling,
    it needs to switch frequencies three times – { f 0 − f 1 − f 0 − f 2 } – to serve
    the communication flows in a round robin manner. It is possible to reduce the
    number of times the node switches frequencies by using a band-by-band scheduling
    approach [9], where each relay node processes all packets from flows operating
    on one frequency band at a time, thus avoiding additiona switching delays. In
    our example, the new schedule would be { f 0 − f 0 − f 1 − f 2 } , implying only
    two frequency changes. On-demand routing: When a CR transmitter or any of the
    relay nodes decide on the next hop neighbor node for routing, control information
    needs to be exchanged to identify the number of communication flows at the intermediate
    relay nodes and the number of different frequency bands these communication flows
    are operating on. Depending on this information, switching and queuing delay at
    the bottleneck relay nodes are estimated and used to evaluate the route. Local
    coordination: A local coordination mechanism is applied to every node in a multihop
    CRN. Depending on the number of communication flows and amount of service delays
    at the intersecting nodes, the local coordination helps decide whether to perform
    new flow accommodation or flow redirection to other relay nodes for fast optimization
    of routes. . The problem of varying interference in the CRN is not considered
    in the above protocol. Moreover, the proposed protocol uses the service delay
    (switching and queuing) measurement by each of the nodes for only the next hop
    neighbor in the entire communication path. This makes for a “greedy” approach
    and has the potential of ending up in a bad locally optimal solution. A communication
    flow with high service delay at each of the intermediate nodes but a smaller hop
    count may result in smaller cumulative delay at the intended receiver than the
    communication flow with small individual delays at each of the intermediate nodes
    and a large hop count. Thus, instead of considering the individual service delay
    at each of the relay nodes, the optimal parameter for selecting best multihop
    routing in CRN would be to learn/estimate the end-to-end cumulative service delays
    along the hops. One may argue that in a distributed system, estimating all the
    hops is not possible and hence this leads to a trade-off between speed and optimality
    of the decision. . One possible approach could be to apply a gradual backward
    propagation of control information from the relay nodes to the source CRs to estimate
    the cumulative delay along the communication path. In such a mechanism, each of
    the relay nodes would create a vector of control information locally that will
    consist of the perceived SINR along the incoming flows from the upstream relay
    nodes and locally coordinated information of routing metrics (e.g., switching
    and queuing delay at this particular relay node due to the number of communication
    flows passing through it). This vector of control information coupled with similar
    control vectors received from the downstream relay nodes would then be propagated
    back to the upstream relay nodes and so on until eventually it reaches the source
    CR. The source CR thus would have the complete estimate about the multiple routes
    through the relay nodes. Since the spectrum usage map of the CR nodes is dynamically
    varying, periodic propagation of control vector information would be necessary
    to update the source CR. Note that this mechanism has several advantages in terms
    of dynamically locating high interference zones in a CRN and avoiding such zones.
    Moreover, as the source CRs would now have the periodically updated information
    about the network spectrum usage map, it will be easier to employ efficient minimum
    delay end-to-end routing and even to switch channels and change routes in case
    of PU arrival. Conclusions This article investigated issues arising in the design
    of distributed multi-hop cognitive radio networks with particular emphasis on
    the MAC and Network layers. The major challenges in multi-hop CRNs include: distributed
    yet regulated spectrum sharing; heterogeneous radio frequency ranges; dynamically
    changing relay nodes; varying interference and switching delay at relay nodes.
    Some insights and potential directions toward enhancements to existing MAC and
    multi-hop routing were proposed. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    Abstract: Multiple access methods in a wireless network allow multiple nodes to
    share a set of available channels for data transmission. The nodes can either
    compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an
    individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical
    tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied
    to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access
    in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious
    behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms
    for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can
    provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based
    on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review
    of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete
    information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free
    and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider
    time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA),
    and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access
    (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in
    dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed. The major
    findings from the game models used for these different access schemes are highlighted.
    To this end, several of the key open research directions are outlined. Published

    theory is a branch of applied mathematics which is concerned with how rational
    entities make decisions in a situation of conflict. It provides a rich set of
    mathematical tools to model and analyze interactions among the rational entities,
    and the rationality is based on gains or payoff perceived by these entities. Game
    theory has been primarily used in Economics. It has also been used in other disciplines
    such as Biology, Political science, Engineering, and Philosophy. One of the major
    areas in Engineering where game theory has been used is data communication networking.
    In particular, it has been used to model and analyze routing and resource allocation
    problems in a competitive environment, and more recently to security problems
    in wireless networks. Applicability of game theory tools to analyze power control,
    waveform adaptation, medium access, routing, and node participation was discussed
    in [1] from a layered perspective. In a multi-user wireless communication network,
    the transmitting nodes share the limited radio resources (e.g., wireless channels
    and transmission power). Therefore, one critical issue is how the nodes share
    these resources to transmit data so that the optimal network performance can be
    achieved. Multiple access methods developed for wireless networks can be divided
    into two main groups, namely, contention-free channel access and contention-based
    random access methods. In a multiple access scheme, nodes can either cooperate
    or compete to achieve their objectives (e.g., optimal throughput and quality-of-service
    (QoS)). Consequently, game theory has become a very useful mathematical tool to
    model and analyze multiple access schemes in wireless networks, and to obtain
    solutions for resource allocation, channel assignment, power control, and cooperation
    enforcement among the nodes. The notion of multiple access game can be illustrated
    by the following example [2], [3]. Suppose that there are two mobile nodes t x
    1 and t x 2 who want to access a shared wireless channel to send information to
    the corresponding receivers rcv r 1 and rcv r 2 . Both the receivers are within
    the transmission range of both the transmitters. Each transmitter has one packet
    to transmit in each time step and it can either choose to transmit during a time
    step or wait. If t x 1 transmits, the packet is successfully transmitted if t
    x 2 chooses not to transmit during that time step (and hence there is no collision).
    For successful packet transmission, t x 1 obtains a benefit at the cost of transmit
    power. It is of interest to analyze the interactions between the transmitters
    under different network settings and performance objectives. Different game models
    (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information
    games) have been developed to study the behavior of transmitting nodes to access
    the wireless channel(s) and obtain the multiple access solution (or equilibrium)
    [2], [4]. Various game models are considered under different scenarios, perspectives,
    or assumptions on transmitting nodes'' behavior. Nevertheless, the common aim
    of these models is to improve network performance (e.g., throughput maximization,
    resource consumption minimization, and QoS guarantee) given self-interest or group-rationality
    of transmitting nodes. The motivations of using game models for design, analysis,
    and optimization of multiple access in wireless networks are as follows: Theoretical
    foundation for multiple access schemes:Game theory, which is most notably used
    in Economics, usually considers a multiplayer decision problem. A success or benefit
    of an individual in making decisions depends on the decisions of others. Game
    theory provides a theoretical basis to analyze interactions in multiplayer systems
    including human as well as non-human players (e.g., computers, animals, and plants)
    [5]. Therefore, it can be applied to a wireless communication network in the context
    of resource sharing where the players are the nodes (e.g., mobile stations, base
    stations, access points) in the network. Cooperation or competition among mobile
    nodes for channel access in a wireless network is a multiplayer decision problem,
    which can be modeled as a game. The benefit of a node as a result of its chosen
    action (i.e., strategy or move) can be measured in terms of performance metrics
    such as throughput and delay. An equilibrium solution of the game model defines
    the actions of the different nodes (e.g., transmission power) for which the chosen
    performance objective is optimized. Modeling selfish/malicious behavior of nodes:The
    transmitting nodes in a wireless network may behave selfishly in order to reap
    performance advantage over other nodes, as a result of which the overall network
    performance may degrade. To make the network robust against the selfish behaviors
    (or attacks) by these malicious nodes, efficient defense mechanisms need to be
    built into the system. Game theory can be used to model and analyze the selfish
    behavior of nodes and design the defense mechanisms for robust multiple access
    in wireless networks. Distributed protocols: In many scenarios, wireless nodes
    make their decisions in an individual (or distributed) manner rather than in a
    centralized manner. Game theory is a suitable tool to optimize wireless access
    distributively [6]. In a centralized scheme, solving the problem of multiple access
    may become computationally expensive when the network size increases. Also, the
    network control overhead could be prohibitive. In contrast, efficient distributed
    algorithms can be designed based on game theory which can reduce the communication
    and computation overhead significantly. Therefore, game theory is a useful tool
    to develop efficient distributed protocols for wireless networks. With an appropriate
    game formulation, cross-layer optimization can be also performed in a distributed
    way. Mechanism design:The parameters of a game can be designed (or varied) such
    that it leads the independent and self-interested wireless nodes toward a system-wide
    desirable outcome. Pricing is one technique that can be used for such mechanism
    design (or incentive scheme) to regulate the usage of radio resources by the wireless
    nodes by adjusting their costs. This article comprehensively surveys the existing
    researches on game theoretic approaches for channel access in a multiuser wireless
    network. The aim of this article is to familiarize the readers with the state-of-the-art
    research on this topic and the different techniques for game theoretic modeling
    of the multiple access problem in wireless systems. Different types of game models
    are reviewed for both contention-free and random channel access schemes. For contention-free
    channel access, time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency- division multiple
    access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA)-based wireless networks
    are considered. For contention-based channel access, game models for ALOHA and
    carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based channel access methods are reviewed.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II presents an overview
    of multiple access methods for wireless networks. Then, an overview of game theory
    and its applications to multiple access design is presented in Section III. Next,
    we review the game models for contention-free channel access and random channel
    access in Sections IV and V, respectively. Section VI provides a summary of the
    survey and discusses several open research issues. Section VII concludes the paper.
    SECTION II. Overview of Multiple Access Methods In this section, the general concepts
    of channel access and performance issues related to multiple access design in
    wireless networks are discussed. A. General Concepts Channel access methods in
    wireless networks can be divided into two main groups, namely, contention-free
    channel access and contention-based random channel access schemes. In contention-free
    schemes, multiple nodes are allocated with the radio resources (e.g., time slot,
    channel, and code) by a central entity and the nodes use the allocated resources
    for data transmission [7]. Contention-free channel access can be used in time-division,
    frequency-division, and code-division multiple access networks. Time-division
    multiple access (TDMA): In TDMA, time is divided into fixed-length frames and
    each frame is divided into multiple time slots. Time slots are allocated to the
    nodes for data transmission. In TDMA, synchronization among the nodes is required
    to avoid interference [8]. Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA): In FDMA,
    radio frequency band is divided into multiple channels. The channels are allocated
    to the nodes for data transmission. Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access
    (OFDMA) is an improved version of FDMA which is based on the orthogonal frequency-division
    multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in the physical layer. In OFDMA, frequency band
    is divided into multiple subcarriers which are shared among the nodes. OFDMA is
    used in the IEEE 802.16-based WiMAX networks. Code-division multiple access (CDMA):
    In CDMA, multiple nodes can transmit data on the same channel simultaneously.
    The transmitted data by each node is encoded by using a unique spreading code.
    The spreading codes for the different users are orthogonal/near-orthogonal to
    each other. The receiver of each node can decode the original data correctly if
    the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is maintained above a threshold.
    For contention-based random access scheme, a node has to compete with other nodes
    to transmit data over the wireless channel. A packet transmitted by a node will
    be received successfully if there is no collision. A collision occurs when multiple
    nodes transmit data simultaneously and the SINR at the receiver is lower than
    the minimum SINR required to decode the original packet correctly. If collision
    occurs, a node may attempt to retransmit the packet, and the specifics of the
    retransmission method depend on the protocol used. The most common contention-based
    channel access schemes are as follows [9]: ALOHA: In ALOHA, if a node has a packet
    to send, it will attempt to transmit the packet immediately. If the packet collides
    with packets from other nodes, the node will retransmit the packet later. The
    ALOHA protocol can be operated in a slotted fashion, in which case, time is divided
    into slots, and packet transmissions are aligned with the time slots. Carrier
    sense multiple access (CSMA):CSMA is a probabilistic medium access method in which
    a node senses the status of the channel before attempting transmission. If the
    channel is idle, the node initiates a transmission attempt. If the transmission
    is unsuccessful due to a collision, the node waits for a packet retransmission
    interval and transmits again. Two of the improved variants of CSMA are CSMA with
    collision detection (CSMA/CD) and CSMA with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). In
    CSMA/CD, assuming that a node is able to detect a collision, a transmission is
    terminated as soon as a collision is detected. The collision can be avoided by
    expanding the retransmission interval (i.e., backoff period) for the node to wait
    before a new transmission. In CSMA/CA, if the channel is sensed busy before transmission,
    to decrease the probability of collisions on the channel, transmission is postponed
    for a random period of time. B. Performance Issues in Multiple Access for Wireless
    Networks The key requirements for the design and optimization of multiple channel
    access schemes for wireless networks are as follows [10]: Maximize network throughput:
    Throughput refers to the amount of data successfully transmitted by the nodes
    over a time period. Maximizing the overall system throughput is a key objective
    of most of the multiple access schemes. This is turn improves the spectrum efficiency
    in wireless networks. Minimize delay: Delay refers to the time required for a
    packet to be transmitted successfully since it has been received at the transmission
    buffer from the upper layer. Delay is a key performance metric for real-time traffic
    (e.g., voice and video). Multiple channel access schemes for such traffic have
    to minimize delay. Guarantee fairness: Fairness is a measure of whether the nodes
    are receiving an equal (or fair) share of radio resources. Multiple channel access
    schemes must guarantee a certain level of fairness to all nodes in the network.
    Improve power efficiency: Power efficiency is an important performance metric
    for battery-powered wireless nodes. There is a tradeoff between power efficiency
    and network performance. To reduce power consumption, a node can be put in standby
    mode during which the node cannot transmit and/or receive packets. Consequently,
    the throughput reduces. In a wireless network, the nodes sharing the limited radio
    resources may have different behaviors. On one hand, all nodes can cooperate to
    meet the above requirements and achieve optimal network performance. This is referred
    to as group rationality. On the other hand, the nodes can be noncooperative to
    compete with each other for the radio resources. This is referred to as self-interest
    behavior. To analyze these behaviors and investigate their impact on network performance,
    game theory can be applied through which the equilibrium solution (i.e., behavior
    of the nodes at steady state) can be obtained. SECTION III. Overview of Game Theory
    and Its Applications to Multiple Access In this section, the basic concepts used
    in game theory are discussed and different game models are briefly introduced.
    The issues pertinent to using game theory to analyze multiple access schemes in
    wireless networks are also discussed. A. General Concepts A game is defined by
    a set of players, a set of actions for each player, and the payoffs for the players.
    A player chooses an action and the complete plan of action is referred to as the
    strategy. When the action is chosen deterministically, it is called a pure strategy.
    On the other hand, when the action is chosen probabilistically according to a
    certain probability distribution, it is called a mixed strategy. Based on the
    strategies of the players, their payoffs are determined. Depending on the nature
    of the game, there are different solution concepts. However, almost all of them
    rely on the equilibrium concept which ensures that a player will gain a fair or
    optimal payoff given the strategies of other players in the game. Pareto optimality
    or Pareto efficiency is another well-known concept in a game. A strategy is called
    Pareto optimal if it is impossible to make one player better off without necessarily
    making other players worse off. B. Game Theoretic Models Two major game-theoretic
    approaches which can be used to model multiple access schemes are the noncooperative
    and the cooperative game approaches. In a noncooperative game, the players make
    rational decisions considering only their individual payoff. In a cooperative
    game, players are grouped together and establish an enforceable agreement in their
    group. 1. Noncooperative games Self-interested players in a non- cooperative game
    make decisions independently. The players are unable to make enforceable contracts
    but it does not mean that players do not cooperate. Any cooperation in the games
    must be self-enforcing. Noncooperative game theory has been used extensively to
    study various issues in wireless networks (e.g., medium access control game, time
    slot competition, and power control in CDMA). The goal of a noncooperative game
    model is to find the equilibrium solution for networks with self-interested nodes.
    A well-known solution concept for a noncooperative game is Nash equilibrium [11].
    A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for the players such that no player
    has any intention to change his/her strategy to gain a higher payoff given that
    none of the other players changes his/her strategy. Let i be an index of a player,
    i∈I={1,…,M} where I is a set of players and M is the total number of players.
    Let S i denote a set of strategy of player i . s i ∈ S i is any possible strategy
    of player i . The Nash equilibrium satisfies the following condition [11]: u i
    ( s ∗ i , s ∗ −i )≥ u i ( s i , s ∗ −i ),∀i∈I,∀ s i ∈ S i (1) View Source where
    u i (⋅) is the payoff function of player i, s ∗ i is a Nash equilibrium strategy
    of player i , and s ∗ −i is a Nash equilibrium strategy vector of all players
    except player i . However, a Nash equilibrium may not exist in a game. Also, even
    if a Nash equilibrium exists, it may not be unique. Another solution concept which
    is more general than the Nash equilibrium is known as correlated equilibrium [12].
    In this concept, a strategy profile is chosen according to the joint distribution
    instead of the marginal distribution of players'' strategies as in the Nash equilibrium
    solution. The definition of correlated equilibrium is given below. Let S i denote
    a set of strategies of player i . A probability distribution π over S 1 ×⋯× S
    M is a correlated equilibrium if for every strategy s ∗ i ∈ S i such that π( s
    ∗ i , s −i )>0 , and every alternative strategy s i ∈ S i , it holds that, ∑ s
    −i ∈ S −1 π( s ∗ i , s −i )[ u i ( s ∗ i , s −i )− u i ( s i , s −i )] ∀i∈I,∀
    s i ∈ S i . ≥0, (2) View Source To interpret this definition, given a recommendation
    (i.e., a recommended strategy according to the distribution π ) to player i ,
    a distribution π is defined to be a correlated equilibrium if no player i can
    choose a strategy s i instead of s ∗ i which results in a higher expected payoff.
    A noncooperative game can be classified as either a complete or an incomplete
    information game. In a complete information game, information such as the payoffs
    and strategies of the players are observable to all the players. On the other
    hand, in an incomplete information game, the information is unknown by other players.
    An incomplete information game can be modeled as a Bayesian game [11] in which
    Bayesian analysis is used to predict the outcome of the game. The equilibrium
    solution of such a game is called Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Similar to the Nash
    equilibrium in a complete information game, a Bayesian Nash equilibrium can be
    obtained in which each player seeks for a strategy profile that maximizes its
    expected payoff given its beliefs about the types and strategies of other players.
    Moreover, a game can be classified as either a static game or a dynamic game.
    A static game is a one-shot game where all players make decisions without knowledge
    of the strategies that are being chosen by other players. The one-shot game ends
    when actions of all players are chosen and payoffs are received. In contrast,
    in a dynamic game, a player chooses an action in the current stage based on the
    knowledge of the actions chosen by the other players in the current or previous
    stages. This dynamic game can be called a sequential game since players play a
    static game repeatedly. The common equilibrium solution in dynamic games is a
    subgame perfect Nash equilibrium [13]. A subgame perfect Nash equilibrium represents
    a Nash equilibrium of every subgame of the original game. A common method to obtain
    subgame perfect equilibria is backward induction. A dynamic game with incomplete
    information can be described as a multi-stage game when information is unknown
    to other players [11]. It is similar to a dynamic game with complete information
    in that the players take turns sequentially rather than simultaneously but information
    is incompletely known to others. The players follow their beliefs and dynamically
    update their beliefs by using the Bayes'' rule. In a dynamic game with incomplete
    information, perfect Bayesian equilibrium is the solution concept which can be
    considered as a combination of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium and subgame perfect
    equilibrium concepts. Repeated game [11] is a special kind of dynamic game in
    which the same set of players plays the same stage game or one-shot game repeatedly
    over a long time period. Repeated games can be divided into two key types, namely,
    finite and infinite repeated games, depending on whether the period of time during
    which the game is played is finite or infinite. Most repeated games are typically
    infinite repeated games and a player takes into account the effect of his/her
    current action on the future actions of other players. Markovian game (i.e., Markovian
    dynamic game or Markov game) is an extension of game theory to Markov Decision
    Process-like environments. A Markovian game can be defined as a type of stochastic
    game [14] [15] which can be regarded as a multiagent extension of Markov decision
    process [16]. The key difference between a Markov game and a Markov decision process
    is that a transition depends on the current state and the action profile of the
    players. Also, each player may receive different reward as a result of the action
    profile. Each player has a reward function (i.e., payoff function) and tries to
    maximize its expected sum of discounted reward. A more specific type of Markovian
    game is a switching controlled Markovian game where the transition probability
    in any given state depends on the action of only one player. The Nash equilibrium
    for such a game can be computed by solving a sequence of Markov decision processes.
    Auction game [17] is a game theoretic approach in which an object or service is
    exchanged on the basis of bids submitted by the bidders to an auctioneer. There
    are two main auction mechanisms, namely, the first and second price auctions.
    In first price auction, an object or service is given to a bidder who submitted
    the highest bid and pays a price equal to the amount of bid. In second price auction,
    an object or service is given to a bidder who submitted the highest bid and pays
    a price equal to the second highest amount of bid. Stackelberg game or leader-follower
    game [11] is a strategic game in which the player acting as a leader moves first
    and then the rest acting as followers move afterward. Then, the problem is to
    find an optimal strategy for the leader, assuming that the followers react in
    such a rational way that they optimize their objective functions given the leader''s
    actions. The Stackelberg game model can be solved by subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.
    Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) [18] is a solution concept in the evolutionary
    game theory. In this game, the evolution of social behaviour of animals in a population
    is considered. In a wireless network, a population can be a group of mobile nodes
    sharing the channels. A strategy is called an ESS if in a fixed population, the
    entire population using ESS cannot be invaded by mutant strategies of a small
    group. 2. Cooperative games In a cooperative game, players are able to make enforceable
    contracts. The players in a coalition cooperate to maximize a common objective
    of a coalition. In this case, players can coordinate strategies and agree on how
    the total payoff is to be divided among players in a coalition. Nash bargaining
    game is one type of cooperative games where the players maximize the product of
    their gains given what each player would receive without cooperation (i.e., threat
    point). This is referred to as the Nash bargaining solution which can be defined
    as follows: s ∗ =arg max s ∏ i∈I ( u i ( s i )− u d i ) (3) View Source where
    u i (⋅) is the payoff function of player i, s i is a strategy of player i , and
    s ∗ is a Nash bargaining solution strategy vector of all players, and u d i is
    the threat point (i.e., the utility gained if player i decides not to cooperate
    and bargain with the other players). Coalition formation game is a cooperative
    game involving a set of players who are looking for cooperative groups (i.e.,
    coalitions). A coalition S, which represents an agreement among the players to
    act as a single entity, can be formed by players in a set N to gain a higher payoff,
    and the worth of this coalition, denoted by v is called the coalitional value.
    Two common forms of coalitional games are strategic form and partition form. In
    the former case, the value of a coalition S depends on the members of that coalition
    only (i.e., independent of how the players in N\S are structured). In the latter
    case, the value of a coalition S strongly depends on how the players in N\S are
    structured. Coalitional game models can be developed with either transferable
    payoff or non-transferable payoff. In a transferable payoff coalitional game,
    there is no restriction on how the total payoff will be divided among the members
    of a coalition. In a non-transferable payoff coalitional game, the payoff that
    each player in a coalition obtains depends on the joint actions that the players
    of a coalition select [19]. A stable solution for a coalition formation game ensures
    that the outcome is immune to deviations by groups of players (i.e., no player
    has an incentive to move from its current coalition to another coalition). Game
    theory can be used to model and analyze cooperative and noncooperative behaviors
    of nodes and their interactions during channel access in wireless networks. There
    are a few considerations when game theory is applied to model and analyze multiple
    access schemes in wireless networks. C. Issues in Game Theoretic Design of Multiple
    Access Schemes Self-interest and group-rationality: Most of the game theoretic
    models developed for multiple access in wireless networks have the assumption
    of self-interest and grouprationality for the noncooperative and cooperative game
    models, respectively. A node with self-interest has the objective to maximize
    only its own payoff. However, this behavior may not provide a socially optimal
    solution. The corresponding depreciation is called price of anarchy. On the other
    hand, group-rational nodes can cooperate to achieve a socially optimal solution,
    and for this, a cooperative game (e.g., bargaining game) can be applied [20] [21].
    However, in many cases, the group-rationality condition may not hold for all nodes,
    and some nodes may deviate from cooperation. Therefore, a penalization (or punishment)
    mechanism is required to enforce cooperation among the nodes so that a socially
    optimal solution can always be achieved. Penalization mechanisms: These mechanisms
    [22] are proposed to promote cooperation in multiple access among nodes sharing
    the channel. The punishment is commonly applied to the nodes deviating from cooperation
    since such deviation can degrade the network performance. In this respect, two
    important issues are the detection of deviating nodes and designing the punishment
    mechanism to be applied. Practical implementation: Although game theory provides
    solutions for a situation of conflict during multiple access, it is still difficult
    to implement these solutions in a practical environment. In many cases, distributed
    implementations are desirable. In some distributed implementations, the mobile
    stations may require information such as SINR, power, price from the base station(s)
    in order to converge to the equilibrium solution. However, in a realistic scenario,
    these information cannot be observed perfectly (e.g., channel gain of other nodes).
    Therefore, the mobile stations may need to have the ability to learn from the
    radio environment which may increase the complexity of implementation and reduce
    the rate of convergence of the solution of the game to the equilibrium solution.
    Payoff function: A payoff function represents the benefit or reward to a player
    in the game when an action is chosen by this player. Defining a suitable payoff
    function is an important issue. When the payoff function is defined differently,
    the solution of the same game model applied to the same multiple access scheme
    can be dramatically different. The payoff function should be defined considering
    the physical performance measures of the nodes and/or networks. In the following
    sections, we review various game theoretic models proposed in the literature to
    study multiple access schemes. This review is categorized based on different types
    of multiple access methods and types of the game models used. SECTION IV. Game
    Models for Contention-Free Channel Access In this section, game models for contention-free
    channel access based on TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA are reviewed. A. TDMA-Based Channel
    Access Games Since the nodes have to transmit data during their allocated time
    slots, in TDMA-based channel access games, the nodes compete for time slots to
    achieve their performance objectives (i.e., QoS requirements). Four different
    game models, namely, noncooperative static game, auction game, dynamic game, and
    repeated game models are discussed. A summary of the key features of these game
    models is provided in Table II. The details of these models are discussed next.
    Table I Summary of Game Models Table II Summary of TDMA-Based Channel Access Games
    1. Noncooperative static game-theoretic approach In [23], a noncooperative static
    game model for QoS-aware resource competition is proposed for a single-hop wireless
    network with multiple wireless links. The wireless nodes need to compete for the
    transmission time within a time slot. The power consumption of all nodes is assumed
    to be constant and the channel fading is assumed to follow a stationary fiat-fading
    process. Two nodes are considered as the players in the game. The time slot length
    is denoted as t i T where t i ∈[0,1] is the time slot share of node i (i.e., fraction
    of time in a slot to be accessed by node i ) and T is the size of frame. Time
    slot share t i is the strategy of nodes. Two nodes i=1,2 transmit their data without
    collision if t i + t 2 ≤1 and collision occurs if t 1 + t 2 >1 . Time slot allocation
    to the nodes is shown in Fig. 1(a). Since the nodes have self-interest, they minimize
    the time slot usage given the channel state information (i.e., channel power gain
    denoted as h i ) subject to the effective capacity [24]. The corresponding optimization
    formulation for node 1 is as follows: min t 1 E h { t 1 } (4) View Source subject
    to E h { e − β 1 t 1 R 1 }− A 1 ≤0 (5) View Source and t 1 ≤1− t 2 (6) View Source
    where E h denotes expectation over h, β 1 is the normalized QoS exponent, R 1
    is the normalized transmission rate which is a function of channel state information.
    A 1 is equal to e − θ 1 C 1 where C 1 denotes the target effective capacity exponent
    and θ 1 denotes the QoS exponent for node 1. This effective capacity is also considered
    as an objective of the system. Nash equilibrium is the solution of this time slot
    competition game. It is found that the Nash equilibrium may not be unique. However,
    since the game can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, a unique solution
    can be obtained by minimizing the Lagrangian function of the objective function
    if the available time slot length is enough to guarantee QoS for both the nodes.
    2. Auction game-theoretic approach In [25], a second price and sealed bid auction
    for time slot competition in a dynamic spectrum access scenario is proposed. In
    dynamic spectrum access, each node i∈I={1,…,M} (i.e., the bidder/player in a game)
    submits its bid to the base station. The value of the submitted bid is the portion
    of the time slot (i.e., between 0 and 1) that will be used to help the base station
    relaying data to another distant node. The bidding value b i of node i is a non-decreasing
    function of the channel condition x i . The base station (i.e., the auctioneer)
    allocates the downlink channel to a node offering the highest bid (as shown in
    Fig. (b)). The price that this winning node pays is equal to the second highest
    bid. The amount of transmitted data of winning node j is denoted as d j = x j
    (1− max i∈I,i≠j b i ( x i )) where x j is the channel condition of the winning
    node which is assumed to be the amount of data received per unit time, and b i
    ( x i ) is the bid submitted by a node. A node chooses a value of bid which maximizes
    its expected amount of transmitted data under its budget constraint given the
    probability distributions of the channel conditions of all the nodes. The budget
    constraint of node i represents the amount of time that the node is Fig. 1. The
    diagram represents different time slot allocations: (a) time slot allocation based
    on [23], (b) time slot allocation based on [25], and (c) time slot allocation
    based on [26]. Show All able to provide to the base station for data relaying.
    Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution. It is found that, for pure strategy,
    a Nash equilibrium exists in the two-node case, but in a general multiple-node
    case, a Nash equilibrium may not exist. A distributed algorithm is proposed for
    updating the bids which converges to the Nash equilibrium. The results show that
    to avoid zero throughput (i.e., maximum bid), the budget constraint has to be
    smaller than one. Also, the higher the budget constraint, the lower is the throughput
    for each node. A system model almost similar to that in [25] is considered in
    [26]. The second-price auction mechanism is used for the nodes competing for time
    slots in a downlink transmission scenario. Similar to [25], the utility function
    of a node is the expected amount of transmitted data and the bidding value b i
    of node i is a function in the channel condition x i . A node submits a bid which
    maximizes its expected amount of transmitted data under the budget constraints
    given the probability distributions of the channel conditions of all the nodes.
    The time slot allocation process for this auction game can be illustrated as in
    Fig. 1(c). The Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution of the auction game.
    It is shown that the Nash equilibrium leads to a unique allocation which is also
    Pareto optimal. For uniformly distributed channel state, the aggregated throughput
    that nodes achieve at the Nash equilibrium is at least 3/4 of the optimal aggregated
    throughput achieved using an optimal centralized allocation without fairness consideration.
    Also, a centralized opportunistic scheduler is proposed to achieve proportional
    fairness. The a priori knowledge of channel distribution is not required by this
    scheduler. The centralized scheduler will assign time slots according to the Nash
    equilibrium strategy. 3. Dynamic game-theoretic approach In [27], a Marko- vian
    dynamic game is formulated to solve the transmission rate adaptation problem in
    a dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio network. In such a network, the
    secondary users (or cognitive radio users) opportunistically access the radio
    spectrum, which is licensed to the primary (or licensed) users, without causing
    harmful interference to the primary users. The players of the game are secondary
    nodes competing for the channel or time slot in a TDMA scenario (e.g., in the
    IEEE 802.16-based network). In a TDMA cognitive radio system, the system has a
    predefined decentralized access rule that allows only one secondary node to access
    the channel at a time. The access rule is defined as a function of channel quality
    and transmission delay. This transmission rate control problem is formulated as
    a general-sum switching control Markovian dynamic game. In this dynamic game,
    the system state transition probability at each time slot depends only on the
    active secondary node. Node i (i.e., secondary node i ) follows a decentralized
    access rule to try to occupy a time slot at time n , after a period of time t
    n i = γ i q n i h n i where γ i is the QoS parameter of node i, Q n i is the buffer
    occupancy state of user i , and h n i is the channel state of node i . The composite
    variable x n i =[ q n i , h n i ] denotes the state of user i at time n . If there
    are more than one node having the same waiting period, a node will be randomly
    picked with equal probability. after node j is selected to transmit data, this
    node chooses action a n j (i.e., transmission rate in bits/symbol) assuming an
    M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation. The transmission cost of the selected node
    j, c j ( x n , a n j ) , is defined as its transmission bit error rate (BER),
    and the cost of node i, d i ( x n , a n j ) , is defined as its delay constraint
    (i.e., QoS constraint) which is a function of the buffer state q n i . The transition
    probabilities depend only on the action of active node; hence, a Markovian dynamic
    game can be formulated. The strategy of node i . denotes the transmission policy
    s i . The Nash equilibrium policy s ∗ i is computed by minimizing the expected
    total discounted cost function subject to the expected total discounted delay
    constraint as follows: s ∗(n) i ={ s n i : min s i C n i ( s i )}subject to D
    n i ( s i )≤ D ^ i (7) View Source where C n i ( s i ) is the infinite expected
    total discounted transmission cost calculated from c j ( x n , a n j ) . D n i
    ( s i ) is the infinite expected total discounted delay which is calculated from
    d i ( x n , a n j ) and cannot be greater than threshold D ^ i . The value iteration
    algorithm is used to obtain a Nash equilibrium policy. The Nash equilibrium policy
    of any node i is observed to be a randomized mixture of pure policies and the
    pure policies are non-decreasing on the buffer occupancy state. A stochastic approximation
    algorithm exploiting this structure is presented to efficiently estimate the Nash
    equilibrium policy by computing parameters such as buffer state thresholds and
    randomization factors. In [28], a system model similar to that presented in [27]
    is considered; however, correlated equilibrium is studied as the solution of the
    game. Two distributed correlated equilibrium algorithms (i.e., iterative correlated
    equilibrium algorithm and correlated Q-Iearning algorithm) are proposed to obtain
    the correlated equilibrium in the Markovian game. The stationary policy s ∗ is
    a correlated equilibrium for the Markovian game, i.e., ∑ a −i ∈ A −1 s ∗ x ( a
    −i , a i ) Q s ∗ i (x,{ a −i , a i })≥ ∑ a −i ∈ A −1 s ∗ x ( a −i , a i ) Q s
    ∗ i (x,{ a −i , a ′ i }) (8) View Source where Q s ∗ i (⋅) is the Q-function of
    user i : which is the total discounted reward of taking action a in state x .
    The Q-function is a function of the user i ''s utility plus the infinite expected
    total discounted utility. The utility is the difference between a function of
    achievable transmission rate and the transmission delay. When an iterative algorithm
    is used to find the correlated equilibrium, each user does not need the information
    of the Q- functions of other users, and this can be used to develop distributed
    algorithms. However, the probability transition matrix is required to update the
    Q- function values. The correlated Q-Iearning algorithm can remove the requirement
    of a system state transition probability matrix for the iterative correlated equilibrium.
    Hence, it is more practical than the iterative algorithm. 4. Repeated game-theoretic
    approach In [29], a repeated game model for spectrum sharing in a cognitive radio
    network is presented. The game enforces the nodes to tell their true channel conditions
    and to cooperate with each other. Data transmission over a long time period is
    considered. Therefore, spectrum sharing can be formulated as a repeated game where
    the nodes are concerned about their payoffs (e.g., throughputs) in the future.
    The actions of the nodes are the power allocation according to the power constraint
    and channel condition. In this game, the power constraint is assumed to be identical
    for all nodes. If all the nodes make an agreement and share the spectrum in an
    orderly fashion, every node gains benefit from the cooperation. However, some
    nodes may violate the agreed upon rule and deviate from cooperation. Then, the
    game model provides a punishment mechanism which will be triggered and applied
    to the deviating node for a certain period of time. The period of time for punishment
    is chosen such that the expected payoff from cooperation is greater than the expected
    payoff from deviation. To design a cooperation rule, an opportunistic time slot
    allocation method is developed which maximizes the total throughput. The node
    informing the best channel gain will be allocated time slots for transmission.
    However, in the incomplete information case, the channel gain of one node may
    not be known to other nodes, and some node may falsely inform its channel gain
    information. Therefore, a Bayesian mechanism is introduced to enforce all the
    nodes to tell the true values of their channel gains. B. Channel Access Games
    in FDMA In FDMA, the nodes compete for available channels in the network and the
    solutions of the game models (i.e., equilibria) can be obtained in the complete
    and incomplete information cases. We consider three different game models, namely,
    noncooperative static game, auction game, and cooperative game models. A summary
    of the key features of these game models for FDMA is provided in Table III. The
    details of these models are discussed next. Table III Summary of FDMA-Based Channel
    Access Games 1. Noncooperative static game-theoretic approach In [30], the optimal
    FDMA channel assignment problem for noncooperative wireless networks is studied
    assuming that the nodes can be equipped with either single or multiple radio interfaces.
    The available frequency band is divided into orthogonal channels. The authors
    introduce a payment formula to ensure the existence of a strongly dominant strategy
    equilibrium (SDSE) [31], which is a stronger solution concept than the Nash equilibrium.
    This payment is used to obtain the globally optimal solution in terms of effective
    system-wide throughput. The strategy of node i( s i ) is the channel assignment
    vector which is the number of radio interfaces allocated to each channel. The
    solution in terms of SDSE can be described as follows: ∀ s −i ∈ S i ,∀ s i ≠ s
    ∗ i , u i ( s ∗ i , s −i )≥ u i ( s i , s −i ) ∃ s −i ∈ S i ,∀ s i ≠ s ∗ i , u
    i ( s ∗ i , s −i )> u i ( s i , s −i ) (9) (10) View Source where S i is the set
    of all possible strategies and u i (⋅) is the payoff function of node i . The
    payoff function is defined as the difference between the throughput and the payment
    to the system administrator. The payment is a function of the node''s throughput
    plus a penalty (if the node deviates from the globally optimal solution) or a
    bonus (if the node does not deviate). An algorithm to obtain the SDSE is proposed.
    It is proved that the algorithm converges to the SDSE. Multiple channel access
    in multi-cell and multi-user OFDMA networks is considered in [32]. In multi-cell
    networks, changes of resource allocation in a cell affect the performances of
    other nearby cells. A noncooperative game model for sub-channel assignment, rate
    adaptation, and power control is introduced. Node i with self-interest maximizes
    its own payoff u i (⋅) (e.g., minimizes its transmission power) by allocating
    its transmission rates r i on different sub-channels k∈{1,…,K} under the required
    rate R i and power constraint P i max as follows: min r i u i (⋅)= ∑ k=1 K P k
    i ,s.t. ∑ k=1 K r k i = R i (11) View Source where P k i is the transmission power
    of user i in subchannel k Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution. This Nash
    equilibrium (NE) can be obtained by using the water-filling algorithm. However,
    in some cases of high channel interference, there might be multiple Nash equilibria
    or the solution might also be undesirable (i.e., the overall power for the users
    is larger than the power constraint: ∑ K k=1 P k i > P i max ). A dual noncooperative
    game is used if the desired NE solution cannot be obtained. The definition of
    the dual game is as follows: max r i ∑ k=1 K r k i ,s.t.   ∑ k=1 K P k i = P i
    max . (12) View Source after the dual noncooperative game converges, if the desired
    NE solution is still not reached (i.e., if any node has to play the dual noncooperative
    game, the obtained NE is considered as an undesired NE), a mechanism called virtual
    referee is introduced to improve the performance of this noncooperative game.
    The key idea of the virtual referee mechanism is that a referee monitors the nodes
    in the network. If the Nash equilibrium is reached, the referee does nothing;
    however, if it is not, the referee will modify the game rule in order to remove
    some nodes from accessing subchannels so that a better performance can be achieved.
    The flow of this noncooperative game with a referee is shown as Fig. 2. Fig. 2.
    The diagram illustrates the steps of the algorithm for noncooperative game with
    virtual referee in OFDMA networks. Show All A channel allocation game is studied
    in [33] as a static game when nodes have multiple radio interfaces. The players
    are the nodes with self-interest which aim to maximize their own profits defined
    as the total rates or channel utilization. In this game, there are K orthogonal
    channels. If the same channel is used by multiple nodes, they can hear the transmissions
    of each other. Moreover, a node can use multiple channels at the same time. The
    strategy of each node is the channel allocation vector or the number of radio
    interfaces on each channel. The payoff of each node is the achieved bit rate.
    It is assumed that the rate on each channel is allocated equally by using a reservation-based
    time-division schedule among the interfaces. The total available rate on a channel
    is assumed to be a non-increasing function of the number of radio interfaces accessing
    this channel. The set of channels used by node i is denoted as K i . The payoff
    function of node i , defined as u i , is the sum of achieved bit rate r on each
    occupied channel k∈ K i as follows: u i =∑ l i,k l k R( l k ) (13) View Source
    where l i,k is the number of radio interfaces of node i currently using channel
    k, l k is the number of radios using channel k , and R( l k ) is the total rate
    which is a decreasing function of the number of radios using channel k . Nash
    equilibrium is considered as a solution. If the total number of radio interfaces
    is smaller than or equal to the number of channels, then a flat channel allocation
    (not more than one radio interface per channel) is the Nash equilibrium. To find
    a Nash equilibrium, three algorithms are introduced. The first one is a centralized
    algorithm with perfect information. It requires sequential action of players and
    global coordination. This global coordination can be achieved with an extra radio
    interface per device for scanning the channels. The second algorithm is a distributed
    algorithm with perfect information. This algorithm is a round-based algorithm
    in which a random radio interface assignment to the nodes over the channels is
    used. It is assumed that there is no node that can assign more than one radio
    interface to any channel. after the initial assignment, each node evaluates the
    number of radio interfaces on each channel and tries to improve its total rate
    by reorganizing the allocation. However, an unstable allocation can occur. To
    avoid this problem, a backoff technique is used. Each node chooses a random initial
    value and then decreases this counter value periodically. The reallocation is
    performed when the counter is zero. The third algorithm is a distributed algorithm
    with imperfect information. This algorithm also uses the backoff technique. In
    each round, a node calculates the average number of devices on the channels. Then,
    the node can obtain a probability to choose channel. The algorithm can reach a
    stable state but it may not be the Nash equilibrium since the available local
    information is incompletely known. Then, a mechanism is introduced to resolve
    inefficient stable states. The main difference of [34] from the previous game
    model is that the base stations (rather than the mobile nodes) are the players
    in this game. A noncooperative distributed resource allocation game in a multi-cell
    OFDMA system is proposed for M base stations serving L nodes. All of the base
    stations share the same frequency band with the total bandwidth B divided into
    k sub-channels. The players are the base stations and a strategy is the sub-channel
    assignment and power allocation. The transmission power at a sub-channel k of
    base station i is denoted as p i k . That is, p i =( p i 1 ,…, p i k ,…, p i K
    ) is the transmission power vector of all the sub-channels of base station i .
    The constraint on the transmission power of each base station is ∑ K k=1 p i k
    ≤ P max . The payoff function is defined as the difference between the weighted
    sum of the data rates ( ∑ i∈ U i β j R j (P, A i )) and the cost of total. power
    ( ∑ K k=1 p i k ) where U i is the set of nodes in cell i, β i is a weighting
    factor, P=[ p 1 ,…, p i ,…, p M ] and A i =[ a i kj ] K×L , a i kj is 1 if sub-channel
    k is assigned to node j ; otherwise, it is o. The payoff function is defined as
    follows: u i (P, A i )= ∑ j∈ U i β j R j (P, A i )−c ∑ k=1 K p i k (14) View Source
    where c denotes the price per unit power, having the unit bps/W. Each base station
    maximizes its payoff function. To find the optimal sub-channel assignment given
    a network power vector P 0 , the sub-channel assignment game can be represented
    as max A i ∑ i∈ U i β j R j ( P 0 , A i ) . Using a greedy approach, the solution
    A ∗i (P) , can be found when P is determined. Hence, we can obtain the optimal
    power allocation, which is the Nash equilibrium, by solving max p i ∑ j∈ U i β
    j R j ( P 0 , A ∗i (P)) . The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium of
    the power allocation game can be proved. Moreover, a distributed resource allocation
    algorithm is proposed to obtain both the sub-channel assignment and power allocation.
    The algorithm iteratively converges to an equilibrium point. The key concept of
    the algorithm is that each base station updates the subchannel assignment according
    to a greedy approach and the power allocation according to the best-response update
    using local information from nodes (i.e., SINR in each sub-channel). The work
    of [35] presents a noncooperative game model for spectrum access in distributed
    cognitive radio networks. In such a network, M secondary nodes opportunistically
    transmit data on the channel allocated to the primary node. Let p i be transmission
    power of secondary node i (i.e., transmitter and receiver). Secondary node i has
    a maximum transmission power constraint ( p i ≤ p ^ i ) in each channel. It is
    assumed that the total power in each channel must not exceed the maximum total
    power of all users using the channel k∈{1,…,K} , which is ∑ i∈ U k p i ≤ P ^ where
    U k denotes the set of all nodes using channel k and P ^ is the maximum total
    power of all users. The strategies of secondary nodes are the choices among K
    available channels. The objective of secondary node i is to maximize its payoff,
    which is a function of SINR γ k i on each channel k (i.e., max u i ( γ k i ) )
    subject to the maximum transmission power constraint p ^ (i.e., p i ≤ p ^ ). Using
    an N-channel bi-matrix game, the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium is
    proved. Next, this noncooperative game model is extended to the Stackelberg game
    since the channel access of a disconnecting secondary node depends on the other
    secondary nodes'' strategies. There are events which cause disruption in channel
    access. Arrival of a primary node is the main cause of channel access disruption
    since the secondary node has to leave the channel immediately. Interference from
    multiple secondary nodes accessing the channel and channel fading may also cause
    disruption in channel access. In an unexpected event, a secondary node who has
    any strategy that can help uninterrupted channel access is considered to be a
    leader (i.e., a leader has information on channel access by primary users). The
    rest of the secondary nodes who do not have any information on accessing channel
    are followers. Then, the payoff of the leader is the summation of u i ( γ k i
    ) and the cost that the followers pay for switching the channel. The payoff for
    a follower is the difference between u i ( γ k i ) and the price that the leader
    sets for switching the channel. Note that this leader-follower scenario is temporary.
    A node finds a channel and broadcasts the new channel information. Only one node
    can be a leader in each channel. The numerical results show the existence of an
    equilibrium solution. 2. Auction game-theoretic approach In [36], a distributed
    resource control scheme is presented to achieve fairness in OFDMA systems. Specifically,
    an auction game-theoretic resource allocation scheme based on iterative multi-unit
    second price auction is applied. A base station (BS) controls transmission power
    and bidding to maximize system capacity and node fairness. From an information-theoretic
    point of view, the medium access control (MAC)-layer throughput capacity region
    is achievable by successive decoding [37] when at each subchannel k , the first
    node''s decoded signal is subtracted from the sum signal, then the next node''s
    signal is decoded, and so on. In this auction, first each node i submits bid b
    i which includes power control variable and bid value. Each node calculates its
    bid by maximizing the expected Shannon capacity, and each node submits its bid
    and waits to be assigned the decoding priority for each sub-channel from the base
    station. after the bids are received by the base station, the decoding priority
    is assigned to each node following the weighted sumrate capacity maximization
    of the base station. The cost that each node i pays is the cost for winning the
    l th decoding priority at subchannel k . Then, transmission power will be allocated
    based on the optimal and fair water-filling allocation according to the result
    of the decoding order. Also, the cost that the nodes have to pay will be announced.
    To obtain the Nash equilibrium for bidding in this auction, an iterative update
    algorithm is proposed. The key concept is to update the bid value based on the
    difference between the current bidding efficiency and the target bidding efficiency
    at each time slot t . Bidding efficiency is computed by a node''s achievable transmission
    rate divided by the cost of the node. Also, the bidding control variable is updated
    using the subgradient algorithm as follows: x (t+1) = x (t) + α t g (t) (15) View
    Source where x (t) is the bidding control variable at time t, α t is a constant
    step size, and g (t) is a subgradient which is a function of the total cost that
    node has to pay for and the total bid money that node can use during the game.
    The analytical and simulation results show that this iterative update algorithm
    can converge to the stable and optimal equilibrium which can achieve fairness
    among users when the channel conditions of the subchannels for the different nodes
    are uniformly distributed. 3. Cooperative game-theoretic approach In [38], a cooperative
    game theoretic model is proposed for secondary base stations (SBSs) in a cognitive
    radio network. The main concept of this work is to form cooperative groups among
    the SBSs in a multi-channel cognitive radio network by using a game theoretic
    approach called coalition formation game. To improve the quality of information
    about availability of primary nodes (PNs) to serve secondary nodes (SNs), the
    SBSs share their information through control channels such as a cognitive pilot
    channel (CPC) to other SNs. SBS i∈I={1,…,M} detects the presence of any PU k∈K={1,…,K}
    by using a channel and serves L i SNs. Each SBS can gather information on the
    availability of channels as a subset K i ⊆K . The false alarm probability obtained
    by SBS i : over PN channel k is denoted as P i fal,k ‘ Then, the total potential
    utility of SBS i in a noncooperative approach is given as follows: u({i})= ∑ k∈
    K i ∑ j=1 L i [(1− P i fal,k ) θ k ρ ji − α k (1− P i det,k ) (1− θ k )( ρ k r
    k − ρ j k r k )] (16) View Source where ζ k is the probability that channel k
    is available and α k is a penalty factor defined by PN k for any SN causing interference.
    The term (1− P i det,k ) is the probability of misdetection. ρ ij is the probability
    of successful transmission of SN j to its serving SBS i at the time when channel
    k is available. The term ( ρ k r k − ρ j k r k ) is the reduction in the probability
    of successful transnusston of PN k at its receiver r k whenever SN j transmits
    over channel k at a time of the presence of PN k due to the mis-detection of PN
    k To improve the utility, the SBSs can share the available knowledge of the presence
    of PNs; however, there is a tradeoff between the utility gained from learning
    new channels (through information sharing) and the cost to obtain cooperative
    information. In a coalition S , the set of known PNs by any SBS i in the coalition
    is defined as K S = ∪ i∈S K i . Hence, the payoff of any SBS i∈S is defined as
    follows: u i (S)= ∑ k∈ K S ∑ j=1 L i [(1− P i k fal,k ) θ k i i k ρ ji − α k (1−
    P i k det,k ) (1− θ k i i k )( ρ k r k − ρ j k r k )] (17) View Source where θ
    k i i k is the probability that SBS i can obtain the knowledge of channel k from
    another SBS i k ∈S. i k =i if SBS i : has its own information on channel k . SBS
    i k giving the maximum utility will be selected by SBS i . Since the payoff of
    SBS i depends only on the identity of the SBSs in the coalition which SBS i .
    is a member of, this game can be considered as a hedonic coalition game [39].
    The formulation of the game is described next. Given two coalitions S 1 . and
    S 2 , and i∈ S 1 and i∈ S 2 , S 1 ⪰ S 2 means SBS i prefers to be a member of
    coalition S 1 over being a member of coalition S 2 , and S 1 ≻ S 2 means SBS i
    strictly prefers to be a member of coalition S 1 over being a member of coalition
    S 2 . Then, the proposed coalition formation game can be defined as follows: S
    1 ⪰ S 2 ⇔ w i ( S 1 )≥ w i ( S 2 ) (18) View Source where w i (S) is a preference
    function for SBS i and coalition S . SBS i makes a decision to leave its current
    coalition S x and then to join another coalition S y when S x ≠ S y if and only
    if S y ∪{i} ≻ i S x . This can be interpreted as: an SBS will switch to a new
    coalition if it can strictly gain more payoff without decreasing other members''
    payoffs in the new coalition. A partition or a set of all coalitions is Nash-stable
    if no SBS has an incentive to move from its current coalition to another coalition
    or to deviate and act alone. A distributed algorithm to find a Nash-stable partition
    is proposed and the simulation results show that the average payoff per SBS of
    the coalition formation scheme outperforms one of the noncooperative schemes when
    the number of SBS increases. Another coalitional game for transmission power allocation
    and subchannel assignment in the uplink channel of an OFDMA system is presented
    in [40]. In the considered system model, there are M nodes located in the coverage
    area of a same base station. The base station provides K ‘ subchannels to node
    i∈I={1,…,M} to guarantee the target rate requirement. Let k denote each subchannel
    k∈K={1,…,K} . Let R i be the target rate requirement of node i . Suppose that
    the total bandwidth is B , then the carrier spacing of every subchannel is △f=B/K
    -. A player defined in this game is a pair of one subchannel and one node. Hence,
    MK players are considered in this game. The strategy of each player is the transmission
    power assigned to subchannel p ik . Then, there are M coalitions ζ=[ S 1 ,…, S
    i ,…, S M ] to be assigned to the M nodes and each coalition S i contains K .
    players (e.g., shown in Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Coalitions of players are formed following
    the game model in [40] when there are 3 mobile nodes and 3 subchannels. Show All
    In this game, the members in each coalition do not change during the game. Consequently,
    the coalition S i achieves its rate C i = ∑ k∈K C ik where C ik =△f log 2 (1+
    γ ik ) is the Shannon capacity achieved by node i on subchannel k . γ ik is the
    SINR at the base station. The payoff that each coalition will obtain is defined
    as follows: u( S i )= 1 C k / R k −1 −α.t(1− C k / R k ) (19) View Source where
    t(⋅) is the step function with t(y)=1 if y≥0 and t(y)=0 if y<0 , and α is a positive
    constant. A coalition will achieve the highest payoff (i.e., positive infinite)
    when C k = R k . An iterative algorithm based on Markov modeling of the TU coalitional
    game is proposed to update the best responses. The analytical and numerical results
    show that the algorithm can be considered as a Markov process. The process can
    quickly converge to an absorbing state which is also a Nash equilibrium solution
    with probability of one. C. Channel Access Games in CDMA CDMA systems use spread-spectrum
    technology in which each node is assigned with a different code to allow multiple
    users to be multiplexed over the same channel at the same time. Power control
    for multiple access is crucial for CDMA to ensure that the received signal can
    be decoded correctly. In a CDMA system with self-interested nodes, the transmission
    power control problem can be modeled as both the complete and incomplete information
    noncooperative games. Also, cooperative game models can be used for group-rational
    nodes in a CDMA system to achieve a Pareto optimal power control strategy. A summary
    of the key features of these game models for CDMA is provided in Table IV. The
    details of these models are discussed next. Table IV Summary of CDMA-Based Channel
    Access Games 1. Noncooperative static game-theoretic approach In [41], a noncooperative
    game model is presented for power control. Each node has an objective to maximize
    its own utility. The game considers a multi-carrier direct-sequence CDMA system
    in which the data stream for each node is divided into multiple parallel streams.
    Each stream is first spread using a spreading sequence and then transmitted on
    a carrier. The strategy of each node is to choose its transmission power. A high
    transmission power may yield high SINR and high transmission rate. However, it
    may also cause high interference to the other nodes in the network. The utility
    of a node is defined as the ratio of the total throughput and the total transmission
    power for all K carriers. Assuming that all the nodes use equal transmission rates,
    the utility function of a node can be expressed as the ratio of the summation
    of the efficiency functions and the summation of transmission powers for all K
    carriers. The efficiency function (f(γ)) represents packet success probability.
    The utility is a non quasi-concave function of the transmission power of the node.
    Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution. At the Nash equilibrium, each node
    transmits only on the carrier with the best effective channel. This best effective
    channel is the channel that requires the least amount of transmission power to
    achieve optimal SINR γ ∗ , at the output of the uplink receiver. Optimal SINR
    γ ∗ =γ f ′ (γ) is the solution to the efficiency function. A unique Nash equilibrium
    in this game can be achieved under a certain set of conditions. Also, an iterative
    and distributed algorithm based on best-response update is proposed to obtain
    the Nash equilibrium. The results show that, at the Nash equilibrium, the total
    network utility of this multicarrier system is higher than that of a single carrier
    system. Also, it is higher than that of a multicarrier system with the nodes choosing
    their transmission powers to maximize their utilities over each carrier indepen-dently.
    In [42], a noncooperative static Bayesian game is presented for uplink power control
    in a CDMA network. Each node chooses its transmission power. The payoff is a function
    of the difference between throughput and power consumption. The throughput part
    in the payoff function is composed of the gain from achievable bit rate and a
    ‘success function’. The ‘success function’ is a Sigmoid function of SINR. Since
    the path loss information for the other nodes is not completely known, each node
    uses path loss probability density functions to estimate the SINR (and hence payoff)
    of the other nodes. The solution of this incomplete information game is the Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium (BNE), which can be obtained from the best-response dynamics.
    This dynamics represents the strategy update rules based on the expected utility
    when path loss information is not completely known to the other nodes. The existence
    of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium is proved and it can be obtained in a distributed
    way. In [43], a noncooperative power control game for multirate CDMA networks
    is studied. All nodes in this multirate CDMA system use the same chip rate. However,
    they are able to adjust their processing gains to increase their data rates. The
    objective of the game is similar to that of [41], [42]. However, the payoff of
    each node is defined as the difference between the throughput in bits per second
    and the cost of transmission power. The cost that each node has to pay is a function
    of its received power divided by the total received power of all nodes plus noise
    at the base station. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium are
    proved for two channel models, i.e., a binary-input Gaussian output channel and
    a binary symmetric channel. Also, the spectral efficiency is derived for both
    the channel models. A joint rate and power control game model is presented in
    [44] for uplink CDMA communications. The system model and the concept of power
    control and rate updates in this game are similar to those in [46]. In particular,
    each node can adjust both transmission rate and transmission power to maximize
    its payoff (i.e., utility). The payoff of each node is in bits/J, which can be
    calculated from packet length, transmission power, transmission rate, and an efficiency
    function which is related to the SINR. The strategy of each node is to choose
    rate and power for transmission. The sets of rate and power are shown to be convex.
    The existence of Nash equilibrium for joint rate and power control is proved by
    using the NikaidoIsoda theorem [45]. Moreover, an algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium
    in this noncooperative joint transmission rate and power control game, shortly
    called NRPG, is proposed. The requirement of this algorithm is that each node
    has to obtain the SINR of the other nodes. The algorithm is proved to converge
    to the same Nash equilibrium when the nodes are assigned with different initial
    powers. Also, NRPG can converge to the solution faster than the algorithm proposed
    by Zhao and Lu [46]. Another noncooperative game model for power control is proposed
    in [47]. The strategy of each node is to choose transmission power p i . Each
    node in this system model has an objective to minimize its cost (instead of maximizing
    its utility). The cost function should be convex and non-negative and in [47]
    it is chosen to be a weighted sum of power ( β i p i ) and square of SIR error
    ( δ i ( γ tar i − γ i )) which is the difference between the actual SIR and the
    target SIR. β i and δ i are weighting constants. A distributed algorithm is proposed
    to obtain the Nash equilibrium. The power update algorithm is expressed as follows:
    p t+1 i = γ tar i ( p t i γ t i )− β i 2 δ i ( p t i γ t i ) 2 (20) View Source
    where t denotes the t th iteration of the algorithm. However, the information
    of interference power and SIR is still required by the node from the base station
    in order to calculate γ t i in each iteration. The convergence of the algorithm
    is proved. The proof shows that the algorithm converges to a unique fixed solution
    under a set of conditions. Also, the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional
    power balance algorithm (e.g., smaller number of iterations are required for convergence
    to a solution, higher efficiency in power saving, and more nodes can be handled).
    2. Cooperative static game-theoretic approach In [48], a cooperative game is applied
    to obtain the optimal power allocation in a CDMA system. A multiuser CDMA system
    with perfectly known channel information and fixed signature and linear sequences
    is considered. The objective is to minimize power consumption given minimum SINR
    of each node. It is shown that the power region (i.e., a feasible set of power
    allocation such that the SINR requirement of each node is met) is convex and log-convex.
    If the power region is not empty, then there is a unique power allocation that
    satisfies the SINR requirements of all nodes. To obtain the unique, Pareto optimal,
    and proportional fair solution, a bargaining game similar to that in (3) is formulated
    and solved. In this case, a node''s strategy is its transmission power. The results
    show that the utility should be appropriately selected as a function of transmission
    power. The payoff function can be chosen to be u i ( s i )=− e s i , where s i
    , node i ''s strategy is the choice of transmission power. SECTION V. Game Models
    of Random Channel Access In this section, the game models for random channel access
    are reviewed. In particular, channel access based on ALOHA and CSMA/CA protocols
    are considered. A. Channel access games in ALOHA-like protocols In the literature,
    different game models, namely, noncooperative game, cooperative game, evolutionary
    game, and Stackelberg game models have been used for analyzing ALOHA-like channel
    access schemes with (and without) power control and rate adaptation. A summary
    of these game models is provided in Table V. The details of these models are described
    below. Table V Summary of ALOHA-like Channel Access Games 1. Noncooperative game-theoretic
    approach In [49], a noncooperative static game analysis is applied to the slotted
    ALOHA protocol with M selfish nodes. Actions of nodes are “To transmit” and “Not
    to transmit”. A node has the objective to maximize its expected payoff given other
    nodes'' transmission probabilities. The payoff is zero when a node chooses not
    to transmit, one when a node chooses to transmit and it is successful, and − c
    i when a node chooses to transmit but it is unsuccessful (here c i is the cost
    of unsuccessful transmission for node i ). Mixed strategy Nash equilibria are
    considered as the solutions which can be described as the transmission probability
    (i.e., the probability to perform action “To transmit” and “Not to transmit”)
    of the nodes. In [50], a noncooperative ALOHA game model is presented. The actions
    of the nodes are similar to those in [49]. However, the payoff is the utility
    defined as the difference between a logarithmic function of a node''s SINR and
    the cost of transmission. Note that the transmission power is assumed to be identical
    for all nodes. The channel gains of other nodes are unknown, and a node''s objective
    is to maximize its own expected utility. Note that only one node with the highest
    channel gain can capture the channel. Each node will gain zero payoff if it does
    not transmit. A node will transmit if its expected payoff is greater than zero.
    Bayesian Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution of the game. In a noncooperative
    ALOHA game, the Bayesian Nash equilibrium is always the threshold strategy of
    a channel gain. That is, a node will transmit if its channel gain is not lower
    than the threshold. The threshold strategy enables the system to exploit multiuser
    diversity by giving more chance of transmission to the node with better channel
    gain. To find the optimal strategy, the optimal threshold strategy has to be obtained
    first. In this model, only a symmetric case is considered where the cumulative
    distribution function (CDF) of channel gains and weights of the payoff function
    are identical for all nodes. The existence of a unique symmetric Bayesian Nash
    equilibrium is proved. Noncooperative Bayesian static ALOHA games are also presented
    in [51] and [52]. Both the game models consider interference. As in [49], a fixed
    power is assumed in both the MAC games. The nodes do not know others'' channel
    states (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)). Each node decides to transmit or not
    to transmit the data (i.e., strategies) based on the SNR. In [51], each node will
    then obtain its payoff which is the difference between the utility function of
    SNR and the cost function if its transmission is successful. The node will pay
    the cost if its transmission is unsuccessful and will gain nothing if the node
    makes a decision not to transmit data. Also, in [52], the payoff is the network
    throughput expressed as the difference between a logarithmic function of SNR and
    the cost of transmission power. Each node has an objective to maximize its expected
    payoff given a belief about other nodes'' channel states (i.e., probability density
    functions of other nodes'' SNRs or channel gains) and the transmission probabilities.
    As in [50], only symmetric case is considered, and Bayesian Nash equilibrium is
    obtained as the solution of both of these games. It is found that a node will
    transmit if its channel gain is not lower than the SNR threshold. The existence
    of a unique symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium is proved. It is mentioned in
    [52] that in the static game with symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium, a threshold
    exists such that the expected payoff of “To transmit” action is equal or greater
    than the expected payoff of “Not to transmit” action if and only if its channel
    gain is greater than the equilibrium threshold and the expected payoff is equal
    to or greater than zero. The best-response dynamics is used to obtain a pure Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium strategy. The convergence time of the best-response dynamics
    is of the order of a polynomial of number of nodes. In [53], nodes can observe
    multiple contention signals which are functions of nodes'' channel access probabilities.
    The action of each node is to select the channel access probability. The payoff
    of each node is the utility which is the difference between a function of its
    channel access probability and the cost. The cost is defined as a function of
    contention measure signals (e.g., collision probability and idle time between
    channel access). Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution. The conditions
    under which the Nash equilibrium becomes efficient are established. The utility
    functions can be defined by using reverse engineering from existing protocol and
    by using forward engineering from desired operating points and based on heuristics.
    Since a node can observe the outcome of others'' actions and payoffs indirectly,
    the node can use these observed information to update their distributed algorithms
    to converge to the Nash equilibrium. The dynamics of the random access game is
    studied. Three basic dynamic algorithms (i.e., best-response based, gradientplay
    based, and Jacobi-play based algorithms) are presented. Also, a variant of the
    basic best response-based dynamic algorithm is proposed when the propagation delay
    is taken into account. Moreover, a dynamic algorithm under estimation error is
    considered. It is proved that the stochastic gradientplay algorithm converges
    to the equilibrium point without error. A power-controlled MAC game and a random
    access game with incomplete information are presented in [54]. A node can be either
    selfish or malicious (i.e., type of node). In the power-controlled MAC game, the
    payoff of a selfish node is the expected value of the difference between a function
    of SINR and the energy cost. The payoff of a malicious node can be defined as
    two different functions depending on its opponent nodes. Two utility functions
    are considered, i.e., based on SINR and Shannon rate. Nash equilibrium is considered
    as the solution when the types of the nodes are known. On the other hand, Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution when the types of the nodes are
    unknown. Each node maximizes its expected payoff by varying its transmission power.
    A Bayesian random access game, in which the nodes transmit with probabilities
    such that their payoffs are maximized, yields the same result as that of the power-controlled
    game. The payoff of a selfish node is the expected value from successful and unsuccessful
    transmissions. Also, each node dynamically updates its belief about the opponent''s
    type using Bayes'' rule. Similar to [54], in [55], both random access game and
    power control game are studied. First, a random access game is presented. The
    payoff of node i is calculated based on the expected payoff when it transmits
    data, and the expected utility when it waits for transmission. A dynamic random
    access game is considered. At each stage of the game, nodes follow a mixed strategy
    (i.e., transmit or wait). Each node maximizes its payoff by choosing the transmission
    probability appropriately. The decision at each stage can be described as a state
    (i.e., the number of backlogged nodes) which is a general property of Markov games.
    Given the state information, the Markov perfect equilibrium at each stage of the
    game can be computed as the Nash equilibrium of the mixed strategy game. Cooperation
    among the nodes yields a higher payoff than that at the Nash equilibrium. Next,
    a power control game is presented. Unlike the mixed strategy of transmitting or
    waiting in the random access game, power control is the mixed strategy of each
    node in the power control game. Each node selects its transmission probability
    with different power levels from a feasible set of power levels to maximize its
    expected payoff. This payoff depends on the probability that the captured power
    level at the receiver belongs to any node i . Similar to the power control game,
    in a rate adaptation game, each node selects the probabilities of employing different
    modulation schemes (i.e., using different transmission rates) that maximize its
    payoff. This payoff depends on the probability that the captured rate belongs
    to any node i :. Zero power level or zero transmission rate can be considered
    as the action of waiting for a transmission. To this end, a joint power control
    and rate adaptation game is formulated. Nodes determine their equilibrium strategies
    which are both the power level and transmission rate maximizing their expected
    payoffs. Numerical results show that power and rate control game improves the
    expected utilities compared to the random access game discussed in the same paper.
    However, the joint power and rate control game incurs a higher computational complexity.
    In all the above works, it is assumed that the network has the single packet reception
    capability only. In contrast, in [56], a noncooperative game model is developed
    for optimal decentralized transmission control in a slotted ALOHA-like protocol
    for a finite-size random wireless network having the multipacket reception capability.
    The objective of each node in the network is to optimize its transmission probability
    such that its own utility is maximized. It is proved that, for a node, when the
    probability of successful transmission is a non-decreasing function of the corresponding
    SINR, there exists a threshold transmission policy which maximizes its utility.
    Subsequently, it is shown that there exists a Nash equilibrium at which every
    node adopts a threshold policy. 2. Incompletely-cooperative game-theoretic approach
    In [57], a game-theoretic model of a slotted ALOHA-like MAC is presented. The
    model considers nodes with traffic of either high-priority (HP) or low-priority
    (LP). Since the nodes transmitting low priority traffic can experience an unfair
    channel access (i.e., HP packets have higher probability to be transmitted than
    that of LP packets), selfish nodes can cheat by classifying the low priority traffic
    as high priority traffic to gain performance improvement. To solve this problem,
    an access point (AP) can decide the size of contention phase (CP) and contention
    free phase (CFP). In the contention phase, LP queues contend for channel with
    probability q while HP queues contend with probability p>q . The access point
    can switch to a contention-free phase for a fraction of the time α to poll the
    n LP nodes. Then, the throughput that each LP node receives during CFP is α/n
    as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. High and low priority queues access the channel with
    different probabilities during contention phase and low priority nodes are polled
    equally during contention-free phase. Show All Average delay and throughput are
    used to compute the utility of HP and LP nodes, respectively. Nash equilibrium,
    which is a solution of this game, is any fraction of time α in which the throughput
    of nodes with LP traffic pretending to be the HP traffic is lower than the throughput
    of truthful nodes with LP traffic. Therefore, Nash equilibrium is the point where
    none of the nodes has an incentive to lie about its traffic type. The access point
    can choose a value of α from an admissible range to ensure the truthful Nash equilibrium.
    This point can be chosen as the Nash bargaining solution from cooperative game
    theory. In [58], a pricing-based noncooperative slotted ALOHA MAC game is presented.
    The key idea of this game is to motivate the nodes to cooperate with each other
    by using a pricing mechanism in the payoff function so that the multiuser diversity
    gain can be achieved. A static game is proposed in which the actions of each player
    i∈I={1,…,M} are “To transmit” and “Not to transmit”. If a player successfully
    transmits its packet(s), the payoff is 1− c i − μ i , where c i is the cost of
    transmission and μ i is the price charged per successful packet transmission.
    If the transmission is unsuccessful, the payoff is − c i − v i . If a player chooses
    not to transmit and it waits, the payoff is − v i , where v i is the waiting cost
    which is defined as 1− c i − μ i . In this game, each node maximizes its payoff
    given the medium access probabilities of all nodes. The probabilities of medium
    access are identical for all nodes since a fair game is considered. To maximize
    the expected payoff, a node will choose “To transmit” when the expected utility
    of “To transmit” action is not lower than that of “Not to transmit” action. Nash
    equilibrium, which is considered as a solution, can be found to be of threshold
    type. The equilibrium threshold is the cost of the corresponding action. Therefore,
    the transmission is successful only if there is exactly one transmitting node
    and transmission cost is smaller than the equilibrium threshold. 3. Evolutionary
    game-theoretic approach In [59], an evolutionary game-theoretic model is formulated
    for ALOHA protocol. An evolutionary game is a dynamic game where players interact
    with other players and adapt their strategies based on payoff (fitness). The dynamics
    (i.e., stability) of the population adopting different strategies is studied.
    Also, an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) is considered. In the evolutionary
    game model, if an ESS is reached, the proportions of population adopting different
    strategies do not change over time. In particular, the population with ESS is
    immune from being invaded by a population with non-ESS strategy. The effect of
    time delay on the dynamics of the evolutionary game model is studied. Similar
    to the other ALOHA games, each player has two possible strategies (i.e., “To transmit”
    and “Not to transmit”). For the two-player case, if a player transmits a packet,
    it incurs a transmission cost (c∈(0,1)) irrespective of whether the transmission
    is successful or not. The payoffs are 1−c,0 , and −c if the player has a successful
    transmission, no transmission, and collision, respectively. It is found that this
    game has two pure Nash equilibria (i.e., (Player I - Transmit, Player II - Not
    to transmit) and (Player I - Not to transmit, Player II - Transmit)) and one mixed
    Nash equilibrium (1−c,c) where 1−c and c represent proportions of individuals
    which transmit and do not transmit, respectively. The strategy (1−c,c) can also
    be an ESS since this strategy is a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium. 4. Stackelberg
    game-theoretic approach In [60], slotted ALOHA protocols are analyzed using game
    theory. The model considers throughput of the system when nodes are of self-interest
    and compete for bandwidth using a generalized version of slotted-ALOHA protocols.
    First, an analysis based on a two-state Markov model is presented when the nodes
    cooperate to equally share the bandwidth and maximize the system throughput. The
    states are “Free state” when the most recent transmission of node is successful,
    and “Backlogged state” when the most recent transmission is unsuccessful due to
    collision. The results show that the lower bound of aggregated throughput is one
    half and this bound is independent of the number of nodes. Next, an analysis is
    presented for the case when the nodes are selfish to maximize their own throughputs.
    Since in this case all nodes transmit with probability one, the system throughput
    will be zero. Next, a Stackelberg game model is presented. A leader is any node
    that takes the selfish nodes (i.e., the followers) into account. The follower
    and leader nodes choose their best strategies (i.e., transmission probabilities
    in both states) by maximizing their throughputs (i.e., payoffs) subject to constraints
    on the budgets of the nodes. The budget should be higher than the cost of transmission.
    The followers maximize their throughputs based on the leader''s strategy while
    the leader maximizes its own throughput according to the best response strategies
    of followers. Backward induction is used to find the Stackelberg equilibrium.
    The leader achieves a higher throughput than that of the followers when the budget
    is large. B. Channel Access Games in CSMAICA Systems In this section, the game
    models formulated for analyzing CSMA/CA-based channel access are reviewed. The
    solution of a CSMA/CA game describes how the nodes in the network should choose
    their backoff windows so that the equilibrium point can be reached. Noncooperative
    static game-theoretic approach, noncooperative dynamic game approach, and repeated
    game approach can be used to model and analyze CSMA/CA systems. Since the nodes
    are selfish, to maximize their payoffs, the nodes may set the backoff windows
    to the smallest value. However, if all the nodes do so, the network throughput
    will be zero due to collision. To avoid this problem, incompletelycooperative
    game models are used in which the nodes are enforced to cooperate in the system
    by using a penalizing mechanism. A summary of these approaches is provided in
    Table VI. The details are described below. Table VI Summary of CSMA/CA Channel
    Access Games 1. Noncooperative static game-theoretic approach In [51], a medium
    access contention game model is formulated for the CSMA protocol. Similar to the
    slotted ALOHA protocol, the possible results from transmission attempts of each
    node are successful transmission, collision, and no-transmission. Transmission
    after k backoff slots is added to the action space of each node. The action set
    is A={1,…,K,K+1} , where k∈K=A∖{K+1}={1,…,K} denotes transmitting at slot k and
    index K+1 denotes the action of not-transmitting a packet. The payoff function
    of node i is the difference between the utility and the cost of transmission if
    this node selects a backoff slot number which is less than the backoff slot number
    of each of the other nodes. Node i : incus a cost of transmission if a collision
    occurs, that is, when the earliest backoff slot chosen by one (or more) of the
    other nodes is the same as that of node i . Node i gains nothing if it selects
    a backoff slot number greater than the lowest backoff slot number among the other
    nodes. The nodes play the game by maximizing their expected payoffs (similar to
    the ALOHA game models discussed in Section V-A1 before) given the type spaces
    (i.e., channel SNR, h) and beliefs (i.e., probabilities of channel states of other
    nodes, P −i ( h −i ) ). A symmetric mixed strategy (in terms of the probability
    that the node will not transmit at the first k∈K slots) Bayesian Nash equilibrium
    is found for this single-stage (static) Bayesian game. In [61], CSMA/CA is first
    modeled as a static game and then as a dynamic game (e.g., Bayesian learning game
    with incomplete information). In the static game, the action can be “To transmit”
    or “Not to transmit” (i.e., wait). after node i selects its action, the utility
    of node i is calculated as a function of status of the packet transmission and
    actions of all nodes. The status can be “idle” (i.e., no transmission), “successful”,
    or “fail” (i.e., collision). If the nodes “decide to transmit at the beginning
    of a given slot with probability p i “ or “stay quiet with probability 1− p i
    , for the same transmission probability by all nodes (i.e., symmetric behaviour),
    there is a unique solution of this static game ( s ∗ 1 =⋯= s ∗ i =⋯= s ∗ M = p
    ∗ ) which is a symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium given as follows: s ∗
    i =1− ( u w − u f u s − u f ) 1 M−1 (21) View Source where there are M nodes in
    the system and u s , u f , and u w are the payoffs that a node obtains if its
    status is successful, failed, and idle, respectively. The dynamic game model for
    CSMA/CA will be described in Section V-B2. In [62], a noncooperative game theoretic
    model is presented for contention control in a point-to-multipoint network (e.g.,
    WiMAX network). Multiple subscriber stations (SSs) are connected to a base station.
    A time-division duplex mode for wireless access is used for best-effort traffic.
    To provide multiple access services, a node has a limited number of time slots
    to transmit request messages (REQs). The node enters a contention resolution process
    when it has packets to send. The node sets its backoff counter (i.e., the number
    of slots that the node needs to wait before it transmits an REQ). If an REQ is
    successfully received and there is enough bandwidth, then the node can transmit
    data without collision in the scheduled time slots. The transmission is unsuccessful
    if a permission is not received by the node from the base station within a defined
    period of time, in which case, a new exponential backoff process is started. The
    objective here is to obtain high throughput by avoiding collision in the system.
    This can be achieved by gradually adjusting the contention windows of all contending
    nodes to the optimal values. The game in [62] considers a saturated system (i.e.,
    nodes always have packets to transmit). The channel access probability of node
    i can be found to be p i =2/(C W i +1) where C W i is a constant contention window
    of node i . The utility function has to be continuously differentiable, strictly
    concave, and with finite curvatures bounded away from zero. The utility is chosen
    to be a function of channel access probability which is the strategy of a node.
    The cost of transmission is the probability of collision ( p i , q i (p)) , where
    q i (i) is the conditional collision probability of node i . In the game, the
    utility function is defined as follows: μ( p i )= ln( p i )− p i / w i 1/ v i
    −1/ w i . (22) View Source u( p i ) is an increasing function in the strategy
    space of node i (i.e., channel access probability ( p i ) ) where p i ∈[ v i ,
    w i ] and 0< v i < w i <1 . The payoff function is then u( p i )=μ( p i )− p i
    q i (p) . Nash equilibrium (defined as p ∗ ) is the solution of the game. The
    proof of the existence of unique non-trivial Nash equilibrium (i.e., u i ( p ∗
    i )= q i ( p ∗ ) , where q i (i) is the conditional collision probability of node
    i .), is provided. The best-response play and gradient play algorithms are presented
    to obtain the Nash equilibrium solution. The results show that, with this algorithm,
    a higher throughput is achieved with fewer transmissions than that of standard
    binary exponential backofff protocol. 2. Noncooperative dynamic game-theoretic
    approach The single-stage CSMA Bayesian game in [51] described before is extended
    to a dynamic game where the static one-stage game is played repeatedly. The action
    of node i , can be either to transmit a packet or not to transmit a packet based
    on node i ''s channel gain h i and node i . ''s type. K stages associated with
    K backoff slots are considered in this Bayesian dynamic game. At stage k∈{1,…,K}
    , if node i successfully transmits its packet, it will obtain the payoff function,
    μ i ( h i )− c i ( h i ) where μ i is the utility function and c i ( h i ) is
    the cost function. If node i unsuccessfully transmits its packet, it will pay
    − c i ( h i ) as a cost of transmission; otherwise, node i gains nothing (i.e.,
    zero payoff). If there is no transmission, the stage of the game increases from
    k to k+1 . When there is at least one transmission at any stage k , the game ends.
    Each node maximizes its expected payoff from stage 1 to k to obtain the perfect
    Bayesian equilibrium (PBE). A symmetric PBE is considered since it is a proper
    operating point of a distributed protocol for the following reasons. First, it
    might not be possible to distinguish among nodes in the random access network.
    Second, asymmetric PBE is not sustainable since it causes unfairness problem by
    assigning unequal shares of channel to the nodes. Third, it is much simpler to
    operate a network with a single strategy in a symmetric equilibrium for all nodes
    than to operate a network with different strategies for different nodes. The symmetric
    PBE is shown to be a threshold strategy. That is, any node i : decides to transmit
    at stage k when its SNR is greater than SNR threshold h k th (i.e., h i > h k
    th ). The numerical results show that the proposed protocols provide better robustness
    and higher multi-user diversity gain than those of conventional random access
    protocols. The static game is extended to a dynamic Bayesian-learning game with
    the unknown number of contending nodes in [61] (i.e., the static game is played
    repeatedly). There are maximum of M nodes in the system. These nodes compete for
    transmission at the beginning of a time slot. Fairness requirement is considered.
    In order to maximize the payoffs of the nodes, only symmetric strategy with s
    ∗ 1 =⋯= s ∗ i =⋯= s ∗ M = p ∗ , which is the probability of transmission, is considered.
    Each time slot corresponds to a stage in this dynamic game. Since the number of
    contending nodes is unknown, each node needs to observe the feedbacks from its
    previous play. Then, the node can build its belief about the network using Bayes''
    rule. It is assumed that all nodes can keep track of their historical information
    perfectly. Three counters (i.e., the total number of passed time slots, the total
    number of successfully transmitted data packets, and the number of times that
    ACK control-frame is not received in a pre-defined time space after transmitting
    the data packet) are used to compute the belief. The current packet transmission
    probability and the frame collision probability of each node can be computed by
    these three counters under the assumption that all nodes always have packets to
    transmit. Each node has to listen to the channel to receive any possible packet
    from its neighbouring nodes when it is idle. after that, each node can obtain
    the posterior belief of the number of concurrently contending nodes (n) for the
    channel by using both the transmission and collision probabilities (i.e., p and
    q , respectively) as follows: n=f(p,q)=1+ log(1−q) log(1−p) . (23) View Source
    It is found that the equilibrium optimal solution of this game depends on the
    number of contending nodes n . The transmission probability can be varied according
    to the following equation in which only contention parameter C W min (i.e., minimum
    contention window) is considered: p= 2(1−2q) (1−2q)(C W min +1)+q.C W min .(1−(2q
    ) n ) (24) View Source where C W min =min([n×rand(7,8)],C W max ),rand(x,y) returns
    a random value between x and y , and n is the number of concurrently contending
    nodes. The game state n can be then updated using (23) after a node updates its
    beliefs. Simulation results show that the performance of the dynamic CSMA game-based
    MAC is superior to the IEEE 802.11 DCF MAC in terms of throughput, delay, and
    packet-loss rate. Another dynamic game model for CSMA/CA is proposed in [63],
    where the probabilities of transmission are the strategies of the nodes. Each
    node estimates its conditional collision probability and adjusts the persistence
    probability. The payoff of each node is the difference between the utility when
    the node accesses the channel with probability p i , and the cost (i.e., probability
    of collision). For a network with homogeneous nodes, the game model has a unique
    nontrivial Nash equilibrium which is a symmetric equilibrium. This guarantees
    fair sharing of wireless channel among the same class of nodes. Next, the dynamics
    of the game is studied. Although one node can observe the outcome of other nodes,
    it does not have complete knowledge of actions and payoffs of other nodes. Every
    node adjusts its current channel access probability gradually in the gradient
    direction based on the observations of other nodes'' actions. Then, the Nash equilibrium
    can be reached. Based on the dynamics of this random access game, a new MAC protocol
    based on CSMA/CA is proposed. Instead of executing exponential backoff upon collisions,
    each node estimates its collision probability and contention window according
    to gradient play. Each node can estimate its conditional collision probability
    by observing the average number of consecutive idle slots. Therefore, the size
    of contention window can be adjusted accordingly. Throughput and shortterm fairness
    of the proposed MAC protocol are better than those of the IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol.
    Service differentiation is also considered. When there is more than one class
    of nodes, the throughput ratio can converge to a constant when the total number
    of nodes increases. 3. Incompletely-cooperative game-theoretic approach In [64],
    a CSMA/CA-based MAC game model is presented for dynamic spectrum access in a cognitive
    radio network. This game model can be divided into two sub-games. The first subgame
    is a channel allocation game in which the nodes compete to allocate radio interfaces
    to the channels. The second subgame is a multiple access game among the nodes
    contending to transmit packets in the same channel. The available frequency band
    is divided into K channels of the same bandwidth. Each node is equipped with l
    radio interfaces (for l<K ). Each node can hear other nodes'' transmissions if
    the same channel is used. Each node determines the number of interfaces to be
    used in each channel. This is the action of nodes in the first sub-game of channel
    allocation. Each node maximizes its utility function which is the sum of throughputs
    achieved by the node in all allocated channels. Each node can observe other nodes''
    information perfectly. The solution of the channel allocation game is the Nash
    equilibrium if the difference between the number of interfaces in any channel
    x and that in any other channel y is lower than or equal to 1. Also, the number
    of interfaces allocated to any channel x by node i is lower than or equal to 1
    for any channel y . It is found that if the rate function of each channel is independent
    of the number of interfaces in any channel, then any Nash equilibrium of channel
    allocation is Pareto optimal. The existence of Nash equilibrium is shown and its
    efficiency (i.e., price of anarchy) is studied. It is found that the price of
    anarchy is close to one (i.e., Nash equilibrium yields a payoff close to that
    of the socially optimal solution). Next, the second sub-game for CSMA/CA channel
    contention is formulated. This sub-game aims not only to optimize the network
    performance, but also to provide incentives to the nodes to behave optimally.
    The actions of the nodes are “To transmit”, “Not to transmit”, and “To backoff”
    in which a contention window value between one and the maximum value is chosen
    by a node. Node i selects the value of contention window on each channel c to
    maximize its throughput (i.e., payoff). The static CSMA/CA game shows that the
    Nash equilibrium (i.e., contention window is chosen to be one) is inefficient
    and unfair. A desirable solution for the CSMA/CA game should have three properties:
    uniqueness, per-radio fairness, and Pareto optimality. Using the Nash bargaining
    framework from the cooperative game theory, these three properties can be achieved.
    However, in the noncooperative regime, the Nash bargaining solution is not a Nash
    equilibrium and might not be stable. Therefore, a penalizing mechanism is introduced
    by which the node deviating from Nash bargaining solution will be punished. A
    jamming mechanism is presented to penalize the deviating node. The deviating node
    is selectively jammed for a short duration by other nodes using the same channel
    when the deviating node is detected doing selfishly for its transmission. Using
    the penalty function and the jamming mechanism, the game can reach a Nash equilibrium
    unilateral deviation from which is not profitable. A distributed algorithm is
    proposed to obtain the Pareto-optimal Nash equilibria. The algorithm can converge
    to the equilibrium point even in case of imperfect information. The algorithm
    is based on a round-based distributed algorithm [65]. Also, a coordination algorithm
    is proposed for CSMA/CA in which one node acts as a coordinator for the observed
    channel by inflicting penalties to the other nodes which receive a higher throughput.
    In [66], an incompletely cooperative game model is presented for wireless mesh
    networks. The routers and clients communicate wirelessly with each other in a
    mesh architecture. CSMA/CA is used as a channel access mechanism. Since a packet
    can be retransmitted only for a certain number of times, the game model can be
    formulated as a finite repeated game. The number of opponents can be estimated
    by using conditional collision probability and transmission probability. These
    probabilities are computed by the node using two local counters (the total number
    of successfully transmitted data frames and the total number of transmitted data
    frames which are unsuccessful). However, these estimations are accurate only under
    saturated conditions (i.e., nodes always have packets to transmit). A virtual
    CSMA/CA mechanism, V-CSMA/CA is proposed. V-CSMA/CA follows the CSMA/CA scheme
    but it handles virtual frames. V-CSMA/CA will send a virtual frame and then the
    probability of collision is estimated. If the channel is idle, the node will observe
    that the virtual frame is successfully transmitted. A collision of virtual frame
    will be detected whenever any other node chooses the same time slot for transmission
    of their real data frame. If the node has no packet to transmit, the game state
    is estimated by using V-CSMA/CA. If the node has packets to transmit, the game
    state is estimated by using CSMA/CA. In the analysis of the game, a player is
    not always fixed. That is, Player 1 stands for node i and Player 2 stands for
    all other opponent nodes. The actions of Player 1 are “Transmission” and “Backoff”.
    The actions of Player 2 are “Successful Transmission” (i.e., Player 1 selects
    “Backoff” and none of the nodes in the group of Player 2 selects “Transmission”),
    “Unsuccessful Transmission” (i.e., Player 1 selects “Backoff”, but a node in the
    group of Player 2 selects “Transmission”), or “Backoff” as shown in Fig. 5. μ
    i b , μ i f , and μ i s are utility obtained when Player i chooses to backoff,
    to transmit and transmission is successful, and to transmit but transmission fails,
    respectively. The optimal strategy of each player ( s ∗ i ) can be found by minimizing
    its payoff by varying the transmission probability p i . It can be considered
    as a mixed strategy solution. Then, the cooperation among the nodes considered.
    In a two-node scenario, one node adjusts its transmission probability to help
    the other node to achieve the optimal payoff (i.e., p ∗ 1 =arg min p 1 u 1 ( p
    2 , p 1 ) and p ∗ 2 =arg min p 2 u 2 ( p 1 , p 2 ) , where u 1 (⋅) and u 2 (⋅)
    are payoff functions of Players 1 and 2 which are based on each other''s utility
    of transmission, respectively. Fig. 5. Strategies of two players when Player 1
    is nodeand Player 2 refers to all opponent nodes [66]. Show All The transmission
    probabilities can be changed by tuning the MAC contention parameters as in [61].
    after estimating the game state, the mesh router broadcasts its estimated information
    to all nodes. Since in a dynamic network frequent information updates are needed,
    this may result in large overhead. To reduce the overhead, a distributed approach
    is used by each node to detect the channel, estimate the game state, and adjust
    the contention parameters. Moreover, the estimation is performed after a packet
    is transmitted or a packet is discarded (rather than in every time slot). Also,
    the contention parameter is adjusted accordingly. The simulation results show
    that the incompletely cooperative game can improve throughput and decrease delay,
    jitter, and packet loss rate. The fairness of this game is comparable to that
    of the IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol. 4. lncomoletelv-coooerative repeated game-theoretic
    ap- 5. proach In [67], a game-theoretic study of CSMA/CA under a backoff attack
    is presented. An enforcement mechanism is introduced for the misbehaving nodes
    in the network. Although this enforcement mechanism is similar to that in [64],
    here it is used in the context of a mobile ad hoc network and the game formulation
    is for a repeated game in which a long-term utility is to be maximized. First,
    a noncooperative game is formulated for a finite number of nodes. Each node chooses
    an action which is a backoff configuration from a feasible set. The payoff function
    is defined to be the bandwidth share function depending on the backoff configuration
    profile (s=( s 1 ,…, s i ,…, s M )) . Nash equilibrium is the solution of this
    one-shot noncooperative game which might be unfair or inefficient. Therefore,
    to obtain a better solution, a repeated game is proposed in which a node takes
    into account the effect of its current action on the future actions of other nodes.
    The number of stages is finite and should be large enough to approach the steady
    state values. Nodes can switch between standard or non-standard backoff configuration
    (i.e., fair or more-than-fair bandwidth share, respectively) to maximize their
    own long-term payoffs. To prevent the backoff attack and to obtain a fair Pareto
    optimal and sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium, a strategy profile called cooperation
    via randomized inclination to self-ish/greedy play (CRISP) is introduced. This
    optimal solution is a probability distribution over the selected backoff configuration
    at stage k( s k i ) . An invader node deviating from CRISP will experience lower
    bandwidth than that of nodes playing CRISP. SECTION VI. Summary of Game Models
    and Open Research Issues A. Summary of Game Models Table VII summarizes the game
    models formulated for the key multiple access mechanisms. In the channel access
    games for TDMA, nodes compete with each other to obtain time slots for their transmissions.
    Time slot allocation among the nodes is performed by using various game models.
    In the auction game models, the nodes bid for time slots and they have to pay
    to the base stations for the allocated time slots. Game models can be formulated
    in which the nodes are able to choose transmission power in their allocated time
    slots. To enforce cooperation among the nodes, a punishment and truthtelling mechanism
    can be used. Table VII Summary of Channel Access Games In the channel access games
    for FDMA, most of the models consider how nodes (with single or multiple radio
    interfaces) choose channels for transmission. In these game formulations, the
    number of radios, transmit rate, and power rate assigned to each channel correspond
    to nodes'' actions. In the channel access games for CDMA, power control is the
    key objective of all the proposed games. Both cooperative and noncooperative games
    can be formulated. Nodes select their transmission powers to meet their requirements
    in terms of SINR and transmission cost. In most of the ALOHA-like game models,
    the nodes can choose either “To transmit” or “Not to transmit” as their possible
    actions and the transmission powers of the nodes are assumed to be fixed. Then,
    the games have mixed strategy solutions. Some of the games can be shown to have
    solutions which are threshold strategies. In some of the CSMA/CA game models,
    the actions are “To transmit” and “To wait for k backoff time slots”. The solutions
    of these game models are mixed strategies (i.e., the transmitting probability
    of nodes at the first k time slots). In some CSMA/CA-like MAC game models, the
    action set of nodes is defined as transmission probabilities. In addition, most
    of the CSMA/CA-like MAC game models consider only the symmetric strategy case
    by assuming that all nodes are identical and throughput maximization is the key
    objective. Since in random access schemes, nodes access the channel(s) in a distributed
    manner, some nodes may misbehave. A penalizing mechanisms is required to address
    this problem. A summary of game models for contention-free channel access approaches
    is shown in Table VIII and a summary of game models for random channel access
    approaches is shown in Table IX. Table VIII Game theory models for contention-free
    channel access Table IX Game models for random channel access B. Open Research
    Issues Based on the summary of the game models presented in the previous section,
    several open research issues on the application of game theoretic models for design,
    analysis, and optimization of multiple access schemes for wireless networks can
    be identified as follows: Investigation of different equilibrium concepts: Many
    works in channel access games only study Nash equilibrium as the solution concept.
    However, Nash equilibrium does not always provide the best network performance.
    Therefore, other equilibrium concepts need to be inves-tigated. For example, Nash
    bargaining solution, which is Pareto optimal, can be considered for efficiency
    and fairness reasons. Another solution is correlated equilibrium which is a more
    general equilibrium concept than the Nash equilibrium and also incurs less computational
    complexity. It can be computed in polynomial time for essentially all kinds of
    multi-player games. Utility and cost function design: In the application of game
    theory to multiple channel access, utility and cost indicate, respectively, the
    preference of players to be maximized and to be minimized for channel access.
    There are many different functions used to represent payoff of players in channel
    access games. Comparisons among the utility functions in terms of performance
    and effectiveness may be required. Also, the utility functions should consider
    system parameters such as the priorities of packets, amount of battery power available,
    and application-layer QoS parameters. To obtain suitable utility functions that
    can converge to desirable equilibria, reverse engineering from existing protocols,
    desired operating points, or forward engineering from heuristics [68] can be used.
    Cooperation enforcement mechanism: In random channel access games, many works
    propose cooperation enforcement mechanisms in noncooperative scenarios. Penalizing
    and pricing mechanisms are introduced. However, the complexity and implementation
    issues of these mechanisms (e.g., jamming and detection mechanisms) need to be
    investigated while developing practical protocols. In this case, a pricing mechanism
    may be preferred over a penalizing mechanism since pricing schemes are easier
    to be implemented by service providers. Uncertainty in wireless and mobile networks
    and accuracy of available information: Some game models are formulated as dynamic
    or repeated games in order to analyze the outcomes in long-run periods. Most games
    assume that the number of nodes in the network is constant; however, in realistic
    scenarios, the number of nodes changes over time (i.e., nodes leave or join the
    network). In random channel access games, the number of nodes can be estimated
    by using probabilities of packet transmission and collision. It might be acceptable
    if the time duration of one stage of the game is short or the game is not played
    infinitely. However, it is not completely true for all games. Moreover, most games
    assume that the nodes completely know other nodes'' information. The assumption
    may not always hold in a mobile wireless network. Then, unknown information has
    to be estimated based on some available knowledge of mobiles and their belief
    models (i.e., probability distribution). Currently, there are few works using
    game-theoretic approaches with incomplete information. Bayesian game and Bayesian-learning
    mechanism are useful tools to study the multiple access problem under incomplete
    information. More works in this area are required to model and analyze distributed
    multiple access methods in large-scale wireless networks. Cost of information:
    The Bayesian Nash equilibrium for incomplete information game may be inefficient
    due to the lack of complete information. Nodes can implement the information gathering
    mechanism so that a better decision can be made. However, the cost of information
    collection needs to be considered and a cost-benefit analysis needs to be performed.
    Develop defense mechanisms against multiple access attack: Defending attacks from
    untrusted nodes is an important research issue in wireless networks. Malicious
    nodes prevent other nodes from accessing the network (i.e., denial-of-service
    (DoS) attack). For example, jamming attack is a form of DoS attack. There are
    some channel access games which take security issues into consideration. However,
    most of these game-theoretic models analyze the interactions between pairs of
    jammers and communicating nodes or between pairs of jammers and detecting nodes
    when an intrusion detection system (IDS) is deployed [69] [70]. A few researches
    such as those in [71]–[73] formulate games between jammers and communicating nodes
    in order to analyze equilibrium points as defense strategies against jamming attacks.
    More researches in this area are required. For example, we can formulate a noncooperative
    game with incomplete information when types of nodes such as selfish, malicious,
    or defending (i.e., when IDS is deployed) are incompletely known to other nodes.
    Multiple access in heterogeneous wireless networks: Channel allocation and multiple
    access problem in a heterogeneous wireless access network can be modeled by using
    game theory. In a heterogeneous network, the service providers for the different
    wireless access networks as well as the mobile users (who are able to access the
    different networks using multiple radio interfaces) may cooperate or compete with
    each other. Game theoretic modeling and analysis of the interactions among the
    mobile nodes and service providers is an interesting research topic. Again, in
    a heterogeneous network where a bi-Ievel hierarchy exists (e.g., in a cellular
    network where macrocells are underlaid with femtocells), transmission power and
    rate control problem (e.g., by the macro base stations and the femto access points)
    for multiple access can be modeled by using game theory, and an optimal multiple
    access method can be designed. Develop application-centric game models for multiple
    access: Traditional multiple access schemes may not be efficient in some specific
    wireless access scenarios such as in vehicular networks and wireless sensor networks.
    There are two steps in designing MAC protocols for a specific application [74].
    First, the application requirements and the resource constraints are specified.
    Next, a protocol that satisfies all these constraints is designed. For example,
    in vehicular networks, high mobility that causes the topology of the network to
    vary rapidly is one of the application specifications, and transmission delay
    (i.e., emergency messaging delay) is an application requirement. Limited bandwidth
    due to high vehicle mobility and vehicle density is one of the resource constraints.
    These specifications and requirements need to be considered when designing a multiple
    access method for vehicular networks. For a game theoretic multiple access scheme,
    the utility functions for the players should take the related parameters into
    account. Due to the applications'' specific requirements and specifications, developing
    game models for application-centric multiple access is more challenging. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion Game theory has been widely used to model and analyze the noncooperative
    and cooperative behaviours of mobile nodes in the context of multiple access in
    wireless networks. The game models are useful for designing distributed channel
    access mechanisms in wireless networks to achieve stable and efficient solutions.
    This article has presented a comprehensive survey of the game models developed
    for multiple access in wireless networks. These game models have been categorized
    based on the types of protocols (e.g., contentionfree or contention-based) and
    types of games (e.g., complete and incomplete information, and static and dynamic
    games). The major findings from these game models have been discussed. Unavailability
    of complete information, misbehaviour of nodes, consideration of system (i.e.,
    implementation) aspects give rise to major challenges in designing game theoretic
    design of multiple access schemes in wireless networks. From these perspectives,
    several open research directions have been outlined. Authors Figures References

    Abstract: Spectrum inference, also known as spectrum prediction in the literature,
    is a promising technique of inferring the occupied/free state of radio spectrum
    from already known/measured spectrum occupancy statistics by effectively exploiting
    the inherent correlations among them. In the past few years, spectrum inference
    has gained increasing attention owing to its wide applications in cognitive radio
    networks (CRNs), ranging from adaptive spectrum sensing, and predictive spectrum
    mobility, to dynamic spectrum access and smart topology control, to name just
    a few. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey and tutorial on the recent
    advances in spectrum inference. Specifically, we first present the preliminaries
    of spectrum inference, including the sources of spectrum occupancy statistics,
    the models of spectrum usage, and characterize the predictability of spectrum
    state evolution. By introducing the taxonomy of spectrum inference from a time-frequency-space
    perspective, we offer an in-depth tutorial on the existing algorithms. Furthermore,
    we provide a comparative analysis of various spectrum inference algorithms and
    discuss the metrics of evaluating the efficiency of spectrum inference. We also
    portray the various potential applications of spectrum inference in CRNs and beyond,
    with an outlook to the fifth-generation mobile communications and next generation
    high frequency communications systems. Last but not least, we highlight the critical
    research challenges and open issues ahead. Published in: IEEE Communications Surveys

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction A. Background and Motivation
    The contradiction between spectrum shortage and spectrum under-utilization has
    motivated the emergence of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) or opportunistic spectrum
    access (OSA) [1]. Cognitive radio (CR) [2] has been well recognized as one of
    the crucial techniques of realizing the DSA/OSA concept. Since its conception,
    CR has been designed for autonomous reconfiguration by learning from and ultimately
    adapting to the continuously changing radio environment [3]. The first step of
    implementing a CR is to capture the relevant information about the spectral evolution.
    In the spectrum management framework relying on spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation
    decisions, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility proposed in [4], spectrum sensing
    has the task of sensing its occupancy and capturing the characteristics of the
    primary user (PU). However, in the practical sensing process, some inevitable
    problems arise concerning the sensing speed, the potentially excessive energy
    consumption and the limited sensing scope, all of which hinder the efficient operation
    of the CR. The main reason for these problems is that each CR can only sense the
    current radio environment at its operating location without any awareness of the
    unsensed bands or locations and of the future trends of the spectral domain activities
    [5]. This inevitably wastes precious information about the evolution of spectral
    states between time slots, frequency bands, geographical locations, etc. Spectrum
    inference/prediction is known as an effective technique complementary to spectrum
    sensing for capturing the relevant information about the spectral evolution and
    identifying spectrum holes. Briefly, spectrum sensing determines the spectrum
    state in a passive manner using various signal detection methods. By contrast,
    spectrum inference/prediction is a promising technique of inferring the occupied/free
    state of radio spectrum from already known/measured spectrum occupancy statistics
    by effectively exploiting the inherent correlations among them, in a proactive
    manner. Fortunately, some other fields of application, such as the atmosphere
    [6], finance [7], network traffic [8] and human mobility [9], inference/prediction
    techniques (including the popular big data technique [10]) have provided potential
    techniques of discovering the usage patterns hidden in the data and have succeeded
    in maintaining the stability of the economy, forecasting the weather conditions
    and so on. Similarly, spectrum inference/prediction is a promising technique that
    can be utilized for acquiring precious unknown spectrum occupancy information
    in advance and for enhancing the performance of the CRs by accelerating the process
    of choosing the best channel and expanding the sensing scope in the time-frequency-spatial-domain
    [11]–[13]. Therefore, an increasing number of researchers have been focusing on
    using or developing effective inference/prediction techniques for CRs. Preliminary
    results (see [14]–[20]) demonstrate that spectrum inference/prediction algorithms
    operating across the time-frequency-spatial dimensions may equip CRs with an accurate
    forecasting capability. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a survey of
    the specific algorithms, since the inference/prediction function is at the heart
    of the CR architecture and operates in a realm, where communications techniques
    meet artificial intelligence. B. Comparison With Related Survey Articles Historically
    speaking, there is only a brief survey relying on 15 citations [21] on spectrum
    prediction in CRNs, which is focused on a temporal scope. By contrast, the goal
    of this paper is twofold. The first is to present an all-encompassing systematic
    survey of the recent advances in spectrum inference/prediction algorithms from
    a time-frequency-spatial domain perspective. The second is to discuss the potential
    applications and prospects in order to emphasize the significance of inference/predicton
    techniques in the context of the CR technology and to provide guidelines for researchers
    focusing on making CR more intelligent and efficient. Notably, spectrum inference
    is also related to the subject of spectrum occupancy measurements [23], [24] and
    primary user activity modeling [22]. Briefly, primary user activity models use
    mathematical or theoretical expressions to mimic the underlying PU activities,
    while spectrum inference algorithms use machine learning or data mining methods
    to predict or infer the future or unknown PU activities based on the available
    historic data. References [22]–[24] are excellent survey and tutorial papers on
    spectrum occupancy measurements and/or theoretical modeling relying on statistical
    analysis, while our paper focuses on presenting various data mining algorithms
    conceived for spectrum inference/prediction. Indeed, the spectrum models in [22]–[24]
    are very useful for theoretical performance analysis or simulated data generation.
    However, they cannot be directly used for prediction. Moreover, the work of this
    survey paper is also related to the survey papers on various aspects of CRNs,
    such as spectrum sensing [25]–[30], spectrum decision [31]–[35], resource allocation
    [36]–[41], security and privacy [42]–[48], MAC protocols [49], [50], routing [51],
    network coding [52], various applications [53]–[56], to just mention a few. A
    list of the related survey papers is provided in Table I for further references.
    On one hand, the studies on spectrum inference can find their applications in
    these aspects, which will be discussed in detail in the following sections. On
    the other hand, spectrum inference to some extent is a parallel or complementary
    technique to those in Table I. This paper fills the gap between them by providing
    a comprehensive survey of spectrum inference in CRNs. TABLE I A List of Related
    Survey Articles C. Organization and Notation This paper is organized as illustrated
    in Fig. 1. We introduce the necessary preliminary knowledge on spectrum inference
    in Section II. Specific inference algorithms operating in the time-frequency-spatial
    domain are detailed in Section III, while Section IV proposes a macroscopic view
    of various inference methods. The current and potential future applications are
    introduced in Section V. Finally, a range of challenges and future trends are
    presented in Section VI along with our conclusions. The acronyms used in this
    article can be found in the Table VII for convenience. TABLE VII Acronyms Fig.
    1. The structure of this paper. Show All SECTION II. Preliminaries for Spectrum
    Inference in CRNs A. Sources of Spectrum Data Empirical real world spectrum measurements
    constitute the very important source of spectrum data and play a fundamental role
    in supporting the research and development of spectrum inference techniques. Numerous
    spectrum occupancy measurement campaigns have been conducted all over the world
    (see [23], [24], [59]–[87]). Excellent surveys and tutorials on the latest advances
    of worldwide spectrum occupancy measurements can be found in [23] and [24]. Briefly,
    here we highlight some common features of the spectrum measurement campaigns as
    follows. Firstly, the campaigns have covered various frequency ranges. For example,
    the probably earliest measurement campaigns conducted by the Institute of Telecommunication
    Science in the USA around 1995 [59] measured very broad frequency bands spanning
    from 108 MHz to 19.3 GHz. One the other hand, the very recent ones carried out
    in Beijing [86] and London [87] focused on TV bands (e.g., 470 MHz~790 MHz) to
    identify TV white spaces. Moreover, there are many other campaigns that measured
    specific licensed bands (like WiFi bands, TV bands, radar bands and cellular bands)
    relying on diverse lengths of measurement periods (from a few hours to several
    years) as well as different places (e.g., Denver, Dublin, Aachen, and Singapore,
    etc) and scenarios (including rural, suburban and urban areas, indoor and outdoor
    cases) [23], [24], [59]–[87]. Second, the campaigns have had various measurement
    setups. In terms of hardware devices, the spectrum measurement systems generally
    consist of the antenna, the filter, the amplifier and the spectrum analyser to
    collect the spectrum data. Most of the spectrum measurement campaigns specify
    several common setups. For example, both the sampling rate and the measurement
    period, as well as the frequency span and frequency points, the measurement location,
    antenna polarization and direction have to be chosen according to the particular
    applications considered. Moreover, since the various settings may lead to different
    levels of measurement complexity and accuracy, the tradeoffs among of these potentially
    conflicting factors have been carefully taken into consideration. Third, the campaigns
    have a tendency to bridge real world spectrum measurements and the public/private
    spectrum databases [247]–[250]. On one hand, the collection, storage and evaluation
    of massive amounts of spectrum measurements requires advanced databases. On the
    other hand, spectrum measurements ensures a data-driven approach, complementarily
    to the traditional propagation model-based approach [242], when aiming for improving
    the accuracy and the update speed of the spectrum availability provided by the
    geolocation spectrum databases [5], [88], [246]. Moreover, spectrum measurements
    are also coupled with the building of radio environment maps (REM) [254]–[256].
    B. Models of Spectrum Usage Exploiting the statistics of spectrum use or the deterministic
    status of PUs have been one of the critical issues for secondary use of the licensed
    spectrum. The research on the PU’s behavior gleans lessons from the spectrum measurement
    campaigns. A brief conclusion is that the obtained spectrum occupancy results,
    e.g., in terms of the duty cycle, from spectrum measurement campaigns run by different
    groups are not always the same at different measurement time, locations, frequency
    bands with various measurement hardware and softwares. However, the primary user
    occupancy models (e.g., DTMC and CTMC) discussed in the following are widely used
    by different measurement campaigns associated with various parameter setups for
    specific bands, locations, and time. Specifically, in CRNs, spectrum usage models
    of the primary system usually determine both the action and the performance of
    a secondary network and thus they play a significant role in spectrum inference,
    since the exploration and evaluation of inference algorithms as well as techniques
    is often based on them [90]. Spectrum usage models can be utilized to discover
    patterns of the PU’s activities by analyzing the spectrum data and by reconstructing
    the statistical properties of the spectrum usage in real radio communication systems.
    By taking advantage of these models, we can generate simulated data for validating
    the inference algorithms. In order to prepare a solid basis for our discussions
    in the next section, we will briefly present the most common approaches of modelling
    spectrum usage across the three orthogonal dimensions of time, frequency and space,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2, [19], [22], [89], [91]–[93]. Explicitly, in Fig. 2,
    there are several primary transmitters having their own primary coverage area,
    which are carefully coordinated for mitigating the interference arising from the
    others. A number of PUs and CRs are roaming either within or outside the coverage
    area of these primary transmitters. Furthermore, every primary transmitter has
    its spectrum for licensed or unlicensed use. Fig. 2. An illustrative scenario
    in the time-frequency-spatial dimension. Show All 1) Time Domain Model: In the
    time domain, the spectrum usage may simply be modeled by a Markov chain having
    two states, one representing that the channel is busy and the other one representing
    that it is idle. In terms of temporal continuity, these models can be classified
    either into the discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) model or into the continuous-time
    Markov chain (CTMC) model. a) DTMC model: Since the PU’s states can be described
    as being either busy or idle and most measured data are usually represented in
    the form of binary sequences, the spectrum usage patterns are reflected by bits
    of zero value indicating having no traffic and logical ones indicating that the
    spectrum is being used by the PU at a particular time instant [94], [95]. The
    state space of a primary radio channel obeying the DTMC is denoted by S={0,1}
    . The time index set is discrete, t= t k =k T s , where k is a non-negative integer
    representing the step index and T s is the time period between consecutive transitions
    or state changes. The most important parameter of the DTMC model is the transition
    probability p ij ( t m , t n )∈{0,1} , which represents the probability that channel
    state moves from state i in the m -th slot to state j in slot n . In this particular
    case, the transition matrix is given by: P=[ p 00 p 10 p 01 p 11 ]. (1) View Source
    The overall DTMC model describing the activity of a PU’s channel is illustrated
    in Fig. 3. We can use the above-mentioned concept of DC, denoted by Ψ , as a metric
    of describing the ratio of time during which the channel is declared busy as well
    as idle [89], [91]. Fig. 3. DTMC model. Show All In terms of stationarity, the
    DTMC models fall into two categories: stationary and non-stationary DTMC models.
    In the stationary DTMC model, the transition matrix can be formulated as, P=[
    1−Ψ 1−Ψ Ψ Ψ ], (2) View Source where Ψ is a constant parameter and it can be selected
    as Ψ= p 01 = p 11 , especially in the long term Ψ=P(s=1) . In this way, the DTMC
    model becomes capable of reproducing the mean DC of a real channel. However, the
    stationary DTMC may only be valid for a limited time period, if the system exhibits
    only an approximately stationary behavior during this period, where the reproduced
    average DC approximately matches the instantaneous DC at all times [89]. If the
    modeled system does not appear to exhibit strictly stationary characteristics,
    a non-stationary DTMC model should be considered. In this case, the transition
    matrix should be defined as, P(t)=[ 1−Ψ(t) 1−Ψ(t) Ψ(t) Ψ(t) ], (3) View Source
    where Ψ(t) is a variable, which is a function of the discrete time t . Based on
    different patterns of the channel’s load, DC models can be developed using both
    deterministic and stochastic modelling approaches [89]. On one hand, in many particular
    services, like GSM and TETRA, common human habits and social behaviors impose
    a significant impact on the load patterns, which deterministically shape the characteristics
    of Ψ(t) . On the other hand, the stochastic DC modelling approaches are presented
    to describe the random variable Ψ(t) as a function of numerous random factors
    contributing to the PU’s behavior in real scenarios. It was found that the empirical
    PDFs of Ψ(t) can be modelled by the Beta distribution [96] and the Kumaraswamy
    distribution [97]. Furthermore, extensive empirical measurement results have shown
    that the DTMCs associated with the deterministic and stochastic DC models mentioned
    above are capable of reproducing the average DC value and the statistical properties
    of the PU’s idle or busy duration in real-world channels. The DTMCs have also
    been widely used in the literature to analyze the system throughput, the average
    packet delay and the end-to-end packet delay (see [98], [99]). b) CTMC model:
    In contrast to the DTMC model, the CTMC model pays closer attention to modeling
    the length of a state’s holding time. Note that the traditional exponential distribution
    used for characterizing the state holding time in CTMC is not necessarily accurate
    enough, according to a range of realistic measurements and analysis conducted
    across the globe [91], [100]–[106]. In view of this, many researchers considered
    the Continuous-Time Semi-Markov Chain (CTSMC) models, where the sojourn time may
    obey arbitrary distributions. In [104], [105], [107], and [108], the idle duration
    was assumed to obey either a generalized Pareto distribution [108], or a mixture
    of uniform distribution and the generalized Pareto distribution, or alternatively,
    obey a hyper-Erlang distribution [104], [105] and so on. López-Benítez [89] employ
    goodness-of-fit metrics to evaluate several common distributions and to demonstrate
    that in real-world systems CTSMC models have a better performance in terms of
    reproducing the statistical properties of the busy and idle durations. Additionally,
    the correlation between the busy and idle durations, which the CTSMC fails to
    reproduce has been analyzed in [91] and [109]. 2) Frequency Domain Model: In this
    paper, the frequency-domain model can also be termed as the time-frequency model,
    since we do analyze the properties of spectrum data over the allocated frequency
    band based on the channel’s DC which is a temporal parameter. Although the channels
    are considered to be mutually independent within a spectrum band [90], [110],
    this may not be the case for adjacent frequency-domain channels [92]. Hence, when
    modeling the spectrum usage in the frequency domain, the dependency among neighboring
    channels should be taken into consideration. With respect to the statistical correlation
    across the frequency band, two aspects can be investigated through the analysis
    of real-world spectrum data. The first one is the DC distribution within an allocated
    band, while the second is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the DC
    distribution, which are closely matched by the Beta distribution, by the Kumaraswamy
    distribution and so on [89]. Another aspect to consider is the DC clustering across
    the frequency bands. In [111], the similar DC values of the adjacent channels
    were classified into the same group, and the distribution of the size of the cluster
    group was described by an appropriately shifted version of the geometric distribution
    [96]. 3) Spatial Domain Model: In recent years, numerous studies considered the
    relationships among the channel states observed by CRs in different scenarios
    [112]–[114]. Making use of the location information beneficially supports the
    CR’s initial awareness of the environment and its ability of taking actions efficiently
    [115], [116]. Based on the above-mentioned DC models in the time- and frequency-
    domains, the spatial DC models and the modelling of simultaneous observations
    are briefly introduced below. Reference [89] discussed the spatial DC models under
    different conditions, namely when concerning either time-varying or constant power
    and continuous or discontinuous transmitters. The DC values, Ψ , are calculated
    after the process of energy detection. López-Benítez [89] also discussed the conditional
    and the joint probabilities of the state observed at an arbitrary location and
    the simultaneously observed state at the reference location. Given these two probabilities,
    we will be able to model the spectrum usage at another location based on the model
    at the reference location. Therefore, the spatial modelling procedure attaches
    importance to the correlation of the spectrum usage at various locations for supporting
    spectrum inference/prediction. However, it should be noted that generally spectrum
    measurement campaigns are conducted by measuring the received signals and then
    estimating the status of the PUs using various spectrum sensing techniques, such
    as energy detection [117], matched filtering, and waveform based sensing. Due
    to the inevitable noise, incomplete observations, and the ambiguity of parameters
    like the energy decision threshold and the undiscovered spectrum features, such
    formulations are unable to accurately infer the PUs’ true status and to capture
    the real characteristics of the PU’s activity [117]–[119]. In this sense, all
    the models, including those introduced above may be imperfect, which necessitates
    further research. C. Spectrum Inference in Various CRNs Depending on the type
    of available side information and on the regulatory constraints, there are three
    main CRNs paradigms: underlay, overlay, and interweave [120]. Briefly, the underlay
    CRN allows CRs to operate if the interference they cause is below a given threshold.
    In overlay CRNs, the CRs overhear the transmissions of the PUs, and then use this
    information along with sophisticated signal processing techniques to improve the
    performance of PUs, while also obtaining some additional bandwidth for the CRs’
    own transmission. In interweave CRNs, the CRs sense the absence of a PU signal
    in the time, frequency, and/or spatial domains, and opportunistically communicate
    during the PUs’ absence. Generally, underlay, overlay, and interweave can be used
    in different bands (e.g., TV white space, radar bands and cellular bands) according
    to the specific regulations in a separate or hybrid manner [121], [122]. Most
    of the existing studies on spectrum inference focus their attention on interweave
    CRNs, i.e., on predicting the spectrum occupancy state in terms of being idle
    (i.e., the absence of a PU signal) or occupied (i.e., the presence of a PU signal),
    by licensed users. There are relatively few studies on spectrum inference in other
    types of CRNs such as underlay, overlay and hybrid CRNs. It is an interesting
    and fruitful research direction to extend the research from interweave CRNs to
    other types of CRNs. Technically, a key difference is that the inference of binary
    spectrum state (i.e., idle or busy) in interweave CRNs should be extended to the
    inference of multi-level or even continuous spectrum state values in underlay
    and overlay CRNs, relying on the knowledge of the channel state information between
    PU transmitters and PU receivers. SECTION III. Spectrum Inference Algorithms in
    CRNs Numerous prediction algorithms have been proposed for forecasting the channel
    state, the spectrum occupancy, the potential interference imposed, the PU’s coverage
    area and so on. In this section, the common spectrum inference/prediction algorithms
    found in the literature will be surveyed in the time, frequency and spatial domains
    by adopting a multi-dimensional approach. The taxonomy of these spectrum inference
    algorithms is illustrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Taxonomy of spectrum inference algorithms
    in the literature (See Table VII for the acronyms). Show All A. Temporal Spectrum
    Inference Algorithms The three main branches of Fig. 4 will be surveyed in Sections
    III-A–III-C respectively, commencing with the temporal techniques. In the time
    domain, spectrum prediction infers the status of spectrum according to the historical
    information on the evolution of the spectral occupancy [128]. The information
    gleaned is represented by a series of numbers extracted from the original data,
    with the aid of linear prediction, Markov modelling, neural networks, pattern
    mining, etc. After acquiring the regular patterns of the PU, we can sense the
    spectrum in less time than usual, conserve precious energy and make collisions
    among PUs and CRs more infrequent. 1) Linear Prediction (LP): Let us commence
    with LP algorithms seen at the top of the temporal branch. Linear prediction is
    an important branch of mathematical statistics, where future values are predicted
    as a linear function of previous samples. The LP based approach is widely used
    in digital signal processing for predicting the signal power as a benefit because
    of its remarkable simplicity, and it has also been invoked for implementing temporal-domain
    spectrum prediction [15], [93], [128]–[130]. Other applications include speech-
    and audio-compression [131] as well as video compression [132].The most commonly
    used linear prediction models include the autoregressive (AR) model, the moving
    average (MA) model, the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model and the autoregressive
    integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. a) AR model: With reference to the left
    column of the middle branch in Fig. 4, the AR model of order m , AR(m) , can be
    formulated as [133], X(t)= ∑ i=1 m α j X(t−i)+e(t). (4) View Source In the spectrum
    prediction context, X(t−i) represents the past observation before the t -th slot,
    while X(t) and e(t) represent the observation and error terms of the t -th slot.
    The expression ∑ m i=1 α j X(t−i) aims for weighting the historical observations,
    where m is the length of the prediction memory window and α j is the weighting
    parameter of the AR model. Reference [15] used a second-order autoregressive model,
    i.e., AR(2), for performing spectrum prediction in the time domain, where the
    coefficient α j has been obtained as the solution of the Yule-Walker equations.
    Then a Kalman filter has been used for predicting the state of a spectrum hole.
    In [130], the channel occupancy status is converted into a binary form and the
    AR model is used for spectrum occupancy characterization as well as for prediction.
    Finally, artificial signals complying with the Global System of Mobile (GSM) communication
    standard were generated for testing the performance of prediction. Furthermore,
    AR models have also been applied for predicting both the channel state transitions
    in fading channels [134], [135] and the channel occupancy [93]. b) MA model: The
    MA model is similar to the autoregressive model, except that the predicted value
    for the observation in the t -th slot depends on the error values observed in
    the past [136], rather than on the current values. The MA model of order n , namely
    MA(n) , can be formulated as [133], X(t)= ∑ i=0 n β i e(t−i), (5) View Source
    where, the notations X(t) and e(t) are the same as in the AR model, while β j
    is the parameter of the MA model and β 0 =1 . In [137], when analysing the Chinese
    TV-band channels spanning from 603.25 MHz to 843.25 MHz, the results indicate
    that the MA model is more suitable for predicting the strength of television signals
    than the ‘experience based’ method. Additionally, in [129], a non-linear exponential
    moving average (EMA) model is proposed, whose weighting factor decreases exponentially
    for each older data point, in order to put more emphasis on the recent observations,
    while giving some cognizance to former observations. c) ARMA model: Still referring
    to the left column of the middle branch in Fig. 4, the MA model is combined with
    the AR model to form an autoregressive moving average model ARMA(m,n) [16] as
    follows: X(t)+ ∑ i=1 m α j X(t−i)= ∑ i=0 n β i e(t−i), (6) View Source where the
    notations of X(t) and e(t) are the same as in the AR and MA models. Furthermore,
    α j and β j are the parameters of the ARMA model, β 0 =1 . In [138], the ARMA
    model shows a better prediction performance in channels which have cyclic behaviors
    compared to the performance in forecasting the Bluetooth and WiFi channels that
    have more random behaviors. d) ARIMA modeling: The most important feature of the
    more flexible ARIMA model is that it is capable of handling non-stationary time
    series as well as rapidly decaying autocorrelation functions [139], etc. The general
    ARIMA(m,n,d) model is formulated as [136], W(t)= ∑ i=1 m α j W(t−i)+ ∑ i=0 n β
    i e(t−i), (7) View Source where we have W(t)=X(t)−X(t−d) , while α j and β i are
    the parameters of the ARMA model of order m , e(t) represents random errors, and
    d is the degree of non-stationary homogeneity. The overall process of using these
    models is illustrated in Fig. 5 adopted from [128]. The samples X X of the time
    series constitute the input of this procedure. As seen in Fig. 5, we first judge
    the degree of stationarity for the input data, and if the samples are not deemed
    to be stationary, they will have to be processed by different techniques. Following
    this step, we calculate both the covariance function as well as the partial autocorrelation
    function, and then classify X X into a specific model. Finally, we compute m and
    n . As seen in Fig. 5, we also have to estimate the parameters α j and β i . Finally,
    we use the selected model to forecast the prospective values. Fig. 5. Linear prediction
    (LP) structure. Show All 2) Markov Model (MM) Based Methods: Let us now consider
    the second column of the middle branch in Fig. 4. The Markov chain based modelling
    of sub-band PUs was validated by analyzing real-world measurements in the paging
    spectrum band in [140]. The Markov model has an appealingly simple structure characterized
    by its state-transition matrix. In this subsection, we will discuss a pair of
    temporal prediction methods, namely the Hidden Markov models (HMM) and the partially
    observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), also featuring in Fig. 4. a) HMM:
    According to [141], an HMM is usually formulated as λ=( π π, A A, B B) , where
    π π represents the initial state probability vector, defined as: π π=[ π π i ]=P(
    q t = s i ),1≤i≤N, (8) View Source where S={ s 1 , s 2 ,, s N } denotes N different
    states in a Markov chain and q t ∈ S S represents the state at time instant t
    , where π i satisfies the conditions 0≤ π i ≤1 , ∑ N i=1 π i =1 . Furthermore,
    A A=[ a ij ] is the state transition matrix, which defines the probability of
    traversing from one state to another, formulated as: a ij =P( q t = s j | q t−1
    = s i ),1≤i,j≤N. (9) View Source Furthermore, B B=[ b ik ] is the observation
    probability matrix that offers the option of producing different observed values,
    while being in a particular state, which is encapsulated in: b jk =P( o t = v
    k | q t = s j ),1≤j≤N,1≤k≤M, (10) View Source where V V={ v 1 , v 2 ,…, v M }
    represents the space containing M observed symbols and o t is the value observed
    at time instant t , o t ∈ V V . Note that we have 0≤ a ij , b jk ≤1 , ∑ N j=1
    a ij =1 and ∑ M k=1 a jk =1 . Traditionally, a standard HMM predictor is based
    on the discrete-time model introduced in Section II, where the time is slotted
    and the state space is binary, with the spectrum slot being either in state s
    i =1 or s i =0 . The set O O={ o 1 , o 2 ,…, o T } may be used for representing
    the past observation sequence in T consecutive slots. In order to predict the
    state in the (T+1) -st slot, a HMM predictor of the standard form may be designed
    by obeying the following four steps [20], [111], which are illustrated in Fig.
    6 and detailed as follows: Step 1 (Initialization):Set the initial parameters
    of the HMM λ 0 =( π π 0 , A A 0 , B B 0 ) . Step 2 (Observation):The CR senses
    the sub-band spectrum and collects the observed data O O={ o 1 , o 2 ,…, o T }
    . Step 3 (Training):Given the observed sequence, the parameters of the HMM will
    be adapted by invoking an appropriate training approach, such as the Monte-Carlo
    method, and the Baum-Welch algorithm [141], for maximizing the likelihood associated
    with the model and defined as P( O O|λ) . Step 4 (Prediction):The state observed
    at slot (T+1) , o T+1 , can be predicted by the following rule: o T+1 ={ 1, 0,  if
    P( O O,1|λ)≥P( O O,0|λ),  if P( O O,1|λ)<P( O O,0|λ). (11) View Source Fig. 6.
    HMM prediction process. Show All This standard HMM approach has been investigated
    in [14], [20], [95], [111], [142], [143], and [140] for the sake of predicting
    the future states and the idle/busy durations of the channel. In [95], the HMM
    is used for predicting the spectrum usage patterns, which are assumed to be deterministic
    Poisson distributed. Given a sequence of predicted states, the CR will dynamically
    choose these surmised frequencies for its use, even though the spectrum occupancy
    should generally be modeled by stochastic distributions, as previously mentioned
    in Section II. This algorithm was also advocated in [142], matching its output
    to the data collected from the 450–470 MHz band in Australia, but the specific
    implementation of the algorithm was not detailed in [142]. Meanwhile, Chen et
    al. [14] considered a realistic propagation environment that took into account
    the time delay incurred both by the hardware and software. It should be mentioned
    that in [14] the parameters of the HMM used are obtained statistically, without
    employing any training for the model. Instead, the authors verify the proposed
    method using measured WiFi data instead of artificial data. Both the model complexity
    and the computational complexity have been studied in order to provide a qualitative
    characterization of the HMM performance, which were complemented by a range of
    implementation issues arising during the design [118]. As the number of states
    N increases, the number of model parameters to be estimated also increases. The
    computational complexity of the HMM based predictor is directly related both to
    the number of states N and to the size of the observation sequence T . Moreover,
    MM or HMM-based methods work well under the assumption of having memoryless or
    Markovian spectrum state evolution, where the future state depends only on the
    relevant information about the current, not on information from distant the past.
    The Markovian property has been validated by analyzing real-world measurements
    in the paging spectrum band in [140], which motivates the research of HMM-based
    spectrum inference methods. Most of the related studies have focused on first-order
    and stationary HMM. However, in practical systems, the spectrum state of the future
    may depend on a relatively long historical information (see the tide effects in
    the GSM bands [209]). The state distribution of PUs may also dynamically change.
    In order to improve the performance of the standard HMM, in recent years researchers
    have developed several sophisticated HMMs by carefully considering the stationarity
    and the high-order Markovian nature of the spectral slot occupancy pattern. Some
    representative advances are summarized below as follows: Non-stationary Hidden
    Markov model (NS-HMM): Here we are still considering the Markov-modeling belonging
    to the second branch of the temporal algorithms seen in Fig. 4. As mentioned above,
    the PU’s spectral slot occupancy pattern is assumed to be deterministically distributed,
    when the standard HMM model is used. However, in reality the PU’s behaviors obey
    time-varying non-stationary DTMC [89]. Under these circumstance, conventional
    HMMs may fail to adequately characterize the PU’s dwelling time distributions
    [17]. For this reason, the NS-HMM was employed for modeling the channel’s status
    in [17] in order to characterize the idle/busy duration of the PU’s channel. The
    NS-HMM can be described as λ NS =[ π π, A A(t), B B] , which replaces the static
    transition probabilities of the conventional HMMs with dynamic ones. In [17],
    the parameters of the NS-HMM are inferred through Bayesian inference with the
    aid of Gibbs sampling, and the impact of different model parameters on the model’s
    accuracy has been investigated. It was found that as expected the channel quality
    experienced by the CR is an increasing function of the sensing accuracy and of
    the estimated idle duration. In [118], the so-called expectation maximization
    based algorithm was developed for calculating the parameters of a NS-HMM. Numerical
    experiments relying on real spectrum measurement data have been carried out for
    demonstrating that the NS-HMM outperforms the traditional HMM-based approaches.
    Hidden Bivariate Markov Model (HBMM): As an extension of the standard HMM, HBMMs
    have been proposed for more accurately characterizing the transmission pattern
    of a PU [144]. In contrast to the standard univariate HMM, the HBMM incorporates
    a number of additional variables by introducing a state duration distribution
    for modeling the channel usage in CR, rather than using the geometric duration
    distribution of a standard HMM. In [144], the HBMM was described in form of the
    function λ B =( π π, G G, μ μ, R R) , where π π is the initial state probability
    vector reminiscent of that in the standard HMMs, G G is the state transition matrix,
    while μ μ and R R represent the vector of observed receive signal strength average
    and variance. Repeatedly using the definitions of the standard HMM parameters,
    let Z Z= O O× S S=[ Z t ]=( o t , q t ) denote the specific value returned by
    the bivariate Markov chain. The state transition matrix can be defined as: G G=[
    g ab (ij)]=[P( Z t+1 =(b,j)| Z t =(a,i))]. (12) View Source The parameter λ B
    may be estimated by extending the Baum algorithm [145], which is simpler than
    an explicit duration estimating algorithm. When determining the model parameters,
    Thao et al. [144] apply forward-backward recursions for predicting the spectral
    slot state at a future time instant. The performance of the HBMM in spectrum sensing
    and prediction was characterized by numerical results in [144], demonstrating
    that the HBMM is capable of more accurate state predictions than a standard HMM.
    Higher-order HMM: Still referring to Fig. 4, we note that although the first-order
    standard HMM has been broadly adopted for predicting the channel’s state, this
    model does not make full use of the historical information, since a state only
    depends on the immediate preceding state. To alleviate this problem, a higher-order
    HMM was also proposed for predicting the next channel state [146]. A higher-order
    HMM can be formulated as λ HO =( π π, A A HO , B B) . In contrast to the standard
    HMMs, A A HO =[ a HO ij ] is the state transition matrix representing the transition
    from the states in the previous D slots to the current state, which can be defined
    as [146]: A A HO = = [ a HO ij ] P( q t+1 = s i D+1 | q t = s i D ,…, q t−D+1
    = s i 1 ), i 1 , i 2 ,…, i D , i D+1 =1,…,N. View Source When considering the
    computational complexity versus model accuracy trade-offs, there are several variants
    of the higher-order HMMs [146]–[149]. By relying on real-world WiFi signals recorded,
    it was shown that the performance of the proposed approach is significantly better
    than that of the nearest neighbor prediction relying on first-order HMMs, especially
    when the order of the HMM increases [146]. b) POMDP: The last member of the MM-based
    temporal methods seen in Fig. 4 is constituted by the POMDP family, which is a
    generalization of a Markov decision process that tolerates uncertainty about the
    state of a Markov process and allows the acquisition of environmental information
    [150]. Based on DTMC model of Section II [89], a POMDP applied in CRNs is defined
    by the six-tuple ( S S, A A, T T, R R, Z Z, O O) [151]–[154], where S S is the
    channel state space {0(idle),1(busy)} ; A A is a discrete and finite set denoting
    the CR actions, i.e., as { a 1 (access), a 2 (no access)} ; T T :  S S× A A→ Π
    Π( S S) is the state-transition function. If s is the current channel state and
    action a is chosen by the decision maker, the process will move to a new state
    s with the probability of T T( s ′ |s,a) . R R :  S S× A A→R is the reward function
    that defines the expected immediate reward R R(s,a) received, when the process
    is in state s and action a is taken; Z Z is a finite set of observations the CR
    infers from the radio environment; O O :  S S× A A→ Π Π( Z Z) is the observation
    function and for each action and resultant state, O( s ′ |a,o) denotes the probability
    of observing o and moving to state s ′ after taking action a ; The POMDP based
    CR engine [155] is depicted in the Fig. 7, with the state predictor being the
    core component in the process [151], [153]. In this procedure, b is the ‘belief
    state’, which describes the probability that the channel’s state is idle, summarizing
    all the past information necessary for formulating the allocation decision π [154].
    The channel state predictor computes the probability b based on a combination
    of the most recent value, on the current observation and on the previous action.
    More specifically, Zhao et al. [153] proposed an approach for channel state prediction
    based on POMDP by finding the optimal policy that maximizes some aspect of the
    reward. In this approach, the probability b ′ ( s ′ ) that the future state s
    ′ is idle can be calculated by the Bayesian formula as follows b ′ ( s ′ )=P(
    s ′ |a,b,o)= ∑ S O( o t+1 | s ′ ,a)T( s ′ |s,a)b(s) P( o t+1 |b,a) . (13) View
    Source Fig. 7. POMDP based prediction. Show All The numerical results provided
    in [152] and [156] have shown that the performance of the spectrum access approach
    using the POMDP based CR improves over time upon gleaning increasingly more accurate
    information concerning the channel’s state inferred from the accumulated observations.
    As a benefit, the collisions of CRs with PUs were substantially reduced. However,
    a problem concerning the POMDP based approach is its potentially excessive complexity,
    especially when the number of channels is high. To tackle this problem, more research
    is required for developing efficient algorithms for solving POMDP problems. 3)
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Based Methods: Let us now move on to the third
    family of the temporal methods portrayed in Fig. 4. As a key technique in machine
    learning, the ANNs have been extensively applied to communications, signal processing,
    intelligent control, etc. They represent a class of flexible nonlinear models
    based on parallel computation, which consist of both input and output layers as
    well as intermediate layers composed of artificial neurons [157]. In CRNs, an
    ANN allows for learning the PU’s behavioral patterns by invoking a training set
    of spectrum data, learn these patterns, and then capitalize on it for classifying
    new patterns and for making forecasts. Because of its high prediction accuracy
    and capability of learning, ANNs constitute a popular approach of predicting the
    spectrum state’s evolution. Generally, depending on their architecture, we can
    categorize ANNs into two classes: feedforward and feedback neural networks [158].
    The architecture of ANNs invoked for predicting channel states is depicted in
    Fig. 8. Fig. 8. Artificial neural network (ANN) based prediction. Show All a)
    Feedforward neural networks (FFNNs): Feedforward neural networks enter the spectrum
    data strictly into the input layer and give the states predicted by the output
    layer without any feedback. Referring to the rich literature concerning FFNN based
    algorithms invoked for spectrum prediction [20], [157], [159]–[168], we will first
    provide a brief overview of typical multilayer feedforward neural networks (MFNNs),
    also known as the multilayer perceptron (MLP). Then we will describe the overall
    spectrum prediction procedure of neural networks. Based on the PU’s activity modeled
    by DTMC, where the input and output data are represented by binary sequences,
    MFNNs rely on neurons as their basic computing unit for calculating a weighted
    sum of the inputs and perform a nonlinear transformation of the sum [20], [160],
    [168], which can be expressed as follows [20], [168]: y l j = a l j = f( a l j
    ), ∑ i y l−1 i w l ji , (14) (15) View Source where y l j is the output of a neuron
    j in the l th layer; w l ji represents the adaptive weights connecting the neuron
    j in the l th layer and neuron i in the (l−1 ) st layer; a l j is the weighted
    sum of the inputs yielding the outputs of the former layer, and f( a l j ) is
    the activation function, often represented by the tangent sigmoid function [160]:
    y l j = 2 1+ e −2 a l j −1. (16) View Source Before performing spectrum prediction,
    there should be a training process for MFNNs. First, the observed spectrum data
    vectors X X(t−τ+1,t)={ x t , x t−1 ,…, x t−τ+2 , x t−τ+1 } are imported into the
    input layer and the estimated output data y o t+1 is calculated using the activation
    function. Then, the difference between the desired value x t+1 and its estimation
    y o t+1 is denoted as the error e t , which can be expressed as follows [20],
    [160] : e t = x t+1 − y o t+1 . (17) View Source Finally, in order to minimize
    the prediction error e t , the adaptive weight w l ji will be updated by repeatedly
    using the back propagation algorithm [169] until the prediction error reaches
    its minimum. In [160], the prediction error is measured by the mean squared error
    (MSE), denoted as E(w) , which can be computed as follows [160]: E(w)= 1 2 ∑ t
    e 2 t = 1 2 ∑ t ( x t+1 − y o t+1 ) 2 . (18) View Source Once the training process
    is completed, the future spectrum state can be predicted by capitalizing on the
    observations with the aid of the MFNNs. In [20], the predicted value y o t+1 is
    decided by invoking a threshold at the output layer, which can be expressed as
    follows: y o t+1 ={ 0, 1,  if  y o t+1 ≥0,  if  y o t+1 ≤1. (19) View Source It
    is noteworthy that the learning speed of the traditional FFNNs, like MFNNs, is
    generally slower than desired, which would naturally evolve the attainable prediction
    efficiency. This problem was solved by the extreme learning machine (ELM) of [177].
    Furthermore, Miche et al. [159] optimized the original ELM, while in [158] the
    optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) was used for spectrum prediction.
    OP-ELM based spectrum prediction also relies on the structure of single hidden
    layer neural networks (SLFNs), just like the original ELM, where the input weights
    are randomly assigned, but the output weights are calculated using a different
    procedure. According to the experiments conducted in [158] and [159], the OP-ELM
    algorithm is more robust and flexible than the original ELM, showing a higher
    learning speed and a higher accuracy compared to other FFNNs. b) Feedback neural
    networks (FBNNs): The only difference between FBNNs and FFNNs is the presence
    or absence of feedback links that span from the outputs of neurons to the inputs
    of neurons in the previous layer [178], [179], as depicted in Fig. 8. The FBNN
    requires the data to be passed both forward as well as backward, hence imposing
    a high complexity and often making the FBNNs ‘confused’ or unstable. In this sense,
    the forecasting performance of FBNNs may become less attractive than that of FFNNs
    [180]. FBNNs gleam information from the sequence or time dependence of the inputs
    and the inputs themselves, which means that the features detected in previous
    patterns form a part of each new pattern. Therefore, when we want to take the
    previous spectrum observations into consideration in order to sense or predict
    the spectrum, the FFNNs discussed above are less pragmatic for us. In [178], Elman
    recurrent neural networks (ERNN) is used for radio frequency (RF) multivariate
    time series modelling in order to predict the spectral evolution. This feedback
    method leads to more intelligent CR decisions for exploiting the expected spectrum
    opportunities, thereby leading to optimized spectrum usage and interference avoidance
    [178]. Although ERNN is powerful in predicting the time domain sequences, it has
    slow convergence and does not excel in terms of determining the network structure
    [181]. The Echo State Network (ESN) concept is proposed as a new technique of
    overcoming these problems in [182]. Taking this as a basis, Yang et al. [183]
    further proposed a method based on an improved form of ESN for spectrum prediction.
    The proposed ESN structure is also visualized in [183]. In contrast to the ERNN,
    the intermediate hidden layers are replaced by a cycle reservoir associated with
    fixed feedback connections and randomly connected neurons [183]. The parameters
    of the improved ESN are calculated using particle swarm optimization (PSO). It
    should be noted that the PSO is known to outperform the traditional back propagation
    algorithms in training ANNs, as a benefit of their faster convergence and lower
    complexity [165], [184]. Experiments have been conducted in [183] to demonstrate
    that the performance of the optimal ESN is better than that of the ERNN in predicting
    both the specific state and the state duration of the primary spectrum, since
    it reduces the training time required for obtaining a higher prediction accuracy.
    4) Pattern Mining (PM) Based Methods: PM is a classic data mining technique conceived
    for discovering underlying patterns in large amounts of data. In CRNs, the patterns
    usually reflect the rules hidden in the spectrum occupancy of a channel. The motivation
    of finding the rules arises from the desire to analyze historical spectrum data
    for predicting the future channel states, so as to improve the attainable spectral
    efficiency and hence to reduce the collision rate. In previous research, the spectrum
    usage prediction has relied on frequent pattern mining (FPM) [119] and partial
    periodic pattern mining (PPPM) [16]. Both methods are based on a binary channel
    state model. FPM: In the context of CRNs, the channel state values observed are
    delivered in a sequence and serve as the spectrum occupancy history database.
    The mission of FPM is to find the specific sequences that appear in the data set
    with a frequency above a threshold, which are referred to as a frequent sequential
    patterns [185]. Thus, it becomes possible to predict the next state or next sequence.
    Although the FPM of [119] is two-dimensional, its ability to predict the future
    spectral states is only known in the time domain. PPPM: In contrast to FPM, the
    partial periodic patterns observe the PU’s features during certain time periods
    instead of the entire time span [186]. Since the propagation environment is stochastic
    and the PU’s behaviors may not show an obvious regularity. The patterns only become
    relevant for certain time periods of the day [16]. The procedure of PPPM based
    prediction can be described as follows [16]: Step 1:Process the binary channel
    state values and generate candidate patterns; Step 2:Count the support of each
    candidate pattern; Step 3:Eliminate the redundant candidate patterns; Step 4:Generate
    the prediction rules and calculate the probability of the future channel states.
    Additionally, the algorithm based on PPPM was also used for predicting the channel
    state duration in [16] so as to reduce the collision probability owing to the
    PU’s short absence. 5) Other Algorithms: Other relevant temporal methods found
    in the literature include Bayesian inference (BIF), learning automata (LA) and
    support vector machines (SVM). BIF is known as a classic method of solving the
    state prediction problem in CRNs as a critical part of the Markov systems, like
    the aforementioned NS-HMM and POMDP. It provides a general unifying framework
    for sequential state estimation. The procedure of BIF based prediction continuously
    updates the a posteriori distribution in a recurrent manner, based on the influx
    of spectrum data. Assuming that the evolution of the state is Markovian, BIF can
    make predictions based both on the observations and on the a posteriori distribution.
    BIF-based prediction is proposed in [17] and [187] for estimating the distribution
    of idle durations in the PU’s traffic. The algorithm proposed in [17] combines
    BIF with NS-HMM to predict the channel quality, which is capable of improving
    the efficiency of dynamic spectrum access. Compared to the traditional maximum
    likelihood technique, the BIF technique is capable of performing better, when
    processing a limited number of samples, and the channel availability may be reliably
    predicted after estimating the prevalent spectrum usage patterns [188]. In [157],
    a LA technique is utilized for predicting the spectrum opportunities in CRNs.
    The LA technique first generates the PU’s activity model according to the characteristics
    of the PU’s behavior. Then, the training and testing stage updates the parameters
    of the models, and finally the performance of the model is assessed in order to
    correct the prediction of the system’s behavior. In comparison to the MFNNs, the
    LA has shown a high performance, despite its simple structure [157]. The SVM technique
    has been widely used to make time series predictions in many scientific fields,
    such as financial marketing, power supply and medical sciences [189] as well as
    for spectrum prediction in CRNs. The application of SVM to solve regression problems
    is termed as support vector regression (SVR). In [190], SVR is used for predicting
    the probability density of the idle/busy CR state duration. In [191], SVR is applied
    for processing the spectrum occupancy data. B. Spectrum Inference in Frequency
    Domain Section III-A has reviewed some of the popular techniques conceived for
    predicting the future spectrum occupancy in the time domain. Further studies are
    well dedicated to inferring the states of other channels in the light of already
    acquired sensing or predicted results [93], [119], [130], [192], [193]. The spectral
    occupancy correlation between adjacent channels has been evaluated by experiments
    in [194]–[196]. This correlation serves as the most important information representing
    the relationship of different channels within the same services. In other words,
    the more correlated two channels are, the more accurate predictions will be made.
    Yin et al. [192] exploited the spectral correlations for inferring the availabilities
    of other channels in order to improve the throughput. The new concept of channel
    availability vector was introduced for characterizing the spectral occupancy information.
    In [193], predicting the states of unsensed channels is formulated as a matrix
    completion problem. The classic technique of belief propagation (BP) [197] is
    applied to fill the matrix with predicted states. It is found that the BP scheme
    is more suitable for specific matrix types, where the adjacent elements are highly
    correlated [29]. In [198], Bayesian networks are proposed for jointly modeling
    the spectral-domain and spatial-domain correlations, where the authors introduced
    statistical inference for evaluating the spectrum occupancy. The correlation across
    the frequency dimension was exploited to enhance the estimation of spectrum occupancy
    in wideband spectrum sensing [195], [196]. Yin et al. [119] has proposed a frequency
    pattern matching algorithm operating in two-dimensions (FPM-2D) for spectrum inference,
    which searches through all relevant 2D patterns [119]. Once these patterns have
    been obtained, we can compute the probabilities of future channel states and estimate
    the channel’s availability. Their algorithm outperforms the first-order HMM-based
    predictor in terms of its prediction accuracy. Similarly, frequency domain correlation
    techniques were also introduced in [93] by modeling the neighboring channels in
    pairs. Simultaneously considering multiple frequency bands, the classic AR models
    which do not need a priori knowledge on the communication environment were also
    employed to reduce the complexity [93]. This algorithm performs well for deterministic
    usage patterns. The investigations of [93], [119], [192], and [196] clearly quantify
    the performance improvements achieved by spectral correlation based inference.
    C. Spectrum Inference in the Geographic Spatial Domain From a spatial-domain perspective,
    there are two directions for spectrum inference: One of them aims to infer the
    spectrum state information, while taking both the positions and movements of CRs
    into consideration; The other one infers geographical information, including the
    primary system’s coverage contours, service areas and so on. 1) The First Direction:
    In the first direction, both the BP technique and the Bayesian networks discussed
    in the frequency domain are also capable of taking the spatial correlations into
    account for inferring the channel states from those of other locations. In the
    static spectrum environment, the interference powers experienced at different
    CR nodes are inferred by exploiting the spatial variation of interference. Specifically,
    both semi-supervised dictionary learning [200] and compressive sensing are employed
    for the interpolation of unobserved interference in the spatial domain, incorporating
    the CR network topology. Since the movement of CRs directly affects the spectrum
    availability in a specific geographic area, spectrum prediction in the time-space
    domain constitutes and important research area. The traditional static model is
    extended to a dynamic mobility model in [201]. The CRs’ mobility and the PUs’
    activity can be jointly considered to infer both the spectrum occupancy and the
    interference constraints for a certain period under different relative positions
    between the PUs and CRs. Based on this scheme, both a greedy and a fair prediction
    algorithms were proposed in [201] to make the spectrum exploitation more effective,
    hence maintaining fairness in spectrum allocation. A SVM is used for inferring
    the spectrum occupancy evolution considering both the time-domain and geographic
    distribution characteristics [202]. A joint feature-vector extraction method is
    designed by analyzing both the CRs’ movement and the PUs’ behavior. Again, a SVM
    based inference mechanism is introduced for expediting the convergence speed,
    which is shown to have a better inference performance than the algorithms solely
    depending on the speed and location information, as in [202]. It was found that
    carefully choosing the parameters is capable of mitigating the performance loss
    caused by high-speed CRs having erratic movements. In [203], the SVM was invoked
    both for predicting the handoff point and the idle channels with a high precision.
    In addition to the spectrum availability, the link availability between the CRs
    was also inferred by Hou et al. [204]. By invoking this novel approach, a more
    reliable path can be found for dynamic routing in CRNs. 2) The Second Direction:
    For the TV services, the primary receivers must be protected from harmful interference
    [18]. This approach makes full use of the effective antenna height, effective
    isotropic radiated power and terrain information to map the primary users’ coverage
    contour through Fresnel diffraction theory. The Google Earth software plays an
    indispensable role in TV white space prediction. Based on the primary users’ coverage
    contour inference, the potential interference and the collisions imposed by the
    CRs may be significantly reduced. In [205], a location predictor is proposed,
    where the historical changes of the PU’s geographic locations are represented
    by a directed graph having weighted edges. Once a spectrum occupancy prediction
    is requested, all the edges originating from the starting point are listed and
    then the destination is predicted according to the calculated maximum weights.
    D. Spectrum Inference in Joint Multiple Domains In addition to spectrum inference
    techniques in single domain (i.e., time, frequency and space) mentioned above,
    there are also recent studies on joint multiple-domain spectrum inference. Specifically,
    the work in [119] is one of the first studies to develop joint time-frequency
    spectrum prediction algorithm, where two-dimensional frequent pattern mining is
    proposed to analyze binary historical spectrum occupancy data. Ding et al. [210]
    develop an algorithm for spectral-temporal two-dimensional spectrum prediction
    with incomplete historical data by exploiting the approximate low-rank property
    of real-world spectrum measurement matrices. In [211], a robust spectral-temporal
    two-dimensional spectrum prediction algorithm is proposed under an assumption
    on the sparsity of abnormal or corrupted historical data. In [212], a matrix completion-based
    algorithm is developed for TV white space database construction via joint spectrum
    sensing in time domain and spectrum inference in spatial domain. Tang et al. [213]
    propose the concept of spectrum tensor and develop a multi-dimensional (including,
    time, frequency, and space) spectrum inference algorithm for spectrum map construction
    by invoking the recent advances in tensor completion. Moreover, the recent tutorial
    papers [214], [215] propose to combine spectrum sensing and spectrum inference
    into spectrum database for providing spectrum services for users, and also highlight
    that joint multiple-domain spectrum inference is an active research trend. E.
    Summary and Insights As discussed above, there are a wealth of contributions on
    spectrum inference. In this subsection, we offer a brief summary and discussions
    of the existing spectrum inference algorithms. First of all, the major developments
    of spectrum inference/prediction techniques are summarized at a glance in Tables
    II and III in the chronological order. Then, the advantages and technical challenges
    of various spectrum inference algorithms are summarized in Table IV, according
    to a priori information concerning the processed data and to the resultant complexity
    and accuracy constraints. TABLE II Major Developments of Spectrum Inference Techniques
    (Part 1) (T/E: Theoretic/Experimental Work; U/O/I: Underlay/Overlay/Interweave)
    TABLE III Major Developments of Spectrum Inference Techniques (Part 2) (T/E: Theoretic/Experimental
    Work; U/O/I: Underlay/Overlay/Interweave) TABLE IV Discussions on Advantages and
    Challenges of Various Spectrum Inference Algorithms Furthermore, there are also
    several major insights based on the comprehensive survey of the existing studies
    detailed as follows. Firstly, while the majority of the existing studies focused
    on spectrum inference in the time domain, in the past decade, spectrum inference
    in joint multiple domains has been gaining increasing research interests. For
    instance, Ding et al. [209]–[211] proposed various joint two-dimensional spectral-temporal
    spectrum prediction algorithms by leveraging the low-rank nature of the spectral
    data. Tang et al. [213] developed a multi-dimensional (time, frequency, and space)
    spectral map construction method. Second, there are some quantitative comparisons
    among different spectrum inference techniques. Specifically, it was reported in
    [20] that under the same traffic scenario, an ANN based predictor performs slightly
    better than the HMM predictor owing to having a flexible number of states and
    a more efficient training mechanism. Although having more intermediate layers
    in the ANN increases their computational complexity, the prediction results are
    improved [157]. As expected, there is a tradeoff between the complexity and the
    accuracy. Moreover, it is reported in [139] that the short-term prediction performance
    of the ANN based predictor is better than that of the ARIMA predictor, but their
    performance degrades, when predicting further into the future. The performance
    of the HMM predictor suffers from two inherent limitations [218]. Since the radio
    environment is changing all the time, the fixed states assumed in Markov modeling
    fail to capture the rich temporal variations of the channel activities. Another
    limitation of the HMM aided predictor is that discrete or univariate Gaussian
    models of observations often fail to adequately characterize the general situations.
    The POMDP predictor gives full cognizance to random actions, to incomplete information
    and to noisy observations of the environment, but it may not be able to accurately
    calculate the probabilities of specific action outcomes [219]. When it comes to
    pattern mining based schemes, the partial periodic pattern mining predictor is
    more robust than the HMM predictor owing to extracting more channel state prediction
    rules, which reduces the probability of spectrum usage prediction compared to
    traditional frequent-pattern mining [16]. SECTION IV. Algorithm Analysis of Spectrum
    Inference in CRNs A. Performance Metrics When evaluating or choosing a prediction
    algorithm, carefully selected metrics should be considered. Typically the notion
    of detection probability ( P d ) representing the correct prediction of the busy
    states and the false-alarm probability ( P fa ) representing the rate of incorrect
    prediction of idle states are used for studying the performance of algorithms
    in spectrum occupancy prediction. A combination of a higher P d and lower P fa
    suggests a better prediction performance. Some other statistical criteria like
    the normalized mean square error (NMSE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE),
    and the root mean square error (RMSE) can also be introduced to quantify the adequacy
    of prediction. In order to demonstrate the advantage of using spectrum prediction,
    both the percentage improvement in spectrum utilization and the percentage reduction
    in sensing energy can also be invoked. Spectrum inference/prediction is an efficient
    technique complementary to other techniques, such as spectrum sensing, geolocation
    spectrum database, and radio environment map, for capturing the relevant information
    about the spectral evolution and identifying spectrum access opportunities. In
    this subsection, we first briefly present the key ideas of each technique one
    by one. Then, we discuss the relationships between spectrum inference and the
    other techniques. B. Relationship With Spectrum Sensing Spectrum sensing determines
    spectrum state in a passive manner using various signal detection methods. This
    approach, however, suffers from the hidden node problem because of shadowing [239].
    In the past decade, intensive studies have been carried out across the globe to
    improve the detection performance of spectrum sensing. Excellent survey papers
    in this direction can be found in [25]–[27]. Briefly, existing studies on spectrum
    sensing in CRNs can be classified into two groups: quiet-periods-based (see [26])
    and non-quiet-periods-based spectrum sensing (see [288]), also known as spectrum
    monitoring in the literature. As the name implies, in the former studies, a cognitive
    radio first spends a time duration (known as quiet period) to perform spectrum
    sensing and then determines whether to transmit based on the sensing results.
    By contrast, spectrum monitoring in CRNs is a relatively new technique, where
    the cognitive radios can continue their communications while simultaneously monitoring
    the band to detect any transmissions that are initiated by primary radios. More
    specifically, the spectrum is monitored by the cognitive radio receiver during
    reception and without quiet periods [287]–[289]. So far, spectrum sensing has
    not been widely accepted by regulatory bodies to ensure non-harming the primary/licensed
    users. It is challenging to meet the strict rules required by the regulators from
    FCC, such as the detection of a primary signal at −114 dBm by FCC. C. Relationship
    With Geolocation Spectrum Database By contrast, according to the regulations of
    FCC [240], [241], the geolocation spectrum database approach seems to provide
    a technically feasible and commercially viable solution in the near future. This
    approach provides a service ensuring that an unlicensed device can inquire the
    spectrum availability from a geolocation database, which predicts the spectrum
    availability at any location using propagation modeling combined with terrain
    data [242], [246]. Based on the guidelines provided by FCC [240], several TV white
    space database systems have been developed by companies [247]–[250]. A specific
    limitation of this approach is that the accuracy of the spectrum availability
    provided by the geolocation database depends crucially both on the quality of
    the propagation modeling and on the granularity of the terrain data. To resolve
    this issue, a data-driven approach is presented in [5] to build a spectrum database
    by learning the spectrum availability from mobile crowd sensing and big spectrum
    data analytics. Another limitation of this approach is that the update speed of
    the spectrum availability provided by the geolocation database is relatively slow
    (e.g., in the time scale of hours or days). D. Relationship With Radio Environment
    Maps The radio environment map (REM), concept was originally proposed by scientists
    from Virginia Tech [115], [251], [252], which is a promising tool that provides
    a practical realization of CRNs, explicitly, it constructs a comprehensive map
    of the CRN by utilizing multi-domain information from geolocation databases, characteristics
    of spectrum use, geographical terrain models, propagation environment and regulations
    [253]. In contrast to the geolocation spectrum database, REM is an advanced knowledge
    base that stores live multi-domain information on the entities in the network
    as well as on the environment [254], [255]. Spectrum inference is an efficient
    technique complementary to the above techniques. Spectrum inference, with spectrum
    prediction in the time domain as a special case, infers an unknown spectrum state
    from known spectrum data, by effectively exploiting the inherent statistical correlations
    of spectrum data in time, frequency and spatial domains. A key distinguishing
    feature of spectrum inference is that it presents a proactive view of the spectrum
    state. In terms of the relation with spectrum sensing, spectrum inference can
    reduce the sensing time and energy consumption [127]. Spectrum inference (e.g.,
    in time domain) can also be fused with spectrum sensing to improve the detection
    performance of spectrum access opportunities [12]. In terms of the relationship
    with a geolocation spectrum database, spectrum inference (e.g., in spatial domain)
    can be further used to calibrate the propagation models and to improve the update
    speed of the database. In terms of its relationship with REM, spectrum inference
    in multiple domains (i.e., time-frequency-space) can be used to construct dynamic
    interference maps for each frequency at each location of interest [253], in a
    proactive and energy-efficient manner. SECTION V. Experimentation-Based Approaches
    in CRNs Although the majority of the existing spectrum inference algorithms are
    mainly studied from a theoretical perspective, there are some studies that aim
    for bridging the theory and the practice. In this section, we present discussions
    regarding real experimentation-based spectrum inference approaches in CRNs. We
    begin with presenting several well known spectrum-related experimental projects,
    which serve as the hardware/software basis for the development of spectrum inference
    algorithms. Then, we briefly comment on the analysis of real-world spectrum measurements.
    Furthermore, we discuss the experimental results reported in the literature. A.
    Spectrum-Related Experimentation Projects During the past two decades, quite a
    few spectrum-related experimental projects have been carried out all over the
    world, which collected empirical real world spectrum measurements and supported
    the development of spectrum inference techniques. Excellent surveys and tutorials
    on the latest advances of worldwide spectrum projects and occupancy measurements
    can be found in [23] and [24]. In the following, we provide a brief review of
    several well-known spectrum occupancy evaluation projects to assist the readers.
    ORCA, which stands for Optimization and Rational use of wireless Communication
    bAnds [290], is a project with the general scientific objective of extensively
    evaluating the spectrum occupancy in order to study the potential for its exploitation
    by innovative wireless services. This project developed DTV coverage prediction
    algorithms by exploiting for example the Longley-Rice propagation model [291],
    [292]. WiSHFUL, which stands for Wireless Software and Hardware platforms for
    Flexible and Unified radio and network controL [293], is a project funded by the
    European Commission’s Horizon 2020 Programme with the following objectives: i)
    to offer open, flexible and adaptive software and hardware platforms for radio
    control and network protocol development; ii) to offer portable facilities that
    can be deployed at any location; iii) to attract and support experimenters for
    wireless innovation. CREW, which stands for Cognitive Radio Experimentation World
    [294], is a project with the main target of establishing an open federated test
    platform, which facilitates experimentally-driven research on advanced spectrum
    sensing, cognitive radio and cognitive networking in view of both horizontal and
    vertical spectrum sharing in licensed and unlicensed bands. Parts of the research
    outputs of this project focus on constructing radio environment maps using various
    spatial inference techniques [295]. FARAMIR, which stands for Flexible and spectrum-Aware
    Radio Access through Measurements and modeling in cognitive Radio systems [296],
    is a project making CRs a reality, with the main goal of developing techniques
    for increasing the radio environmental and spectral awareness of future wireless
    systems. Parts of the research outputs of this project focus on constructing radio
    environment maps using various statistical inference techniques [297], [298].
    B. Predictability Analysis of Real Spectrum Measurements With respect to spectrum
    inference/prediction, there is a fundamental question: To what degree is the spectrum
    state evolution predictable? In other words, the predictability of spectrum evolution
    reflects the upper-bound performance of all potential spectrum inference/prediction
    techniques. When considering the temporal spectrum usage evolution for a given
    frequency band in a given location as a random time series, the entropy is the
    most fundamental quantity characterizing the degree of predictability for this
    random variable. In general, having a lower entropy implies a higher predictability
    and vice versa. Entropy-based analysis has indeed been introduced in diverse prediction
    scenarios, such as for the atmosphere [6], in finance [7], for network traffic
    [8] and for human mobility [9]. The basic idea is that the entropy offers a precise
    definition of the information content of predictions and it is renowned for its
    generality due to relying on minimal assumptions concerning the model of the scenario
    studied. Recently, in [127], we have invoked an information theoretic methodology
    of using statistical entropy measures and Fano’s inequality to quantify the degree
    of predictability underlying real-world spectrum measurements. We found that despite
    the apparent randomness, a remarkable 90% predictability may be achieved, in real-world
    RSS dynamics over diverse spectral bands for several popular services, including
    the classic TV bands, cellular bands, the (Industrial Scientific Medical) ISM
    bands, etc. Similarly, Olivieri et al. [123] have applied the information theoretic
    entropy as a measure of predictability in the process of generating the ON- and
    OFF-period durations. Wellens et al. [124] and Riihijarvi et al. [125], [126]
    have used state-of-the-art multi-scale entropy metrics in order to examine the
    predictability of the spectrum measurement traces recorded as a function of the
    prediction complexity. C. Experimental Spectrum Inference Approaches As shown
    in Tables II and III, although the majority of the existing spectrum inference
    algorithms are predominately studied from a theoretical perspective, there are
    some studies in the open literature that implement and test spectrum inference
    approaches from an experimental perspective. To the best of the authors’ knowledge,
    [140] is one of the earliest studies of this kind, where the Markovian property
    of the spectrum usage has been validated by analyzing real-world measurements
    in the paging spectrum band (928–948 MHz). Experimentally, the HMM is used for
    predicting the ON-OFF activity of the PU with a prediction accuracy of about 76%.
    Similarly, Chen et al. [14] verify the HMM method using measured WiFi data instead
    of artificial data, where the numerical results show that the prediction accuracy
    for a single device is above 70 %, which can be improved by cooperative prediction
    of multiple devices. Melián-Gutiérrez et al. [111] train and validate the HMM
    model with the aid of real measurements collected from the 14 MHz HF amateur band,
    where an average of 10.3% prediction error rate is achieved. In [162], a multi-layer
    perception ANN is applied to forecast the idle or busy state of different channels,
    where the performances are evaluated for a seven-day spectrum dataset collected
    in a metro city located in south China and the empirical results show a high prediction
    accuracy having a mean RMSE as low as 0.04. In [119], based on spectrum measurements
    ranging from 20 MHz to 3 GHz at four locations in Guangdong province of China,
    the authors develop a 2-dimensional frequent pattern mining (FPM) algorithm to
    predict the availability of multiple channels simultaneously, where the numerical
    results show that the prediction accuracy is higher than 95% for the GSM900/1800
    downlink and for the TV bands. Ding et al. [210] develop a joint spectral-temporal
    prediction from incomplete historical observations, where real measurements of
    TV bands (614 MHz-698 MHz) are used for quantifying the improvements over the
    one-dimensional neural network-based temporal prediction scheme. In an extended
    work [209], Ding et al. develop a robust online spectrum prediction algorithm
    relying on incomplete and corrupted historical observations, where the real measurements
    of TV bands, ISM bands and GSM bands are used for demonstrating that the proposed
    algorithm performs well in the presence of missing data. SECTION VI. Applications
    of Spectrum Inference in CRNs The specific benefits of cognitive radio networks
    depend on our ability to infer/predict the unknown/unmeasured spectrum states
    from known/measured spectrum data. To portray the various applications of the
    spectrum inference technology, in this section we first review the existing use
    cases and then we portray spectrum inference in the context of: i) 5th generation
    mobile communications (5G) spectrum sharing, ii) next-generation high-frequency
    (HF) automatic link establishment (ALE), and iii) several other potential applications
    in various future wireless networks, such as cognitive smart grid networks, cognitive
    radio sensor networks, cognitive cellular networks (CCN), and cognitive machine-to-machine
    communications (CM2M). Based on the spectrum management framework proposed in
    [4], the existing applications of spectrum prediction in CRNs can be classified
    into four basic categories, namely, spectrum sensing, spectrum decisions, spectrum
    evolution upon handover and spectrum sharing [21]. The corresponding example applications
    of the inference algorithms discussed in Section VI on each category are summarized
    in Table V. Moreover, the applications and benefits of exploiting spectrum inference/prediction
    in CRNs are presented in Fig. 9, Table VI and briefly summarized as Sections VI-A–VI-D.

    Show All A. Spectrum Inference for Sensing Spectrum sensing is a critical aspect
    of spectrum inference applications that aim to explore idle spectrum slots. In
    the emerging spectrum sensing paradigms in the time, frequency and spatial dimensions,
    inference techniques are widely used to infer the most possible vacant channels
    for improving the detection performance and reducing the energy and time consumption
    of sensing. In terms of spectrum inference in the time domain for spectrum sensing
    [15], [93], [128], [129], [139], [187], [220] use various linear prediction techniques,
    such as AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA to perform spectrum prediction, where the output
    is used to improve the sensing accuracy and reduce the sensing cost. In parallel,
    Markov models such as HMM [14], [17], [20], [95], [111], [118], [140], [142],
    [144], [146], [218], [221], [222] and POMDP [153] are also widely used to perform
    similar tasks. These kinds of models work well under the assumption of memoryless
    or Markov property existing in the spectrum state evolution. That is, the future
    state depends only on the relevant information about the current, not on information
    from further in the past. ANN models are another kind of techniques that are widely
    investigated (see [20], [119], [139], [158], [160]–[162], [167], [168], [178],
    [183], [223], [224]), which show relatively better prediction accuracy over other
    models. In addition, pattern mining methods [119], [216], BIF methods [17], [187]
    and SVM methods [190], [191] are also investigated. In terms of spectrum inference
    in the frequency domain for spectrum sensing, the spectral occupancy correlation
    between adjacent channels has been evaluated by experiments in [194]–[196]. Related
    studies are well dedicated to inferring the states of other channels in the light
    of already acquired sensing or predicted results [93], [119], [192], [193]. Specifically,
    Yin et al. [192] exploited the spectral correlations for inferring the availabilities
    of other channels in order to improve the throughput. In [193], predicting the
    states of unsensed channels is formulated as a matrix completion problem and the
    technique of belief propagation (BP) is applied to fill the matrix with predicted
    states. Yin et al. [119] has proposed a frequency pattern matching algorithm operating
    in two-dimensions (FPM-2D) for spectrum inference, which searches through all
    relevant 2D patterns. Similarly, frequency domain correlation techniques were
    also introduced in [93] by modeling the neighboring channels in pairs, where the
    classic AR models which do not need a priori knowledge on the communication environment
    were also employed to reduce the complexity. The existing studies on spectrum
    inference in the spatial domain for spectrum sensing are relatively limited. In
    [212], a matrix completion-based algorithm is developed for TV white space database
    construction via joint spectrum sensing in time domain and spectrum inference
    in spatial domain. Tang et al. [213] propose the concept of spectrum tensor and
    develop a multi-dimensional (including, time, frequency, and space) spectrum inference
    algorithm for spectrum map construction by invoking the recent advances in tensor
    completion. B. Spectrum Inference for Decision Spectrum inference for decision
    has been investigated in various aspects such as, centralized spectrum allocation,
    decentralized channel selection, physical layer rate adaption, dynamic spectrum
    access, to name just a few. In the following, we introduce several representative
    examples. Akbar and Tranter [95] proposed to use the HMM based prediction algorithm
    for dynamic spectrum allocation, where the superiority in terms of system throughput
    is presented by comparing with traditional CSMA based algorithms. Qin et al. [199]
    and Melián-Gutiérreza et al. [111] respectively studied the problem of spectrum
    inference-based channel selection in the HF spectrum. Zhao et al. [153] proposed
    an approach for channel state prediction based on POMDP by finding the optimal
    policy that maximizes some aspect of the reward. Baldo et al. [167], [168] proposed
    to use neural networks based cognitive controller for dynamic channel selection
    and adaptation. In [178], Elman recurrent neural networks was used for radio frequency
    multivariate time series modelling in order to predict the spectral evolution,
    which leads to intelligent CR decisions for exploiting the expected spectrum opportunities,
    optimized spectrum usage and interference avoidance. C. Spectrum Inference for
    Mobility The mobility terminology in the CRNs has double meanings. On the one
    hand, it refers to ‘spectrum mobility or spectrum handoffs’ from one spectral
    band to another, for example, due to the appearance of PUs or owing to interference
    avoidance for other CRs. One the other hand, the ‘mobility of CRs and/or PUs’,
    for example in vehicular CRNs, may also affect the surrounding geographical spectral
    environment in terms of imposing additional interference, hence changing channel
    conditions and spectrum availability, etc. An excellent survey paper on spectrum
    mobility in CRNs was conceived by [170], which starts from the consideration that
    in highly dynamic environments, CR-aided communication is often interrupted and
    hence spectrum mobility is recognized as a pivotal feature of enabling continuous
    CR data transmission, by transferring ongoing sessions to an idle channel. A recent
    classification and survey was provided by [171]. In [172], a Poisson distribution
    based model of spectral resources relying on a cross-layer spectrum handoff protocol
    optimized for the minimum expected transmission time was developed for cognitive
    LTE networks. However, the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum makes
    it difficult to support seamless CR communications. To address this problem, a
    spectrum-aware mobility management scheme is proposed in [173] for CR cellular
    networks, where a unified mobility management framework is developed for supporting
    the diverse mobility patterns in CR networks, which consists of spectrum mobility
    management, user mobility management and inter-cell resource balancing. Over the
    years, most of the existing studies have been focused on so-called reactive spectrum
    mobility, where the CR switches its communication once a PU becomes active, where
    the detection of the PU relies either on spectrum sensing or on monitoring. However,
    there are also some emerging proactive spectrum mobility solutions, based on prediction
    or inference techniques. For instance, Bütün et al. [205] propose a static neighbor
    graph (SNG) algorithm for predicting the mobility of cognitive users. Wang et
    al. [202] proposed a support vector machine (SVM) based spectrum mobility prediction
    algorithm for mobile CRNs. In [203], the SVM was invoked both for predicting the
    handoff point and the idle channels with a high precision. In addition to the
    spectrum availability, the link availability between the CRs was also inferred
    by Hou et al. [204], where by invoking this novel approach, a reliable path can
    be found for dynamic routing in CRNs. In [205], a location predictor is proposed,
    where the historical changes of the PU’s geographic locations are represented
    by a directed graph having weighted edges. Once a spectrum occupancy prediction
    is requested, all the edges originating from the starting point are listed and
    then the destination is predicted according to the approximately calculated maximum
    weights. Huang et al. [174] propose a Bayesian inference-based prediction algorithm
    for spotting the specific channel that is most likely to be available for the
    CR-aided vehicular ad-hoc networks, where the most critical challenges are the
    high-speed mobility of vehicles and the dynamically-fluctuating channel availability.
    As a further advance, Thakur et al. [175] propose a proactive spectrum prediction
    technique, where the emergence of PU is predicted before its true emergence, in
    order to avoid dropping even a single packet. D. Spectrum Inference for Sharing
    In the context of spectrum sharing, there are different understandings in the
    literature. In the generalized sense, the concept of spectrum sharing is inter-changeable
    with the concepts of dynamic spectrum access or cognitive radio, which consists
    of three paradigms of spectrum usage: underlay, overlay and interweave [120].
    This kind of understanding of spectrum sharing makes its meaning too board to
    cover every aspects of CRNs. On the other hand, in the narrow sense, spectrum
    sharing focuses on the underlay mode, which allows CRs to operate in the same
    band at the same time if the mutual interference among them is below a tolerant
    threshold. Spectrum inference for sharing is invoked for supporting/facilitating
    the coexistence of CRs with the PUs. As shown in Table V, the research on inference-based
    spectrum sharing is relatively limited and mainly focused on spatial domain [5],
    [18], [176], [200]. In [5], a systematic approach is developed to enable efficient
    spectrum sharing between the PU (i.e., TV receivers) and the CR (e.g., smart phone,
    tablet, mobile vehicles, etc) where matrix completion-based spectrum inference
    technique is invoked to serve as a spatial interpolator of unmeasured spectrum
    data. Villardi and Harada [18] propose to predict the contour and service areas
    of the PU for enabling unlicensed CR systems operating in the TV white space without
    producing harmful interference to the PU receivers. Recently, Kim and Giannakis
    [200] have proposed a dictionary learning framework to predict the interference
    power levels in various locations for enabling harmonious spectrum sharing between
    the PU and the CR. Zhou et al. [176] formulate the adaptive vehicular data piping
    problem for dynamic spectrum sharing as a coalitional formation game and propose
    a near optimal coalitional formation approach for enabling vehicular data pipe
    selection partition in a distributed way. E. Potential Use Case I: Spectrum Inference
    for Supporting 5G Spectrum Sharing Radio spectrum sharing is an essential topic
    for 5G wireless communications [258], [259]. The explosive growth of data rates
    offered by smart phones, tablets, laptops, vehicles and many other wireless devices
    is about to overwhelm the allocated 2G-3G-4G radio spectrum. Spectrum sharing
    is emerging as an affordable, near-term method of meeting the 5G radio spectrum
    shortage and increasing the radio access network capacities for supporting 5G
    content delivery [260]. Spectrum sharing may occur between an incumbent user (e.g.,
    commercial TV or public radars) and a secondary 5G user, when a 5G device uses
    a spectrum band allocated for an incumbent usage in a geographic place, time and
    RF channel that the incumbent is not using, subject to the tolerable interference
    imposed on the incumbent [5]. Fig. 10 presents a vision of spectrum inference/prediction-based
    spectrum sharing conceived for 5G wireless communications. Specifically, in the
    basic operation cycle printed in light color, the spectrum sensing module infers
    the observable RF stimuli from the radio environment and outputs the predicted
    RSS in various spectrum bands of the current time slot. Based on the input from
    spectrum sensing, the spectrum sharing module activates spectrum reuse and interference
    control to ensure the safe coexistence between commercial or public incumbent
    users and secondary 5G users. It may be deemed inevitable for 5G devices to explore
    and exploit the benefits of multiple (non-continuous) spectrum bands of a wide
    range, spanning from a few hundred MHz in the VHF/UHF band to the 30–300 GHz millimeter-wave
    length band. In this case, predictive schemes are expected to obtain the RSS of
    such wide spectrum bands and to enable wideband spectrum sharing in a timely and
    cost-efficient manner based on time domain or joint time-frequency domains spectrum
    inference algorithms discussed in Section IV. Specifically, in Fig. 10, a spectrum
    inference/prediction module is introduced, which infers the future RSS based on
    the historical RSS data acquired by spectrum sensing, which can further enhance
    5G spectrum sharing for example by, supporting adaptive PHY-layer spectrum sensing,
    i.e., adaptive optimization of the sensing parameters, such as the sensing time
    duration in each time slot, facilitating resource-efficient MAC-layer spectrum
    sensing, for example by reducing the number of time-slots required for multi-band
    sequential sensing as well as scheduling and by reducing the energy consumption
    of multi-sensor cooperative sensing as well as scheduling, supporting high-data-rate
    spectrum sharing by combining the outputs of spectrum sensing and spectrum prediction,
    for example by guiding the selection of spectrum bands of high channel quality
    in carrier aggregation. Fig. 10. Spectrum inference for spectrum sharing in 5G
    wireless communication systems. The basic operation cycle is in light color and
    the functionality of spectrum inference/prediction is in dark color. Show All
    Specifically, in 5G systems, prediction-based spectrum sharing can be arranged
    at the base stations (BSs) of macro/small cells and at the access points (APs)
    of WLANs in a centralized manner as well as more aggressively, by the autonomous
    user equipment in a self-organized manner by relying on game theory and graph
    theory. F. Potential Use Case II: Spectrum Inference for Next-Generation HF Automatic
    Link Establishment High-frequency (HF) radio, also known as short-wave radio [261],
    operating in the 1.5–30 MHz spectrum band, is now widely used, not only by the
    amateur community, but also by worldwide governmental and non-governmental agencies
    as an alternative to satellites for over-the-horizon wireless communications.
    Typical application scenarios of HF radios include ships at sea, aircraft out
    of range of line-of-sight radio networks, disaster areas where the terrestrial
    communications infrastructure has been destroyed, and distant regions lacking
    other communications, to name just a few. One of the key challenges in using HF
    communications is finding a frequency that will support the desired tele-traffic
    from a transmitter to a receiver. The reasons behind this challenge are mainly
    two-fold: Firstly, over-the-horizon HF communications often use skywave propagation
    paths provided by ionospheric refraction, which physically makes the window of
    usable frequencies time-varying throughout the day, the season, the subspot cycle,
    the weather environment, and the radio locations, etc [262], which is quite different
    from terrestrial wireless communications, such as cellular and WLAN systems. Second,
    there are many governmental and non-governmental HF radio systems in the HF band,
    which make it a nontrivial task for each transmission to find a frequency without
    interfering with other users [263]. To tackle the above critical challenge, ALE
    [262] is well-recognized as a promising technology, which automates the process
    of finding a usable frequency and setting up links between two or more radios.
    Since the late 1970s, three generations of automatic link establishment techniques
    have been developed. Briefly, the first generation ALE was independently developed
    by different manufactures to automatically identify suitable transmission frequencies
    using microprocessors, instead of the original manual operation. The second generation
    ALE focused on standardized, interoperable HF radio systems, relying on the standards
    such as MIL-STD-188–141A and FED-STD-1045. The third generation ALE operates at
    a lower SNR, carries more traffic and supports larger networks. The ALEs of the
    first three generations are in essence narrowband ALE operating over 3kHz HF channels.
    However, in recent years we have seen an increasing demand for higher-data-rate
    transmission over HF links, supporting services ranging from voice and low-speed
    data to real-time video over HF skywave channels from aircraft, which motivates
    us to develop wideband ALE operating over HF channels wider than 3kHz, and up
    to 24 kHz [262]. Wideband ALE, also termed as fourth generation (4G) ALE, introduces
    an increased bandwidth flexibility as well as additional automated capabilities:
    i) detect and characterize the occupancy or interference within a wideband channel,
    and ii) coordinate the allocation of the clear subchannel. The literature [263]–[266]
    reports on the potential application of cognitive radio techniques in 4G ALE,
    where consensus ensures that spectrum sensing will indeed be used for HF radios
    for detecting the occupancy or interference within any portion of channels up
    to 24 kHz. Based on data link quality analysis (LQA), the associated frequency
    selection algorithm will be invoked for determining which channel(s) will be used
    for data transmission. The research and development of 4G ALE is still in its
    infancy [267]. Fig. 11 presents a vision of spectrum inference/prediction-based
    wideband 4G ALE. Specifically, in the basic operating cycle printed in light color,
    firstly sequential spectrum sensing is performed for detecting the occupancy or
    interference within each channel. Based on the output of spectrum sensing, sequential
    LQA is then performed on the particular channels, which are deemed to be unoccupied.
    Based on the LQA result, the frequency band(s) having a high quality will be selected
    as the active transmission link. One of the main problems of the basic operation
    cycle for wideband ALE is that the amount of time required both by the process
    of spectrum sensing and LQA increases proportionally with the number of frequencies
    sensed and analyzed. To reduce the associated delay, spectrum inference/prediction
    may be invoked as seen in Fig. 11. Specifically, spectrum inference can be employed
    in two specific ways: Inference/Prediction of spectrum occupancy, which outputs
    the predicted spectrum occupancy ranking. Based on this output, the specific frequency
    of the particular bands exhibiting a higher probability of being unoccupied will
    be sensed first in the following process. Inference/Prediction of link quality,
    which outputs the predicted link quality ranking. Based on this output, the specific
    frequency of the links having a higher predicted link quality will be firstly
    selected for LQA. Fig. 11. A vision of spectrum inference/prediction-based wideband
    4G HF ALE. The basic operating cycle is in light color and the functionality of
    spectrum inference/prediction is in dark color. Show All We note that in the basic
    operating cycle of wideband 4G ALE, the specific order in which spectrum sensing
    and LQA are carried out is generally random or predefined. By contrast, the introduction
    of spectrum inference/prediction is capable of providing an informative guidance
    considering the sensing order and LQA order. Therefore, the link establishment
    time is expected to decrease in 4G ALE, provided that the spectrum inference techniques
    summarized in the previous sections are invoked. To enable the vision shown in
    Fig. 11, time domain or joint time-frequency domains spectrum inference algorithms
    discussed in Section IV can be used. G. Other Use Cases: The Applications of Spectrum
    Inference for Various Future Wireless Networks In addition to 5G and HF communications,
    there are many other potential applications of spectrum inference for various
    future wireless networks, such as cognitive smart grid networks (CSGN) [56], [268],
    cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSN) [40], [269]–[271], cognitive cellular networks
    (CCN) [272]–[274], and cognitive machine-to-machine communications (CM2M) [275].
    Specifically, in cognitive radio-enabled smart grid networks, spectrum sensing
    and spectrum inference techniques are promising methods of providing timely smart
    grid wireless communications by utilizing all available spectrum resources. Besides
    the prediction of spectrum state evolution, various statistical inference techniques
    can also be utilized to predict the system state of the smart grid itself and
    the potential faults resulting from environmental disasters, cyber attacks and
    mechanical failures [56]. In CRSNs, wireless sensor networks benefit from the
    advantage of cognitive radio to overcome the spectrum scarcity by enabling dynamic
    spectrum access [269]. Among others, the limited energy/power supply and processing
    capability of wireless sensors impose additional constraints on the utilization
    of various cognitive radio techniques. More specifically, the design of spectrum
    inference in CRSNs should carefully balance the tradeoffs among the inference
    accuracy, the computational complexity, and the memory requirements. In future
    CCNs, spectrum sharing-oriented cognitive radio techniques can be used to improve
    the spectrum utilization and to meet the dramatic increase of wireless data rate
    requirements. Most of the studies on spectrum sharing in future CCNs assume that
    the network will be i) multi-tier, including macro cells, small cells such as
    micro cells and pico cells, and device-to-device or machine-to-machine communications
    [272]; ii) multi-band, including both licensed and unlicensed bands [273]; and
    iii) software-defined, relying on various intelligent learning or data mining
    algorithms operated in the cloud radio access networks [274]. Inference of the
    spectrum usage state and the users’ content demand will facilitate more proactive
    and efficient network operations. SECTION VII. Open Issues and Research Trends
    Although a number of studies have been carried out on spectrum inference in CRNs,
    this research topic has a great potential for future investigation. Actually,
    there are still a number of unsolved challenges waiting for solutions. Based on
    the above survey and tutorial, this section presents a range of potential open
    issues and future research trends as follows. A. Fundamental Performance Limits
    of Spectrum Inference First of all, the fundamental performance limits on spectrum
    inference are still unknown. Most existing work on spectrum inference focus on
    applying various statistical inference techniques for capturing the spectrum state’s
    evolution. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a paucity of studies
    focusing on the theoretical performance analysis of spectrum inference. Just as
    the Shannon capacity gives the upper bound of various modulation and coding schemes,
    there should be fundamental performance limits for the various spectrum inference
    techniques. These fundamental performance limits can guide the further development
    of spectrum inference algorithms. As mentioned above, recently, Olivieri et al.
    [123] have applied the information theoretic entropy as a measure of predictability
    in the process of generating the ON- and OFF-period durations. Wellens et al.
    [124], Riihijarvi et al. [125], [126] have used the multi-scale entropy, in order
    to examine both the complexity and the predictability of the spectrum measurement
    traces recorded. In [127], from an information theory perspective, the authors
    have introduced a methodology of using statistical entropy measures and Fano inequality
    to quantify the degree of predictability underlying real-world spectrum measurements.
    However, there is no commonly accepted limit on spectrum inference in the literature
    so far. Moreover, most of them have focused on the performance limits of time-domain
    spectrum prediction. No work has considered the limits of joint multi-domain spectrum
    inference, intuitively, which is expected to have a higher performance upper bound.
    B. Spectrum Inference in Various Domains Besides the time, frequency and spatial
    domains, in other dimensions such as the code- and angular-domain, to the best
    of our knowledge, inference/prediction of spectrum usage has not been proposed.
    Once the system becomes aware of the spreading code that the PU is going to use,
    the CRs become capable of choosing orthogonal codes to simultaneously transmit
    information with little or no interference. In the context of multiple input multiple
    output (MIMO) techniques, the PUs may transmit data within a narrow beam in a
    specific direction [279]. This provides opportunities for CRs to simultaneously
    transmit over the same frequency band in different directions. Inference/prediction
    techniques may help the CRs to infer the PU’s transmit phase trajectory and pre-shift
    the phase accordingly. Moreover, most of the existing spectrum inference studies
    focus on single domain spectrum inference, more specifically, time-domain spectrum
    prediction, but only very limited work consider joint multi-domain spectrum inference.
    Actually, no individual spectrum data exists in isolation, there are inherent
    correlations between this data and its neighbors in time domain, frequency domain,
    and space domain. Consequently, joint multi-domain spectrum inference is an active
    research direction, which is expected to bring more comprehensive, accurate and
    reliable spectrum information. C. Spectrum Inference in Various Bands Although
    there have been extensive spectrum measurement campaigns all over the world during
    the past decade, the majority of the efforts have been focused on TV bands to
    identify TV white spaces (see [86], [87]), which to some extent represent the
    responses to FCC’s spectrum policy task force in 2002 [57] and to FCC’s adoption
    rule for unlicensed use of television white spaces around 2010 [240]. There is
    an urgent need to perform spectrum measurements and inference, in order to document
    the usage of spectrum bands that have attracted the recent interest of the regulatory
    bodies. For instance, FCC issued a report and order in 2015, adopting rules for
    the commercial use of 150 MHz of spectrum in the 3550–3700 MHz band (known as
    3.5 GHz band), where the primary user is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
    radar systems. There are relatively few studies on the spectrum measurements in
    the new bands [282]–[284]. Interestingly, spectrum sharing between the incumbent
    radar systems and the Internet of Things devices or secondary WiFi networks have
    been recently studied in [284]–[286]. D. Cooperative Spectrum Inference In scenarios
    where there are multiple PUs and multiple CRs, cooperative spectrum inference
    among CRs is a promising research direction. Cooperative spectrum inference can
    benefit from multi-user diversity gains since different CRs may face different
    shadowing and fading environments and have different spectrum consequences for
    inference. Furthermore, cooperative spectrum inference can enable different CRs
    to perform different inference subtasks, which may both reduce the computational
    complexity and the inference delay. Moreover, the geographical movements as well
    as the data transmission trends of the CRs could be better predicted by cooperative
    schemes. There are several studies in this direction [257], [277], [278]. E. Deep
    Spectrum Inference With the escalation of spectrum demand, there is a pressing
    need to recognize, classify and to activate the available bands. In fields like
    public health, economic development and climate forecasting, data mining has shown
    a beneficial predictive power [276]. Similar success may be anticipated in the
    radio environment conceiving the required transmission power, spectrum state,
    PU/CR location, as long as there is sufficient training data. To handle the flood
    of spectrum data, recent advances in artificial intelligence techniques, like
    deep learning and reinforcement learning [280], [281], are promising tools for
    improving the spectrum inference performance. F. Spectrum Inference for Sensing
    There are a number of interesting directions of exploiting spectrum inference
    for sensing. Firstly, as is known, wireless spectrum has a (time, frequency, space,
    etc) multi-domain space. Due to either the hardware limitations or sensor deployment
    cost, spectrum sensing can only capture the state of a partial of the spectrum
    space. To obtain a whole picture of the multi-domain spectrum space, spectrum
    inference can help to fill the unmeasured space via acting as an interpolator.
    Second, to find idle spectrum from a large number of candidate bands, the order
    of spectrum sensing is vital to minimize the sensing time overhead. Spectrum inference
    can provide a predictive input to spectrum sensing for enabling a better sensing
    order. In addition, spectrum inference can output a complementary spectrum state
    estimation to spectrum sensing. It’s possible to fuze the output of spectrum inference
    and spectrum sensing to get a more accurate state estimation. G. Spectrum Inference
    for Sharing In the context of spectrum sharing, spectrum inference is invoked
    for supporting/facilitating the coexistence of CRs and PUs. The current research
    on inference-based spectrum sharing is limited and mainly focused on spatial domain
    [5], [18], [176], [200], where the inference of spatial signal coverage is used
    to improve the spatial reuse. One interesting direction is to jointly predict/inference
    the spectrum demand of CRs and the spectrum activities of PUs for proactively
    coordinating the spectrum sharing among them. Another direction is to predict/inference
    the statistical channel gains of CR links, PU links and CR-PU interference links,
    which can facilitate the resource allocation, especially when the channel gains
    cannot be obtained due to various practical constraints. H. Spectrum Inference
    for Mobility As mentioned above, spectrum mobility in the CRNs has a twin interpretation.
    On the one hand, it refers to spectral handoff from one band to another, due to
    the appearance of PUs or interference avoidance. One the other hand, the mobility
    of CRs and/or PUs, for example, in vehicular CRNs, may also affect the geographically
    surrounding spectrum environment in terms of imposing additional interference,
    changing channel conditions and spectrum availability, etc. Spectrum inference
    associated with in the former case has been extensively studied. However, in the
    latter case, there are only a few contributions. Supporting high-throughput vehicular
    communications is important for safety applications, traffic management and mobile
    Internet access. One promising scenario of spectrum inference for mobility can
    be found in railway, highway or subway based cognitive communications, where the
    mobility trajectory is fixed and thus the spectrum demand may be relatively regular
    for inference. One interesting research direction is to jointly consider the spectrum
    mobility with the user mobility since the spectrum evolution patterns are generally
    determined by the human’s usage of radio spectrum. Moreover, it is reported in
    [9] that a 93% potential predictability of human mobility can be expected, which
    in-turn can be exploited for supporting accurate spectrum inference. I. Spectrum
    Inference for Decision As mentioned above, spectrum inference for decision has
    been extensively investigated in various aspects such as, centralized spectrum
    allocation, decentralized channel selection, physical layer rate adaption, dynamic
    spectrum access, to name just a few. There are relatively few open issues found
    on this topic. However, one direction is to design demos or systems that utilizes
    the specific techniques with the well known example as DAPRA’s spectrum challenges.
    J. Applications of Spectrum Inference Last but not least, more investigations
    on specific applications of spectrum inference techniques is also a fruitful research
    direction. Although there are several common rules for various applications, the
    requirements of spectrum inference in different application scenarios are rather
    diverse. For example, the spectrum occupancy state in TV bands changes relatively
    slowly on a time-scale of several hours, while the spectrum occupancy state in
    cellular bands or Wi-Fi bands changes within several milliseconds. Considering
    the fact that the outdated prediction or inference is useless, the tolerance to
    time delay in the corresponding spectrum inference is significantly different,
    which imposes different design constraints on the specific inference algorithms.
    SECTION VIII. Conclusion Spectrum inference is a promising technique of improving
    the spectrum exploitation in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we reviewed
    the recent advances in spectrum inference based on an extensive study of the existing
    literature. We first introduced the preliminaries of spectrum inference, including
    the sources of spectrum data, the models of spectrum usage and the predictability
    of spectrum evolution. Then we explored various spectrum inference algorithms
    from a time-frequency-spatial domain perspective and presented an in-depth tutorial.
    We proceeded by offering a comparative analysis of the advantages and challenges
    of various spectrum inference techniques. Additionally, we reviewed the applications
    of spectrum inference both in existing and in future wireless networks, including
    5G cellular communications, next-generation HF communications, cognitive smart
    grid networks, cognitive radio sensor networks, etc. We also highlighted a range
    of open issues and research trends influencing the actual deployment of spectrum
    inference. We conclude that the main goal of the existing and forthcoming studies
    on spectrum inference in CRNs is to achieve a compromise amongst the conflicting
    objectives of improving the prediction accuracy, reducing its computational complexity
    and memory requirement. This forms a fruitful research area. Our hope is that
    this paper, with its interdisciplinary perspective, will stimulate the research
    and development of spectrum inference in future wireless networks. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Multicasting is a fundamental networking primitive utilized by numerous applications.
    This also holds true for cognitive radio networks which have been proposed as
    a solution to the problems that emanate from the static non-adaptive features
    of classical wireless networks. A prime application of cognitive radio networks
    is dynamic spectrum access, which improves the efficiency of spectrum allocation
    by allowing a secondary network, comprising secondary users, to share spectrum
    licensed to a primary licensed network comprising primary users. Multicasting
    in cognitive radio networks is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature
    of spectrum opportunities available to the secondary users. Various approaches,
    including those based on optimization theory, network coding, algorithms, have
    been proposed for performing efficient multicast in cognitive radio networks.
    In this paper, we provide a self-contained tutorial on algorithms and techniques
    useful for solving the multicast problem, and then provide a comprehensive survey
    of protocols that have been proposed for multicasting in cognitive radio networks.
    We conclude this paper by identifying open research questions and future research
    directions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords MulticastingCognitive
    radio networksRouting 1. Introduction Cognitive radio networks (CRNs), networks
    of nodes equipped with cognitive radios (CRs), promise to revolutionize modern
    wireless networks by incorporating intelligence into its core (Akyildiz et al.,
    2009). CRs have themselves evolved from the concept of software-defined-radios
    (SDRs) that allowed a network to adapt to network conditions and user requirements
    in runtime with software changes only. CRs extend this concept to allow a node
    to observe its environment and to adapt to it through learning and cognition.
    A major use-case of CRNs is employing ‘dynamic spectrum access’ (DSA) to improve
    the wireless spectrum utilization. DSA has captured the fancy of industry, regulators,
    and academia as it promises to remedy the problem of inefficient spectrum utilization
    brought upon by the historical command-and-control approach to spectrum allocation.
    The main failing of this static spectrum allocation approach, which licensed specific
    portions of the radio spectrum to specific applications for exclusive usage, became
    apparent as more and more wireless technologies clamored for any available spectrum.
    It was observed that while most of the wireless spectrum was licensed, thereby
    being off-limits for newer innovative technologies that required spectrum as their
    lifeline, the spectrum was hardly utilized through a quirk of static spectrum
    policy and licensed user׳s bursty communication nature. DSA promises to solve
    this problem of ‘artificial spectrum scarcity’ by allowing secondary users (SUs)
    access to the licensed spectrum subject to the condition that it does not cause
    any interference for the licensed, or the primary, users (PUs). Multicasting or
    group communication is a fundamental networking primitive utilized by numerous
    wireless networking applications. Some envisioned applications include support
    of multimedia applications (such as video conferencing), file distribution, news
    or update dissemination (Paul and Raghavan, 2002, Sahasrabuddhe and Mukherjee,
    2000). Multicasting subsumes the models of unicast transmission and broadcast
    transmission in its paradigm by varying the receiver group from the one extreme
    of a single receiver to the other extreme of all the network nodes as receivers.
    Multicasting over wireless networks is a significant but challenging goal in the
    field of networks, which requires a lot of issues to be addressed like bandwidth,
    topology, loss of packets, routing, reliability, security issues and quality of
    service, before it can be deployed. Providing a trade-off between stability, throughput
    and packet loss with reduced bandwidth requirement and less power consumption
    is the main aim of multicast in wireless networks (Quinn and Almeroth, 2001).
    Furthermore, multicasting is challenging in CRNs due to the dynamically changing
    topology of CRNs. CRNs often have to operate in unknown radio environments, with
    the topology of a secondary network depending critically on the temporal and spatial
    aspects of PU arrivals. This can lead to a scenario where the various CRN nodes
    have a heterogeneous set of channels available. This complicates the problem of
    multicast as the channel heterogeneity may mean lack of a common channel between
    neighbors (Akyildiz et al., 2006). More detailed analysis of routing challenges
    for multi-hop CRNs is provided in Sengupta and Subbalakshmi (2013). In this paper,
    we provide a tutorial on the general algorithms, techniques, and protocols that
    have been proposed for the wireless multicast problem, particularly, with a focus
    on CRNs. While there are numerous survey articles on wireless multicast (Varshney,
    2002), optimization problems in multicast (Oliveira and Pardalos, 2005), algorithm
    issues in multicast (Winter, 1987), this is the first work that coherently synthesizes
    necessary background from fields like optimization theory, network coding theory,
    algorithms, game-theory, machine-learning in the form of unified tutorial and
    follows it up with a survey of existing work on multicast in CRNs. We also provide
    a survey of the state-of-the-art in the field of multicast routing in CRNs, and
    highlight the open research challenges in this area. Organization of the paper:
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We provide the necessary background
    on multicasting, including defining basic terminology, various categories of multicasting
    approaches, and challenges of multicasting in Section 2. We then provide a self-contained
    tutorial on various algorithms and techniques from diverse fields such as graph
    theory, network coding, optimization, machine learning, and game theory in Section
    3. A detailed survey of multicasting protocols proposed for CRNs is then provided
    in Section 4, followed by articulation of open research issues and future research
    directions in Section 5. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section 6. 2. Background:
    wireless multicasting Before coming to our focused topic of algorithms, techniques
    and protocols for multicasting in CRNs, it is important to establish some background
    in the broad area of wireless multicasting. In this section, we will introduce
    some basic multicasting terminology and concepts, multicasting goals, and challenges
    for efficient multicasting in CRNs in 2.1 Multicasting basics, 2.2 Multicasting
    goals, 2.3 Why multicasting in CRNs is challenging?, respectively. 2.1. Multicasting
    basics The basic components of a multicast routing framework include sources,
    receivers, and groups having straightforward interpretations. The originator of
    the data stream is called a ‘source’ while the end-user that wishes to receive
    the data stream is called a ‘receiver’. Receivers that share a common interest
    are pooled together in a multicast ‘group’. In multicast routing, the source is
    interested in transmitting its data stream to a group of hosts (Rosenberg, 2012).
    When there is a single receiver node, the routing problem is known as unicast
    routing which is typically solved by computing a shortest path between the source
    and the receiver. On the other extreme, the problem of transmitting the stream
    from the source to all the node in the network is known as broadcast routing or
    simply broadcasting. Multicasting subsumes unicasting and broadcasting as a special
    case, and addresses the problem of reaching a group of nodes that collectively
    represent the destination. To understand the various approaches that may be adopted
    to ensure packet delivery to a group of nodes, consider a simple example. Consider
    a multicasting example in which a source node s wishes to send a stream of bandwidth
    b to a group comprising g other network nodes. A rather inefficient approach of
    doing this, known as unicast replication, is to have s create g copies of the
    stream, i.e., a copy for each of the g receivers, and to send each of these copies
    towards its destination node amongst the g receivers using unicast. This approach
    is viable only when b and g are small and the intention is to avoid the overhead
    of implementing a multicast routing protocol. The disadvantage of using unicast
    replication is that there would be (unnecessarily) increased consumption of bandwidth
    and general network resources. For point-to-multipoint group communication, multicasting
    comes across as the most efficient manner of communication. Different from replicated
    unicast, if a node is transmitting to multiple receivers through the same downstream
    neighbor, only one transmission is used in multicasting thereby suppressing the
    unnecessary redundancy and overhead. The efficiency or gain of multicast in terms
    of network resource consumption compared to unicast has been studied in Van Mieghem
    et al. (2001). Moreover, multicast also avoids the inefficiency of broadcasting
    when only a group of nodes are intended receivers by sending data only to the
    interested nodes by creating multicast groups (Varshney, 2002). 2.1.1. Multicast
    group based classification The conception of multicast group is an essential part
    of the overall multicasting framework. A multicast group can be static or dynamic:
    in the former category, the group composition cannot be changed once decided,
    while the latter category allows members to be added or removed at any time. The
    task of routing is more challenging for the case of dynamic groups since it is
    not known in advance which nodes will be added or removed (Oliveira and Pardalos,
    2005). Multicast groups can also be classified according to the relative number
    of users: in sparse groups, the number of participants is small compared to the
    number of nodes in the network, while for pervasive or dense groups, most of the
    network nodes are engaged in multicast communication. Alternatively, groups can
    be classified on the basis of its openness: closed group allows only group member
    senders to send data, while in an open group the sender may or may not be a member.
    Finally, groups can be classified on the basis of their permanency: permanent
    groups are everlasting and exist longer than transient groups (Deering, 1988).
    2.1.2. Forwarding structure based classification Multicast protocols are broadly
    classified into the following two types. (1) Tree-based protocols: In graph-theoretic
    terminology, a tree on a graph is defined as a subgraph. Tree-based multicasting
    protocols work by constructing a tree on the overall connectivity graph which
    connects together the multicast group in an acyclic subgraph. In a tree structure,
    each node can reach any other node through a single path. Trees have been widely
    deployed in wired networks for establishing shortest path routing: with such a
    tree being called a shortest-path-tree (SPT). Although they ensure efficient data
    forwarding for wireless networks, they are problematic for unreliable wireless
    networks due to lack of robustness associated with the fragile tree structure.
    In case of a link failure, a tree has to be recomputed because there is no alternative
    path present. Trees are well-suited for networks with relatively static topology
    (such as wired networks, or wireless mesh networks to some extent), but are not
    as suited for dynamic topologies (such as mobile ad hoc networks or MANETs, and
    CRNs). Tree-based protocols can be further classified into source-based and shared-based
    tree protocols (Paul and Raghavan, 2002). There are fundamentally two distinct
    approaches to construction of multicasting trees: using (i) ‘shortest path trees’
    (SPTs), or (ii) minimum cost trees (MCTs). The former approach minimizes the distance
    of each receiver from the sender, while the latter approach aims to minimize the
    tree׳s overall edge cost (Nguyen, 2008). The Source-based approach works by constructing
    a SPT rooted at the source node. Since the source-based trees are custom built
    for each source, the receivers in the multicast tree typically receive excellent
    QoS (as the receivers are connected to the source via shortest paths) at the cost
    of the usage of extra network resources. The problem with source based trees is
    mainly in its lack of scalability to large networks. The Core-based approach,
    on the other hand, typically uses MCT algorithms such as the minimum Steiner trees
    (MSTs) to minimize the overall edge cost of the multicast tree. In the core-based
    tree (CBT) approach, a single tree is constructed for each group, regardless of
    the multicast source (Ballardie et al., 1993), to address the scalability problem
    faced by source-based trees. The core router receives all the messages as unicast
    transmission, and then forwards packets to all the ongoing interfaces of the tree
    except for the incoming one. CBT is able to conserve network bandwidth since it
    does not utilize flooding. The CBT is also able to scale to large networks since
    it utilizes a shared tree that has limited overhead. The drawback of a CBT approach
    is that since the tree is not customized to each source, the receivers will typically
    have non-optimal routes and QoS. (2) Mesh-based protocols improve upon the fragility
    of tree-based structures by allowing multiple paths to exist between the source
    and the receivers. Mesh-based protocols avoid recomputation of trees on the failure
    of a link (which may be due to node mobility or PU arrival) and can instead rely
    on alternate paths that are part of the original forwarding structure. This introduces
    some robustness to link failures making mesh-based protocols more suited to wireless
    networks with dynamic topologies and network conditions (such as MANETs and CRNs).
    The drawback of mesh-based protocols is the higher computational and message overhead
    involved with managing the forwarding structure (Sahasrabuddhe and Mukherjee,
    2000). 2.2. Multicasting goals In wireless networks, multicasting can have various
    performance goals. In particular, it is important to provide high quality of service
    (QoS), energy-efficient performance, and to ensure reliability and security. We
    discuss these performance goals next. Quality of Service (QoS): A number of popular
    applications, such as teleconferencing, distance learning, and file caching and
    dissemination, exploit multicast transmissions while requiring a certain minimum
    QoS for satisfactory performance. To support such applications, providing network
    support for scalable group-based applications with strict QoS requirements becomes
    essential. Various metrics (such as end-to-end delay, jitter, loss, and throughput)
    can be used to quantify the quality of service. The interested reader is referred
    to the survey (Striegel and Manimaran, 2002) for more details about the issues
    relating to QoS-based multicasting. Power consumption: In wireless networks, the
    choice of the transmitting power level is linked with a crucial tradeoff between
    the reach and interference of a particular transmission. If the transmit power
    is increased, more of the neighboring receivers can be reached in a single-hop.
    This, however, comes at the cost of increased interference to other neighboring
    nodes that are not the intended receivers (Wieselthier et al., 2000). In a CRN,
    the secondary nodes have to ensure that their transmissions do not interference
    with any PU. Another consideration impacting the choice of transmit power deals
    with node mobility as commonly mobile nodes have limited power resources thus
    motivating energy-efficient multicasting approaches. An efficient multicasting
    protocol must take into account all these issues. As an example work, Thomas et
    al. presented a cognitive energy efficient multicasting approach that increases
    the lifetime of a multicast flow by controlling the antenna directionality, transmission
    power, and routing tables of network nodes (Thomas et al., 2007). A comprehensive
    survey on energy efficient wireless multicasting protocols can be seen at Gupta
    and Wang (2005). Reliability and security: Ensuring reliability and security of
    multicast routing is complicated by the broadcast nature of wireless channels
    and the multicast group dynamics (through which nodes can join and leave groups
    at any time) (Akyildiz et al., 2006, Moyer et al., 1999). It has been pointed
    out in literature that ARQ-based mechanisms, which require ACKs to be sent in
    response to a valid received packet, do not scale well for multicasting and broadcasting
    applications. Ensuring reliability and security is an important goal for multicasting
    protocols in CRNs and must be carefully considered by protocol designers. 2.3.
    Why multicasting in CRNs is challenging? To fully exploit the benefits of multicasting
    in CRNs, it is important to surmount the considerable challenges that accompany
    it. Before describing the various CRN specific multicasting protocols proposed
    in literature in Section 4.3, we will describe the various challenges associated
    with multicasting in CRNs in this section. We will divide the challenges into
    general challenges of multicasting, challenges due to wireless networks and challenges
    imposed by the cognitive environment. 2.3.1. Challenges unique to multicasting
    Optimal solution to the problem of multicasting is considered difficult even in
    centralized conditions with distributed multicasting being correspondingly more
    difficult. For example, the problem of optimally packing Steiner trees to find
    maximum multicast flow is NP-hard (Hodgskiss, 2000). Another significant challenge
    is managing dynamic multicast groups which results in a highly dynamic topology
    which creates problem due to the need of recomputation of the multicast forwarding
    structure. It is desirable that the group dynamics should not affect the way data
    is delivered currently to members that remain in the group (Diot et al., 1997).
    Although, calculating an optimal multicast route is already a difficulty problem,
    maintaining route optimality after changes in the group and network complicates
    it further significantly (Diot et al., 1997). 2.3.2. Challenges due to the wireless
    medium Broadly speaking, there are three main challenges posed by wireless networks
    to the problem of efficient multicasting. We will discuss these next. (i) Wireless
    broadcast advantage: Unlike wireline networks, a transmission in wireless medium
    reaches all nodes in the transmission range simultaneously (assuming omnidirectional
    antennas). This is known as the ‘wireless broadcast advantage’ (WBA) or the ‘wireless
    multicast advantage’ (WMA) (Wieselthier et al., 2000). While exploiting WMA can
    result in lesser number of distinct transmissions than what would be required
    in an equivalent wired network, WMA is not really an advantage when it comes to
    devising polynomial-time optimal algorithms for multicasting. In contrast, the
    multicast ‘advantage’ makes the multicasting problem much harder. As an example,
    the minimum energy broadcast problem—which is tractable and is solved easily for
    wireline networks through various algorithms devised for calculating the minimum
    spanning tree (MST)—is NP-complete in the context of wireless networks (Liang,
    2002, Lun et al., 2005a). We reiterate here that the broadcasting problem is a
    special case of the multicasting problem (where the multicast group contains all
    the network nodes). This implies that the multicast problem is at least as complex
    the broadcast problem, thereby motivating interest in development of heuristic
    multicasting algorithms (Wieselthier et al., 2000). (ii) Interface diversity:
    Many wireless technologies can currently support provisioning of multiple radio
    interfaces on the same node. The use of multi-radio interfaces introduces ‘interface-diversity’
    which allows multiple simultaneous transmissions on a node through these multiple
    interfaces tuned to orthogonal channels. It has been shown in previous work that
    exploiting the radio diversity can significantly improve routing performance both
    in the case of unicast (Draves et al., 2004) and broadcast (Qadir et al., 2006a).
    (iii) Rate diversity: Another feature of modern wireless technology is the use
    of adaptive modulation to provide the ability to transmit at multiple link-layer
    transmission rates. As an example, IEEE 802.11b nodes support transmission at
    link-layer rates of 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbps. This ‘rate-diversity’ provides an extra
    degree-of-freedom that should be incorporated into the design of multicasting
    framework. Although it is commonly assumed that multicasting and broadcasting
    will only utilize the lowest link-layer rate for transmission (with which maximum
    neighboring nodes can be reached), previous work has shown the benefit of using
    rate-diversity in the choice of link-layer transmission rate for both multicast
    (Qadir et al., 2006b) and broadcast (Chou et al., 2006). 2.3.3. Challenges introduced
    by CRNs CRNs are very dynamic in nature. Topology changes in CRN depend upon the
    location and activity of the PUs. These frequent changes cause a number of problems
    for multicasting in CRNs compared to multicasting in traditional wireless networks.
    Channel heterogeneity is one such problem, where two neighboring nodes may not
    have a common channel available and they have to use different channels for multicasting.
    Thus as a result, a single multicast transmission is broken into many small unicast
    transmissions introducing significant switching delay. Achieving route stability
    is another problem, as CR transmissions need to be interrupted whenever a PU activity
    is detected. Routing algorithm should be capable of dealing with such changes
    and adapt accordingly. Interestingly, there has been work that has shown that
    the multicast capacity of the secondary network, as well as the primary network,
    can theoretically achieve the same performance bounds as if they were standalone
    networks (Wang et al., 2009). However, to achieve these performance bounds, the
    major challenges in multicasting in CRNs must be addressed. In the remainder of
    this section, we will describe four major challenges posed by CRNs: (i) PU dynamics:
    In CRNs, whenever a PU starts communicating in the vicinity of a SU, the SU is
    required to vacate the channel and instead look for another channel not occupied
    by the PU. Frequent PU arrivals can lead to a highly dynamic network due to the
    spectrum mobility associated with the PU dynamics which can cause frequent temporal
    connection losses for SUs thereby seriously impacting their performance. Therefore,
    deployment of multicasting becomes even more challenging with channel availability
    being dependent on both time and location (Almasaeid and Kamal, 2010). This results
    in different sets of idle channels available at various SUs, making transmission
    coordination extremely exigent. (ii) Channel diversity: In order to perform transmission
    coordination in CRNs, a common control channel (CCC) is commonly used for exchanging
    control information between SUs. The CCC design originates from multi-channel
    wireless networks, but when deployed in cognitive networks, it needs to address
    a number of additional challenges such as ensuring: robustness to PU activity,
    sufficient coverage of the CCC, and security of the CCC (Chachulski et al., 2007).
    Unless, there is a dedicated radio interface tuned to the CCC, the problem of
    ‘deafness’ can arise and lead to coordination problems. A detailed discussion
    of issues relating to the use of CCC in CRNs is provided in Lo (2011). (iii) Spectrum
    heterogeneity: The random and arbitrary nature of PU arrivals on various licensed
    channels can significantly complicate the problem of routing in CRNs. This implies
    that the spectrum available to a given SU is contingent on the activity of PUs
    at the given time in its range. The spectrum availability is likely to be dynamic
    (i.e., time-varying) and heterogeneous (i.e., not the same channels are available
    at all nodes) across the SUs in CRNs (Sengupta and Subbalakshmi, 2013). Also,
    unlike traditional wireless networks the channels used are typically from the
    same spectrum band, it is possible that CRNs are operating on heterogeneous channels
    from diverse spectrum bands having distinctly different transmission properties
    (Sengupta and Subbalakshmi, 2013). (iv) Spectrum opportunity: It has been shown
    in literature (Ren et al., 2009) that detecting spectrum opportunities is not
    equivalent to detecting PU signals. In particular, the existence of a spectrum
    opportunity requires that (i) the transmission of a SU transmitter is not ‘harmful’
    to PU receivers; (ii) the reception at the SU receiver is successful. Intuitively,
    a channel provides a spectrum opportunity to a pair of SUs if they can communicate
    successfully without violating the interference constraint (that ensures PU transmissions
    and receptions are not interfered with). This implies that ‘spectrum opportunity’
    defines an asymmetric1 concept local to a particular secondary transmitter and
    its receiver(s). Thus, the simple detection of a PU transmitter׳s signal does
    not necessarily imply that SUs must not access the spectrum since there may be
    no PU receivers in the vicinity of the SU transmitter. Another key takeaway is
    that spectrum opportunities depend on both transmitting and receiving activities
    of PUs. Moreover, the task of detecting spectrum depends also on (i) the transmission
    powers and (ii) the geographical locations of PUs and SUs. This has significant
    implications for the problem of multicast in CRNs. For example, if a SU uses high
    transmission power to reach a large group of receivers, it may have to wait longer
    to ensure that no PU receiver is active in the resulting larger interference region;
    on the other hand, transmitting with lower transmission power will reduce the
    chances of interrupting with PU reception but may result in more transmissions—each
    of which is now able to reach lesser number of receivers individually due to the
    reduced transmission power. This highlights the potential tradeoff associated
    with the ‘power diversity’ or the ability to transmit at different transmitting
    power. A similar tradeoff is associated with the ‘rate diversity’ of modern wireless
    networks in which a lower rate transmission has a larger reception area while
    higher rate transmissions can be decoded reliably in a shorter range. 3. Algorithms
    and techniques for wireless multicasting Various algorithms and encompassing techniques
    have been used in the design and analysis of wireless multicast. In particular,
    the techniques of the field of graph theory have been extensively applied to solve
    various routing problems in networking. In recent times, network coding has also
    emerged as an information theoretic framework that can be used to increase performance
    particularly for multicasting in wireless networks. With CRNs representing a network
    with very dynamic conditions, there is also interest in applying algorithms and
    techniques from optimization and decision theory to providing adaptive functionality.
    In this section, we survey the landscape of these algorithms and techniques of
    graph theory, network coding, and decision making frameworks such as optimization,
    machine-learning, and game theory in 3.1 Graph theory, 3.2 Network coding, 3.3
    Optimization, 3.4 Machine learning, 3.5 Game theory, respectively. 3.1. Graph
    theory Multicasting has been an active area of research for many decades and numerous
    techniques from graph theory have been proposed for the construction of multicast
    routes. In a classic paper, Diot et al. (1997) described the basic multicasting
    algorithms in three categories: source-tree based, center-tree based, and Steiner-tree
    based algorithms (Oliveira and Pardalos, 2005). These techniques are discussed
    next. 3.1.1. Source based algorithms For source-based routing, the routing tree
    created for each multicast group is rooted at the source node. Some implementations
    of this scheme utilize the reverse path forwarding (RPF) algorithm to ensure loop-free
    forwarding of multicast packets. The RPF algorithm has been shown to perform poorly
    for small multicast groups (Oliveira and Pardalos, 2005). Source based routing
    techniques can also utilize Steiner tree-based methods to focus on minimization
    of tree cost (Oliveira and Pardalos, 2005). 3.1.2. Center based algorithms In
    contrast to source-based routing, center-based tree, or the core-based tree (CBT),
    algorithms utilize single unique shared tree for all group communication regardless
    of the source. The center-based algorithms construct a tree rooted at a special
    root node known as the center node, or the core node, through which all the group
    communication is managed. The center node is computed to have some special properties
    such as being the closest to all other nodes (Oliveira and Pardalos, 2005). Contrary
    to shortest-path-trees (SPT) used for source-based trees, the path between two
    group members in a CBT is not guaranteed to be the shortest. Furthermore, calculating
    the center node is a hard problem, although approximations have been proposed
    (Oliveira and Pardalos, 2005). 3.1.3. Steiner tree based algorithms A Steiner
    tree is a tree that interconnects a particular subset of the vertex set with minimum
    aggregate cost. While the Steiner problem for connecting a source with a multicast
    group apparently looks identical to the minimum-spanning-tree problem involving
    the same set of nodes, the difference is that the Steiner tree can incorporate
    other non-multicast-group vertices (the so-called Steiner points) and edges to
    produce the shortest interconnect between the source and the multicast group.
    The Steiner tree is well-known to be a computationally complex problem and has
    been shown to be NP-complete (Winter, 1987). Also, since the edges are undirected,
    it is applicable only if we assume symmetric links. Another inefficiency is that
    it is a monolithic algorithm. Unlike incremental algorithms, monolithic algorithms
    have to be run every time there is a change in topology or costs. Although, it
    is aimed at a centralized computation, heuristic implementation can be distributed
    (Diot et al., 1997, Bezenšek and Robič, 2013). Due to its complexity, a lot of
    attention has focused on deriving approximate solutions to this problem (Takahashi
    and Matsuyama, 1980, Waxman, 1988, Hauptmann and Karpinski, 2013). The problem
    of routing with static multicast groups in wired networks is often formulated
    as a Steiner tree problem (Oliveira and Pardalos, 2005). In a wired network, multicast
    packets are transmitted over the tree edges independently (i.e., each outgoing
    link requires an independent transmission). Thus, the Steiner tree (which minimizes
    the overall aggregate cost of all the tree׳s independent links) is an adequate
    model for wired multicast. Extension of Steiner trees to wireless networks: Due
    to its characteristic WBA, the wireless multicasting problem is significantly
    different from the traditional multicasting problem in wired networks, and the
    wired multicasting approaches cannot be directly applied to wireless networks.
    For wireless multicasting, the Steiner connected dominated set (SCDS) model has
    been proposed as a viable approach (Torkestani and Meybodi, 2011). The minimum
    SCDS problem was first proposed as a generalization of the well-known concept
    of a connected dominating set (CDS) by Guha and Khuller (1998), and was applied
    to the problem of multicast in ad hoc networks by Ya-feng et al. (2004). 3.2.
    Network coding While routing was long viewed as the only primitive available for
    successfully operating multi-hop networks, it has been discovered that allowing
    intermediate nodes to diversify beyond the simple primitive of store-and-forward
    routing can actually improve performance. This discovery was first articulated
    in the seminal work of Ahlswede et al. (2000). This paradigm, known as network
    coding (NC), equips intermediate nodes with the ability of combining incoming
    packets and applying algebraic operations on received data before forwarding.
    The receiving node is then presented with a set of network coded packets as well
    as the information required for retrieving the original information. Network coding
    is considered a very attractive alternative to routing in settings like application-layer
    overlay networks and multi-hop wireless networks (Lun et al., 2006). To develop
    an intuition for how network coding works, we refer the reader to Fig. 1 representing
    a simple wireless network in which two nodes X and Y are connected through an
    access-point (AP).2 Both the end nodes X and Y intend to send their packets, named
    x and y respectively, to the other node. In the traditional approach, this will
    require four transmissions as shown in Fig. 1. NC-based approach, however, exploits
    the WBA to suppress an extra transmission by transmitting a single coded packet
    (determined through an XOR operation on X and Y). Due to the WBA, this packet
    is received by both the nodes X and Y, and since these nodes already known their
    own respective packet contents, they can easily recover the other packet. While
    we have used XOR operation as the coding choice at intermediate node for ease
    of exposition, in general, more elaborate algebraic coding operations (e.g., linear
    network coding) can be used to recombine several input packets into one or more
    output packets (Fragouli et al., 2006). Intuitively, NC improves network efficiency
    through extra computation at the end nodes. This tradeoff is appealing due to
    the increasing need of efficient network bandwidth and since processing continues
    to become cheaper and powerful riding Moore׳s law. Download : Download full-size

    It can be seen that even in this simple wireless networking topology of two nodes
    X and Y interconnected through an access point AP that the NC-based approach can
    reduce a transmission, and thereby avoid wastage of bandwidth, by exploiting WBA.
    While NC was originally proposed for multicasting in a wireline setting, it turns
    out that wireless applications are even more suited to an NC scheme. This stems
    from the observation that NC naturally thrives when dealing with two characteristics
    of wireless links (its unreliability and its broadcast nature) that complicate
    the wireless routing problem (Deb et al., 2005, Lun et al., 2005a). Interestingly,
    NC is useful for multicasting application both in lossless and lossy wireless
    settings (Lun et al., 2005a). It was shown that for lossless networks (i.e., idealized
    networks with broadcast links that are effectively lossless), NC can achieve the
    maximum possible multicast rate. Since NC allows joint use of network resources
    by multiple sink nodes, any rate possible for all sinks individually is simultaneously
    achievable for all sinks together (Ho and Lun, 2008). In lossless setting, the
    main utility of NC over routing is for multicast, while for single unicast sessions,
    NC provides no extra benefit. For lossy networks, NC, particular random linear
    NC, provides better performance than routing for both single unicast and multicast
    sessions (Lun et al., 2005a). It has been shown that for a given coding subgraph,
    random linear NC achieves the capacity of a single connection (unicast or multicast,
    Ho and Lun, 2008). NC can be categorized into the following two main types: 1.
    Intra-session NC considers network coding for a single communication session of
    either unicast communication to a single sink node or multicast communication
    with multiple sink nodes. Our discussion up to now has focused on intra-session
    NC. Since in intra-session NC, the same set of sink nodes are decoding all coded
    packets, it suffices for each node to generate outputs through linear combinations
    of its inputs. The receiver can successfully decode the packets once it has received
    enough independent linear combinations of the source processes. Intra-session
    NC is well-understood with the maximum achievable multicast rate being characterized
    by the min-cut max-flow theorem (Ahlswede et al., 2000). The throughput benefits
    of intra-session NC are available only for multicast and vanish for the case of
    unicast. It has been shown that linear codes are sufficient for achieving maximum
    bounds for multicast traffic (Li et al., 2003) with polynomial-time linear encoding
    and decoding algorithms being available (Koetter and Médard, 2003). Also, randomized
    NC algorithms focusing on multicast have been proposed (Ho et al., 2003). 2. Inter-session
    NC (i.e., coding amongst information symbols of different sessions) is needed
    in general for achieving optimal rates when multiple sessions share the network.
    Inter-session admits throughput benefits for the cases of both unicast and multicast,
    with these benefits readily visible in two special kinds of network topologies:
    those having ‘butterfly’ substructure or a ‘wireless cross’ topology (Khreishah
    et al., 2009) (similar to the topology used in Fig. 1). Inter-session NC is typically
    more complicated than intra-session NV requiring strategic coding so that each
    sink may be able to decode its desired source processes. Another complication
    is that in inter-session NC, decoding may be required at non-sink nodes unlike
    the case of intra-session NC. Presently, it is not yet completely known how to
    construct optimal network codes for multi-session network problems, although some
    work has been done in this direction (Ho et al., 2006). The most well-known utility
    of NC is increase in throughput. Ahlswede et al. (2000) demonstrated an increase
    in throughput for the problem of multicast in a wireline network. This observation
    holds even more true for the same problem in wireless settings, where NC provides
    a pronounced advantage and yields a throughput advantage over routing (Ho and
    Lun, 2008). Another important utility of NC is that it provides improved robustness
    implying loss resilience and facilitation in the design of localized distributed
    algorithms that can perform well even with partial information (Fragouli et al.,
    2006). While, erasure channel coding is traditionally performed at the source
    node, it has been shown that NC is useful in combating against packet losses leading
    to improved error resilience (Ho and Lun, 2008). Finally, NC often leads to less
    complex solutions as compared to the routing approach. 3.3. Optimization Optimization
    theory is a richly developed theory comprising tools and techniques for determining
    ‘optimal’ decisions in scenarios which may also incorporate certain constraints
    (Keshav, 2012, Hillier and Lieberman, 2001). Formally, a mathematical optimization
    problem has the following form: (1) Here the vector is called the optimization
    variable, and the function ( ) of the optimization variable, that we have the
    objective of minimizing, is known as the objective function. The functions , i=1,
    …, m are the (inequality) constraint functions, and the constants , …, are the
    limits, or bounds, for the constraints. A vector ⁎ ‘solves’ the optimization problem,
    or is deemed optimal, if it has the smallest objective function value among all
    vectors that satisfy the constraints defined. There are many classes of optimization
    problems generally characterized on the basis of the form of the objective and
    the constraint functions. In particular, for linear program (which we will study
    in Section 3.3.1), the objective function f0 and the m constraint functions are
    all linear, i.e., . If the optimization problem is not linear, it is called a
    nonlinear optimization problem. The class of convex optimization (which we shall
    study in Section 3.3.3), which includes linear optimization as a special case,
    the objective function f0 and the m constraint functions are all convex, i.e.,
    . Due to the inequality in the preceding constraint function, convex programming
    can be of both linear and nonlinear types. An important characteristic of an optimization
    problem is its discrete or continuous nature. Typically, continuous optimization
    problems either have no constraints or have constraints of a continuous character
    comprising equations and inequalities. In problems of discrete optimization, also
    called combinatorial optimization, either the constraint set is finite or it has
    a discrete nature. Informally speaking, combinatorial algorithms are techniques
    for high speed manipulation of combinatorial objects such as permutations, graphs,
    and networks (Knuth, 2006, Papadimitriou and Steiglitz, 1998). Common applications
    of combinatorial optimization include scheduling, assignment, route planning,
    and set covering. We will find extensive use of combinatorial optimization in
    multicasting (Leggieri, 2009). Two important combinatorial optimization techniques,
    which are extensively used in multicasting literature, are linear programming
    (covered in Section 3.3.1) and integer programming (covered in Section 3.3.2).
    Linear programming is a problem of combinatorial optimization according to its
    fundamental theorem, while integer programming is a combinatorial technique in
    which optimization variables can only adopt discrete integer values (Papadimitriou
    and Steiglitz, 1998). Optimization problems come in two main varieties if we consider
    the complexity of the optimization problem. Firstly, there are some ‘easy’ problems
    that can be solved in time bounded by a polynomial in the input length n, and
    secondly, a larger class of ‘hard’ problems for which no polynomial time algorithm
    exists and all known algorithms require time exponential in n in the worst-case
    (Fisher, 2004). If a problem has a linear objective function and linear constraints,
    the problem is considered easy to solve and linear programming (discussed in Section
    3.3.1) can be used to solve it (even for very large sized problems). For many
    practical problems, the objective function or the constraints are not linear,
    and the resulting problem is hard to solve in a time-efficient manner. We will
    discuss various approaches that can be used to tackle such hard nonlinear optimization
    problems later on. Deriving a solution to an optimization problem typically entails
    seeking an optimal solution (if the problem is tractable or is a small-scale NP
    problem), or an approximation solution with some qualification of its quality
    in comparison with the optimal, or aiming for heuristic if even an approximate
    solution is difficult to obtain. In case of multiple objective functions, one
    way of defining efficiency of solution is through Pareto optimality which captures
    the tradeoff between the multiple objective functions by choosing an operating
    point where further improvement in any objective function cannot be made except
    through deterioration in some other objective function׳s value. 3.3.1. Linear
    programming Linear programming (LP)3 is one of the biggest success stories of
    ‘optimization theory’. LP techniques have been exploited by generations of practitioners
    to solve practical problems in a diverse set of fields such as engineering, economics
    and finance (Hillier and Lieberman, 2001, Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis, 1997). LP
    is commonly applied in these fields to realize optimal logistical planning and
    scheduling. An application area of LP, much closer to our subject, is in network
    optimization. Typical network optimization problems, that may be formulated as
    linear programming problems, are the shortest path problem, the min-cut max-flow
    problem, and the minimum cost-flow problem (Ahuja et al., 1993). Various highly
    efficient solutions have been devised that exploit the special structure found
    in minimum cost network flow problems. This structure allows radical simplification
    to the standard Simplex solution method of LP and allows even large-scale optimization
    problems to be solved very efficiently. The foundation of these procedures can
    be seen in a specialized field of optimization that caters to network flow problems
    (Ford and Fulkerson, 2010, Ahuja et al., 1993). 3.3.2. Integer programming In
    many optimization problems, it only makes sense for certain optimization variables
    to take on integer values (e.g., number of packets, flows, generally make sense
    for integral values only). When all the optimization variables must take only
    integer values, the optimization model is known as integer programming (IP). In
    general, IP problems can belong to either of the linear or the nonlinear class.
    If an IP belongs to the linear class, i.e., its objective and constraint functions
    are both linear, the class of model is referred to as integer linear programming
    or ILP. If in an optimization model, certain optimization variables can only take
    on integer values while other can take real values, the class of optimization
    model is known as mixed integer programming (MIP) model. The relationship of IP
    with other classes of optimization is depicted graphically in Fig. 2. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Relationship between various optimization approaches.
    Convexity is the ‘watershed’ between tractable and intractable problems. Linear
    programs generally have polynomial-time solutions while integer programs have
    no known polynomial-time solutions as they belong to the class of NP-complete
    problems. While LP problems generally entertain polynomial-time solutions, IP
    programs are more complex to solve and typically are in the class of non-deterministic
    polynomial-time (NP). Since IP problems are computationally intractable (i.e.,
    they are NP-complete or NP-hard), various relaxation techniques have been used
    for producing approximate solutions. IP models can be solved more efficiently
    if the problem has network substructure in which case Lagrangian relaxation can
    be used to decompose the IP. Other solution concepts for IP include branch-and-bound
    and branch-and-cut. The most common relaxation method used for solving IP is the
    linear programming relaxation though the restriction of optimization variables
    taking integer values is relaxed. IP techniques are useful in communication networks
    for synthesis, assignment and scheduling problems (Resende and Pardalos, 2006).
    The objective in a synthesis problem is to find an optimal allocation of resources
    to edges of a complete graph such that all demands, and other requirements of
    the problem, are met (Resende and Pardalos, 2006). An example of a synthesis problem
    is ensuring that the transmission demands are met even in the event of a node
    or link failure. IP techniques are also commonly used for solving a wide variety
    of assignment and scheduling problems (Resende and Pardalos, 2006). Since allocation
    often does not entertain a fractional solution, IP formulation arises as a natural
    candidate optimization model. Example applications include: (i) channel assignment
    problem which assigns channels to the various nodes and their interfaces, and
    (ii) allocating discrete time slots to job requests. 3.3.3. Convex optimization
    Although, earlier it was thought that all nonlinear problems are intractable,
    it has been shown now that convexity defines the demarcation, or the ‘watershed’,
    between tractable and intractable problems (Chiang et al., 2007). This insight,
    along with the invention of efficient methods for solving convex optimization
    problems, marks the biggest progress in the field of optimization theory since
    the formulation of linear programming and invention of the simplex algorithm.
    So much so that it can be said that successfully formulating a practical problem
    as a convex optimization problem is as good as solving the problem (Boyd and Vandenberghe,
    2004). Interest in convex optimization has been reinvigorated by a few important
    recent discoveries. It has been shown that interior-points methods developed for
    solving linear programming problems are useful for solving a broader much wider
    class of convex optimization problems as well. Secondly, it is now realized that
    convex optimization problems (beyond least-square and linear optimization problems)
    are much more prevalent than previously thought (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004).
    Convex optimization subsumes least-square, linear-optimization, conic programming
    (Nemirovski, 2006), and geometric programming (Chiang, 2005) classes of optimization
    (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004). 3.3.4. Dynamic programming Dynamic programming
    (DP) is a powerful optimization technique applicable when a problem can be decomposed
    into subproblems such that the optimal solution to the original problem is a composition
    of the optimal solutions to each subproblem. (This is also called the optimal
    substructure of the problem.) The technique proceeds by decomposing the problem
    into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem recursively, and then aggregating
    the solutions to obtain the final answer. DP is applicable where the problem can
    be divided into smaller problems that are easily solved and when the program has
    the optimal substructure which allows coalescing the smaller solutions into a
    solution of the overall problem. It is critical for DP that the recursion does
    not result in a proliferation of subproblems (Keshav, 2012). The term ‘dynamic
    programming’ was used by Richard Bellman in the 1940s in his mathematical study
    of sequential multi-stage decision processes in which it is desired to make an
    ‘optimal’ decision one stage after another. The term ‘dynamic’ in ‘dynamic programming’
    refers to the temporal aspect of multi-stage decision making while ‘programming’
    refers to optimization. Naively, one would assume that an optimal decision should
    require considering the set of all feasible policies, and then choosing the policy
    which provides the maximum return. This brute-force approach does not work except
    for trivial toy problems and is grossly inadequate for processes involving even
    a moderate number of stages and actions. The excessive dimensionality of such
    brute-force enumeration based approach results from trying to incorporate too
    much information into the framework. The basic idea of the theory of DP is refreshingly
    simple. It proposes that ‘optimal policy’ should be viewed as determining the
    decision required at each time in terms of the current state of the system. This
    is known as the principle of optimality which is based on the insight that the
    remaining decisions in DP must constitute an optimal policy π for the continuation
    process treating the current state as starting input regardless of the initial
    states and decisions. Using this principle, the optimal policy can be computed
    through backward induction starting at the terminal point. Since DP proceeds by
    breaking down a complex problem into smaller subproblems, it is important for
    time-efficiency that each subproblem is solved only once. In many DP problems,
    it turns out that the repeating subproblems grow exponentially as a function of
    the size of the input. DP solves this problem by trading off space for time. In
    DP, the solution to a subproblem is stored, or ‘memoized’, and looked up when
    needed. DP combines the best of the methods of ‘greedy algorithms’ and ‘exhaustive
    search’ into an intelligent brute-force method that allows us to go through all
    the possible solutions to pick up the optimal solution in reasonable time. Application
    of DP in CRNs: DP, like most other optimization techniques, can only be used in
    CRNs when perfect knowledge about the system is available.4 In such a scenario,
    i.e., with a model of the environment available, the wireless environment is typically
    modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) which provides a mathematical framework
    for modeling sequential planning by an agent in stochastic situations, where the
    outcome does not follow deterministically from actions, as an ‘optimal control’
    problem in which the aim is to select actions that maximize some measure of long-term
    reward. DP techniques are widely used for solution of MDPs. 3.3.5. Nonlinear optimization
    We have earlier seen in the beginning of Section 3.3 that if any of the objective
    function (f0) or the m constraint functions ( ) is not linear, then the optimization
    problem is known as nonlinear optimization. For constrained non-integer linear
    optimization, or simply linear programming, it is well-known that the objective
    function has its maximum and minimum values at one of the vertices of the polytope
    defined by the intersection of the constraint planes. Since the extremal value
    of the objective function is guaranteed to be at a vertex of the polytope, linear
    programming can thus be easily solved through methods like the simplex algorithm.
    In nonlinear optimization, on the other hand, there is no such guarantee that
    the extremal value of the objective function will lie at a vertex of the polytope.
    In particular, the objective function may both increase and decrease as we walk
    along the contour line (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004), thereby making the optimization
    problem much more challenging. Since the technique of checking the vertices of
    the polytope of constraint planes is no longer sufficient, we need to resort to
    any of the large number of nonlinear optimization techniques proposed in literature
    (Keshav, 2012). Nonlinear optimization techniques fall into roughly into two categories
    (Keshav, 2012): (i) constrained nonlinear optimization, and (ii) heuristic nonlinear
    optimization. We discuss these two techniques in the next two subsections. 3.3.6.
    Constrained nonlinear optimization In constrained nonlinear optimization, when
    the objective function and the constraints are continuous and at least twice differentiable,
    there are two well-known techniques: (i) Lagrangian optimization, and (ii) Lagrangian
    optimization with the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. Lagrangian optimization:
    Lagrangian optimization is a method of constrained nonlinear optimization that
    computes the maximum or minimum of a function f of several variables subject to
    one or more constraint functions denoted gi. The method of Lagrange multipliers
    gives the set of necessary conditions to identify optimal points of equality constrained
    optimization problems. This is done by converting the original constrained problem
    to an equivalent unconstrained problem with the help of certain unspecified parameters
    known as Lagrange multipliers. As an example, consider that we wish to maximize
    subject to the constraint that . It is assumed that both these functions have
    continuous first partial derivatives. The Lagrange multiplier λ is used in the
    Lagrangian dual function L, or simply Lagrangian, in the following way: . The
    Lagrangian can be solved to recover the solution to the original constrained optimization
    problem (Bertsekas, 1982). Lagrange optimization is based on the two fundamental
    principles of duality and relaxation. 1. The duality principle implies that an
    optimization problem can be viewed from either from the perspective of the primal
    problem or the alternative perspective of the dual problem. The primal and dual
    problems are intimately linked with the solution of the dual problem informing
    about the solution of the primal problem. The optimal values of the primal and
    dual problems are not necessarily the same though, with the solution of the dual
    providing a lower bound (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004) to the solution of the primal
    problem. The difference between the solutions for the dual and the primal is known
    as the ‘duality gap’. This duality gap is zero under a constraint qualification
    condition for convex optimization problems which ensures ‘strong duality’. Thus,
    when the necessary condition is fulfilled, the value of an optimal solution to
    the primal problem establishing the immense utility of the duality principle.
    In summary, the main insight behind using duality is to bound or solve an optimization
    problem via a different optimization problem. 2. The Lagrangian relaxation idea
    is based on the intuition of conceptualize a ‘hard’ optimization problem (e.g.,
    MILP) as an ‘easy’ problem that is complicated by a relatively small number of
    complicating side constraints (Fisher, 2004). This idea proposes linking the original
    minimization problem, termed as the primal problem, with a complementary maximization
    problem, termed as the Lagrangian dual problem, which is often easier to solve
    as it readily presents decomposition possibilities. The basic intuition of Lagrange
    duality is to develop a relaxed version of the primal problem by transferring
    the complicating constraints to a modified objective function (known as the Lagrangian
    function or simply the Lagrangian) augmented with a weighted sum of the constraint
    functions in which the weighting term, representing the (Lagrangian multipliers),
    is used to penalize in proportion to the amount of violation of the dualized constraints.
    The Lagrange dual is obtained by minimizing the Lagrangian function with respect
    to the primal variable. Interestingly, solving the Lagrange dual is always a convex
    optimization problem, even when the primal problem is not. The solution of the
    Lagrange dual is either the lower bound for the primal solution (for weak duality)
    or the exact primal solution (if conditions of strong duality are fulfilled).
    Lagrangian optimization with KKT conditions: The Lagrangian method is applicable
    when the constraint function is limited to being equality constraints. Allowing
    inequality constraints, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) approach generalizes the
    Lagrange multiplier method to allow solutions to a broader class of nonlinear
    programming problems. Using the KKT conditions, it can be determined whether the
    stationary point of the auxiliary Lagrangian function is also a global minimum
    (Keshav, 2012). 3.3.7. Heuristic nonlinear optimization For the typical class
    of intractable problems, sometimes we are satisfied with heuristic or ‘good enough’
    solutions that provide reasonably good results most of the time. Amongst various
    heuristic solutions, we will discuss greedy algorithms, genetic algorithms, and
    ant colony optimization algorithms. Greedy algorithms: In a greedy algorithm,
    the basic building block of a complete feasible solution is a partial solution
    developed by ‘greedy’ that are based on whatever partial information is available
    at the time. These partial solutions are progressively developed to build a more
    complete solution until the iterations develop a complete feasible solution. The
    famous Dijkstra algorithm used for solving the shortest path tree (SPT) problem
    is an example greedy algorithm. Randomization is an important tool that can be
    exploited to avoid local minima׳s in search-based optimization problems. In particular,
    randomization is utilized by tools like simulated annealing. Another core idea
    adopted in some metaheuristic techniques like tabu-search is to use adaptive memory
    contrary to the approach adopted in memoryless approaches like simulated annealing.
    Metaheuristics also employ concepts of intensification (which encourages intensifying
    previous solutions found to perform well) and diversification (which encourages
    search to examine unvisited solutions). In some other fields (e.g., in genetic
    algorithms and reinforcement learning), the concepts of intensification and diversification
    are known by the terms exploitation and exploration, respectively. It is to be
    noted that exploitation and exploration, or alternatively, intensification and
    diversification, represent conflicting goals and therefore the dilemma of choosing
    one or the other needs to be resolved in a balanced fashion. There are various
    other metaheuristic techniques proposed in literature and the interested reader
    is referred to a book on this topic (Talbi, 2009) or the book chapter on this
    topic in Resende and Pardalos (2006). We discuss next two particular evolutionary
    algorithm metaheuristic algorithms: genetic algorithms and ant-colony optimization.
    Genetic algorithms: A genetic algorithm (GA) is a particular class of evolutionary
    algorithm which uses techniques inspired from evolutionary biology—such as inheritance,
    mutation, crossover, and natural selection—to improve the performance of a computational
    process. In every generation, multiple individuals are stochastically selected
    from the current population with fitter individuals more likely selections and
    are genetically modified (mutated or recombined) to form the next generation of
    the population. The usage of genetic operators and stochastic selection allow
    a gradual improvement in the ‘fitness’ of the solution and allow GAs to keep away
    from local optima. Ant colony optimization: While typical ‘shortest path’ routing
    protocols may have significant computational and message complexity, the humble
    biological ants, in a marvel of nature, are able to shortest routes to food sources
    in the dynamics of ant colony with extremely modest resources. There is interest
    in applying techniques from ant colony optimization (ACO) to problems in wireless
    networking to allow low complexity and high performance solutions. 3.4. Machine
    learning Machine learning is an interdisciplinary field that deals with learning
    systems and algorithms. It draws upon techniques and methods from a wide variety
    of fields such as statistics, information theory, artificial intelligence, optimization
    theory, control theory, and operations research (Russell et al., 1995). Russell
    et al. (1995) describe machine learning to be the ability to “adapt to new circumstances
    and to detect and extrapolate patterns”. Machine learning techniques have proven
    themselves to be of great practical utility in diverse domains such as pattern
    recognition, robotics, natural language processing, autonomous control systems.
    They are particularly useful in domains, like CRNs, where the agents must dynamically
    adapt to changing conditions. 3.4.1. Reinforcement learning The aim of an intelligent
    agent in reinforcement learning (RL) is to determine a policy, or a sequence of
    actions, that maps the state of an unknown stochastic environment to an optimal
    action plan. RL thus addresses the planning problem for unknown stochastic environments.
    For the case where the environment is stochastic but with a known model (i.e.,
    we have an unknown stochastic environment), the framework of Markov decision processes
    (MDPs) is used instead. RL techniques are widely used in CRNs, with their importance
    emanating from the specific relevance of RL techniques to CRN environment (which
    is highly dynamic, unpredictable, and generally unknown a priori). Since the environment
    RL agents work in are stochastic, the payoffs of actions are also not deterministic.
    The agent, therefore, has to balance two potentially conflicting considerations
    as it performs sequential decision making. On the one hand, it needs to explore
    all feasible actions and their consequences to determine which action returns
    the most value. Simultaneously, it is also desired to exploit the existing knowledge,
    attained through past experience, of favorable actions which received the most
    positive reinforcement. Most RL algorithms can be classified into being either
    model-free or model-based (Sutton and Barto, 1998). A model intuitively is an
    abstraction that an agent can use to predict how the environment will respond
    to its actions, i.e., given a state and the action performed therein by the agent,
    a model can predict the (expected) resultant next state and the accompanying reward.
    In the model-free approach, which are most applicable to CRNs with dynamic unknown
    conditions, the agent aims to directly determine the optimal policy by mapping
    environmental states to actions without constructing a MDP model of the environment.
    An example of a popular model-free RL technique is the Q-learning technique whose
    application to multicast routing in CRNs we will study next (Sutton and Barto,
    1998). Q-learning: Q-learning is a popular model-free RL technique with limited
    computational requirements that enables agents to learn how to act optimally in
    controlled Markovian domains. The implication of being model-free is that Q-learning
    does not explicitly model the reward transition probabilities of the underlying
    process. Q-learning proceeds instead by estimating the value of an action by compiled
    over experienced outcomes using the idea known as temporal-difference (TD) learning.
    TD learning combines ideas from Monte Carlo (MC) methods and dynamic programming
    (DP). Like MC methods, TD method is a simulation based model-free method that
    can learn directly from raw experience without a model of the environment׳s dynamics.
    Like dynamic programming, TD method used bootstrapping to update estimates based
    in part on other learned estimates. Q-learning proceeds by incrementally improving
    its evaluations of the Q-values that incorporate the quality of particular actions
    at particular states. The evaluation of the Q-values is done by learning the Q-function
    that gives the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state and
    following the optimal policy thereafter. Learning Automata (LA): LA is a RL technique
    that subscribes to the policy iteration paradigm of RL which, unlike other RL
    techniques, operates by directly manipulating the policy π (Nicopolitidis et al.,
    2011, Akbari Torkestani and Meybodi, 2010a, Akbari Torkestani and Meybodi, 2010b).
    A learning automaton is a finite state machine that attempts to learn the optimal
    action (that has the maximum probability to be rewarded) while interacting with
    a stochastic environment. The application of LA techniques for building adaptive
    protocols in CRNs is particularly appealing due to the natural simplicity of the
    LA approaches, and the general applicability of RL techniques to CRNs. Accordingly,
    LA has been used in the design of wireless MAC, routing and transport-layer protocols
    (Nicopolitidis et al., 2011). 3.5. Game theory Game theory is a mathematical framework
    which can be used to model interactive decision making between multiple decision
    making entities. Although, game theoretic models exist for both cooperative and
    non-cooperative settings, it is precisely the ability to model the competition
    between multiple agents which distinguishes game theory from optimization theory
    and optimal control-theoretic frameworks such as the MDP (Haykin, 2005). Game-theoretic
    analysis is relevant when the decision making is a result not only of environment,
    but also the decision of other ‘players’ (or decision makers). Game theory is
    popularly used in CRNs since each CR in a CRN interacts with a dynamic environment
    composed of other rational agents that sense, act, and learn while aiming to maximize
    personal utility. For games specific to CRNs, individual CRs typically represent
    the players, and the actions may include the choice of various system or design
    parameters such as the modulation scheme, transmit power level, and flow control
    parameter. In literature, there has been a lot of work in applying game-theoretic
    ideas to the design and analysis of general wireless networks (MacKenzie and DaSilva,
    2006) and CRNs (Wang et al., 2010). 4. Protocols used for wireless multicasting
    Multicast routing for wireless networks is an active area of research and various
    protocols have been proposed in literature. While our main focus in this paper
    is on the topic of multicasting in CRN, we will also highlight related work in
    multicasting which has focused on general multi-hop wireless networks since such
    networks share many common attributes with CRNs. In the remainder of this section,
    we will provide a metric based classification of multicasting protocols in Section
    4.1. 4.1. Metric based classification Multicasting protocols addressing various
    important metrics in wireless networks such as energy efficiency (Maric and Yates,
    2005), throughput (Zeng et al., 2007, Zeng et al., 2010, Ramamurthi et al., 2009),
    and delay (Hoang Lan and Uyen Trang, 2009, Isazadeh and Heydarian, 2010) have
    been proposed in literature. Since the major bulk of routing research in wireless
    network has focused on the development of unicast routing protocols, there is
    considerably more work done on routing metrics for unicast traffic in wireless
    networks. Since unicast and multicast routing are fundamentally different (in
    particular, multicast routing typically uses link-layer broadcast to exploit the
    WMA), there have been efforts to customize link-quality based unicast routing
    metrics (developed with the assumption of a single receiver) for application for
    multicast routing. As an example, Roy et al. have adapted various routing metrics
    that have been developed for constructing high-throughput unicast routing trees
    for use for multicast traffic (Roy et al., 2008). 4.2. Technique based classification
    4.2.1. Network coding based multicasting protocols As discussed in Section 3.2,
    network coding (NC) offers a promising technique to theoretically achieve multicast
    capacity throughput in wireless networks. It has been shown in literature that
    an NC based approach can lead to significant performance gains in practical wireless
    networks. For example, it has been shown empirically on a wireless testbed that
    a simple network coding based approach (that uses the XOR operation to combine
    packets) at the forwarding layer, without modifying higher layers including the
    routing layer, can increase network throughput for unicast traffic (Katti et al.,
    2006). Network coding can also be used to simplify computationally complex problems
    related to routing in wireless networks. As an example, the routing problem of
    constructing a Steiner multicast tree which selects a minimum-cost subgraph is
    computationally complex (i.e., it is in the NP-complete class) even in a centralized
    setting. The corresponding NC problem, however, is considerably less complex and
    can be solved through linear optimization with low-complexity distributed solutions
    (Ho and Lun, 2008). In work addressing multicast in wireless networks, it has
    been shown that the interaction between network coding and link-layer transmission
    rate diversity5 in multi-rate multi-hop wireless networks has been investigated
    by Vieira et al. (2013) where it was shown that network coding can be combined
    with multi-rate link layer broadcast to increase network throughput for multicast
    applications. There also has been work on using network coding for minimum-energy
    multicasting in wireless networks. It was discussed earlier (Section 2.3.2) than
    minimum-energy multicasting is an intractable problem if we consider a routing
    based solution since constructing the minimum-cost multicast tree in traditional
    routed networks requires solving the directed Steiner tree problem which is known
    to be NP-complete. However, the situation is not as bleak for NC based multicast
    solution as the problem of finding the minimum-cost multicast tree, when network
    coding is used, can be solved in polynomial time with a linear program. The results
    of this optimal NC-based solution greatly improve the results of non-NC-based
    routing heuristics (Lun et al., 2005a). Furthermore, the practical implementation
    of NC is eased as decentralized NC solutions exist crucially in wireless networks.
    The amenability of NC for decentralized implementation, more than the energy savings,
    arguably holds the most promise for improving the performance of wireless networks
    (Lun et al., 2005a). It is worth noting that NC based wireless multicasting protocols
    have been proposed for CRNs in literature. We will cover a few representative
    works later in Section 4.3.3. 4.2.2. Optimization-based multicasting protocols
    Various methods of optimization theory (which was introduced in Section 3.3) have
    been used for addressing multicasting problems in CRNs. In this section, we will
    survey the applications of these optimization methods. While considering optimization-based
    multicast work, it is important to note that different objectives can be considered
    for optimization such as path delay, total cost of the tree, and maximum congestion
    (Oliveira and Pardalos, 2005). Some important optimization problems that relate
    to multicast routing are the ‘the multicast network dimensioning problem’, and
    the ‘multicast packing problem’ (Oliveira and Pardalos, 2005). The problem of
    optimally packing Steiner trees to find maximum multicast flow is NP-hard (Hodgskiss,
    2000). This was shown in the context of single-radio single-channel multi-hop
    wireless network in Wan (2009) where it was shown that the ‘maximum multiflow’
    and the ‘maximum concurrent multiflow’ problems subject to bandwidth and interference
    constraints are NP-hard. A survey of optimization problems that are relevant to
    multicast tree construction is presented in Oliveira et al. (2006) and Oliveira
    and Pardalos (2005). The technique of dynamic programming (DP) has been extensively
    applied for the problem of routing in communication networks. In general, DP-based
    solutions are highly suited to problems that involve graph-theoretic problems
    involving rooted trees (Skiena, 1998) and famous routing algorithms—such as the
    Dijkstra algorithm and the Floyd–Warshall algorithm—are based on DP principles
    (Leiserson et al., 2001, Keshav, 2012). Various DP based multicasting solutions
    have been proposed in literature. Lun et al. formulated the problem of dynamic
    multicasting, which aimed at finding minimum-cost time-varying multicast subgraphs
    that provide continuous service to dynamic groups in wireless networks using NC
    within the framework of DP (Lun et al., 2005b). We have seen earlier in Section
    3.2 that minimum-cost multicast tree can be solved in the setting of NC with a
    linear program—however, such works have assumed a static multicast group setup
    that does not change with time. The dynamic multicasting problem is more challenging
    and DP techniques have been applied to this problem with some success in Lun et
    al. (2005b). In another DP-based work, Almasaeid et al. (2010) have considered
    the problems of broadcast deformation and channel switching delay while proposing
    a multicast algorithm for CRNs. The problem of broadcast deformation is very common
    in CRNs because of its dynamic environment due to the dependence of channel availability
    for SUs on channel occupancy of PUs due to which the available channel set for
    each may be different which can potentially deform a broadcast transmission into
    a few multicast transmissions or many unicast transmissions in the worst case
    scenario. With different channels at different users, the channel switching latency
    also contributes a switching delay. This study proposes algorithms to tackle the
    problem of channel heterogeneity and latency introduced due to the channel switching.
    The simulations show the better performance of proposed algorithms in terms of
    delay as compared to baseline algorithms. Integer programming (IP) has been popularly
    used for modeling the broadcast and multicast problems in wireless networks. We
    present a few representative examples of IP based wireless multicasting. Das et
    al. (2003) presented three different IP models for the optimal solution of minimum
    power broadcast/ multicast problem in wireless networks. The models assumed complete
    knowledge of distance and the network nodes are fixed. Oh and Lee (2013) have
    proposed MR2-ODMRP (an ODMRP inspired new multicasting protocol) which explores
    using new degrees of freedom (multiple transmission rates with multiple radios)
    to provide optimized multicasting performance. The optimization problem is modeled
    as an integer linear program (ILP) and the transmission rate for each node is
    computed to construct the optimal tree. The results show that MR2-ODMRP outperforms
    ODMRP in terms of end-to-end delay to produce near optimum results. In an optimization-based
    wireless multicasting work based in the context of CRNs, Shu et al. (2013) have
    jointly formulated the problem of multicast routing and channel allocation in
    CRNs as an MILP optimization problem with the objective of increasing throughput/
    session. A representative summary of optimization-based CRN multicasting works
    can be seen in Table 1. Table 1. Representative summary of the various protocols

    2012) Spanning tree Tree construction with minimum bandwidth consumption A QoS-satisfying
    multicast tree, with minimal bandwidth consumption, is constructed through a novel
    slot assignment algorithm The methods of Lagrangian relaxation and dual decomposition
    are popular techniques that are applied to a wide variety of optimization problems
    in wireless routing. In Yuan et al. (2006), the throughput maximization problem
    for multi-hop multicast is decomposed into two subproblems: firstly, a data routing
    subproblem at the network layer, and secondly, a power control subproblem at the
    PHY layer. The coordination between these subproblems is managed through a set
    of Lagrangian dual variables. In Chen et al. (2006), it is proposed that cross-layered
    design be performed systematically through the framework of ‘layering as optimization
    decomposition’ (Chiang et al., 2007) for time-varying channels. The resource allocation
    problem is broken down, through dual composition, into three subproblems of congestion
    control, routing and schedule which interact through the congestion price. A recent
    Lagrangian relaxation based wireless routing work can also been seen at Wen and
    Liao (2011). Cross layer optimization approach has been used for the problem of
    multicasting in CRNs in Hu et al. (2010) and Gao et al. (2011). In Hu et al. (2010),
    cross layer optimization approach is used to multicast data to the multimedia
    receivers while optimizing the received video quality. The proportional fairness
    among multicast receivers and interference minimization are also taken into account.
    A sequential fixing algorithm and a greedy algorithm is proposed in order to achieve
    the fairness and to minimize the interference while optimizing the video quality.
    Linear relaxation of the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is
    used by the fixing algorithm and the greedy algorithm makes use of the inherent
    priority structure of fine granularity structure video and ordering of user channels
    according to their qualities. To adjust the calculated solution according to updated
    channel sensing results, a less complex greedy algorithm is used. The results
    show that the proposed algorithms perform better than the baseline algorithms
    in terms of average peak to signal to noise ratio. In Gao et al. (2011), cross
    layer optimization approach is used with the purpose of reduction in the required
    network resources. A self-interference constraint protocol is proposed which assigns
    a frequency channel at each transmitter to at most one session of multicast. These
    frequency bands are assigned by using the self-interference constraint in which
    the receiving nodes are not allowed to receive simultaneously from two transmitters.
    In this way, interference is minimized. The purposed algorithm solutions are compared
    with the lower bound which show that the proposed solution provides near optimum
    values. Apart from optimization techniques, metaheuristic techniques have also
    been proposed for various routing problems in wireless networks particularly for
    multicasting. We will present next a brief sketch of some representative works
    that have used the frameworks of genetic algorithms (GA) (Roy and Das, 2004, Cheng
    and Yang, 2010), and ant-colony-optimization (ACO), respectively. Roy and Das
    (2004) have proposed ‘QoS-based mobile multicast routing protocol’ (QM2RP) which
    utilizes the framework of multi-objective genetic algorithms to optimize multiple
    QoS parameters such as end-to-end delay, bandwidth requirement and residual bandwidth
    utilization; the presented protocol is capable of discovering near-optimal multicast
    routes within few iterations even with imprecise network information. In another
    work, Cheng and Yang (2010) have proposed a GA based QoS multicasting protocol
    for MANETs. This work adapts to the dynamically changing topology of MANETs using
    GA. A lot of research effort has also focused on using ACO for imitating the performance
    of biological ants to produce optimized and efficient distributed routing behavior
    in wireless networks (Zhao et al., 2012, Di Caro et al., 2005, Shen et al., 2008).
    In particular, a few ant-colony-optimization based multicasting protocols have
    been proposed for wireless networks (Yi and Yan-chun, 2011). In Prasad and Lobiyal
    (2013), an ant colony optimization approach is proposed to tackle the minimum
    cost multicast tree with delay and bandwidth constraints problem. A niched ant
    colony optimization with colony guides (NACOg) algorithm is proposed to tackle
    the problem. The results show the better performance of the NACOg as compared
    to other algorithms in terms of finding the minimum cost QoS multicast tree. In
    another research (Alasaad et al., 2013), QoS multicasting performance in wireless
    mesh networks is studied over a ring routing topology. An algorithm is proposed
    for IP multicasting routing with the mesh routers supporting the group communication.
    The proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional schemes in terms of end to
    end delay and capacity of multicast networks. 4.2.3. RL based multicasting protocols
    In this section, we will discuss two RL based techniques that can be used for
    multicasting in wireless networks. We have already provided background on Q-learning
    and learning automata (LA) in Section 3.4.1. We will now describe their applications
    for the problem of routing in general, and for multicasting in CRNs in particular.
    Q-learning is arguably the most popular model-free reinforcement learning technique,
    and it has been applied to CRNs extensively (Bkassiny et al., 2013). It has also
    been applied in the setting of routing in communication networks. The ‘Q-routing’
    algorithm, proposed by Boyan in 1994 (Boyan and Littman, 1994), learned a routing
    policy that minimizes total delivery time through experimentation with different
    routing policies. Some desirable features of this approach were: (i) its learning
    is continual and online, (ii) it is robust in the face of dynamic network conditions,
    and (iii) it is distributed and uses local information only. This early paper
    established that adaptive routing is a natural domain for reinforcement learning
    and a lot of follow-up work has taken place (Kumar and Miikkulainen, 1997, Littman
    and Boyan, 2013). The technique of LA has been popularly used for constructing
    routing protocols for wireless networks. Torkestani et al. have proposed using
    LA for multicast routing in mobile ad hoc networks or MANETs6 to find routes with
    expected higher lifetimes through prediction of node mobility (Akbari Torkestani
    and Meybodi, 2010a). Another LA-based distributed broadcast solutions can be seen
    at Akbari Torkestani and Meybodi (2010b). In Jahanshahi et al. (2013), the problem
    of channel assignment and multicast routing in wireless mesh networks is solved
    jointly in the learning automata framework. The performance evaluation depicts
    that the proposed scheme LAMR (Learning Automata based Multicast Routing) outperforms
    the well known algorithms LCA (Level Channel Assignment) (Zeng et al., 2007) and
    MCM (Multi-Channel Multicast) (Zeng et al., 2010) in terms of packet delivery
    ratio, delay and throughput. In another study (Cheng and Yang, 2011), QoS multicast
    problem merged with the channel assignment problem in wireless networks is presented.
    The authors claim that the multicast tree construction and channel assignment
    problem have been solved separately. They propose three different algorithms for
    finding minimum interference multicast tree with efficient use of scarce network
    resources. 4.2.4. Game theory based multicasting protocols Routing in networks
    is a well-studied problem in algorithmic game theory both in a general network
    setting (e.g., of transportation networks) (Roughgarden, 2007) and also for Internet-like
    networks (Qiu et al., 2006). In particular, game theory has been used to analyze
    ‘selfish routing’, which can arise in distributed routing algorithms where each
    agent intends to optimize for itself, using ‘mechanism design’, sometimes called
    reverse game theory, which allows us to devise appropriate mechanisms for a game
    such that rational players interested in maximizing their personal utility will
    play into a desired equilibrium point (MacKenzie and DaSilva, 2006). In wireless
    networking, there is a strong interest in sharing the cost of multicasting, particularly
    of multimedia content, which incurs a significant cost to the network in terms
    of bandwidth and overall power consumption which has to be borne by the network
    nodes. It is usually desired to distribute this cost across various receivers
    by devising some cost-sharing mechanism. Considering non-cooperative scenarios,
    it is possible for nodes to cheat and thereby maximize their personal utility.
    In this context, game-theoretic analysis has been used to analyze cost-sharing
    mechanisms for multicasting in wireless networks. We will describe two such works
    in brief. Singh and Altman (2011) have studied the problem of sharing the cost
    of multicasting (assumed to be in terms of the transmission power) in a wireless
    network. The properties of various cost-sharing proposals are studied using game-theoretic
    analysis. Panda et al. (2012) have studied a wireless multicast cost sharing game
    in a population of dynamic users that arrive and depart randomly. The authors
    have characterized its equilibrium and have made observations on how to ensure
    equal cost sharing. 4.3. CRN specific multicast protocols We will now be presenting
    the solutions that have been proposed to address the challenges that are faced
    while deploying multicast in CRNs. We will discuss these solutions in categories
    of PU-aware resilient multicasting protocols, multicast scheduling protocols,
    and other general CRN multicasting protocols in 4.3.1 PU-aware resilient multicasting
    for CRNs, 4.3.2 Multicast scheduling protocols in CRNs, 4.3.3 Other CRN multicast
    protocols, respectively. A representative summary is also presented in Table 1.
    4.3.1. PU-aware resilient multicasting for CRNs There is great interest in developing
    PU-aware resilient routing protocols for CRNs to counter the ability of PUs to
    disrupt communications of SUs in CRNs. Due to the importance of maintaining uninterrupted
    communication sessions in CRNs, Mao and Li (2011) have proposed a backup path
    based approach which proposes to switch traffic flow to the backup path in the
    case of PU activity on the working path. The problem of selecting the backup path
    is formulated as an integer programming problem. The switching of traffic to the
    backup path is triggered by statistical rules based on Bayesian decision framework.
    The authors have demonstrated an approximate 50% reduction in average packet delay
    on a multi-hop CRN experimental testbed involving PUs. While the work of Mao et
    al. is not particularly focused on supporting multicasting sessions with backup
    paths, there has been work that have applied the concept of backup paths to develop
    PU-aware resilient multicasting protocols (Alnabelsi and Kamal, 2013, Almasoud,
    2013). We will discuss them next. Alnabelsi and Kamal (2013) have proposed a resilient
    multicast routing framework in CRNs (that is robust to failures or disappearance
    of channels) based on the concept of multi-layer hypergraphs (MLHG). The CRN is
    modeled as a MLHG with each layer of the MLHG representing a different channel,
    and the group of SUs sharing a common channel modeled with a hyper-edge. While
    the primary paths from the source SU to the destination SUs are selected considering
    the channel-switching and transmission delay, a backup path—which is, if feasible,
    ‘shared risk hyper edge group’ (SRHEG) disjoint with the primary path—is also
    computed to protect the multicast session. The authors have proposed an ILP model
    for determining the multicast primary and backup paths that minimizes the maximum
    path delay and minimizes the number of selected channel links. The authors present
    simulation results showing the feasibility of backup based multicasting and demonstrate
    that with increasing number of channels, the number of primary and backup paths
    that can be routed in CRNs also increases. Almasoud (2013) and Almasoud and Kamal
    (2014) have recently proposed mechanisms for PU-aware resilient multicasting which
    can protect against channel failures and disappearance. The overarching aim of
    this work is to provision multiple multicast sessions that are protected against
    PU induced spectrum interruptions while ensuring minimization of the cost of multicast
    sessions and maximization of number of accommodated multicast sessions. This work
    proposed three approaches for multicast session protection. In the first approach
    (protection without link-sharing), primary and backup multicast trees—which are
    ‘shared primary user risk group’ (SPURG) disjoint—are established for each multicast
    session that protects against one PU interruption at a time. The second approach
    (protection with link-sharing) generates primary and backup multicast trees like
    the first approach but allows backup trees increased sharing of resources (the
    backup trees can share some links in the primary tree of the same session, and
    also links in backup trees of any session) while limiting the number of links
    that can be shared within one or more sessions (to avoid the joint failure of
    primary and backup tree on the appearance of a certain PU). The third approach
    (protection with rings) generates for each multicast session a ring which starts
    and ends at the source node while passing through all the destination nodes. It
    is ensured that a path along any ring is SPURG disjoint from other paths along
    the same ring which results in each destination node receiving a copy of the multicast
    message even if a PU becomes active and causes one path along the ring to fail.
    It is shown that in general that the number of accommodated sessions in the network
    increases, and the cost of multicast sessions decreases, as available channels
    are increased or as the session size becomes smaller. The highest number of multicast
    sessions in the network can be supported with the link-sharing approach, while
    the ring-sharing approach generates multicast sessions with the least cost. 4.3.2.
    Multicast scheduling protocols in CRNs To cope with the channel heterogeneity
    problem in CRNs, multicast scheduling protocols have been proposed. Almasaeid
    and Kamal (2010) have proposed assisted multicast scheduling to reduce the end
    to end multicast delay in a single cell of cognitive mesh networks. The proposed
    scheme uses three operations of assisting, overhearing and codeword exchange.
    The assistance operation allows the multicast receivers to assist in the process
    of multicasting and to forward the data to the other receivers too. Overhearing
    introduces the assistance between two different multicast groups. This happens
    when some nodes belonging to a group overhears a transmission intended for another
    group. After overhearing, these nodes can now forward the data intended for the
    other group. Codeword exchange is also introduced to assist the multicast scheduling
    by using coded packets. The intended multicast receivers can decode and extract
    their data easily. These three operations help in reduction of total multicast
    time. The results show the better performance of assisted multicasting in terms
    of throughput and total multicast time. It is shown that when no assistance is
    used, the sender uses six slots to transmit data intended for the multicast receivers.
    When intra-group assistance is allowed through assistance operation, the number
    of time slots required to transmit data reduces to five. Furthermore, when the
    overhearing operation is enabled and inter group assistance is allowed, the number
    of slots reduce to four. Finally, the number of slots used to transmit data reduce
    to three when network coding is used and coded packets are exchanged. In their
    recent work, Almasaeid et al. have addressed the problem of assisted multicast
    scheduling in cognitive wireless mesh networks (Almasaeid and Kamal, 2013), and
    have proposed two approaches for cooperative multicasting: the first depending
    on the assistance of multicast receivers in delivering multicast data to other
    receivers, while the second is network-coding based. In another study (Jin et
    al., 2010), a greedy scheduling protocol is proposed to optimize the overall performance
    of the network. In this work, fairness among users is also considered along with
    the efficient utilization of spectrum. A cooperative transmission link is allocated
    with at most one channel so that more cognitive users are encouraged to participate
    in the cooperative communication. They have also adopted the network coding so
    that the overhead can be reduced and better error control can be performed. The
    problem is formulated as nonlinear integer program and an online scheduling protocol
    is introduced for channel allocation and power control policies. The proposed
    protocol allocates channels to the links according to a distributed algorithm
    which is claimed to be a good operator in realistic systems. 4.3.3. Other CRN
    multicast protocols Some CRN-specific multicast routing protocols have recently
    been proposed. In Kim et al. (2009), the authors have proposed a multicast routing
    protocol for CR-equipped MANETs to alleviate the scalability issues associated
    with the well known multicasting protocol ODMRP (Lee et al., 2002). All the nodes
    are considered mobile with a single radio per node and multiple channels are available
    in the network. CoCast works in similar fashion as ODMRP works but the difference
    lies in construction of tree and mesh. The ODMRP constructs a mesh so that alternative
    paths can be used upon the breakage of routes. In contrast to ODMRP, CoCast constructs
    a tree which is different from mesh in terms of alternative paths and reduces
    the route overhead. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm CoCast
    performs better when number of multicast sources increase in the network. The
    proposed algorithm is more scalable as compared to the ODMRP. NC based protocols
    have also been proposed for use in CRNs. Jin et al. (2010) have proposed an optimization
    framework for multicast scheduling incorporating cooperative techniques and NC
    to optimize the overall performance of CRNs. This work uses NC to reduce overhead,
    and perform error control and recovery. In particular, NC is used to address the
    challenging task of scheduling transmissions in a cooperative fashion without
    too much overhead (which will be associated with the naive approach of SUs blindly
    pushing packets not useful to other SUs). This paper also NC based multicast scheduling
    protocols based on centralized greedy optimization and stochastic Lyapunov optimization
    with the authors present analysis as well as simulation results to demonstrate
    significant improvement in the multicast performance in CRNs. In another work,
    Kim et al. (2012) have proposed NC-based wireless multicast in cognitive vehicular
    networks working in the ISM band. The considered problem is challenging due to
    the problem of interference from residential WiFi users also utilizing the ISM
    band. This work remodels the existing CoCast protocol (Kim et al., 2012) proposed
    for multicasting in CRNs for the considered environment to improve reliability
    of multicast communication by incorporating NC. The problem of multicasting in
    CRNs has also been studied as a minimum energy multicast (MEM) tree construction
    problem (Ren et al., 2009). The purpose is to save the overall energy used in
    the construction of a multicast tree. Apart from the energy consumed in tree construction,
    energy is also consumed in spectrum sensing, which must be also taken into the
    account. In this work, spectrum opportunities are considered to be determined
    not only by PU transmissions but also by the transmission power of the SUs and
    the traffic load of the PUs (as explained earlier in Section 2.3.3). Thus there
    is a need of an adaptive MEM tree since the MEM tree under high primary traffic
    load may not be optimal for low primary traffic load and vice versa. It is shown
    in this paper that the MEM problem is equivalent to the problem of computing the
    direct Steiner tree rooted at the source. The authors propose an approximate algorithm
    for constructing the MEM tree in CRNs while taking into account the impact of
    the spectrum opportunities. The presented approximation algorithm for the MEM
    tree relies on the approximation algorithm for the directed Steiner problem (Charikar
    et al., 1999) and is adaptive to the traffic load of the primary network. The
    results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the baseline approximation
    algorithm (Liang, 2006) (proposed for the traditional networks) in terms of average
    energy saving under different traffic load of the primary network. The better
    performance is explained by the fact that the baseline approximation algorithm
    treats the secondary network just like the primary network and constructs a undirected
    node-weighted multicast tree that is invariant to the primary traffic load while
    the proposed approximation algorithm, on the other hand, constructs a directed
    Steiner tree that also incorporates the sensing energy to produce multicast trees
    that adapt to the primary traffic load. Apart from the works addressing the MEM
    problem, a protocol has also been proposed for construction of a tree with ‘minimum
    multicast bandwidth consumption’ (Xie et al., 2012) in ad hoc CRNs. Two methods
    have been proposed in this study for minimum bandwidth tree construction. The
    first methods construct the minimal spanning tree first and then slot assignment
    is done through a proposed algorithm, whereas the second approach considers these
    two problems of minimal spanning tree construction and slot assignment jointly
    in such a way that overall bandwidth consumption is minimized. The metrics used
    for the evaluation of proposed algorithm are transmission of slots and success
    rate and these metrics show the better performance of the algorithm over the baseline
    algorithms. A study in Matam and Tripathy (2013) solves the problem of multicasting
    in wireless networks with the objective of bandwidth conservation. A protocol
    has been proposed which computes the multicast trees with minimum bandwidth consumption
    through a heuristic approach. The performance evaluation shows that even in the
    worst case scenarios, the proposed algorithm works better compared to other baseline
    algorithms. 5. Open research issues and future directions 5.1. Incorporation of
    AI into multicast frameworks Since CRNs often have to operate in dynamic unpredictable
    and unknown environments, it is important to integrate AI-based techniques seamless
    into the core of the routing framework. The design of ‘cognitive multicasting
    protocols’ that can intelligently adapt to changing network conditions is an important,
    and yet unexplored, area of research. The interested reader is referred to a detailed
    tutorial and survey on the topic of AI-based cognitive routing protocols for CRNs
    (Qadir, 2013). 5.2. Building reliable multicast routing protocols The ARQ scheme
    adopted in unicast reliable end-to-end protocol is not suited to multicast since
    it requires every packet, or a group of packets, to be ACK׳ed by the receiver.
    Using a negative acknowledgment mechanism (NACK) with a semantic of a retransmission
    request is better suited for multicast transmission (Diot et al., 1997). An approach
    for reliable multicast incorporating NACK that has been proposed in literature
    for WLANs (Kuri and Kasera, 2001) is to elect one of the multicast group members
    as the group ‘leader’ which acts as a group representative for the purpose of
    sending feedback to the multicast source about reliable packet reception. More
    research needs to be done on reliable wireless multicasting protocols for CRNs
    especially for highly dynamic and error-prone environments. 5.3. Incorporation
    of spectrum modeling The multicast routing framework should incorporate spectrum
    modeling into its basic design. One way is to probabilistically model the PU arrival
    process and traffic pattern to avoid the channels that will be claimed by PU with
    a high probability. For example, a SU can exploit spectrum sensing data to select
    white spaces (that emerge due to the absence of PUs) that tend to be longer lived
    at a particular time of the day and a particular location. A number of techniques
    have been proposed for spectrum prediction including techniques that are: (i)
    Hidden Markov model based, (ii) Neural Networks based, (iii) Bayesian inference
    based (Xing et al., 2013). For more details about spectrum prediction techniques,
    the interested readers are referred to a detailed survey on this topic (Xing et
    al., 2013) and the references therein. 5.4. Incorporation of extra degrees of
    freedom A future research direction is incorporating extra degrees of freedom
    such as power control, link-layer rate diversity, interface diversity, and mobility
    seamlessly with techniques such as network coding, game theory, and optimization
    into the multicasting framework. More research is needed on the interplay of these
    degree of freedom in the setting of multicasting in CRNs. 6. Conclusion There
    has a lot of work on wireless multicasting. In particular, various algorithms
    for developing multicast forwarding structures have been proposed, and various
    techniques, including the frameworks of optimization theory, network coding, and
    heuristic techniques, have been used to improve multicast routing. Multicast protocols
    incorporate both techniques and algorithms to define the rules, syntax, and semantics
    of multicast communication. In this paper, we have presented a coherent account
    of the overall landscape of multicasting algorithms, techniques, and protocols
    that apply to multi-hop cognitive radio networks. In particular, we have presented
    both a self-contained tutorial of multicasting algorithms, techniques, and protocols
    that apply to CRNs along with and a detailed survey of their applications. We
    have also identified open research issues, and have identified promising directions
    for future work. References Ahlswede et al., 2000 R. Ahlswede, N. Cai, S.-Y. Li,

    20-1639. 1 A channel that is an opportunity for a particular transmitter and receiver
    may not be opportunity if the transmitter/ receiver roles are reversed. 2 While
    the advantage of NC over store-and-forward in wireless is often explained through
    the so-called ‘butterfly’ example (Yeung, 2008), we use a simple example adapted
    from Fragouli et al. (2006) and Katti et al. (2006) to highlight both the NC advantage
    in avoiding redundant transmissions and also how it utilizes the WBA. 3 The use
    of the ‘programming’ does not refer to computer programming, but is used in the
    sense of planning; this word is used in the same sense in mathematical programming,
    linear programming, and dynamic programming. 4 For the case where perfect knowledge
    is not known, machine-learning techniques like reinforcement learning are more
    appropriate. Such machine-learning techniques are covered later in Section 3.4.

    an important characteristic with CRNs in that both of them have highly dynamic
    topology. The dynamically changing topology in MANETs is due to node mobility
    while in CRNs it is due to PU arrivals. View Abstract Copyright © 2014 Elsevier

    7.1 Introduction In a traditional wireless communication system, frequency spectrum
    is statically allocated to licensed users (i.e., primary users) only. However,
    since licensed users may not always occupy the allocated radio spectrum, this
    static spectrum allocation results in spectrum underutilization. This was confirmed
    in a report from the FCC (Federal Communications Commission)1 where it was shown
    that even in a crowded area, more than half of the radio spectrum is not occupied
    at any given time. This, along with the increasing spectrum demand from emerging
    wireless applications, is driving the development of new spectrum allocation policies
    to allow unlicensed users (i.e., secondary users) to access radio spectrum when
    it is not occupied by primary users. These new spectrum allocation policies, which
    will be implemented through the cognitive radio technology, are expected to improve
    spectrum utilization while satisfying the spectrum demand for new wireless applications.

    access (DSA) and cognitive radio (CR) technology have been proposed as a novel
    technology to improve the spectrum utilization in wireless transmissions. However,
    in self-organized network such ad-hoc cognitive radio networks (AHCRNs), the CR
    nodes need change their transmission parameters, coordinate with other nodes in
    the network to achieve certain goals. Accordingly, challenges have been raised
    in applying the existing spectrum sharing approach to such environment. Instead,
    game theory has been adopted as an important mathematical tool in analyzing, and
    modeling the interaction processes in AHCRNs. In this survey, we introduce the
    concepts of modeling resource allocation (i.e., power and channel) in AHCRNs with
    game theory. Comparison between cooperative and non-cooperative game theory has
    been provided. Application of game theory in PHY, MAC and network layers has been
    outlined. Future directions in modeling cognitive radio with game theoretic approaches
    have been outlined as well. Published in: 2013 IEEE International Conference on

    Location: Melaka, Malaysia SECTION I. Introduction The thought of a cognitive
    radio (CR) has recently gained great concentration within the research area (see
    [1] for a comprehensive survey). “Cognitive Radio” is an intelligent wireless
    device that able to sense a wide range of available licensed spectrum for possible
    utilizing of the currently unused band (i.e., spectrum hole) by the primary user
    (PUs) [1]. Resource allocation in AHCRNs brings to the researchers several challenges
    due to the fact of two networks (CRNs, and PUNs) with conflict demand works together
    at the same time in a specific geographical area. Game theory, on the other hand,
    becomes one of the best candidates to investigate such heterogeneous network since
    it provides a variety of mathematical tools that can be used efficiently in modeling
    and analyzing the interaction among individual nodes in AHCRNs. Game theory, on
    the other hand, can be divided into two broad categories: (i) cooperative game
    theory, and (ii) noncooperative game theory. The importance of applying non-cooperative
    game theory to AHCRNs is multifold [2]: (i) game theory can be applied to simplify
    the multi-objective optimization problem in AHCRNs, where both CR users and PUs
    users existing at the same area trying to share the same spectrum, since it''s
    comes with well-defined equilibrium criteria under different game setting. (ii)
    game theory provides a wide area to derive efficient distributed approaches in
    AHCRNs by using only local information available in the networks. By taking the
    fact of such environment (i.e., the interaction between two networks) into account,
    game theory has been shown to be very powerful at designing the distributed power
    and channel algorithms in AHCRNs (see for example [3]–[6]). In this survey, we
    offer attention to the application of noncooperative game theory in AHCRNs. To
    make our tutorial tractable, we have provided simple definitions and examples
    to a certain scenario in the field of cognitive radio and game theory. The remainder
    of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we display the problem of
    the resource management in Ad-hoc CRN. Fundamentals of game theory have been illustrated
    in Section III. The application of game theory in PHY, MAC and network layer has
    been demonstrated in Section IV. The conclusion is provided in Section V. SECTION
    II. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN AHCRNs Spectrum management in AHCRNs provides the capability
    to maintain good QoS requirements for the users of CRNs while minimizing the generated
    interference to the users of the PUNs by allocating the communication resources
    (e.g., power and channel) for CRs, with two main objectives [7]: (i) channel selection
    and power/rate control and, (ii) spectrum coordination in sharing the available
    spectrum with the PUs. A. Spectrum Access Techniques in AHCRNs Resource allocation
    in CRNs based on game theory can be classified into two main scenarios: (i) overlay
    spectrum sharing: in this scenario, the PUs give the CRs the opportunity to access
    the unoccupied band by PUs. Spectrum sensing is required in this scenario to avoid
    any generated interference to the owner of the spectrum (i.e., PUs). (ii) Underlay
    resource sharing: in this scenario both PUs and CRs located on the same geographical
    area and trying to access the same spectrum band. In the latter scenario, the
    transmission power for CRs should be well-controlled to keep the generated interference
    to PU within acceptable level. Table 1 shows a brief comparison between underlay
    and overlay spectrum sharing. TABLE I. Comparison: underlay and overlay spectrum
    sharing Spectrum Access Comments Underlay The primary goal of underlay scenarios
    is to provide good QoS for CRs, on one hand, and to protect PUs from harmful interference,
    on the other hand. Overlay Overlay spectrum put more effort on when and where
    the CRs may use/leave the available band. SECTION III. Fundamentals of Game Theory
    Game theory was first introduced by J. V. Neumann and O. Morgensterrn in 1944
    [8]. Game theory has been extensively used in microeconomics field, and only during
    the last years, it has received attentions as an effective method to design and
    model a distributed resource allocation problems in AHCRNs. In general, game theory
    can be divided into two main branches: (i) non-cooperative game theory termed,
    and (ii) cooperative game theory termed as. A compression between cooperative
    and non-cooperative game is listed in the following definition Definition 1:non-cooperative
    game: game in which CR nodes are selfish users and allocate their resources independently
    aiming to maximize their own utility functions where Nash equilibrium (NE) is
    the common solution point in this game. Definition 2:cooperative game: game in
    which CR players are cooperate with each other aiming to maximize the total network
    utility where Nash Bargaining (NB) is the common solution point in this kind of
    game. In this survey, we limit our discussion to a non-cooperative game theory
    with the application to AHCRNs. A. Component of Game Theory The normal or strategic
    form of AHCRNs game is made up of three components (players, actions, and objective
    function), which can be mathematically represented as G=⟨N,A,{ u i }⟩ [8]–[11],
    where: N={1,2,…,N} : is a finite set of players (i.e., CR nodes); A= A 1 × A 2
    ×…× A N : is the sets of actions available to each player with A i being the action
    set for player i ; u i :A→R : is the utility functions (i.e., objective function)
    of player i , which is a function of the action chosen by player i , and the action
    chosen by all the players in the game but not player i . Generally speaking, non-cooperative
    game theory has been adopted to investigate the resource allocation problem in
    AHCRNs, in which players are CR nodes; their strategy corresponds to spectrum
    selection and the choice of power level. Table 2 presents a summary of the basic
    components of a non-cooperative game and the elements of AHCRNs. TABLE II. Mapping
    of AHCRNs elements to a game Game component Comments Example Players: N={1,2,…,N}
    Players are assumed to be rational nodes aiming to maximize their utility function
    by considering the activities of the PUs CR nodes in AHCRNs. Strategy: A= A 1
    × A 2 ×…× A N Action related to the functionality being studied. Modulation scheme,
    channel allocation, powers control, route selection, etc.) Utility function: u
    i :A→R The players'' objective which measures the outcome for CR player Throughput,
    delay, SINR, and QoS of AHCRNs. B. Utility Function and Nash Equilibrium 1- Utility
    Function Definition 3:[12], [13], [14]: Utility Function: Set of objective functions
    that each player wishes to maxmnze. Mathematically speaking: function of the action
    chosen by player i( a ction i ) , and the action chosen by all the players in
    the game but not player i( a ction −i ) . Numerous utility functions have been
    considered related to the resource allocation problem in AHCRNs. One of the most
    commonly used utility functions is the logarithmic concave function (i.e., signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR)) which has been used to maximize the spectral efficiency. 2- Nash
    Equilibrium Definition 4:[9], [10], [12]: The Nash equilibrium (termed as NE)
    of a normal game is an action profile a ction ∈A such that no individual player
    can get better payoff from unilateral deviation which can be represented as [12]:
    u i ( a ction i , a ^ −i )≥ u i ( a i , a ^ −i ),∀ a i ∈ A i View Source Where,
    a i denotes the strategy profile of player CR i and a −i denotes the strategies
    of all players but not player CR i . In order to design a proper algorithm based
    on game theory, existence and uniqueness of the NE must be provided. Example 1:
    [11]: table 3 shows an example of normal game and the concept of NE. This example
    considers two-nodes (or players), where node 1 chooses the row, and node 2 chooses
    the column. The values in each cell give the favorites of each node where the
    first number listed is the utility function of node 1 while the second is the
    utility function of node 2. Where X and Y are the actions profile available to
    node 1 and 2 respectively. TABLE III. Example of NE [11] X Y X (−δ,δ) (1−δ,0)
    Y (1−δ,0) (0,0) Consider the first action profile (X, Y), where node 1 plays the
    action Y and receives a utility function of (1−δ) while node 2 plays the action
    profile Y and receives a utility function of 0. In this scenario, node 1 has no
    incentive to deviate, since changing his action profile to Y would reduce his
    utility function from positive value (1−δ) to 0, and node 2 also has no incentive
    to deviate since changing his action profile to X would decrease his utility from
    0 to (−δ) . This confirms that the action profile (X, Y) is the solution of this
    game (i.e., NE). SECTION IV. Application of Game theory in AHCRNs: a LAYERED VIEWPOINT
    Non-cooperative game theory can be applied to model and analyze the AHCRNs at
    different layers such as physical layer, link layer, and all other upper layers
    listed in the Open System Interconnection (OSI) layers. Cognitive radio technology
    comes with simple idea based on reliable detection of white spectrum (i.e., spectrum
    hole). This technique necessitates a new type of functionality at PHY for spectrum
    sensing and new spectrum allocation and routing technique in MAC and network layer
    respectively [15]. The common performance metrics in AHCRNs at the physical layer
    include (e.g.,): (i) function of the estimated signal-to-interference plus noise
    ratio (SINR), and (ii) bit error rate (BER). In this scenario, game theory can
    be applied to the problem of resource allocation in AHCRNs such as distributed
    power control, rate and channel allocation. The key challenge of the PHY in AHCRNs
    is to avoid interference with the users of the primary networks on one hand, and
    to provide good QoS to the users of CRNs, on the other hand. In the following
    sub-sections we will provide an example related to power allocation, MAC protocol
    and routing problem in AHCRNs. as shown in Fig. 1. Fig.1. AHCRNs with different
    OSI layer Show All A- Power Control Game Power control is an essential part in
    underlay AHCRNs in order to protect the owner of the spectrum (i.e., PUs) and
    to provide good QoS to CRs. Non-cooperative game theory, on tdhe other hand, has
    been used to study the problem of power control in CRNs (see, for example, [16]–[18]).
    In [16] the concept of non-cooperative power control game has been proposed for
    MC-CDMA cognitive radio system to meet the communication needs for both PUs and
    CRs. Similarly, in [17] the uplink power control has been modeled using non-cooperative
    game. Pricing based power control has been proposed to minimize the interference
    generated to the PUs in order to provide efficient spectrum sharing. The authors
    in [18] proposed a non-cooperative power control algorithm. However, CDMA-pricing
    cognitive radio system has been proposed to provide dynamic spectrum sharing among
    CR users. Example 2 [19]: underlay game AHCRNs: Consider an underlay ad-hoc network
    scenario. There are N cognitive radio pairs denoted by {C R i } N i=1 . Let ℓ
    N ={1,2,…,N} denote the set of CR links, and the available channel denoted by
    { f k } K k=1 where k=l,2,…,K is the set of available channels. The CRs coexist
    with M active principle users denoted by {PU } M m=1 sharing the same band. Thus,
    a mutual interference arises as shown in Fig. 2. The hard lines in Fig. 2 indicate
    the communication links among CR/PU nodes, while the spotted lines denote the
    mutual interference links. Figure2. An example of system setting: three CRs (pairs)
    with two PUs [19] Show All Definition 5:A power control in an underlay AHCRNs
    can be modeled as a non-cooperative game termed as NPC-G (i.e., non-cooperative
    power control-game) NPC−G=⟨N,{ P i } i ∈ N ,{ u i } i ⟩ View Source where N is
    the number of players and P i is a compact convex strategy set available to the
    players bounded with minimum and maximum power constraints denoted by P min i
    and P max i respectively. In an underlay scenario, each CR node is trying to keep
    a good SINR, on one hand, and minimizing the interference to PUs, on the other
    hand [19]. Therefore, the utility function has been chosen to maximize the achievable
    rate on the given link for a specific power allocation profile. Mathematically
    speaking, the utility function can be modeled as follow [9]. u i ( p c i , p c
    −i )= ∑ i=1 N log(1+ γ f k i ) (1) View Source where p c i is the power strategy
    for CR i, p c −i is the power strategy for all other users in the network but
    not user i and γ f k i is the SINR for CR i on channel f k 1. Nash Equilibrium
    in NPC-G Definition 4 [19]:The Nash equilibrium in NPC-G can be defined as a power
    vector where no CR node in the network can improve its utility function u i (
    p c i , p c −i ) by unilaterally changing its own strategy. Mathematically speaking
    [13] u( p c i , p c −i )≥ u i ( p ¯ c i , P c −i ),∀ p c i ∈ P i ,∀i∈ ℓ N . View
    Source Following the concept mentioned in definition 4, we need to provide both
    existence and uniqueness for NE in NPC-G. 2. Existence of NE in GNPC-P Theorem
    1:A Nash equilibrium exists in the NPC−G=⟨N,{ P i } i ∈ N ,{ u i } i ⟩ , if it
    satisfies the following two conditions The strategy space for CR node (i.e p c
    i ) is a nonempty, convex, and compact subset of some Euclidean space. The utility
    function u i ( p c i , p c −i ) is a quasi-concave function over its strategy
    set. Proof: 1) Since the strategy profile that available for each CR user defined
    by a minimum and maximum power thus the first condition is satisfied. 2) To show
    that the second condition we have to proof that the given utility function is
    quasi-concave in P c i ,∀i∈N . This condition is true if and only if the second
    derivative of the utility function is less than zero (i.e., ∂ 2 u p i ∂ 2 p c
    i <0 ,) in the following ∂ 2 u p i ∂ 2 p c i =− ( ∂ γ fk i ∂ p c i ) 2 (2) View
    Source Since, the second-order derivative of u i ( p c i , p c −i ) is negative,
    then this shows that the utility function is continuous and quasi-concave in the
    strategy space ( p c i ) . since both conditions have been proved, then the NE
    is exist in NPC-G. 3. Uniqueness of NE in NPC-G According to [14], if the best
    response BR(∙) (i.e., utility function) is a standard function, then the NE in
    this game is unique. Theorem 2:The NPC-G-P game has a unique equilibrium point.
    Proof: see [19] for more details on the uniqueness of NPC-G. B. MAC-Layer Game
    Game theory offers simple tools to study MAC protocol in ad hoc wireless networks
    and has been applied to the CSMA/CA protocol [21] and to the Aloha protocol [22].
    Non-cooperative game theory, on the other hand, has been used to study the design
    of MAC protocol in CRNs (see for example [23]–[24]). In [23] a dynamic spectrum
    allocation “DSA-driven MAC” for CRNs has been proposed with four components [23]:
    (i) DSA algorithm, (ii) negotiation mechanism, (iii) clustering algorithm, and
    (iv) collision avoidance mechanism. The authors showed that this approaches can
    provide good spectrum utilization, on one hand, and collision-free channel access
    on the other hand. Another MAC-Game for CRN has been proposed in [24]. Price of
    Anarchy based on noncooperative game has been proposed in this research to facilitate
    the cooperation and spectrum sharing between PUN and CRN. 1- Design of MAC protocol
    for AHCRNs The design of MAC protocol is the challenging part in AHCRNs since
    we need to model both channel allocation (CA) and multiple access (MA) like CSMA.
    The NE, on the other hand must be considered in both models. To simplify the MAC
    protocol design and the existence of the NE in MAC-Game we have proposed block
    diagram as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3 the problem of MAC-Game design can be divided
    into two individual games: (i) Channel allocation game, and (ii) Multiple access
    (MA) game. Preposition 1:if NE exists in both games (i.e., CA and MA game) then
    the NE exists in MAC-Game. Proof: similar to theorem 1, the technique can be applied
    to both games (CA, MA). This resulted in splitting MAC-Game into two sub-games
    and this resulted in a simple analysis for MAC protocol in AHCRNs Fig. 3 Proposed
    block diagram for MAC-Game protocol Show All C. Network Layer The main challenging
    point in the AHCRNs is that the CRs are regarded as temporary users to the available
    spectrum band. This problem is called spectrum mobility, and need a new type of
    handoff in CRNs. When CRNs operate in a multi-hop scenario, another challenges
    and issues arise at higher layers of the protocol stack. Routing is the most important
    issue to deal with in order to build multi-hop network. Multi-hop routing in CRNs
    comes with new challenges compared to the traditional technology of multi-radio
    multichannel network, since CR needs to deal with ON/OFF spectrum holes [26].
    Game theory, on the other hand, provides efficient mathematical tools to deal
    with cross-layer optimization problem (i.e., multi-hop CRNs). Example 2:Figure
    4 shows an example of multi-hop cognitive radio network where the source send
    the packets to the nodes in the middle (i.e., relay nodes) and the relay forward
    the packets to the destination. Fig. 4. Example of multi-hop routing in AHCRNs
    Show All Based on Fig. 4, three possible routing approaches can be defined as
    follow [27]: Definition 5: “Static MHCRNs” this approach is similar to that in
    mesh network technology, since CR nodes assume that the available spectrum is
    permanent all the time. This approach is valid in certain area only (i.e., the
    PUs is not active most of the time). Definition 6: “Dynamic MHCRNs”:this approach
    considers the dynamic nature of the spectrum. Thus the most suitable routing technique
    is the one comes with routing metrics that capture spectrum fluctuations and less
    dynamic spectrum bands. Definition 7: “Opportunistic MHCRNs (Highly Dynamic)”:
    this approach is still an open problem and no optimal research has explored this
    aspect yet. 1- Route Selection in AHCRNs The following definition provide in depth
    procedure to design routing game in AHCRNs Definition 8:opportunistic non-cooperative
    routing game termed as NCR-G can be mathematically modeled as follows NCR−G=⟨N,{
    r i },{ u i }⟩ , where N={1,2,…,N} : is a finite set of decision makers (include
    CRs and RNs); { r i } : is the set of actions available to each player where r
    i is the actions of selecting route for player i ; u i :A→R : is the utility functions
    of player i . To the best of our knowledge, there is no much extensive research
    done in the area of route selection in multi-hop CRNs using game theory. Thus,
    more effort is needed in this area to develop a novel routing protocol in AHCRNs
    based on game theory. SECTION V. Conclusion In this survey, we have showed the
    fundamental concept of game theory putting more effort on non-cooperative game
    theory. However, comparison between cooperative and noncooperative game has been
    outlined. Non-cooperative game can be used to design efficient distributed algorithm
    in ARCRNs. Non-cooperative game can be applied to design cross-layer optimization
    problem like multi-hop routing in ad-hoc cognitive radio networks (ARCRNs). MAC
    protocol is most difficult part to design using game theory. Thus a special care
    needs to take dealing with MAC protocol similar to the proposed technique that
    has been mentioned in the survey. Mathematical model for the PHY MAC and network
    layer using game theory will be one of our directions in the future work. Channel
    allocation and rate control in PHY is another direction of future work. Joint
    spectrum and route selection is another direction of our future work. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: With the advent of 5G (and beyond) technologies, efficient
    exploitation of radio spectrum resources is becoming the fundamental block of
    the new digital economy. Unfortunately, current static radio spectrum allocation
    policies are introducing an artificial spectrum scarcity problem. In this context,
    cognitive radio and spectrum licensing have been proposed as effective ways to
    guarantee adequate quality of service. In particular, the radio spectrum auction
    design is both answer and efficient solution to these problems. This paper provides
    a survey on auction-based methods applied to radio spectrum allocation in cognitive
    radio networks. We first outline the characteristics of radio spectrum regulation
    and spectrum sharing, as well as the advantages of a dynamic spectrum access framework.
    Then, we introduce the economic properties of conventional auctions. Finally,
    we present a comprehensive taxonomy of auction-based methods applied to spectrum
    allocation in cognitive radio networks, as well as their characteristics, and
    implementation issues that will improve the actual radio spectrum allocation mechanism.

    IEEE Conference Location: Brno, Czech Republic SECTION I. Introduction Current
    static radio spectrum management policies through their highly inefficient spectrum
    use are introducing an artificial spectrum scarcity problem. Several surveys on
    radio spectrum occupancy have observed that most of the allocated spectrum is
    not fully used [1]. In particular, measurements provided by the FCC in several
    American cities have shown large variations in the intensity of spectrum use below
    1 GHz frequency [2]. Additional measurements have been conducted by the Shared
    Spectrum Company in the USA on the frequency range 30 MHz and 3 GHz [3]. The associated
    analyses have assessed an average occupancy in the observed locations of around
    5.2%, with a maximum occupancy of 13.1% in New York City and a minimum occupancy
    of 1% in rural areas. In Europe, several measurement campaigns conducted in Germany,
    Spain, Netherlands, Ireland, France, and Czech Republic show a better situation
    [4], ascertaining a higher spectrum occupancy when compared with USA, but still
    rather low if considered alone. For instance, in the Aachen area of Germany, spectrum
    occupancy is estimated to be 32% in the range between 20 and 3000 MHz. Such discrepancies
    between spectrum allocation and actual usage prove the artificial nature of spectrum
    scarcity as caused by spectrum management policy, not reflecting the actual availability
    of usable radio spectrum. To deal with the spectrum allocation congestion and
    spectrum scarcity problems, the Cognitive Radio (CR) technology has been proposed.
    CR is a technology that allows unlicensed users, namely Secondary Users (SUs),
    to opportunistically utilize already licensed bands left unused by licensed users
    [5]. Such frequency bands are named spectrum holes (or white spaces) and are defined
    as multidimensional regions within time, space, and frequency [6]. Through the
    opportunistic access provided by this technology it is possible to improve the
    efficiency of the spectrum utilization and, in perspective, to allow next generations
    of mobile networks to access radio spectrum bands. A pre-requisite of CR is the
    coexistence with current telecommunication technologies and licensed legacy users,
    namely Primary Users (PU), in the shared spectrum. The reallocation of radio spectrum
    has become an important question and auction design is both answer and efficient
    solution. In particular, in the context of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and CR
    technology, auctions enter in the phase of spectrum allocation since a market
    relationship is created between spectrum owners and cognitive users, see [7] and
    references therein. Here, our focus is to provide a systematic survey on auction-based
    methods applied to spectrum allocation in CR networks (CRNs). The existing survey
    works on CR have focused on various (cooperative and non-cooperative) methods
    for searching spectrum holes by means of spectrum sensing techniques, summarizing
    the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm and their challenging problems.
    References [8] and [9] provided a survey of resource allocation algorithms from
    the aspects of adopted approaches, criteria, techniques, and network architectures.
    Reference [10] presented an up-to-date survey of spectrum decision in CRNs based
    on spectrum characterization, spectrum selection, and CR reconfiguration. In [11],
    spectrum access schemes were reviewed, while in [12] the concept of dynamic spectrum
    sharing, was investigated for different network topologies, features, challenges,
    and probable use cases. Reference [13] provided a comprehensive survey of CR,
    full-duplex communication and Long Term Evolution (LTE) on unlicensed spectrum,
    as well as the multiple spectrum sharing techniques. Reference [14] outlined the
    spectrum sharing mechanism for the next generation cellular networks to overcome
    the energy crisis, and the spectrum sharing between satellite telecommunication
    networks and terrestrial has been surveyed in [15]. More recently, [16] provided
    a comprehensive survey on full spectrum sharing in CR networks towards the fifth
    generation (5G). Compared with previous survey papers, our survey aims at presenting
    an overview of spectrum allocation techniques based on auctions mechanisms in
    CR networks. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (i)
    we outline the characteristics of radio spectrum regulation and spectrum sharing,
    as well as the advantages of a dynamic spectrum access framework; (ii) we introduce
    the economic properties of conventional auctions, and then we present a comprehensive
    taxonomy of auction-based methods applied to spectrum allocation in CR networks,
    as well as their characteristics, and implementation issues. The organization
    of this paper is as follows. Section 2 elaborates on the background and motivation
    of radio regulations, shared spectrum, dynamic spectrum access, and CR technology.
    In Section 3, we present the basic frameworks of auction theory, while in Section
    4 we briefly introduce auctions for radio resources. Spectrum auctions are fully
    reviewed in Section 5 along with a discussion on performance metrics in Section
    6. Our conclusions are finally drawn in Section 7. TABLE I. Policy options for
    primary and secondary users SECTION II. Radio Spectrum Regulations and DSA In
    the context of radio spectrum regulation, it is necessary to distinguish between
    trading, as a transfer of spectrum usage rights, and liberalization, as a weakening
    of the restrictions and limitations associated with spectrum usage rights related
    to technologies and services. The report of the Spectrum Policy Task Force of
    the FCC defines spectrum regulatory mechanisms, highlighting three different models
    [17]: a command-and-control model; an exclusive use model; an open access model.
    The most used one is the command-and-control model, which refers to the licensed
    spectrum for shared usage and unlicensed spectrum. In addition, for primary and
    secondary users of the radio spectrum, it is possible to identify different regulatory
    options as summarized in Table 1, see [18]. It is interesting to note that if
    a PU has enough flexibility, it may choose to grant secondary access instead,
    by creating a secondary market to rent the unused portion of the spectrum. This
    approach can guarantee an adequate QoS for the SUs. As a consequence, auctions
    have been recently used in the context of radio resource management. Cognitive
    Radio technology is able to execute dynamic spectrum access (DSA). Actually, it
    is a form of wireless communication that allows the secondary user or the cognitive
    user to extract information from the radio environment and to identify idle channels
    [19]. Secondary users must respect specific power constraints when the primary
    users are present according to three different ways of accessing the spectrum
    band: spectrum interweave, spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay. Spectrum interweave
    means that unlicensed users can access the spectrum when the primary users are
    not transmitting, but they are obliged to leave when the licensed users require
    to transmit. In spectrum underlay, instead, the unlicensed users and the primary
    users transmit simultaneously with the constraint imposed on the latter to maintain
    interference below a certain threshold. Finally, in spectrum overlay, the unlicensed
    users can access the spectrum, but they have to contribute to primary users’ transmission.
    Table 2 lists the spectrum access techniques and their characteristics. TABLE
    II. Spectrum Access Techniques The DSA is performed by Cognitive Radio technology
    through the following functions: spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum
    access and spectrum handhoff [20]. As for spectrum sensing, it allows the secondary
    users to identify the spectrum holes in the licensed bands. Once the radio environment
    has been sensed, spectrum allocation determines the spectrum distribution to unlicensed
    users. The third function of Cognitive Radio, that is spectrum access, determines
    the way in which the secondary users access the licensed bands. Spectrum access
    must execute in such a way the licensed users do not suffer from interferences
    caused by secondary users’ transmission. Figure 1 illustrates the four main functions
    of Cognitive Radio technology Finally, in the context of DSA and Cognitive Radio
    technology, auctions enter in the phase of spectrum allocation since a market
    relationship is created between spectrum owners and cognitive users. SECTION III.
    Auctions for Radio Resources The reallocation of radio spectrum has become an
    important issue and auction design is both an answer and an efficient solution.
    Fig. 1. Cognitive Radio Functions Show All In auctions for radio resources, the
    primary users play the role of spectrum sellers and the secondary users play the
    role of spectrum buyers. The most used auctions in radio spectrum selling are
    the single-sided auctions, the double-sided auctions, the online auctions and
    the dynamic auctions. It is important to highlight that an auction could be online
    and combinatorial, as well as double-sided, online and combinatorial, and so on,
    so there are many ways in which an auction can be designed. In addition, other
    types of auctions are interested in building a framework that discriminate among
    the secondary users. In particular, as shown by [21]–[22], this discrimination
    tries to promote an energy efficient use of the resource by encouraging those
    users with a lower transmission power. It is important to note that an auction
    can be performed in a centralized or in a distributed manner. In the first case,
    the presence of an intermediate operator is not required, while in the second
    case, the intermediate operator is present. Double-sided auctions are generally
    performed in a centralized manner. According to this classification, different
    auction models will be considered in this survey. The classification is useful
    to describe the problems faced by these kinds of mechanisms, since auctions for
    radio resources present several problems to deal with. One problem is designing
    an auction mechanism that could take into account the reusability of the radio
    spectrum. Actually, due to the fact that the spectrum is a shared resource, reusability
    has to be granted among non-conflict buyers. The second problem deals with the
    channel quality, since it is important to consider that different channels correspond
    to a different transmission quality, therefore, the assumption of homogeneous
    channels for buyers should not be taken into account. The third problem is the
    degradation of the QoS of licensed primary users, in fact it is often assumed
    that the allocated spectrum is occupied only by the winning secondary users. Spectrum
    usage becomes problematic if demand for spectrum from primary users increases.
    The problem of avoiding degradation of the QoS of primary users is addressed by
    introducing the possibility of recalling the channel, in fact the idea of recalling
    the channel imposes a priority in the services of primary licensed users. Other
    problems arise in the design of online auctions, in fact this type of mechanism
    does not allow to have a complete information of the bid and ask prices, information
    easily available in offline auctions. Others arise in the design of online auctions,
    in fact this type of mechanism does not allow to have a complete information of
    the bid and ask prices, information easily available in offline auctions. Finally,
    the last problem concerns the properties that an auction model should have to
    discourage untruthful behaviour and create incentives for both buyers and sellers
    to take advantage of the auction. Let us note that the radio spectrum differs
    from conventional commodities, in the sense that it can be used by several users
    at the same time. This feature is called reusability and gives buyers the ability
    to use the radio resource simultaneously. The possibility of re-use of the radio
    resource should be granted to non-conflicting buyers, which means that they do
    not interfere with each other, so re-use of the spectrum requires modelling the
    relationship of interference among buyers through a conflict graph. A. One-sided
    Spectrum Auctions One-sided spectrum auctions are characterized by the presence
    of one spectrum seller and multiple buyers. Authors in [23] consider the problem
    of spectrum recalling, i.e., the possibility granted to the PUs of getting back
    a quantity of spectrum when they require to transmit. The authors propose a recall-based
    auction framework called RSSA that enables the possibility of preserving the QoS
    of primary users. Within the framework of the RSSA, the second-price sealed-bid
    auction is used for the determination of the payment and this mechanism is shown
    to satisfy the properties of individual truthfulness and rationality. The bids
    of the secondary users are presented to maximize their utility and each of them
    has an evaluation equal to the Shannon Capacity when the recall of the channel
    is not considered. The channel’s valuation decreases when the spectrum seller
    declares the quantity of recalled channels. The idea in [23] is to introduce a
    risk factor that can assess how much SUs react to the possibility of channel recall.
    It can be seen that SUs with a higher risk factor value are less averse to the
    risk of channel recall and, as a result, their bid will be higher ensuring a higher
    probability of winning. The authors in [9] use the same idea of channel recall
    proposed by [23] but allowing the presence of multiple winners. The auction is
    still one-sided, and the proposed framework is called RMSA. In the RMSA framework,
    the presence of multiple winners helps the spectrum seller in increasing revenues,
    in fact, since the demands of secondary users are independent of the number of
    channels that can be auctioned, it is common that the channels auctioned cannot
    be fully used by a single winner. The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism can
    be used in the payment scheme since the presence of multiple winners commutes
    the problem into a combinatorial auction. The VCG mechanism guarantees the properties
    of efficiency, truthfulness and individual rationality. Under RMSA, the number
    of recalled channels cannot be calculated by the secondary user as it depends
    on both his own demand and that of other secondary users. In this context, it
    is possible to define a stability factor that has a different meaning from that
    of the risk factor, in fact the stability factor is determined by the activity
    of primary users. A large value of the stability factor indicates a more stable
    service for secondary users since the primary users are not recalling back the
    allocated spectrum. In the RMSA framework, the VCG mechanism guarantees that truthful
    bidding is a dominant strategy, so once the buyers submit their true values for
    the channels, the winners can be obtained by solving an optimization problem.
    The authors in [23] assume that spectrum allocation is made in units of channel.
    On the contrary, the authors in [24] propose a one-side auction framework with
    a variable bandwidth spectrum allocation, that can grant the secondary users with
    a more flexible use of the spectrum. B. Double-sided Spectrum Auctions The double-sided
    auction is the most popular mechanism used for allocating radio spectrum and its
    popularity is due to the greatest adaptability to the real market conditions [25].
    They are characterized by the presence of multiple competitive buyers and sellers.
    In addition, they need the presence of an auctioneer playing the role of an intermediate
    operator among the agents. In a double-sided auction, buyers submit their bid
    prices, which represent the maximum willingness to pay and, similarly, sellers
    submit their ask prices, representing the minimum price at which they are willing
    to sell the item. After collecting the bid and the ask prices, the auctioneer
    clears the market through a price decision. The double auction model has to guarantee
    the property of individual rationality, truthfulness and ex-post budget balance
    property. The latter requires that the auctioneer’s profit, defined as the difference
    between buyers’ payments and sellers’ revenues, to be positive in order to provide
    incentives to start the auction [25]. A double auction model should also guarantee
    the property of economic efficiency which means that all the efficient trade should
    be executed. These properties cannot occur in the same double auction model, due
    to the fact that there is always a compromise between the properties of economic
    efficiency and budgetary balance. The execution of all trade between buyers and
    sellers leads always to a budget deficit and this turns into a negative profit
    for the auctioneer [26]. The trade reduction mechanism is used in double auctions
    to determine the winners and the corresponding payments. Moreover, this mechanism
    is proved to satisfy the properties of individual rationality, truthfulness and
    ex-post budget balance. In addition, the trade-reduction mechanism sorts the buyers’
    bids and the sellers’ asks, respectively, in a non-increasing and in a non-decreasing.
    Each buyer pays bk and each seller receives sk and the profit of the auctioneer
    is given by the difference between the payments made by the buyers and those received
    from the sellers [26]. In particular, the trade-reduction mechanism finds the
    efficient trade quantity k such that bk ≥ sk. The first k-1 sellers and buyers
    are the winners of the auction [27]. As highlighted by [28], the trade-reduction
    mechanism allows for a separation between the allocation decision and the payment
    decision and the idea is to maintain the property of individual rationality, truthfulness
    and ex-post budget balance by eliminating the least profitable transaction. Therefore,
    the bids that have been removed become the reference prices, that is, the buyers
    pay the bidding price of the removed buyer and the sellers are paid by the asking
    price of the removed seller. Another mechanism of great importance is the McAfee
    mechanism. This mechanism works in the same way as the trade reduction mechanism,
    but there is a difference in the determination of the clearing price. In the McAfee
    setting, the clearing price is set as b k+1 + s k+1 2 if the price is in the interval
    [bk, sk], otherwise the trade reduction mechanism is applied. Most of the existing
    works on double auction for spectrum allocation make use of the trade reduction
    mechanism for winner’s selection and payment’s determination. C. Online Spectrum
    Auctions Spectrum auctions can be performed in offline or in online patterns.
    The offline auctions are also known as periodic auctions. In periodic auctions,
    the bid and ask prices can be submitted only in a certain period. The online auctions
    are characterized by the absence of a bidding period, in fact bid and ask prices
    arrive continuously and the auctioneer has to take the allocation and the payment
    decision immediately. The decision between offline and online auctions is strictly
    affected by the buyers’ and sellers’ preferences. Buyers and sellers prefer online
    auctions when they are impatient and need an immediate allocation of the item.
    In online auctions, the secondary users transmit a request to the auctioneer.
    The request is composed by the willingness to pay of the secondary user, the demanded
    channels, the arrival time, the departure time and the job length. The authors
    in [29] design a truthful online combinatorial auction called TRADE. In TRADE,
    the challenges of online auction mechanisms are highlighted. One of these challenges
    is to avoid the pre-emption effect. The pre-emption effect arises when the auctioneer
    interrupts the execution of a current request to meet new requests [30]. The authors
    in [29] highlight that the pre-emption effect must be avoided for two reasons:
    the partial usage of the channel is not charged and the pre-empted secondary user
    is discouraged to participate in the following auctions. Most of the existing
    works on online auction mechanisms make the same assumptions: the pre-emption
    effect is not allowed, the secondary users submit their truthful job lengths and
    their requested channels. Sometimes, it can be assumed that the secondary users
    lie only in submitting a longer time duration for using the channel. The online
    auctions mechanism are always compared in terms of performance with the offline
    auction mechanisms and the reference point is always the VCG mechanism. In the
    TRADE mechanism, the channels are considered identical, the auction is sealed-bid
    and private and the rejected requests of secondary user can be reconsidered for
    future time slots. TRADE considers the reusability of the radio spectrum and a
    conflict graph is used to represent the interference relationship between secondary
    users, but this time the interference relationship depends on location, time-periods
    and requested channel. TRADE mechanism is proved to satisfy the property of individual
    rationality and truthfulness. The authors in [30] propose an online double spectrum
    auction called TODA, in which the auction is sealed-bid and private, the channels
    are assumed to be identical and the reusability of the spectrum is considered.
    As usual, the secondary users who interfere with each other cannot use the same
    channel. In TODA, the interference relationship is present among primary users
    and among secondary users, but only the conflict between secondary users is considered.
    In both TODA and TRADE, the conflict between secondary users depends on locations
    and requested time periods. In TODA, the interference between secondary users
    can be seen under two different models: the protocol interference model and the
    physical interference model, while in TRADE, only the protocol interference model
    is considered. The interference pattern of the protocol considers two secondary
    users as interferers if they are in each other''s interference field. The physical
    interference model admits the simultaneous use of the channel when the SINR is
    in accordance to a certain threshold. Differently from TRADE, TODA assumes that
    the rejected requests cannot be reconsidered for future time slots. TODA satisfies
    the property of truthfulness, individual rationality and ex-post budget balance.
    The authors in [31] propose an online double auction mechanism called SALSA that
    is similar to TODA in its assumptions. SALSA is proved to be truthful, individually
    rational and ex-post budget balance. In [9], the problem of spectrum allocation
    is also modeled using an online double auction called VIOLET. In VIOLET, both
    the activities of primary users and secondary users are uncertain, and the auctioneer
    has the role of granting the spectrum usage to the secondary users, taking into
    account the higher access priority of primary users. In VIOLET, the spatial reuse
    of the spectrum is granted to non-conflict secondary users and the conflict relationship
    is modeled by a conflict graph which is known to the auctioneer. The non-conflict
    secondary users are put into groups, like in TRUST, and the usual trade reduction
    mechanism is applied to select the winners and the corresponding payments. VIOLET
    satisfies the properties of truthfulness, individual rationality and ex-post budget
    balance, so it resists to market manipulation. D. Dynamic Spectrum Auctions Some
    spectrum auctions can be considered as dynamic, in the sense that, some parameters
    are dynamically adapted to improve the performance of the mechanism. The authors
    in [32] propose an auction mechanism for femtocells where a reserve price is established.
    The reserve price increases in every auction round by a step size. This step size
    is not fixed but varies accordingly to the utility of each secondary users. The
    authors in [26] propose a double auction framework for spectrum allocation in
    which the auctioneer can learn from historical data on previous auctions rounds.
    After this learning process, the auctioneer can help both primary users and secondary
    users in deciding their bidding strategy. The authors in [33] propose an auction
    framework for spectrum allocation performed in a distributed manner. The auction
    is first-price and sealed-bid but some advances are proposed in in terms of the
    bid scheme. A learning algorithm is introduced to help the secondary users in
    deciding the participation to the auction. In this framework, the bid strategy
    of each secondary users depends on the bidding history. The authors in [34] propose
    an adaptive auction framework for spectrum allocation called DEAL, in which the
    characteristics of spectrum channels vary in time and space and also the valuation
    is different. In DEAL, some parameters in the auction are dynamically adapted
    to improve the mechanism’s performance. Besides, the reserve price is based on
    secondary users’ bids, but the secondary users can influence the reserve price
    by reporting untruthful bids. Moreover, in DEAL, the reserve price is adapted
    on previous bids instead of current ones, to avoid the submission of fake bids.
    SECTION IV. Auction Efficiency and Performance Metrics The spectrum auctions are
    employed in radio resource management to improve the spectrum utilization. An
    auction may have either the objective of allocating the item to the highest value
    buyer or to maximize the seller revenue. In auctions for radio resources, these
    two objectives are also taken into account with regard to increasing spectrum
    use. In order to see if the auction design has reached the predefined objectives,
    some performance metrics are employed in spectrum auction, one of the most applied
    performance metrics being the spectrum utilization ratio. In VIOLET, the arrangement
    of non-conflict buyers into groups guarantees the spectrum reusability. The spectrum
    utilization ratio in VIOLET is defined as the ratio of total winning users, both
    primary and secondary, over the whole spectrum. The spectrum utilization ratio
    is lower without the auction because the spectrum usage is granted only to primary
    users. The use of auction can increase the spectrum utilization ratio allowing
    the use of the radio resource also to non-conflict secondary users. The spectrum
    utilization ratio is also evaluated in TASG framework with the same conclusions
    shown in VIOLET. In TODA, the performance of the mechanism is evaluated in terms
    of social efficiency which is defined as the sum of the truthful valuations of
    all winners, while the social efficiency is evaluated for comparison with the
    offline VGC mechanism. The same is made for SALSA, also considering the efficiency
    of the mechanism in terms of revenue, the revenue efficiency being defined as
    the total payment of winners. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper has presented a
    review on auction-based methods applied to radio spectrum allocation in CR networks.
    The characteristics of radio spectrum regulation and spectrum sharing have been
    highlighted along with the advantages of a dynamic spectrum access framework.
    The evidence indicates that spectrum allocation design along with well-managed
    spectrum have become critical for developing mobile services, broadcasting, and
    broadband access. Incumbents and new entrants increasingly resort to wireless
    technologies to modernize and expand their facilities. Only tinkering at the margin
    with existing spectrum management practice is no longer enough. In this regard,
    policies to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband services are generally
    viewed as drivers that would stimulate technological innovation and economic growth.
    Increasing the amount of spectrum available to support new mobile technologies
    is one step toward meeting future demand for mobile services. Authors Figures

    Abstract: Cognitive radio (CR) is regarded as a promising technology for providing
    a high spectral efficiency to mobile users by using heterogeneous wireless network
    architectures and dynamic spectrum access techniques. However, cognitive radio
    networks (CRNs) may also impose some challenges due to the ever increasing complexity
    of network architecture, the increasing complexity with configuration and management
    of large-scale networks, fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, diverse
    Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of various applications, and the intensifying
    difficulties of centralized control, etc. Spectrum management functions with self-organization
    features can be used to address these challenges and realize this new network
    paradigm. In this paper, fundamentals of CR, including spectrum sensing, spectrum
    management, spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing, have been surveyed, with their
    paradigms of self-organization being emphasized. Variant aspects of self-organization
    paradigms in CRNs, including critical functionalities of Media Access Control
    (MAC)- and network-layer operations, are surveyed and compared. Furthermore, new
    directions and open problems in CRNs are also identified in this survey. Published

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bangalore, India SECTION I. Introduction
    As the number of devices connected to the internet increases day by day, there
    is a severe constraint on the allocation of spectrum resources. It is a well-known
    fact that spectrum is a limited resource. Spectrum bands are open auctioned, and
    are sold to the highest bidder. Broadly speaking, communication spectra are divided
    into licensed and unlicensed bands. The licensed user has access to the channel
    at all times. However, when the licensed user does not use it, the channel is
    available for communication. According to the federal communications commission
    (FCC), spectrum under utilization is one of the main causes of this spectrum scarcity.
    This gave rise to a new generation of edge devices called cognitive radios (CR).
    A CR is an enhanced software-defined radio, which learns from its environment,
    and can also adjust to changes in the nature of licensed signals, network parameters,
    and Qos requirements. Primary applications of CR include communication systems
    that require high reliability whenever and wherever needed [1]. CRs extend the
    functions of a software radio. A major hurdle in a wireless network is efficient
    spectrum management. Even with significant investment in 3G infrastructure, the
    spectrum allocated to 3G was limited. To overcome this, CR offers a new class
    of protocols called formal radio etiquettes [2] for the flexible pooling of radio
    spectrum resources. Similarly, the works in [3]–[5] have explored the design of
    CR in a 4G network. In recent times, with the advent of 5G and its close interlude
    with internet-of-things (IoT), the number of devices connecting to the internet
    is now more than ever. Hence the need to inculcate CR networks to utilize the
    spectrum effectively has become an important research topic. Although several
    classical signal processing methods exist for CR applications like spectrum sensing,
    dynamic spectrum access, decision-making, and spectrum prediction, they are model-based
    and their performance degrades with uncertainties in model [6]. On the other hand,
    ML techniques exploit the experimentally captured data, and when trained properly
    across a variety of data, can robustly learn the radio environments, adapt to
    new conditions and consistently yield a good performance. These algorithms are
    modular in their architectures and hence form elegant solutions to problems encountered
    in CR networks [7]. In this paper, we present a contemporary survey on the utility
    of ML algorithms for CR applications. As mentioned earlier, ML algorithms are
    envisioned to solve several problems in CRNs, thanks to the rapid development
    in ML techniques and architectures. First, we present a high-level overview of
    some of the key challenges in CRNs and mention the architectures and algorithms
    in ML that can be used to alleviate them. Next, given the vast scope of approaches
    for CR, we focus our attention on two fundamental applications, namely spectrum
    sensing (SS), dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and subtopics such as cooperative
    sensing, spectrum prediction and spectrum auction. We provide a detailed description
    of recent advancements in the field of ML for CR for the above mentioned applications.
    Moreover, we briefly discuss a set of challenges in real-time implementation of
    the mentioned ML techniques. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    Some of the key challenges in CRNs and corresponding ML-based solutions are presented
    in Section II. Section III details the SS problem in CRNs, and presents the popular
    ML algorithms for conventional and cooperative SS. In Section IV, DSA is studied
    in detail as a learning problem, and existing ML solutions for problems such as
    spectrum auction and spectrum prediction are discussed in detail. Common challenges
    encountered while employing ML techniques for CR are briefed in Section V, and
    concluding remarks are provided in Section VI. SECTION II. Key Challenges and
    Ml Solutions In this section, we discuss some of the major challenges in designing
    a CR network, and mention some of the ML-based solutions to alleviate them. At
    a high level, these key challenges in CRNs can be categorized into four classes,
    namely, radio scene analysis, channel identification, spectrum management and
    resource management, as shown in Fig. 1. A CR needs to be aware of the radio frequency
    activity in its environment. In radio scene analysis, SS and interference control
    are the two important tasks. The key problem in SS is to detect white spaces,
    while in interference control, the requirement is to avoid harmful interference
    with a primary user (PU). Distributed Q-learning has been proposed to control
    the interference caused by multiple CRs on a PU [8]. Game theory and reinforcement
    learning are some of the popular techniques used in spectrum management [9], [10].
    In resource management, the goal is to manage the resources in an efficient way
    to meet the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Frequently used algorithms
    in channel estimation and spectrum prediction are hidden Markov model and long
    short term memory (LSTM), respectively. Other ML algorithms for various tasks
    under these four categories are mentioned in Fig. 1. Due to the vast advancements
    in the field of ML for CR, we restrict our attention to ML techniques for SS and
    DSA in this paper. In the next section, we discuss the advancements in SS in detail.
    Fig. 1: Key challenges in cognitive radios and the corresponding machine learning-based
    solutions. Show All SECTION III. Spectrum Sensing Spectrum sensing is one of the
    most essential functionalities in a CR, which is the task of deciding the presence
    or absence of a PU. Many classical signal processing methods such as energy detector
    (ED), matched filter detector (MFD), cyclostationary feature-based detector, and
    differential entropy detector (DED) have been proposed [11], [12]. However, there
    are some limitations to these methods. In the case of ED, the variance of the
    noise has to be known a priori in order to set the threshold. The MFD assumes
    that the CR has complete information about the primary signal, while the cyclostationary
    detector is computationally complex. To overcome these problems, several ML algorithms
    have been proposed [13]–[16]. In an ML framework, SS can be framed as a classification
    problem [17]. The received signal power and the correlation of the cyclic prefix
    were used as inputs to train a naive Bayes'' classifier in [17]. Cyclic prefix
    induced correlation was used to overcome the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) wall
    phenomenon in ED in [18], [19]. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for SS
    were proposed in [15], [16], [20], [21]. Similarly, a deep learning classification
    technique was proposed in [15]. The power spectrum of the received signal was
    used as the input to train the CNN model. Normalization of the input signal power
    was performed to solve the problem of noise uncertainty. Different types of modulation
    schemes like BPSK, QPSK, FSK, QAM, and PAM were used for training. A four-layer
    CNN was developed in [20] to restrict the computational cost while meeting the
    SS requirements. The proposed method was evaluated against a dataset collected
    in the ultrahigh frequency TV band. The aim of the proposed method was to decrease
    the training duration in cases where the input signal features change. Transfer
    learning was used to decrease the training duration, as it enables a swift adaption
    to changes in frequency, environment, and location. Exploiting the knowledge of
    history of the activity of a PU, [21] uses a CNN-based deep learning algorithm
    for activity pattern aware spectrum sensing (APASS). This approach was data-driven
    and did not assume any information about signal statistics and PU activity pattern
    model. For model-based frameworks, the sensing performance depends on the accuracy
    of the considered models. However, when used on real incoming data, there can
    be mismatches and the performance of the above methods can decline significantly.
    No such assumptions are made in data-driven frameworks. These methods learn from
    the pattern present in the input. This helps in reducing the effect of model-mismatch
    problems. Two phases are proposed in data-driven detectors, namely (i) offline
    training phase, and (ii) an on-line detection phase. In [21], the correlation
    matrix (CM) was used as a test statistic for SS, since it contains information
    of the energy of the signal and correlation among the signals. Interestingly,
    this can also be interpreted as an image and passed to CNN as inputs for training.
    To capture the activity of a PU, the present CM and past CM of the PU signal were
    considered for training. These inputs were passed through several convolution
    and max-pooling layers. The output after these layers were flattened and concatenated.
    After applying a softmax regression, sensing results were interpreted. The APASS
    algorithm has the advantage that it can learn the PU activity pattern with no
    prior assumption on the PU signal and the signal model. Next, we look at some
    of the methods proposed for cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS). A. Cooperative
    Spectrum Sensing In conventional SS, a single CR senses the spectrum for channel
    availability. Two main problems occur because of this approach: (a) the hidden
    node problem, and (b) loss of performance due to multipath fading. To overcome
    these problems, cooperation among CRs is desired [22]. The CSS method makes use
    of spatial diversity in CRs for an enhanced sensing accuracy. In CSS, the CRs
    can be simple sensors and the fusion centre (FC) can have a powerful computing
    capability. There is always a tradeoff between the CR overhead and the sensing
    accuracy. Classical fusion methods such as the OR rule, AND rule, K-out-of-N rule,
    counting rule, and linear quadratic combining rule have their associated advantages
    and disadvantages. These methods require setting a threshold value to make optimum
    decisions, and are not scalable. In CSS with ML framework, this threshold setting
    is not required. Several ML algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, have
    been proposed for CSS in existing literature [23]–[27]. Energy vector, where each
    element is the energy of the received signal measured by a CR has been used for
    classification [14], [23], [28]–[30]. The training time of the ML models increases
    with increase in number of CRs. To overcome this problem, authors in [24] propose
    using low dimensional probability vectors as features. It is shown that the N
    -dimensional energy vector y follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The
    mean vectors and covariance matrices under each hypotheses are written as μ y|
    H i =[ μ y 1 | H i ,…, μ y N | H i ] T ,i=0,1, Σ y| H i =diag{ σ 2 y 1 | H i ,…,
    σ 2 y N | H i },i=0,1, (1) (2) View Source where diag(.) denotes a diagonal matrix.
    The corresponding Gaussian distribution values of y are computed and fed as input
    to classifier, which reduces the training time. Finding an idle channel quickly
    with high probability can be improved, if the channel occupancy statistics by
    a PU is known. To this end, authors in [25] use Q-learning to find the order in
    which channels are to be sensed. Further, to improve the sensing accuracy, discounted
    upper confidence bound (D-UCB) is used to select a SU partner for cooperation.
    The sensing accuracy is also known to increase if the data points of signal present
    and absent classes are well separated. The hidden PU problem is known to decrease
    the separability of these classes [31]. To tackle this, [31] proposes a strategy
    to place CRs to increase spectrum sensing coverage. The analytical expression
    for spectrum sensing coverage is derived based on Kullback-Leibler divergence
    between the distributions under each class. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
    technique is also known and is used to improve spectrum utilization. Authors in
    [32] consider power-domain NOMA with CSS, in which the same resource block is
    used by two PUs with different transmit power levels. Unsupervised algorithms
    such as GMM, K-Means, and supervised algorithms such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN),
    directed acyclic graph support vector machine (DAG-SVM), and back propagation
    (BP) algorithms were studied, with energy vector as a feature. A total of M CRs
    are considered, and each user measures energy locally over L time slots. Thus
    a matrix Y∈L×M is defined as a energy-based feature, which is considered for training
    and testing. Multiple PUs may operate in the environemnt around a CR, over the
    same frequency band. Such a setup is considered in [27], which considers a cellular
    network where frequency is reused by neighbouring cells, which are sufficient
    distance apart. In this setup, a multi-class classification is considered, by
    considering spectrum availability across space and time. Error-correcting output
    code based multi-class support vector machine classifier is used for classification.
    In a CSS scenario, the number of CRs may not be sufficient to sense all the PU
    channels for some applications. To solve this, a multiuser, multiband SS problem
    was formulated as a partially observable stochastic game in [33], which proposed
    a collaborative distributed multiagent RL-based SS to solve this problem. The
    CRs select a detection threshold such that a constraint on probability of miss
    is satisfied. The selection of the threshold is done according to the required
    diversity order. In each state, each SU chooses a frequency band to sense, and
    receives a reward based on the sensing results. The local decisions are fused
    by considering the neighbouring CRs for each frequency band. The reward each CR
    receives is based on the number of vacant channels. The aim of each CR is to increase
    the expected sum of future rewards given a constraint on the probability of miss.
    To optimize the above goal, an optimal action-value function is used. However,
    constructing lookup-tables of q values across all possible state-action pairs
    is not practical. Therefore, [33] employs a linear approximation on the action-value
    function, which reduces the computational complexity. Through simulation results,
    it is shown that this method provides an efficient way to find vacant spectra
    in a multiuser, multiband CRN. Deep learning (DL) on each CR to know about the
    status of the PU channel is presented in [30]. A matrix containing locally measured
    energy in each frequency band by each CR is fed as input to the DL model. However,
    collecting this information from each SU increases network flow and usage of resources.
    Hence, reinforcement learning (RL) is used to select a few CRs to update their
    locally sensed energy in the input matrix in the present time slot. In RL, there
    is a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation [34]. The term exploitation
    refers to choosing an optimal action from the action space which provides maximum
    rewards, whereas exploration is choosing an action other than the present optimal
    action so as to explore new actions which may provide higher rewards. Exploitation-only
    causes convergence to a suboptimal solution, while frequent exploration decreases
    average rewards. SECTION IV. Dynamic Spectrum Allocation After sensing the channels
    and detecting the spectrum holes, CRs are assigned a channel each for data transmission.
    Conventionally, fixed spectrum is assigned to users to perform data transfers.
    However, in a CRN, the CRs need to vacate the spectrum upon the arrival of the
    PU. Hence DSA is necessary to prevent interference with the PU. The main task
    in DSA is to allocate available channels to different CRs based on a chosen performance
    metric, with a constraint on interference to PUs and other CRs. In [35], DSA for
    a decentralized, ad-hoc CRN is considered. The CRs continuously learn their environment
    and share the information with neighboring CRs over a common channel. Each CR
    learns about the pattern of channel acquisition by the PU and other CRs, which
    is carried out by Tsigankov-Koulakov self-organizing maps, a special case of ANN.
    The throughput of CRs can be significantly improved if patterns in the PU traffic
    is exploited by a learning algorithm. In [36], CRs use a two-stage reinforcement
    learning to estimate the channel to be sensed, and its availability time. In the
    first stage, the modified optimistic Thompson sampling algorithm is used to return
    a list of available channels in order. In the second stage, a Bayesian method
    is employed to determine the length of channel availability. Authors in [37] define
    a monopolistic market environment with a single PU (monopoly), N CRs and C subchannels.
    Each CR bids for channel access from a PU, and the PU gives channel access to
    the highest bidder. Probabilistic reinforcement learning is employed in both PU
    and CRs to learn the optimum strategy. Authors in [38] consider QoS requirements
    of CRs, and an optimization step is proposed before SS. Two strategies are proposed,
    namely wideband predictive sensing (WBPS) and Q-learning enabled WBPS (QWBPS).
    Prediction of future traffic loads of various radio access technologies (RAT)
    such as GSM, LTE, IEEE 802.11n, is performed at the CR base station (BS). In WBPS,
    the BS chooses a RAT with less likely traffic load, based on the request by a
    CR node. Then, CR performs narrow band SS for the activity of that RAT. In QWBPS,
    the BS performs Q-learning by taking input as QoS requirements, demands of the
    CR node and predicted traffic loads to find the best RAT to sense. A. Spectrum
    Auction and Leasing Spectrum auction is an effective method to exploit the under-utilized
    spectrum for data transmission. When not in use, the licensed spectra is auctioned
    to unlicensed users. In return, licensed users relay their transmission through
    the unlicensed users to save power. An extensive survey on the spectrum auction
    procedures for wireless systems is presented in [39]. In-depth analysis of various
    auction models like forward, single-sided, double-sided, open-cry, and sealed
    cry is presented. Further, a survey of single-hop and multi-hop systems are presented
    as examples for resource allocation in CRNs. In DSA, only CRs are assumed to be
    the players. Each player can place a bid by specifying their will to spend certain
    amount of power to relay the PU data. In [40], an asymmetric cooperative communication-based
    spectrum leasing for both centralized and distributed architectures is presented.
    In the former, a decision centre assigns a bid for each PU channel based on the
    previous assignments through reinforcement learning. In the latter, an auction
    game-based protocol is presented, where a CR places a bid on every channel of
    the PU separately. The PUs on each channel selects a CR based on the bid that
    helps it to maximize the total power savings. The PU receivers can learn and adapt
    through reinforcement learning and increase the minimum bid to minimize their
    power spent for data transmission. Repeated auction has been adopted to maximize
    the tradeoff between the gain and cost in accessing channels [40], [41]. CRs are
    selected based on their past auction history and valuations. Spectrum access in
    CR can be formulated as a dynamic game because of the distributed nature of the
    users. In [41], a Bayesian non-parametric belief update scheme is proposed to
    solve such a game. This scheme achieves a good trade-off between fairness and
    efficiency. A two-stage spectrum sharing method is presented in [42]. They consider
    a scenario where each PU has a different amount of spectrum to sublet. The spectrum
    auction is performed in the first stage. Based on the winner, each PU determines
    a limit for the spectrum recall for the next round. In the next stage, using the
    Stackelberg pricing game, spectrum recall on both PUs and CRs is optimized. In
    the Stackelberg game, PUs and CRs act as leaders and followers respectively. Any
    strategy adopted by the PUs affects the actions of the CRs. Therefore PUs adopt
    an optimal strategy by studying the actions taken by the CRs. Spectrum is assigned
    to the winning CR. However, CRs are informed of the spectrum recall. Therefore,
    CRs start competing among themselves to reduce the total sum of recalled spectrum.
    The outcome of this process is reduction in payments. Both theoretical and simulation
    results show that using this two-stage resource allocation scheme in spectrum
    sharing improves the utilities. B. Spectrum Prediction Spectrum prediction is
    an important topic of research in the field of CR, which aims to improve the time
    and energy efficiencies of the SS process. SS with a large number of PU channels
    would require large sensing time and considerable sensing energy. With spectrum
    prediction, CRs minimize the number of channels sensing channels by choosing those
    which have a high chance to be vacant in the upcoming time slot. The prediction
    algorithms have become significantly better with the advent of ML research. This
    section aims to capture some of the key works in this aspect. In [43], four supervised
    ML techniques, recurrent neural networks, multilayer perceptron and SVM (Gaussian
    and linear kernel) were compared for DSA. Poisson, interrupted Poisson and self-similar
    traffics were used for analyzing the PU environment. Among the learning models
    considered, SVM with linear kernel was found to yield a consistently best performance
    across all the traffic patterns. The LSTM networks are a popular choice due to
    its feedback nature and ability to remember past inputs and results. The LSTM
    networks are designed to tackle the problem of longterm dependency. An LSTM network
    was used in [44], whose output was classified into two classes. With the same
    number of hidden layers and neurons, LSTM shows more encouraging results compared
    to the back-propagation network. A deep learning-based approach was developed
    in [45] by simultaneously predicting multi-slot ahead states of multiple spectrum
    points within a period of time. Supervised learning is initially employed to construct
    samples on short and long term high frequency data. Further, advanced residual
    network modules extract characteristics in these data with diverse time scales,
    which are classified using a deep temporal-spectral residual network. A fusion
    of statistical and predictive modelling of spectrum occupancy was proposed in
    [46] for enhanced dynamic spectrum access. An investigation was conducted to characterize
    the spectrum occupancy of the PU with the help of generalized Gaussian mixture
    models(GMMs). Further, the working of the proposed GMM was validated through learning
    based prediction via recurrent neural networks. Neural networks (NN) offer both
    flexibilities in architecture and consistency in results. Hence, a number of variants
    of NN are proposed and are shown to have reliable performance. A multilayer perceptron
    (MLP) is implemented in [47]. The model does not require a prior knowledge of
    the traffic distributions of the PU and hence is particularly useful in real-life
    scenarios. Another architecture that does not require any a priori knowledge is
    the neural network developed on the basis of a genetic algorithm model. Simulation
    results in [48] indicate that such a method can predict spectrum availability
    accurately and further improve the prediction accuracy compared to other neural
    network-based prediction techniques. A further improvement to the conventional
    back propagation (BP) based NN is seen in [49]. For input, channel states are
    used instead of channel power values. An optimization of the back propagation
    method is performed by using momentum algorithm and genetic algorithm in the prediction
    scheme. Further, a threshold interval is applied to determine predicted channel
    states. This is shown to have superior performance when compared to the conventional
    BP based NN. Time delay neural networks are designed to predict time-series data.
    Next, we discuss some challenges encountered while employing ML methods in CRNs.
    SECTION V. Challenges The main challenges associated with ML algorithms in CRNs
    include: (a) complexity of the real-time model, and (b) the convergence of these
    algorithms within a limited time [50]. Most of the ML algorithms learn from a
    pre-recorded dataset. They find patterns, develop understanding and evaluate their
    prediction confidence from the training data. Therefore the training time depends
    on the size of the dataset and the veracity of the dataset [51]. Another challenge
    faced is to ensure that the security of the device and the network is not comprised
    [52]. As the number of devices grows, there is an increase in the device-to-device
    interaction in a distributed architecture. Therefore, PU emulation can send bogus
    SS results, thereby degrading the throughput of the network. In a centralized
    architecture, malicious users can overload the BS with erroneous results. The
    deployed algorithms have to provide a work around to mitigate this. Further, real-world
    test bed for testing these algorithms has not yet been systematically addressed
    [53]. Hence, CR algorithms trained a dataset may not be robust to work effectively
    in a different environment. Robustness and scalability are two key problems which
    are encountered while implementing ML methods for CRNs. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    In this paper, we discussed ML algorithms for CRNs for non-cooperative and cooperative
    SS, spectrum auction and prediction in DSA applications. At a high level, we discussed
    the set of major challenges in CRNs and mentioned the ML techniques to alleviate
    them, and also briefly discussed the challenges in implementation of these ML
    algorithms. Given the pros and cons of the discussed ML techniques, they offer
    a great value addition to performance analysis and practical implementation of
    CRNs in the near future. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Abstract \n \nCognitive radio is a promising wireless communication technology\
    \ that improves spectrum utilization and offers many benefits for \ninternet users.\
    \ Cognitive radio networks utilizes the available limited resources in a more\
    \ efficient and flexible way. The main objective \nof the Cognitive network is\
    \ to efficiently utilize the unutilized spectrum and meet the demand of the secondary\
    \ users. some of the \nimportant features of cognitive of Cognitive radio networks\
    \ are dynamic spectrum access, self organizing  and flexibility. As Cognitive\
    \ \nradio networks are flexible in nature, it will be effected by various security\
    \ attacks which in turn affects the performance of the network. \nFurthermore\
    \ Cognitive radio networks transmit the spectrum in several licensed bands and\
    \ it also performs dynamic spectrum allocation. \nCognitive radio and Cognitive\
    \ radio networks are wireless in nature these face conventional attacks. In this\
    \ survey we address various  \nattacks in different layers , new threats and challenges\
    \ that Cognitive networks face, current available solutions to address layer attacks.\
    \ \nIn addition applications, open problems and future Research challenges are\
    \ also specified. \n  \nKeywords: Cognitive radio, Cognitive radio networks, Layer\
    \ attacks, Security requirements, IEEE 802.22 \n1.  Introduction \nCognitive radio\
    \ is an emerging area which will overcome the \nproblem of underutilization of\
    \ the spectrum. Normally these \nspectrum vales range between 2.4 GHZ to 5 GHZ.\
    \ Normally \nspectrum \nstudies \nare \nconducted \nfederal \ncommunication \n\
    commission (FCC).Many licensed bands such as TV bands are \nunderutilized but\
    \ the unlicensed bands are over utilized. As \nemerging standards like IEEE 802.22\
    \ exploit these underutilized \nspectrums. Basically IEEE 802.22 is a standard\
    \ for Regional area \nnetwork using white spaces. This standard uses Cognitive\
    \ radio \ntechniques[1] to allow sharing of geographically unused spectrum \n\
    allocated to television broadband service. \nIn wireless communication spectrum\
    \ is critical resource and is \nassigned for data transmission for a duration\
    \ of time. Spectrum \nassignment is basically of two types ,i.e static and dynamic\
    \ \nallocations. During static allocation[2] the main problem \nencountered is\
    \  under utilization of spectrum. This problem is \nreduced by the advent of \
    \ Cognitive radio networks. Radio \nequipment in the Cognitive radio networks\
    \ can sense the available \nspectrum around it and reallocate the spectrum. Cognitive\
    \ radio \nnetworks consists of two types of users: Primary users(PU’s) and \n\
    Secondary users(SU’s). Primary users(PU’s)[3] are licensed users \nwhere as secondary\
    \ users(PU’s) are unlicensed. Primary users are \nhaving more priority over secondary\
    \ users. switching and \nbalancing the spectrum between primary and secondary\
    \ users will \nbe taken care by  Cognitive radio networks. This networks are \n\
    more smart and flexible which will dynamically optimize \nspectrum usage[4]. Spectrum\
    \ utilization raises several open issues. \none among them is Providing communication\
    \ and managing the \nspectrum between primary and secondary users in Cognitive\
    \ radio \nnetworks. To overcome the underutilized portions of the spectrum, \n\
    a good idea was proposed by mitola[6]  using Cognitive radio’s.  \n \n \nThese\
    \ Cognitive radio’s are interconnected to form Cognitive \nradio networks. all\
    \ the Cognitive radio’s senses the spectrum  and \nfinds the free portions which\
    \ are called as whitespaces available in \nthe spectrum. These white spaces are\
    \ called as spectrum holes. \nReassignment of Unused spectrum will be taken care\
    \ by cognitive \nradio networks     \nAs we specified Cognitive radio networks\
    \ are open, dynamic, and \nflexible in nature. Hence, these are vulnerable to\
    \ malicious attacks \n[7]. Providing security to these networks is not an easy\
    \ task, this \nspecifies various challenges and it may become more complicated\
    \ \nnow days because day to day number of threats are increasing and \nsecuring\
    \ them is an challenging task .In this work we are \naddressing both traditional\
    \ and new threats specific to Cognitive \nradio networks. some of the  traditional\
    \ threats for Cognitive radio \nnetworks are Eavesdropping, Spoofing, Personal\
    \ user emulation \n,wormhole, sinkhole[8], Sybil attacks and many more. These\
    \ \nconsequences may effect the functionality of the Cognitive radio \nnetworks.\
    \ Hence we require efficient  preventive measures to \nreduce these traditional\
    \ attacks.IEEE 802.22 is the first standard \nwhich utilizes fallow TV bands and\
    \ does the spectrum \nmanagement. This strandard follows all the security mechanisms\
    \ \nsuch as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, privacy and non \nrepudiation.\
    \ however several solutions for these attacks has been \nproposed in this paper.\
    \ \nThe key contributions of this paper are: \n1. clear descriptions of Cognitive\
    \ radio networks in context of \nspectrum usage. \n2. Provides clear description\
    \ about various security threats and \nattacks \n3. Overview of open problems\

    \ \n2.  Cognitive Radio Architecture \nCognitive radio is defined as “It is a\
    \ radio that can change its \ntransmitter \nparameters \ndynamically \ndepending\
    \ \nupon \nthe \nenvironment it operates”. The main aim of cognitive radio is\
    \ to \nseek the white spaces and utilize them for increasing various QOS \nparameters\
    \ such as throughput, reliability and fairness. The \nstandardization of   Cognitive\
    \ radio networks came with the \nadvent of IEEE 802.22,the first standard with\
    \ only one base \nstation and performs spectrum management. To exploit TV white\
    \ \nspaces Europeon computer manufacturing association(ECMA) \ndefines a new standard\
    \ called ECMA-392.This standard opposed \nIEEE 802.22 because 802.22 targets on\
    \ houses and buildings. \nFurthermore ECMA has proposed several standards regarding\
    \ \nreconfigurable radio systems(RRS) \nSome of the main characteristics of Cognitive\
    \ radio networks are: \n1. \nProper sensing of the operating environment: Here\
    \ CR \nWorks in a multi dimensional cooperative and non cooperative \nemitters,\
    \ works accordingly senses the changes in the emitters & \ntraffic and works accordingly.\
    \ \n2. \nEffective Management of Resources: Radio spectrum is a \nvaluable and\
    \ distributed resource. hence spectrum will not be \navailable at a single location.\
    \ Balancing of spectrum at multiple \nlocations will be taken care by Cognitive\
    \ radio’s. \n3. \nManaging Operational state Languages: These languages \nare\
    \ used for sharing the information in the network. As cognitive \nradio networks\
    \ are dynamic in nature its states are informed in the \nnetwork as per changes.\
    \ The language that CRs use for this \npurpose is called operational state languages\
    \ \nThese are some of the important characteristics of  cognitive radio \nnetworks.\
    \ Cognitive radio functions are spectrum sensing, \nSpectrum Management, Mobility\
    \ and Sharing. \nCogntive Cycle: \nAs we already specified cognitive radio is\
    \ a device which senses \nits environment dynamically and assigns the spectrum.\
    \ The \noperation that cognitive radio performs to sense the environment \nis\
    \ referred as Cognitive cycle[9]. The allocation of spectrum from \nprimary to\
    \ secondary users is also done immediately. The main \nKey phases in cognitive\
    \ cycle are Spectrum sensing, Spectrum \nanalysis and spectrum Decision. \n \n\
    \ \n \nFig. 1: Cognitive Radio Architecture \nThe working of each and every phase\
    \ is as follows. \nI. Spectrum Sensing: This is one of the most important phases\
    \ of \nCognitive cycle. Here two types of sensing will be done i.e, fast \nand\
    \ fine sensing. This sensing operation will be done by the Base \nstation, where\
    \ its primary responsibility is detecting the incumbent \nsignals. Same operation\
    \ will be done by IEEE 802.22 by using \nenergy detection method. The main advantages\
    \ of sensing is \nsimplicity and less computational time, so that it became an\
    \ \nimportant operation in the cognitive architecture. Some of the \npopular spectrum\
    \ sensing techniques used by the cognitive \nnetworks are Cooperative sensing,\
    \ Wave form based sensing, \nmatch filtering, cyclostationery based sensing and\
    \ many more.     \nII. Spectrum Analysis: Here analysis of available holes \n\
    information will be done and it is purely statistical based process. \nIt analyses\
    \ several channels and network characteristics like \nDelay, Error rate etc. The\
    \ collected and analyzed information will \nbe given as an input to the next phase\
    \ i.e spectrum decision \nprocess. \nIII. Spectrum Decision :In this phase the\
    \ most appropriate \nspectrum hole is selected for transmission. Once selected\
    \ it will be \nreused by another secondary user. \nThe above functionality of\
    \ all the phases will gives an abstract \nview of each and every phase. \n3. \
    \ CRN Security Requirements \nAs cognitive networks are wireless in nature they\
    \ have all the \nsecurity requirements which are in the wireless networks. Some\
    \ of \nthe requirements are as follows[10]: \na. \nConfidentiality: all the users\
    \ in the cognitive networks are \ninterested in keeping their data confidential.\
    \ They have to ensure \nthat their messages are only received by the Authorized\
    \ users in \nthe network. One of the major application of CRN is military, here\
    \ \ndata should be kept confidential. \nb. \nAvailability: The spectrum required\
    \  to the primary users \nmust be available to all the users in the CRN’s. All\
    \ the base \nstations consists of various security measures to make the data \n\
    available to all the Primary and Secondary users. \nc. \nAuthentication:  Authenticating\
    \ all the users in CRN’s i.e \nPrimary , Secondary users  and all the other devices\
    \ is essential for \nsecure data transmission. Major threats in the CRN’s will\
    \ be \novercome by using various cryptographic techniques like Public \nand Private\
    \ key cryptographies. These are majorly required in all \nthe algorithms of cryptography.\
    \   \nd. \nIntegrity: It is not sure that all the messages sent by the \nbase\
    \ station, CRN, Primary and secondary users have not been \nmodified in the due\
    \ course. This security requirement that data has \nnot been modified from Primary\
    \ to secondary users and vice \nversa. To maintain integrity ,we use Cryptographic\
    \ Hash functions \nand MAC’s. \ne. \nNonrepudiation: In communication parties\
    \ sender will not \ndeny sending a message and receiver do not want to deny \n\
    receiving a message, we can call it as sender receiver non \nrepudiation in CRN.\
    \ Necessary cryptology has to be developed to \nensure this non repudiation at\
    \ sender and receiver similarly CRN \ndo not deny a message received from a Base\
    \ station. \n4.  Layer Attacks \ni.  Physical Layer Attacks: \n \nPhysical Layer\
    \ is the bottom layer which is used for \ncommunication between two networking\
    \ devices. This layer is \nvulnerable to many threats. Some of them are discussed\
    \ below.[7-\n20] \n \na. Primary User Emulation Attack: (PUEA) \n \nPUEA is the\
    \ major among all the attacks. This attack gained more \nattention from all the\
    \ researchers. In CRN’s, secondary users use \n374 \nInternational Journal of\
    \ Engineering & Technology \n \nthe available spectrum only when it remains unused.\
    \ And \nsecondary users have to vacate the spectrum whenever primary \nuser wants\
    \ it. For this reason secondary users will continuously \ncheck for primary user.\
    \ In this attack, the attackers do not allow \nthe secondary users from using\
    \ available spectrum. The attackers \nact as primary user by transmitting signals\
    \ those characteristics \nwhich are similar to primary user’s signals. Whenever\
    \ the \nsecondary user found those signals it will automatically vacate the \n\
    spectrum and this will occupy by the attacker (who is pretended as \nprimary user).\
    \ And this secondary user moves to the next available \nspectrum by detecting\
    \ another PU’s. If attacker again detect that  \nnext available spectrum band,\
    \ he/she could also make unavailable \nfor secondary users resulting Denial of\
    \ Service (DoS). There are \ntwo types of PUEA: i) Malicious PUEA, ii) Selfish\
    \ PUEA. \nMalicious PUEA: In this type of PUEA, Attackers do not allow \nthe SU’s\
    \ to use the available spectrum. Their main goal is to \nreduce the spectrum utilization.\
    \ Here attackers will not use band \nfor their own purpose. \nSelfish PUEA: In\
    \ this type of PUEA, attacker acts as SU who is \nselfish and if he detects that\
    \ spectrum is unused then he could \nmake it unavailable for the secondary users.\
    \ \n \n \n \n \nFig 2: Primary User Emulation attack \n \nOne example of PUEA\
    \ is explained in the below diagram. The \nnetwork has 10 available channels.\
    \ In which channels (1,4) and \n(2,3,5) are occupied by primary users, while the\
    \ remaining \n(6,7,8,9,10) remains idle so that they can be used by secondary\
    \ \nusers. But the attacker occupies the channels (7,8,9). Therefore, \nonly two\
    \ channels (6,10) are available for secondary users.  \n \n \n \n   \nFig 3: Example\
    \ of PUE attack \n \nTo mitigate PUE attack, a technique called Principal component\
    \ \nanalysis for spectrum sensing is used. In this technique all the \nSU’s send\
    \ details about all PU’s they have observed to the Fusion \nCentre(FC). And this\
    \ center also keep information about SU’s \nTransmission Signal power. By collecting\
    \ all this information \nFusion Center correctly identify the PU and discard the\
    \ suspected \nnode.  Another method which is called as Belief Propagation is \n\
    used to mitigate this attack. In this technique, all the secondary \nusers has\
    \ to follow some sequence of steps until the suspected \nnode is identified and\
    \ discarded from sending process. \n \nB. Objective Function Attack: \n \n \n\
    \ \nNormally cognitive radio has the capacity to modify its radio \nparameters\
    \ based on the current situation. By this adversary will \nattack this objective\
    \ function by wrongly predicting its parameters \nto meet its own objective function.\
    \ Objective function main aim is \nhigh data rate and low power. For example we\
    \ consider the \nfollowing objective function: \n \n \n \nf = w1P + w2R \nwhere\
    \ w1,w2 are the weights of power and data rate. The attacker \nwill modify any\
    \ one of these parameter in the function to make \nCR to use wrong channel. By\
    \ do this he can make to move the CR \nto low security channel which is less secure.\
    \ \nTo mitigate this attack, we must set the predefined threshold for \nthese\
    \ parameters. By doing this, we can stop the communication if \nthe values of\
    \ parameters cross the threshold and this will be \nreported to the Fusion Center(FC).\
    \ \n \nC. Jamming Attack \n \nIn this attack, the attacker aim is to send packet\
    \ out of network so \nthat they can block the legitimate user from participating\
    \ in \ncommunication. This will cause denial of service. \nTo mitigate this attack,\
    \ the primary user information about the \nlocation must be kept by the secondary\
    \ users. Secondary users get \nthis information by connecting to base station.\
    \ \n \nii. Data Link Layer Attacks: \n \nMostly attacks in the data link layer\
    \ are due to the attack of MAC \naddress. Some of the attacks are discussed below.\
    \ \n \nA. Specturm Sensing Data Falsification Attack: \n \nIn this attack, attackers\
    \ acts as legitimate members of the network \nand shares false sensing information\
    \ to the decision stream. So \nthat they will get more available spectrum for\
    \ their own   purpose \nwhich reduces throughput. To mitigate this attack a new\
    \ method is \nintroduced. By using this method the center fusion will keep track\
    \ \nthat how many no.of times all the nodes make correct decisions \nabout presence\
    \ of PU’s. \n \nB. Control channel saturation attack \n \nGenerally in CRN’s,\
    \ there will be only one control channel to \ncarry the traffic between the users.\
    \ This control channel will enter \nthe saturation state when it is not able to\
    \ carry more control traffic. \nBy knowing this the attacker intentionally make\
    \ the control \nchannel to saturate. So that attacker can reduce the no.of \n\
    legitimate nodes to use spectrum. And attacker can use all the \navailable frequency\
    \ bands. \nTo mitigate this attack the network is categorized into clusters. \n\
    And each cluster will have its own control channel. If the control \nchannel of\
    \ one cluster is attacked, the control channels of other \nclusters will remain\
    \ unaffected. \n \niii. Network Layer Attacks:  \n \nThis layer is one of the\
    \ important layer because it routes the data \npackets from one network to other.\
    \ There are many threats in this \nlayer. Some of them are discussed here. \n\
    \ \nA. Hello Attack \n \nIn this attack, the attacker sends the message to all\
    \ the other nodes \nin the network to inform that it is the best route to reach\
    \ the \ndestination within the network. The attacker will send the \nmessages\
    \ with high power to the other nodes and they receive \nInternational Journal\
    \ of Engineering & Technology \n375 \n \nwith good signal strength. So that attacker\
    \ can convince the nodes \nas their neighbors. By this all other nodes may think\
    \ attacker as \ntheir neighbor and send packets through the attackers and lost\
    \ \nthem. \nTo mitigate this attack we should make the bidirectional links \n\
    between the nodes and messages sent through these nodes must be \nverified by\
    \ Fusion Center (FC). \n \nB. Sinkhole Attack \n \nIn this attack, the attacker\
    \ tells other nodes as it is the best route to \nreach the particular destination\
    \ and motivates them to forward \npackets through them. By using this attacker\
    \ may launch a new \ntype of attack called selective forwarding in which it is\
    \ able to \nmodify or discard a packet in the network. \nTo mitigate this attack,\
    \ authentication mechanism is used. In \nwhich every node joining the network\
    \ must be authenticated and \nverified. And the suspected node is discarded before\
    \ joining the \nnetwork.  \n \nC. Sybil Attack \n \nIn this attack, to represent\
    \ a identity the attacker uses many fake \nidentities. So that he can able to\
    \ cheat the legitimate node. This \nattack mainly affects the co-operative spectrum\
    \ sensing technique \nwhere attacker sends wrong sensing information to make wrong\
    \ \ndecisions. \nTo mitigate this attack we use node’s identity validation \n\
    technique. In this we use two types of validation- Direct and \nIndirect. In Direct\
    \ validation identity of the node is verified \ndirectly. In indirect validation\
    \ the identity of node is verified by \nthe other nodes. \n \n iv. Transport Layer\
    \ Attacks \n \nIn Cognitive Radio networks, transport layer has many no of \n\
    attacks. \nA. Key Depletion Attack \n \nCognitive Radio network has more no. of\
    \ retransmissions and \nhigh round trip times therefore it has less transport\
    \ layer sessions \nand most of these sessions are occurred between communication\
    \ \nparties. Generally there may be many transport layer protocols \nsuch as Secure\
    \ Socket Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security \n(TLS). These protocols will generate\
    \ many cryptographic keys at \nthe start of each session. And more session keys\
    \ are generated for \nmany \nsessions. \nTherefore \nthe \nattackers \nlisten\
    \ \nto \nthe \ncommunication and steal the session key. By using these keys they\
    \ \ncan send and receive the session data. \nTo mitigate this attack, we have\
    \ to perform session key sharing in \nmore secure way by using new ciphering algorithms.\
    \ \n \nv. CROSS LAYER ATTACKS \n \nCross layer Attacks are the attacks that targets\
    \ one layer and have \nconsequences over other layers. \n \nA. Lion Attack \n\
    \ \nThis is a kind of cross layer attack, where the attacker performs \nthe attack\
    \ at the physical layer to degrade the performance of \nTransmission Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) at transport layer. In this \nattack, the attacker jams the channel or\
    \ performs PUE attack. PUE \nattack forces the secondary user to frequently perform\
    \ the \nfrequency handoff. This frequency handoff interruption will \nreduce the\
    \ throughout. \nThe impact of this attack can be reduced if we provided proper\
    \ \ninformation about handoff’s to transport layer. To mitigate this \nattack\
    \ we introduce a technique called Freeze TCP by which we \ncan easily predict\
    \ the upcoming disconnection of window. \n \n \nTable 1: Layer Attacks and their\

    \ Security Threats \nIn CRN communication, Security is one of the most important\
    \ \naspect. As CRN’s are the kind of wireless networks, so they suffer \nmore\
    \ to the attacks. These attacks include the privacy of wireless  \n \n \nnode\
    \ which includes eavesdropping, impersonation and traffic \nanalysis. Here we\
    \ discuss some among them.  \n \n \n \n \nA. \nEavesdropping and Impersonation\
    \ \n \nIn Eavesdropping attack, the attacker listens to communication to \nknow\
    \ information about the communicating parties, PUs and \nSU’s. This information\
    \ is used to launch replay attack or \nimpersonation attack. To mitigate this\
    \ attack, we use the encrypted \nand time stamped messages. In Impersonation attack,\
    \ the attackers \nsteal the identity of the legitimate node and use this identity\
    \ to \nestablish communication with other nodes. To mitigate this attack, \nanonymous\
    \ ID’s to all PU’s is introduced. These ID’s can be \nchanged along with the encryption\
    \ keys. \n \n376 \nInternational Journal of Engineering & Technology \n \nB. \n\
    Selective Forwarding Attack \n \n \nIn this attack, certain messages are not forwarded\
    \ to the \noriginal CR node by the malicious node. This malicious node will \n\
    destroy those messages and acts as a block hole. To mitigate this \nattack, the\
    \ CR node or BS uses a time limit strategy. If the limit \nfor particular message\
    \ is exceeded and the message is not received \nthen BS will be informed to resend\
    \ the message to PU or SU \nthrough another secure route.  \n \nC. Sinkhole and\
    \ Sybil Attack \n \n \nIn this attack, the incorrect information about the high\
    \ \nquality route to sink is advertised by the attackers To mitigate this \nattack,\
    \ the certificates are introduced which are issued by the BS \nor by Cognitive\
    \ Radio Network Authority. In Sybil attack, the \nmalicious node is pretended\
    \ to be present at multiple places, so \nthat the BS will believe it as the moving\
    \ legitimate node. To \nmitigate this type of attack we use anonymous ID’s and\
    \ \ncertificates are used.  \n \nD. \nWorm Hole Attack \n \n \nIn this attack,\
    \ the malicious node will believe the other CR \nnodes as their neighbors which\
    \ in fact for away from them. So that \ntheir identities and real addresses can\
    \ be destroyed. To mitigate \nthis attack, the BS will provide anonymous ID’s\
    \ and their \ndistances for each node and this information must be encrypted.\
    \ \n \nE. \nHello flood attack \n \n \nIn this attack, to establish the communication,\
    \ the attacker \nwill broadcast the HELLO message to all nodes in the network.\
    \ \nThe attacker will spoof to the acknowledgement which is used by \nsome link\
    \ layer protocols and attackers use this information to \nconvince other nodes\
    \ that weak links between the nodes as strong \nlinks. So these weak links will\
    \ be used for routing the packets \nbetween nodes and these packets will be corrupted\
    \ or lost. To \nmitigate this attack, we use certificates and authentication.\
    \ Some \nhigher layers use the secure protocols \n. \n6.  Specific Security Threats\
    \ \nIn addition to traditional threats[15], CRN’s has the new kind of \nthreats\
    \ due to the specific threats due to their specific functions. \nSome of them\
    \ are discussed below. \n \nA. \nHardware Attacks \n \nIn this attack, hardware\
    \ of the some of the nodes is altered or \ndamaged. The result of this attack\
    \ may cause the shutting down of \nthe node completely or transmitting signals\
    \ in a completely wrong \nfrequency band. To mitigate this attack we must provide\
    \ hardware \nencryption. So that hardware of node cannot be accessed by \nattacker.\
    \  \n \nB. \nCr Software Attacks \n \nThe impact of the software attacks in CRN’s\
    \ is greater when \ncompared to other network because of their characteristics.\
    \ This \nsoftware attacks can completely make CRN’s shutdown. To \nsuppress the\
    \ malicious software installation we have to use the \ntamper resistance and virus\
    \ detection techniques[22]. There is a \ngreat need to download the softwares\
    \ from the trusted servers. \nWith these attacks we have to protect authentication,\
    \ authorization \nand integrity of software installations from being eavesdropping.\
    \ \n \nC. \nPrimary User Emulation Attack \n \nIn this attack, attacker is disguised\
    \ as PU and  all characteristics \nand signals are advertised to all nodes. There\
    \ are many types of \nPUE attacks[5]. Here we discuss some among them. The denial\
    \ \nPUE attack will occur whenever the attacker will provide the \nwrong information\
    \ to the SU as the PU is occupying it. This forces \nSU to  stop using  frequency\
    \ band and it is vacated. The another \nPUE attack is Induced PUE attack, in this\
    \ attack the attacker \nadvertises the high frequency signals[12] so that SU fails\
    \ to \nidentify the presence of PU. In co-ordinated PUE attack, many \nmalicious\
    \ nodes will co-ordinate with each other to launch attacks \non different channels\
    \ so that as many as CRN’s become disrupted. \nTo mitigate PUE attack, we ise\
    \ a scheme called Localization \nBased Defense and another method to mitigate\
    \ this attack is \nauthentication. \n \nD. \nJamming Distruption Attack \n \n\
    In Cognitive Radio, one can perform Jamming during data \ntransmission. Here the\
    \ attacker will not consider the PU and \ncompete with PU to access channel which\
    \ will cause the DoS for \nPU.  To mitigate this attack CR’s should check ID’s,\
    \ certificates \nand authenticate the transmitting node. \n \nE. \nSpectrum Sensing\
    \ Data Attack \n \nThis type of attack will be occurred due to incorrect spectral\
    \ \nanalysis which results in making wrong decision of assigning \nbands to primary\
    \ users and secondary users. \n \nF. \nSecondary Spectrum Data Falsification (Ssdf)\
    \ \n \nThis type of attack will occur whenever nodes are not able to \nidentify\
    \ the available PU’s. SSDF attacks can be launched in three \nways: \n- \nDenial\
    \ SSDF:  Whenever attacker will advertise about \nchannel unavailability. \n-\
    \ \nInduce SSDF: whenever attacker falsely advertise about \nchannel occupation.\
    \ \n- \nSybil-based SSDF: In this type, the attackers will provide \ninformation\
    \ about the sensing functionalities to other nodes. So \nthat the legitimate nodes\
    \ believe the malicious nodes will provide \ncorrect information about existing\
    \ PU.  \nThis attack can be mitigated by using the authentication schemes \nbetween\
    \ Fusion Center and sensing SU’s. \n \nTable 2: General and Specific Attacks and\

    \ \nCognitive radio networks are a rapidly growing area with 1its \nmain characteristics\
    \ of adaptability, availability, learning, \ncooperative spectrum sensing and\
    \ spectrum handoff. This survey \nmainly concentrates on classification and security\
    \ attacks in \ndifferent layers of cognitive networks. As cognitive radio \nnetworks\
    \ are open like wireless networks, we require proper \nauthentication to verify\
    \ various users and to identify malicious \noutsiders. In this paper we have identified\
    \ potential security \nthreatsand attacks in cognitive radio networks. We also\
    \ provided \nvarious counter measures and mitigation techniques to these \npotential\
    \ security threats. Security is a long-term research \nchallenge in CRN’s. some\
    \ important research issues are PUE \nattacks, worm hole attacks, cross layer\
    \ attacks, dynamic spectrum \nsensing techniques and many more. all these challenges\
    \ require \nfurther research.        \n8. \nApplications \nand \nFuture \nResearch\

    (CR) is regarded as a promising technology to provide high bandwidth to mobile
    users via heterogeneous wireless network architectures and dynamic spectrum access
    techniques, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) may also impose some challenges due
    to factors such as the ever increasing complexity of network architecture and
    the increasing complexity with configuration and management of large-scale networks.
    In this paper, fundamentals of CR, including spectrum sensing, spectrum management,
    spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing, are surveyed, with their paradigms of
    self-organization being emphasized. Besides, variant aspects of self-organization
    paradigms in CRNs, including critical functionalities of Media Access Control
    (MAC)- and network-layer operations, are surveyed. This survey also identifies
    new directions and open problems in CRNs. Published in: 2013 8th International

    I. Introduction Since modern communications networks must deliver ever increasing
    data rates at an ever decreasing cost per bit, the spectral efficiency has to
    be further improved. Hence, a new communication paradigm, i.e., dynamic spectrum
    access (DSA), whose key enabling technology is referred to as Cognitive Radio
    (CR), was recently proposed to solve these spectrum inefficiency problems [1].
    However, DSA technology suffers from low scalability and convergence. Moreover,
    cognitive radio networks (CRNs), as envisioned to provide high bandwidth to mobile
    users via heterogeneous wireless architecture and DSA techniques, may also impose
    new challenges due to the ever increasing complexity of network architecture 1
    For example, the spatial reuse of the spectrum can be increased by deploying large
    number of pico-cells and femtocells, and a combination of macro-cells and small
    cells consequently leads to a heterogeneous network being developed [2]. , fluctuating
    nature of the available spectrum and some other important issues that affect the
    Quality-of-Service (QoS) of user applications [3]. Furthermore, some challenges,
    such as the increasing complexity with configuration and management of large-scale
    networks, the upgrading capital expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures
    (OPEX), and the intensifying difficulties of centralized control, etc, will further
    arise in the future heterogeneous networks [4]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    due to the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, as well as the diverse
    QoS requirements of various applications. Spectrum management functions can address
    these challenges for the realization of this new network paradigm. To provide
    a better understanding of CR networks, this article presents recent developments
    and open research issues in spectrum management in CR networks. More specifically,
    the discussion is focused on the development of CR networks that require no modification
    of existing networks. First, a brief overview of cognitive radio and the CR network
    architecture is provided. Then four main challenges of spectrum management are
    discussed: spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum
    mobility. Published in: IEEE Communications Magazine ( Volume: 46, Issue: 4, April

    are characterized by a static spectrum allocation policy, where governmental agencies
    assign wireless spectrum to license holders on a long-term basis for large geographical
    regions. Recently, because of the increase in spectrum demand, this policy faces
    spectrum scarcity in particular spectrum bands. In contrast, a large portion of
    the assigned spectrum is used sporadically, leading to underutilization of a significant
    amount of spectrum [1]. Hence, dynamic spectrum access techniques were recently

    in every aspects of web usage by the end users. Its essential purpose is information
    retrieval, packet transmission, communication between networks via wired and wireless
    mode. Subsequently wireless data networks and transmission are renowned by a fixed
    spectrum obligation policy and therefore that spectrum utilization becomes very
    significant one, in which new communication techniques are keep on increasing
    and the spectrum bandwidth remains limited because of unlicensed users. Cognitive
    radio is an innovatory technology to make use of the limited spectrum more successful.
    Cognitive Radio (CR) aspires to look up for the spectrum utilization by taking
    improvement of licensed user or primary user, which are so-called unused spectrum.
    Cognitive Radio has extensive applications together with dynamic spectrum access
    allocation and interference management, which will largely blow the NeXt Generation
    Network (xG) for wireless devices and networks. This new networking model is referred
    to as NeXt Generation (xG) Network as well as known as Dynamic Spectrum Access
    (DSA) and Cognitive Radio Networks. Eventually the performance and reliability
    of CR can be increased through the cross-layer design approach in the (xG) networks.
    In this paper, we carry out a survey on CR networks from various portions such
    as waveform, spectrum management and sensing, similarities between intelligent
    antenna and CR, performance and reliability evaluations etc. Published in: 2012

    Coimbatore, India I. Introduction Cognitive radio is an emerging and promising
    technology for getting the most out of consumption of the limited radio bandwidth
    while accommodating the increasing amount of network services and applications
    in wireless network techniques. The cognitive radio networks are almost done for
    dynamic spectrum allocation to access the networks. The key features of cognitive
    radio network are wideband signal processing techniques for digital radio, advanced
    wireless communications methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning
    techniques, and cognitive radio-aware adaptive wireless/mobile networking protocols.
    The spectrum bandwidth allocation is generally designed for effectual and accessible
    transmission for licensed users. Even the unlicensed user makes use of this spectrum
    bandwidth, therefore which makes the spectrum inefficient and hence collision
    occurs. In this critical case the transmission signal and spectrum bandwidth becomes
    lifeless. The main aspect of cognitive radio is to identify the idle spectrum
    in the network for the licensed users to make efficient. Sign in to Continue Reading

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: In advanced radio
    communication systems, most of the radio spectrum remains underutilized. To fully
    utilize the radio spectrum, an efficient allocation of the scarce and expensive
    radio resources is most important and challenging. As a solution of this problem,
    cognitive radio network (CRN) can make better use of the radio spectrum by allowing
    the secondary users (SU) to opportunistically access and share the licensed spectrum
    using dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technology. There are two main sharing techniques
    in CRN based on the access technology: 1) over-lay; 2) under-lay. In over-lay
    mode, secondary user can access only vacant spectrum in the absence of primary
    user (PU) but in underlay mode, the SUs can coexist with the PUs in the same channel
    under the SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio) constraints. To further
    improve the spectrum scarcity, both over-lay and under-lay approaches gets combined
    under SINR constraints to make a hybrid cognitive radio. In this paper, we provide
    a survey for different methods of hybrid cognitive radio in which under-lay and
    over-lay modes are merged using different techniques to efficiently utilize the
    scarce radio spectrum. Published in: 2018 Second International Conference on Electronics,

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India I. Introduction The fixed
    spectrum allocation and access strategies results in increasing the inefficient
    utilization of the radio spectrum. The growing bandwidth demand due to the numerous
    wireless applications leads to the failure of this fixed spectrum allocation policies
    [3]. Also, according to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) recent report,
    only 6% part of the expensive radio spectrum is utilized properly, the other remains
    underutilized [1]–[2]. As a solution of this spectrum scarcity problem, a new
    communication technology is introduced known as dynamic spectrum access (DSA)
    to exploit the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically [4]. DSA allows secondary
    users (SUs) to access the licensed spectrum bands opportunistically without harming
    the performance of primary users (PUs) [5]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    3 Citations Abstract In the existing scenario, the radio spectrum is allocated
    and divided between unlicensed and licensed frequencies. Due to this policy, some
    portions of the spectrum remain unused. To cope with this situation, a new communication
    paradigm is introduced, known as Cognitive Radio (CR). One of the main challenges
    in Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is the sharing of spectrum. Spectrum sharing
    allows several CR nodes for transmission by using vacant spectrum resources. It
    can be conducted in both distributed and centralized environment. Centralized
    spectrum sharing can be impractical with the severe increase in spectrum demand.
    But distributed spectrum sharing along with consumer devices having Cognitive
    Radio capabilities, provides a realistic spectrum sharing solution. There are
    three spectrum sharing techniques in dynamic spectrum access (DSA), i.e., underlay,
    overlay and interweave. Major spectrum sharing challenges are: Common Control
    Channel and Dynamic Radio Range. There are many other challenging issues still
    need additional investigations, thus, making Cognitive Radio an open research
    area. In this chapter, we present a detail survey on different spectrum sharing
    techniques in CRN. This chapter also presents different performance evaluation
    parameters to ensure the quality of the spectrum sharing technique. At last it
    presents various challenges and issues associated with spectrum sharing and the
    future research opportunities in this area. This will present a clear vision to

    Cognitive radio Spectrum sharing Centralized system Distributed system 19.1 Introduction
    The concept of cognitive radio (CR) has recently been a great area of interest
    among the researchers. It was first introduced by Joseph Mitola III in 1998, who
    described it as a fully reconfigurable wireless system that can intelligently
    change its communication parameters according to the user or network needs. This
    ability of cognitive radio is used in sharing of spectrum between primary and
    secondary users. The radio spectrum can be divided between unlicensed and licensed
    frequencies. Due to this inflexible policy, some portions of the spectrum remain
    unused. To cope with this situation, a new communication paradigm is introduced,
    known as Cognitive Radio. Some features of cognitive radio are: Cognitive Capability:
    Find the portion for the transmission in the whole spectrum. Reconfigurability:
    This feature is used to adjust the parameter without modifying the hardware components.
    In CR networks, one of the main challenges in open spectrum usage is the spectrum
    sharing which can be defined as the sharing of idle spectrum by the primary users
    with the secondary users. The CR process consists of four major steps, those are
    known as functional blocks of cognitive radio [1]. Those are in Fig. 19.1. Fig.
    19.1 Four functional blocks of cognitive radio Full size image Spectrum Sensing:
    It determines the presence of the primary user (PU/Licensed user) and spectrum
    availability. A portion of the spectrum can be allocated to a secondary user (SU)
    when that is not used by any other secondary user. Before transmitting a packet,
    a SU should be aware of the spectrum usage in its surrounding. Spectrum Management:
    It predicts the duration of the availability of the spectrum holes to be used
    by SUs (Unlicensed user). The most unique problems associated to spectrum management
    are coexistence with the primary network, interference with the primary network,
    etc. Spectrum Sharing: It shares the spectrum among the SUs according to their
    usage. Some spectrum sharing challenges are spectrum resource management, coexistence
    between heterogeneous wireless technologies, etc. Spectrum Mobility: It maintains
    seamless communication while switching from one portion of the spectrum to another.
    The functionalities of the above CR functional blocks are shown in Fig. 19.2.
    Fig. 19.2 Functionalities of functional blocks Full size image 19.1.1 Outline
    of Spectrum Sharing Techniques According to Feizresan and Omidi in [2], the present
    spectrum sharing solutions in CR network can be classified in three parts, i.e.,
    according to the spectrum access behavior, network architecture and spectrum access
    methods, shown in Fig. 19.3. Fig. 19.3 Spectrum sharing techniques Full size image
    The first classification for spectrum sharing techniques is based on the architecture
    [1, 2], which is described below: Centralized spectrum sharing: In this solution,
    the access procedures and spectrum allocation is controlled by a centralized entity
    [1]. In a distributed centralized approach, each node in the CR network participate
    in spectrum allocation by providing information to the centralized entity to prepare
    the spectrum allocation map. This works as a master-slave model. Distributed spectrum
    sharing: This method is adopted where infrastructure building is not adequate
    [1]. Here, each node is responsible for the spectrum allocation and access is
    based on local (or possibly global)policies. Some of the centralized and distributed
    spectrum sharing techniques are discussed in the next section. The second classification
    is based on the access behavior [2], which is described as follows: Cooperative
    spectrum sharing: In this method, CR users coordinate the functionalities of the
    cognitive network to improve the efficiency of the network by exchanging information
    and guarantee the optimization of spectrum utilization [3]. Duan et al. [4], studied
    the cooperative spectrum sharing between a PU and multiple SUs. For this purpose,
    they used a contract based approach and studied the optimal contract designing
    for various information scenario. Non-cooperative spectrum sharing: This method
    is also known as non-collaborative spectrum sharing method. Here, a CR user is
    not responsible for the coordination of cognitive functionalities with other CR
    users [3]. Liu et al. [5], proposed a demand-matching technique which follows
    game theory for non-cooperative cognitive radio network. This algorithm allows
    each SU to access multiple channels by maximizing its own payoff. The main difference
    between the above two methods is that the first approach requires a common control
    channel (CCC) for the exchange of information, while in the second approach the
    CR users performs the tasks of the network functions on their own without any
    collaboration with other CR users. Spectrum sharing can be classified based on
    the access technology as follows: Overlay spectrum sharing: In this method, a
    CR user uses the spectrum holes, which are not used by the PU, to access the network,
    so that the interference to PU is reduced [6]. Figure 19.4 depicts the overlay
    spectrum sharing. Underlay spectrum sharing: This method uses the spread spectrum
    techniques to access the networks. Once the spectrum allocation map is ready,
    a CR user starts the communication. But there is a possibility of intervention
    between the users [3]. Compared to the overlay technique, it needs more bandwidth.
    It is shown in Fig. 19.5. Fig. 19.4 Overlay spectrum sharing Full size image Fig.
    19.5 Underlay spectrum sharing Full size image The present spectrum sharing techniques
    can be divided into two types: 1. Intra network spectrum sharing: It focuses on
    the sharing of spectrum between the entities of a CR network [7]. Centralized
    intra network spectrum sharing Distributed intra network spectrum sharing 2. Inter
    network spectrum sharing: It focuses on the sharing of spectrum between multiple
    coexisting CR networks [7, 8]. Centralized inter network spectrum sharing Distributed
    inter network spectrum sharing Figure 19.6 shows the difference between both the
    above techniques. Fig. 19.6 Inter-network and intra-network spectrum sharing in
    CR network Full size image Spectrum sharing in centralized intra network: In this
    technique, there exist a spectrum server and all the CR users are coordinated
    by the spectrum server [1]. Spectrum sharing in centralized inter network:Exerting
    of this technique is very much similar to the previous technique, but instead
    of a spectrum server, here a spectrum broker is used to share the spectrum among
    different CR users [1]. Spectrum sharing in distributed intra network: In this
    technique, no single user takes its own spectrum sharing decision. Here each CR
    user plays its own role in sharing process [1]. Spectrum sharing in distributed
    inter network: Here each user takes part in the spectrum sharing process. The
    rest of the chapter is organized as follows: Section 19.2: Discuss on the centralized
    and distributed spectrum sharing algorithms, which are given by different researchers.
    Section 19.3: Discuss on some of the measuring parameters based on which the techniques
    are compared. Centralized and distributed spectrum sharing techniques are compared
    in Sect. 19.4. Current issues and research directions are discussed in Sect. 19.5.
    19.2 2 Centralized and Distributed Spectrum Sharing Techniques The major notations
    adopted in this section are given in Table 19.1. Table 19.1 Major adopted notations
    Full size table 19.2.1 Centralized Spectrum Sharing Algorithms Ning et al. [4]
    have presented the following algorithm for spectrum sharing based on heterogeneity
    of spectrum in centralized CR networks [1]. Here, a unique channel is assigned
    to each node, based on location of the node, its channel occupancy time and fairness
    of channel access opportunity. Step 1: Calculate the channel occupation time Tc
    as: \(T_c = d/v\) where \(d = \sqrt{R^2-h^2} + s * cos \alpha \) and \(h = s *
    sin \alpha , 0\le \alpha \le \pi \) Step 2: Determine the location weight \(m^l_p\)
    which is given by a 3*3 weighted matrix as: $$ m= \begin{bmatrix} 1&0.5&0.25 \\
    0&1&0.5 \\ 0&0&1 \end{bmatrix} $$ Step 3: Calculate the fairness factor as: $$\begin{aligned}
    fi = \dfrac{Nblock + 1}{Naccess + 1} \end{aligned}$$ Step 4: Calculate the utility
    function by going through the following steps: Step 4.1: Determine \(\phi ^l_i\)
    to predict the availability of the channel for communication. $$ \phi ^l_i = {\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \quad \text {if } d_{i\rightarrow CR-BS} \le R_l\\ 0 &{}
    \quad \text {if } d_{i\rightarrow CR-BS} \ge R_l \end{array}\right. } $$ Step
    4.2: Determine \(\beta _i^l\) as: $$ \beta _i^l = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1
    &{} \quad \text {if } T_{c,i}^l \ge T_{th}\\ 0 &{} \quad \text {if } T_{c,i}^l
    \le T_{th} \end{array}\right. } $$ Step 4.3: Determine \(\gamma _i^{l,j}\) as:
    $$ \gamma _i^{l,j} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \quad \text {if channel
    j is available for both}\; SU_i\;{\text {and CR-BS}}\\ 0 &{} \quad \text {otherwise}
    \end{array}\right. } $$ Step 4.4: The utility function \(u_i^{l,j}\) is calculated
    as: \(u_i^{l,j} = \phi _i^l * \gamma _i^{l,j} * \beta _i^l * m_p^l * f_i * T_{c,i}^l\)
    Step 5: Final system utilization is maximized as \(Max \Sigma j \in C_{CR-BS}u_i^{l,j}\)
    Ni and Collings [9] have proposed a heuristic spectrum sharing technique to allow
    reusability of the available frequency among the networks by maximizing cell satisfaction
    and utilization of spectrum [9]. They have proposed the following heuristic method.
    1. Construct all the cardinality-maximized cliques 2. Generate all the possible
    permutations of m cliques, \(\{P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_{m!}\}\) 3. For i = 1 to m!
    4. \(P_i = \{C_1^i, C_2^i, \ldots , C_m^i\}\) 5. Initialize the relative GB and
    its upper/lower bounds: 6. While \(b_G^0 \ne B_G/P_c^i\) 7. For j = 1 to M 8.
    Calculate \(XOS^i_{j,n}\) 9. Remove the vertices indicated by \(OS^i_{j,n}\),
    n = (1, 2) End 10. Calculate \(P_c^i\) 11. If \(B_G^0 \ge B_G\) \(b_G^U = (b_G^0
    + b_G^U)/2\) else \(b_G^D = (b_G^0 + b_G^D)/2\) End 12. \(b_G^0 = (b_G^D + b_G^U)/2\)
    End End 13. \(M = arg_{i \in \{1,2,\ldots ,m\}}max(P_c^i)\) 14. \(P_C = P_C^m
    and P_m \) is the optimal spectral allocation. Zhao and Wang [10], proposed a
    joint optimization algorithm based on centralized spectrum sharing. Joint optimization
    bandwidth and power allocation in centralized CR network was discussed in [10].
    This algorithm uses the sub optimization algorithms to combine the bandwidth allocation
    and power control (Fig. 19.7). Fig. 19.7 Moving distance calculation Full size
    image 19.2.2 Distributed Spectrum Sharing Algorithms Zhu et al. [11] studied the
    problem of maximization of social welfare in spectrum sharing in a CR network.They
    proposed the following distributed algorithm [11] that is used by PU and SUs in
    turn. Input: Cost function C(p) and Utility function \(u_j(p_j) \forall j \in
    \{1, 2,..,n\}\). Output: Optimal spectrum allocation \(p_j^*\). Set \(q^{(0)}
    = \theta \) \(k\leftarrow 0\) while \(\parallel \tilde{p}^k - \tilde{p}^{k-1}\parallel
    _\infty \le \xi \) or k==0 or k==1 do for j from 1 to n do \(\tilde{p}_j^{k+1}(q_j)
    = arg max u_j(p_j) - q_jp_j ; p_j\in [ 0 ,\delta _j ] \) end for for j from 1
    to n do \(q_j^{k+1} = (1-\varepsilon )q_j^k + \varepsilon \{\partial C(P)/\partial
    P_j\} |_{p=\tilde{p}^{k+1}}\) end for \(k\leftarrow k+1\) end while return \(p^*
    = \tilde{p}^{(k)}\) Sun et al. [12], studied a social welfare maximization problem
    for sharing of spectrum in CR network and proposed the following algorithm. The
    licensed spectrum owned by the PU can be rented to SUs for transmitting data to
    fully use the spectrum resource [12]. Input: A CR network consisting of many SUs,
    denoted by \(\{SU_1, SU_2, SU_n\}\). C(p) is the cost function of PU and \(u_j(p_j)\forall
    j \in \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}\) is the utility function of each SU. Output: The optimal
    allocation of the spectrum \(p_i^*\) for each SU. 1. k = 0 2. he PU sets the initial
    value \(q^{(0)} = \theta \) for all SUs Repeat for k = 0,1,... 3. For each secondary
    user,\(\tilde{p}_j^{k+1}\) is computed according to \(\tilde{p}_j^{k+1}(q_j) =
    arg max u_j(p_j) - q_jp_j ; p_j \in [ 0 ,\delta _j ]\) 4. For the primary user,
    according to the returned \(\tilde{p}_j^{k+1}\), the value of \(\tilde{q}_j^{k+1}\)
    is updated as \(q_j^{k+1} = (1-\varepsilon )q_j^k + \varepsilon \{\partial C(P)/\partial
    P_j\} |_{p=\tilde{p}^{k+1}}\) 5. Until if \(\parallel \tilde{p}^{k+1} - \tilde{p}^k
    \parallel _\infty \le \xi \) 6. \(p^* = \tilde{p}^{k+1}, q^* = \tilde{q}^{k+1}
    \) 19.3 Measuring Parameters 19.3.1 Centralized Spectrum Sharing The measuring
    parameters for the centralized spectrum sharing algorithms are as follows. 19.3.1.1
    Channel Allocation It refers to the allocation of the channel among the different
    secondary users (SUs). It is based on the occupation time of the channel. There
    three different schemes for channel allocation, which are: Fixed Channel Allocation:
    In this scheme specific channels are assigned to specific users. This scheme is
    very simple but does not provide flexibility. Dynamic Channel Allocation: In this
    scheme all the channels are placed in a pool and are assigned as per the needs
    of the users. The advantages of this scheme is that it provides flexibility and
    traffic adaptability. Hybrid Channel Allocation: This channel allocation scheme
    is developed by combining the approaches of fixed and dynamic channel allocation
    schemes. Here a user is allocated a channel as per the fixed allocation scheme.
    If it needs a channel in excess, then it can borrow an available channel from
    its neighbor. 19.3.1.2 Fairness Factor In cognitive radio network, fairness is
    mostly related to spectrum sharing and allocation. The fair allocation/sharing
    of spectrum among different users is called as fairness. To improve the fairness,
    fairness factor is used. It is denoted as \(f_i\). The value of \(f_i\) becomes
    small with the number of times a SU has been connected to the CR-BS. There will
    be a low chance for that SU to acquire the channel. 19.3.1.3 Utility Function
    Utility is a measure of preferences over some set of alternatives. Utility function
    is a mathematical function which ranks the alternatives according to the utility
    of the SUs. 19.3.1.4 Channel Occupation Time It is defined as the time in which
    a SU can occupy a channel. It is denoted as \(T_c\). It depends on the distance
    travelled by the mobile SU d and the velocity of the SU v and it can be calculated
    as \(T_c = d/v\). 19.3.2 Distributed Spectrum Sharing The measuring parameters
    for the distributed spectrum sharing algorithms are as follows. 19.3.2.1 Number
    of Secondary Users (SUs) The allocated spectrum of the algorithm under different
    number of secondary users are studied and compared with the optimum. As the number
    of SUs increase, the spectrum allocation and number of iterations also increase.
    In other words spectrum allocation and number of iterations are directly proportional
    to the number of SUs. 19.3.2.2 Effect of \(\beta \) \(\beta \) is the system parameter
    in the PUs cost function. The performance of the algorithm different \(\beta \)
    value is studied and compared with the optimum. As the value of \(\beta \) increases,
    the allocated spectrum and number of iterations decrease. That means, allocated
    spectrum and number of iterations are inversely proportional to the \(\beta \)
    value. 19.3.2.3 Convergence Speed The convergence speed of the algorithm under
    different number of secondary users and the value of \(\varepsilon \) is studied
    and compared. 19.3.2.4 Spectrum Efficiency It is defined as the information rate
    that can be transmitted over a given bandwidth in a specific network. It is a
    measure of efficient utilization of a limited frequency spectrum. 19.3.2.5 Throughput
    In CR network, the network throughput depends on the throughput of SUs. It shows
    how an algorithm performs at a given time. 19.4 Comparison Between the Techniques
    The spectrum demand to accommodate the wireless services and applications of the
    future is growing, it can be clearly known from the dendrogram in Fig. 19.8. Due
    to the rigidity of current allocations, several spectrum occupancy studies have
    indicated a low utilization over both space and time. Hence, it can be inferred
    that to fulfill the demands of applications, dynamic spectrum allocation is required.
    Two approaches that address this problem are Centralized Dynamic Spectrum Allocation
    (DSA) and Distributed Dynamic Spectrum Selection (DSS) [13]. Salami et al. [13]
    presented a survey on these approaches. Both the approaches can be studied on
    the basis of system design and architecture. Fig. 19.8 Dendrogram on number of
    papers published in centralized and distributed spectrum sharing Full size image
    19.4.1 Comparison on the Basis of System Design and Network Architecture DSA generally
    requires a centralized architecture, while DSS requires either distributed or
    centralized approach [13]. DSS approaches are easy to develop and maintain, while
    DSA is faster and more flexible. DSA removes the complexities from the devices/terminals
    and, hence, devices are simpler and cheaper to produce. But in the case of DSS,
    complexity is brought to the edge of the network, i.e., the access network and
    the devices/terminals [13]. 19.4.2 Comparison on the Basis of An Optimum Resource
    Management Strategy In this section, they discussed an analytical approach, based
    on Game Theory. In the game theory, the players are the decision makers. In the
    DSA case, the players are the centralized spectrum management entities, while
    in the DSS case, the terminals or sometimes the transmission-reception pairs are
    chosen as the players. The comparison between the distributed and the centralized
    approaches is shown in Table 19.2. Table 19.2 Comparison between centralized and
    distributed approaches [13] Full size table 19.5 Current Issues and Future Research
    Directions The radio and networking technical capabilities have substantially
    improved, but much remains to be done. Many challenges and issues are there in
    both technological and policy domain, which can be viewed under six categories.
    19.5.1 Efficiency and Access of Spectrum Efficient management of spectrum is the
    major challenge in spectrum sharing. Assignment mechanisms and advancements in
    allocation are required, that facilitate spectrum sharing, support measurement
    and dynamic valuation of the sharing costs and benefits. It is a multidisciplinary
    challenge that requires a joint arrangement of economic, technical and policy
    perspectives [14, 15]. Additional research is needed to advance and develop the
    ability to measure harmful interference, efficiency, value and fair access to
    the spectrum. 19.5.2 Coexistence and Interference Management Another challenge
    in spectrum sharing is facilitating tuneful coexistence and interference management
    in heterogeneous wireless technologies. First, to assess how well the devices
    are coexisting together, some specific metrics are needed to be established. Modulation
    techniques need to be developed for facilitating interference mitigation and avoidance
    [14]. Coexistence between the secondary users (SUs) of the spectrum is required
    in the future spectrum sharing scenarios. Facilitating the coexistence of SUs,
    the techniques that have not been studied previously are needed to be developed
    [14]. Innovations in technology is required for the sharing among the government
    and the commercial bodies. An additional challenge is the coexistence/integration
    with the legacy system due to forward and backward interoperability and compatibility.
    19.5.3 Software, Hardware, Standards and Protocols Improvement of spectral efficiency
    and radio configurability is essential for the commercialization of suitable spectrum
    sharing customer and network tools. So, there is a need of enhancements in smart
    radio architectures, which support high dynamic range for wideband operation [14].
    Another challenging problem is the design of power efficient radios. Development
    of new improvements in the fields of radio software, hardware, protocols and access
    theory are needed so that they will work together, over time and flexibly to support
    wireless technologies of different needs. A hardware is needed to be design that
    provides enhanced geolocation capabilities for direction finding, indoor applications,
    etc. In addition to hardware, software and simulation tools are needed to be developed
    for assessing the scalability and efficiency of newly proposed designs [14]. 19.5.4
    Enforcement and Security The realization of the benefits of new spectrum access
    technologies and their successful deployment will rely on the employment of necessary
    security mechanisms in robust form to resist exploitation of the technologies.
    Vulnerability studies of flexible spectrum access systems and countermeasure development
    is central to understanding effective spectrum sharing [14, 15]. Compliance and
    enforcement requirements with future agile radios require study in the below areas:
    Automation of the identification and detection of interference sources. Building
    mechanisms for quickly imposing the changes in policy on radio devices. Assessing
    the sociology of privacy, implementation mechanisms, and possible penalties. Assessing
    the economic trade-offs in ex-post and ex-ante mechanisms. Table 19.3 Research
    challenges and open problems in spectrum sharing Full size table 19.5.5 Testing,
    Experimentation and Standardization New technologies should be tested through
    large-scale experimentation to ensure that they are robust and secure, will not
    affect the legacy systems, and are effective spectrum users. Such testing will
    be useful in gaining trusts of the stakeholders that the new sharing methods will
    work as guaranteed [14]. Problems related to this category are listed in Table
    19.3. 19.5.6 Policy and Regulatory Challenges There exist some policy-domain challenges
    in dynamic spectrum sharing. Interdisciplinary research is needed in the fields
    of market and non-market based mechanisms for spectrum usage and access to manage
    the sharing of limited spectrum resources efficiently [14]. This category is further
    discussed in Table 19.3. Bhattarai et al. [14], have discussed the research challenges
    and open problems in a tabular format, which is shown in Table 19.3. 19.6 Conclusion
    In the current scenario the radio spectrum is statically divided between licensed
    and unlicensed frequencies. Due to this inflexible regulatory policy, some of
    the entire spectrum remain unused. So cognitive radio is introduced to cope with
    the above problem. In this chapter we have given a general overview of cognitive
    radio architecture, its functional blocks and different spectrum sharing techniques.
    We have presented a detailed survey on centralized and distributed spectrum sharing
    techniques, their measuring parameters and comparison between them. At last some
    current issues and challenges along with future research directions are also presented.

    Accesses 6 Citations 2 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Integrating cognitive
    radio (CR) with traditional wireless networks is helping solve the problem of
    spectrum scarcity in an efficient manner. The opportunistic and dynamic spectrum
    access features of CR provide the functionality to its unlicensed users to utilize
    the underutilized spectrum at the time of need because CR nodes can sense vacant
    bands of spectrum and can also access them to carry out communication. Various
    capabilities of CR nodes depend upon efficient and continuous reporting of data
    with each other and centralized base stations, which in turn can cause leakage
    in privacy. Experimental studies have shown that the privacy of CR users can be
    compromised easily during the cognition cycle, because they are knowingly or unknowingly
    sharing various personally identifiable information (PII), such as location, device
    ID, signal status, etc. In order to preserve this privacy leakage, various privacy
    preserving strategies have been developed by researchers, and according to us
    differential privacy is the most significant among them. In this article, we provide
    a thorough survey on how differential privacy can play an active role in preserving
    privacy of cognitive radio networks (CRN). Firstly, we provide a thorough comparison
    of our work with other similar studies to show its novelty and contribution, and
    afterwards, we provide a thorough analysis from the perspective of various CR
    scenarios which can cause privacy leakage. After that, we carry out an in-depth
    assessment from the perspective of integration of differential privacy at different
    levels of CRN. Then, we discuss various parameters which should be considered
    while integrating differential privacy in CRN alongside providing a comprehensive
    discussion about all integrations of differential privacy carried out till date.
    Finally, we provide discussion about prospective applications, challenges, and
    future research directions. The discussion about integration of differential privacy
    in different CR scenarios indicates that differential privacy is one of the most
    viable mechanisms to preserve privacy of CRN in modern day scenarios. From the
    discussion in the article, it is evident that the proposed integration of differential
    privacy can pave the way for futuristic CRN in which CR users will be able to
    share information during the cognition cycle without the risk of losing their
    private information. Similar content being viewed by others A Location Privacy-Preserving

    and Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in 5G Cognitive Networks Chapter © 2019 Introduction
    The exponential surge in the usage of hand-held Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    caused a huge rise in wireless traffic. Statista report revealed that the number
    of hand-held mobile devices is projected to reach up to 17.72 billion by the end
    of the year 2024 [1]. This surge is causing an irregular usage of spectrum, which
    is further responsible to cause the issue of ‘artificial spectrum scarcity’ [2].
    Similarly, the worldwide analysis and measurement of spectrum utilization revealed
    that only 5-10 % of wireless spectrum is being used by licensed/authorized users
    [3]. All these factors lead researchers to investigate mechanisms which provide
    spectrum efficiency, and cognitive radio (CR) is one of them. Cognitive radio
    is a widely accepted model for efficient spectrum utilization [4]. CR was first
    coined by J. Mitola in 1999. CR is an ambiance-aware intelligent wireless system
    which can dynamically adapt changes depending upon its surrounding RF environment
    [5]. CR works over the principle of allowing CR users (also known as Secondary
    Users (SUs)), to access spectrum of licensed users (also known as Primary Users
    (PUs)), during idle time. This functionality of CR allows SUs to exploit underutilized
    bands of spectrum without causing any harmful inference to the communication of
    PUs [6]. Thus, SUs can dynamically access available spaces in the spectrum band
    in order to manage it efficiently [7, 8]. To dynamically access the spectrum,
    SUs need to follow complete cycle which involve spectrum sensing (SS), spectrum
    analysis, and spectrum adaptation (also known as exploitation) [9]. SUs repeatedly
    carry out these functions in order to achieve the desired environmental conditions.
    (A detailed explanation of functioning of CRN is provided in “Fundamentals of
    Differential Privacy in Cognitive Radio Networks”.) All other functions, for example,
    spectrum auction (used to decide winner of spectrum allocation), etc., can be
    taken as a subvariant of the above-mentioned basic tasks. These functionalities
    help SUs to find and select the best possible spectrum band in order to carry
    out seamless communication. Since these steps involve transmission of SUs data,
    these steps can be exploited by adversaries to infer their personal data. For
    instance, multiple SUs are collected during collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS)
    by a fusion centre (FC) to get the best spectrum results. However, this FC can
    also become an adversary and exploit private data of CR users [10]. Similarly,
    in case of spectrum auction, the centralized auctioneer can exploit the bidding
    privacy (BP) because it has all data of multiple SUs and PUs from the bidding
    perspective. Therefore, it is important to protect the privacy of CR users by
    integrating some external privacy preservation mechanisms. Table 1 Summary of
    Related Survey Articles with their Contribution, and Various Scopes such as Differential
    Privacy (DP), Location Privacy (LP), Trading Privacy (TP), Spectrum Sensing Privacy

    In the quest of providing privacy in CRN, extensive research has been carried
    out by researchers to integrate different privacy preservation strategies with
    CRN. For example, some works [11, 12] proposed the use of anonymization techniques
    such as k-anonymity to preserve privacy of CR users. Similarly, some other works
    [15,16,17] analysed the use of encryption to preserve privacy. Certain works [18,19,20,21]
    investigated the use of private information retrieval to protect private CR data.
    Alongside these techniques, some works also highlight the use of obfuscation-based
    privacy (also known as differential privacy) to preserve CR users’ privacy. Among
    all these mechanisms we believe that differential privacy is one of the most viable
    mechanisms to protect the privacy of CR users because of its dynamic and adaptive
    nature. The notion of differential privacy was first discussed by Cynthia Dwork
    in 2006 in order to protect privacy of statistical databases by adding random
    independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) noise in the data [22]. However,
    afterwards researchers working in the field of private CRN tried integrating this
    differential privacy notion with CRN at different aspects and they got fruitful
    results. Since then, plenty of works highlighting the integration of differential
    privacy with CRN have been carried out in the literature. In this paper, we provide
    a thorough survey regarding integration of differential privacy at various scenarios
    of CRN in order to demonstrate the useful benefits that one can get via this integration.
    Similarly, we try to discuss various technical works that have already carried
    out this integration and published their work in the literature. Key Contributions
    of Our Survey Article Nevertheless, certain surveys from the perspective of security
    and location privacy of CRN have been presented in the literature, but a specific
    survey that highlights the need, integration, functioning, and applications of
    differential privacy in CRN has not been presented yet. In this article, we carry
    out survey of state-of-the-art works involving the integration of differential
    privacy and CRN alongside providing certain use cases which can be beneficial
    for future researchers who are interested to explore this field further. To conclude,
    the key contributions of our article are as follows: We carry out comparative
    comparison of our survey article with previously published survey literature.
    We provide an in-depth analysis over the scenarios in which privacy of CRN can
    be compromised. We provide a thorough analysis from the perspective of integration
    of differential privacy at different levels of CRN. Alongside this, we also in-depth
    survey of all state-of-the-art integrations involving differential privacy and
    CRN. We provide a comprehensive analysis of parameters which should be considered
    while incorporating differential privacy in CRN models. We highlight various challenges,
    open issues, and prospective future directions for researchers and scientists
    interested to explore the field of differentially private CRN. Table 2 List of
    Acronyms Used in the Article Full size table Related Survey Works A comprehensive
    literature is available in the field of CRN; however, the aspect of privacy preservation
    in CRN is not much discussed and only a very few surveys are available in this
    field. Similarly, this presented survey work is different from other surveys in
    a context that it discusses the integration, design requirements, functioning,
    and applications of differential privacy in CRN. To the best of our knowledge,
    there is no prior work which covers multiple aspects of differential privacy in
    CRN. None of the works discussed integration of differential privacy in cognitive
    cycles; therefore, we develop certain comparison matrices such as discussion about
    differential privacy, location privacy (LP), trading privacy (TP), SS privacy
    (SSP), and sources of privacy leakage (SoPL). A comprehensive comparison of our
    survey with other surveys, based on the aforementioned parameters, is presented
    in Table 1. The first work discussing vulnerabilities of CRN from the perspective
    of security, privacy, and deployment threats have been presented by Bhattacharjee
    et al. [11]. The authors first describe various architectural aspects of CRN focusing
    weak links having security and privacy threats. Afterwards, they discuss threats
    and vulnerabilities that CRN can face if they are attacked by some adversary.
    A brief book purely targeting location privacy of CRN have been presented by Wang
    and Zhang [12]. The work first highlights certain privacy preservation mechanisms,
    and then discuss the integration of privacy mechanisms in CRN. The major focus
    of the work is location privacy leakage during CSS and during database driven
    CRN. Another comprehensive survey discussing the security threats and defences
    in CRN have been carried out by Sharma and Rawat [2]. The work focuses over highlighting
    security vulnerabilities in different layers of CRN. The article started with
    discussion of CRN physical layer, then discusses security threats in upper and
    cross-layer CRN. Finally, authors provide in-depth insights on how game theory
    can play the role in enhancing the security of CRN. Another survey by Grissa et
    al. [10] focuses location privacy leakage and its mitigation techniques in CRN.
    This work first discusses the sources of CRN which may cause privacy leakage,
    then presents CRN privacy preservation mechanisms, and finally states CRN location
    privacy methods of spectrum discovery along with attack scenarios. One more work
    providing an in-depth classification of security threats of physical layer of
    CRN is presented by Hamamreh et al. [13]. The article first classifies security
    techniques of CRN physical layer and then presents its detailed applications.
    Another similar article discussing the basics, detection, functioning, and countermeasures
    of physical layer threats of CRN have been presented by Salahdine and Kaabouch
    [14]. The work first classifies all physical layer attacks in CRN, then classifies
    and discusses attack detection techniques and the possible countermeasures. However,
    considering this discussion and after analysing all possible surveys presenting
    privacy preservation in CRN, it can be concluded that the prevailing literature
    does not give an in-depth knowledge and analysis of differential privacy in CRN.
    Our presented work is the first one that covers integration of differential privacy
    with CRN from an in-depth technical perspective. Overview of the Article A brief
    list of acronyms used in our survey article is given in Table 2. The rest of the
    article is structured as follows: “Fundamentals of Differential Privacy in Cognitive
    Radio Networks” provides a brief discussion about fundamental concepts and preliminaries
    of article from the perspective of differential privacy, CR, and sources of privacy
    leakage. Afterwards, “Scenarios of Privacy Leakage During Cognitive Cycle and
    Prospective Role of Differential Privacy” provides an in-depth discussion about
    integration of differential privacy with CRN in different CR scenario. After that
    “Performance Matrices for Evaluating Differentially Private CRN Mechanisms” talks
    about various performance matrices that can be used to evaluate integration of
    differentially private approaches in CRN scenarios. Then, “Differential Privacy
    Approaches for Cognitive Radio Networks” carries out an extensive survey of all
    technical works that have integrated differential privacy in CRN. Afterwards,
    “Applicability of Differential Privacy in Futuristic Cognitive Radios” provides
    in-depth discussion about applicability of CRN in various futuristic scenarios
    and applications. Similarly, “Challenges and Future Research Directions” provides
    insights about possible challenges and prospective future research directions.
    Finally, the article is concluded in “Conclusion”. Fig. 1 A Graphical Illustration
    of Functioning of Differential Privacy Mechanism in Two Adjacent Databases (adapted

    Networks Since CRN serve as a viable solution to overcome spectrum scarcity issue,
    these have therefore been integrated with many domains, for example, smart grid,
    IoT, multimedia transmission, transportation systems, healthcare and other [23].
    Although CR provides amazing features, it also has an issue of privacy leakage.
    Thus, CRN privacy protection is also an important aspect that needs to be taken
    care of while implementing this paradigm. In this section, fundamental concepts
    of our survey such as CRN, differential privacy, importance of privacy in CRN,
    privacy threats, and sources of privacy leakage in CRN are discussed. Cognitive
    Radio and its Preliminaries Discussion about is further categorized into five
    different aspects: (i) spectrum bands, (ii) CRN users, (iii) white space exploitation
    and utilization, (iv) CRN cognitive cycle, and (v) SS. Licensed and Unlicensed
    Bands of Spectrum Spectrum band, also known as frequency band, is used to carry
    out communication between devices, and the band is widespread and ranges between
    9 KHz to 3 THz depending upon the type of application [24]. The spectrum bands
    can be further subdivided into licensed spectrum band and unlicensed spectrum
    band [25]. The licensed band is allocated to licensed users who have paid licensing
    fees. These users can use the allocation frequency at any time without any inference
    and interruption. The licensed bands are usually allocated to telecom/Internet
    companies via auctions, who further allocate the bands to their customers [26].
    Contrarily, unlicensed spectrum bands have been excluded from auction-based sale/international
    licensing; therefore, these bands are used to carry out low-cost communication.
    These bands are limited and their users are pretty large; therefore, these bands
    face the issue of heavy inference. Since a large base of users compete for these
    unlicensed bands, National Authorities regulating these bands carry out a conventional
    auction to manage these bands [24]. In this way, these authorities allocate a
    high paying user a fixed spectrum band and they can use it as a licensed user.
    An analysis indicates that the utilization of these bands greatly varies depending
    upon the geographical region. For example, the overall utilization is 85% at some
    places while it is 15% at other places [27]. This underutilization of spectrum
    leads to the formation of large unused white spaces, which gets wasted. To overcome
    this spectrum wastage, researchers are getting benefit from the dynamic spectrum
    access functionality of CRN, through which CR users can access the unoccupied
    spectrum band and can leave at the time of PU activity. Primary & Secondary Cognitive
    Radio Users The underutilization of spectrum can be controlled and reduced with
    the help of CRN with very minimal level of inference to licensed users. CRN mainly
    comprises of two types of users. First one is known as primary users (PUs), who
    are licensed and can access the spectrum at any time without any permission. The
    second type of users are secondary users (SUs), also known as CR users, who are
    unlicensed and can only access spectrum when it is unoccupied. SUs have to leave
    the spectrum in case PU arrives [28]. CR users continuously sense the activity
    of PUs on the network and always look for white spaces. Once an SU finds a white
    space, it moves to it and starts utilizing it for communication. In this way,
    SUs help to overcome the issue of spectrum underutilization in an efficient manner.
    White Space Utilization CR is an intelligent radio, which changes and adapts to
    the changes according to environment. Similarly, extensive research has been carried
    out in order to efficiently utilize the underutilized spectrum. Generally, CRN
    can be further subdivided into three paradigms on the basis of their spectrum
    utilization [29]. First type of CRN is interweave CRN, where CRN continuously
    senses the activity of PUs and access the network only when it is vacant. These
    are conventional CRN, which wait for the spectrum to become idle. Second type
    of CRN is underlay CRN, which allows CR users to carry out operations alongside
    PU activity if the inference caused by CR users is less than a specific threshold
    value. Third type of CRN is overlay, in which CR users overhear the continuous
    PUs transmissions and then use sophisticated algorithms of signal processing to
    enhance PUs performance, and in turn they get some additional patch of bandwidth
    which they can use to carry out their own transmission. Cognitive Cycle for White
    Space Exploitation The spectrum utilization and exploitation phenomenon of CRN
    works in a stepwise manner, which is also known as the cognitive cycle. The cycle
    comprises four functional steps in which CR performs different actions to access
    spectrum in the most efficient manner. The steps of the cycle are sensing, analysis,
    sharing, and mobility [30]. The details of these steps are given as follows: Spectrum
    sensing is the first step in the cognitive cycle. Through SS, CR nodes carry out
    efficient detection of spectrum opportunities around themselves in order to develop
    an initial idea of which spectrum band to access. Spectrum analysis is the next
    step in which SUs select the best spectrum band from the available bands. The
    values collected via SS are used in spectrum analysis to choose a band in which
    inference to PUs is minimum and utilization is maximum. Spectrum sharing is the
    third step in the cognitive cycle which is used to exploit the chosen spectrum
    for communication. In this step, the decision of choosing the appropriate CR model
    (such as interweave, underlay, or overlay) is taken on the basis of data collected
    from previous two steps. At the end of this step, CR nodes can carry out transmission
    of their data via the selected spectrum band. Spectrum mobility is the final step
    in the cognitive cycle and it involves the immediate mobility of SU nodes after
    detection of PUs. As the name suggests, this step is responsible for making the
    spectrum available to PUs by vacating the activity of SUs in case if PU returns
    to resume its activity. Similarly, a figure to demonstrate functioning of the
    cognition cycle for CRN is provided in Fig. 2. Spectrum Sensing and Access Since
    a large proportion of researchers focus on the integration of differential privacy
    during SS and access, let’s demonstrate these steps in a bit detail for better
    understanding. Collaborative Spectrum Sensing Usually, SS in CRN is carried out
    in a collaborative manner, in which all CR nodes collaborate with each other to
    generate the best SS outcome. This collaborative sensing is carried out to overcome
    the issue of shadowing of PU. For instance, if a PU is present on the rooftop
    of a high building and SU is on the ground level, then the presence or absence
    of PU cannot be sensed with precision using a normal sensing mechanism due to
    low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal received from PU [31]. To overcome
    this issue of fading, multiple CR users collaborate with each other to carry out
    SS to ensure that they do not miss any specific PU. This whole process of collaborative
    sensing is done with the help of a centralized data collection centre called FC.
    Generally speaking, FC collects data from all CRN and determines the final values
    regarding presence or absence of PU in a particular region. Database-Driven Spectrum
    Access According to database-driven spectrum access, data administrations are
    considered responsible for keeping up to date knowledge of spectrum and whitespaces
    in order to provide SUs with the most beneficial information [32]. A selected
    database collects necessary information from PUs including their usage times,
    tolerable inference, available channels, allowed power transmission, and other
    useful information. This information is then forwarded to SUs upon request, and
    the decision of joining or leaving a specific spectrum band is taken on the basis
    of this information. Differential Privacy The perception of differential privacy
    as a medium to protect database privacy was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork in
    2006 [22]. This notion was later used by researchers in almost every field to
    protect the privacy of their participants. For example, in auction, differential
    privacy has been used in auction to protect bid privacy. Similarly, it has been
    used in SS to protect location privacy. To summarize, it will not be wrong to
    say that differential privacy is being applied to all real-life domains ranging
    from statistical databases to real-time decision analysis [33]. The formal definition
    of differential privacy from the perspective of two adjacent datasets x and \(x^\prime\)
    is as follows [34]: $$\begin{aligned} P_R[R(x) \in O_p] \le \exp {\varepsilon
    } x P_R[R(x^\prime ) \in O_p] \end{aligned}$$ (1) In the above equation, R is
    the randomized differentially private algorithm, x and \(x^\prime\) are two adjacent
    datasets, \(P_R\) is the probability value for an outcome \(O_p\) to be in range
    of function Range(R). Furthermore, \(\varepsilon\) is privacy parameter which
    is also known as privacy budget. The value of \(\varepsilon\) is used to control
    the amount of noise which is going to be added in query result. Alongside \(\varepsilon\),
    sensitivity is the other parameter that plays an important role in determining
    noise value. Sensitivity can be defined as the maximum difference an observer
    can get from the result of a query applied to two adjacent datasets x and \(x^\prime\).
    The formal definition of sensitivity can be defined as follows [35]: $$\begin{aligned}
    \Delta S_q = \underset{x, x^prime}{max} ||\kern 0.1500 emf(x)-f(x^\prime )|| \end{aligned}$$
    (2) Furthermore, various mechanisms of differential privacy have been proposed
    to calculate noise, and the two most famous among them are Laplace and Exponential.
    These two use the pseudorandom noise generated from their respective database
    to perturb the query output. A detailed discussion of differential privacy from
    the perspective of mechanisms, composition theorem, sensitivity, and privacy budget
    can be found in [36]. Moreover, an illustrative explanation of differential privacy
    is provided in Fig. 1. Importance of Privacy Protection in CRN Despite great advantages
    by CRN, they do suffer from a serious threat related to the privacy of its users.
    As discussed in the previous section, CR nodes have to sense the spectrum in order
    to generate the environment map of PUs [37]. Similarly, queries and spectrum auctions
    are also carried out by FC to access and trade spectrum. However, while doing
    all these tasks, CR participating nodes have to report numerous amounts of data
    to FC. Although FCs are usually trusted entities, in certain cases such as when
    there is an adversarial attack on FC, the privacy of CR participants can be compromised
    [38]. For instance, the location of SUs and PUs can be compromised which can lead
    to serious consequences. Similarly, the PUs and SUs usage and occupancy times
    can be analysed for malicious purposes. Similar to that, bidding and asking prices
    can be analysed by adversaries for unethical actions. Some of the key benchmarks
    from the perspective of differential privacy and CRN have been presented in Table
    3. (Detailed discussion on privacy sources and their countermeasures using differential
    privacy is given in “Scenarios of Privacy Leakage During Cognitive Cycle and Prospective
    Role of Differential Privacy”) Fig. 2 A Graphical Illustration of Functioning
    of Cognition Cycle for CR Nodes (adapted from [27]) Full size image Adversary
    Models in CRN CR is a diversified network; it therefore faces numerous types of
    adversarial attacks. In this section, we categorize privacy-related adversaries
    into four subtypes which cover approximately all types of adversarial attacks.
    The discussion about these adversaries is as follows: External Adversary This
    type is one of the most prominent and dangerous as compared to others. The adversary
    in this type includes any type of external intruder who is interested to get insights
    about the network in order to fulfil malicious objectives. For example, this adversary
    could be an external pharmaceutical company who is interested in finding out the
    number of CR users who visit hospitals/pharmacies frequently. They will do so
    by compromising the location of PUs and SU. This company will collect all required
    information and can-do targeted advertisements. Usually, these adversaries operate
    in two ways, either compromised communication link or via compromised database.
    Compromised Communication Link In this case, adversaries try to attack the communication
    link between SU/PU and central authority (usually FC). In this way, these adversaries
    try to overhear the communication between SU and FC to infer their private information.
    One way is to launch man-in-the-middle attack [39] on the communication link,
    thus adversaries can get required private information. Similarly, another attack
    in this type is exogenous attack [2], in which an external adversary tries to
    jam the whole CR network to carry out malicious operations during this time. Compromised
    Database The second type of attack by external adversaries could be in the form
    of compromising the FC database. In this attack, adversaries try to carry out
    a direct attack on FC database to get personal information of participants including
    topology map of PUs and SUs [40]. This type of attack is usually carried out in
    database-driven CRN. In collaborative sensing, this can also be done by intruding
    attack [2], where an intruder tries to get into the network externally by masquerading
    itself as a regular CR user, either for getting private information of CR nodes,
    or to inject falsified information in the network. SUs Acting as Adversary Alongside
    external adversaries, sometimes SUs can also act as adversaries and can play the
    role in compromising privacy of other CR participants. Similar to the intruding
    attack discussed in the above section, sometimes legitimate SUs can also act as
    adversaries and try to leak into the privacy of other SUs, PUs, and FC by collecting
    unnecessary data during cognitive cycle [10]. Nowadays there is a trend of decentralized
    sensing via blockchain, and all SUs try to reach a consensus in a decentralized
    manner [41]. This decentralized consensus is a great way to remove FCs, but it
    can also cause privacy issues because information reported by SUs is publicly
    visible to all other SUs, which can lead to harmful effects. PUs Acting as Adversary
    Apart from SUs, sometimes, PUs can also act as adversaries. This rarely occurring
    case cannot be ignored especially in the case of spectrum auction and trading.
    Since PUs are the authorities having excessive spectrum to sell, they also have
    objectives to enhance their revenue. Some PUs therefore try to analyse the bids
    of SUs and try to take certain actions through which they could increase their
    revenue in a tactical way [42]. Service/Fusion Centre Acting as Adversary The
    fourth type of adversary in our CRN modelling is centralized data centre-based
    adversary, which are also known as FCs. These FCs are usually trusted central
    entities and are designed to collect information from SUs during SS process to
    get the best spectrum. However, in some cases these FCs become adversaries. For
    example, FCs can sell the private data of their associated SUs and PUs to advertising
    organizations to earn extra profit. Similarly, these FCs can also analyse the
    data in a malicious way, which can even lead to the development of certain policies
    that may impact a certain group of participants. This discussion concludes that
    efficient privacy preserving mechanisms are required to protect CRN from these
    types of adversaries. In this perspective, differential privacy provides a strong
    privacy guarantee, which can be used to protect the privacy of CR users. Motivation
    of Using Differential Privacy in CRN Privacy preservation in wireless systems
    is a well-established field, and extensive research has been carried out in this
    regard [43]. In this section, a comparative analysis of these privacy preservation
    strategies with differential privacy has been presented. Encryption-Based Privacy
    Protection Since the advent of cryptography, encryption is being used to protect
    information in almost all fields of life [44]. Therefore, it will not be wrong
    to state that encryption-based privacy is the most traditional means to protect
    the privacy of any network/application. Encryption works over the phenomenon of
    key-based cryptography, in which a message is encrypted by a CR sender and then
    it is sent to CR receiver [45]. The receiver has the key which is used to decrypt
    the message. The message in its encrypted form is known as ciphertext, which is
    unreadable and can only be decrypted by the person having the secret key. In this
    way, the message is protected from external intruders who cannot tap into the
    private communication of CR users. Although, encryption provides strong privacy
    against external adversaries, but it is not an efficient privacy protection mechanism
    when internal participants become adversaries. According to our already discussed
    adversary models, encryption will only be helpful against external adversaries,
    but will not be much useful against the other three adversaries. There are certain
    encryption mechanisms which require strong computational power and a specific
    architecture for encryption [46]. Such computational efficiency is hard to obtain
    in small CR nodes. Contrarily, differential privacy provides both these features,
    as it provides privacy protection from internal adversaries and is computationally
    less-expensive as compared to encryption. Oblivious Transfer-Based Privacy Oblivious
    transfer (OT) is also a popular means to protect privacy of CR nodes nowadays
    because it allows CR senders to send a message in multiple patches [10]. In this
    mechanism, a message is broken down into multiple segments during transmission,
    which are then received and reassembled at the receiver as a single message. This
    approach is being used as a viable approach to carry out SS tasks in order to
    find out available spectrum without compromising communication privacy. However,
    this mechanism suffers from similar issues of encryption-based privacy. Firstly,
    OT can only preserve privacy against external intruders, but cannot protect it
    from internal intruders. Secondly, the computational and communication overhead
    of this mechanism is quite high as compared to other mechanisms because multiple
    messages are transmitted at the same time, which incur high communication overhead
    due to collision, cohesion, and redundant rebroadcasts. Differential privacy is,
    however, free from these issues, because the computational and communication overhead
    of differentially private messages is quite minimal, and it also provides protection
    from internal intruders. Fig. 3 Graphical Illustration of Sources of Privacy Leakage
    in Cognitive Cycle of Cognitive Radio Networks Full size image Data Anonymization-Based
    Privacy Data anonymization is also a famous privacy preservation strategy which
    is being used to protect privacy during query evaluation of CR nodes [47]. In
    anonymization-based privacy, a dataset is anonymized by removing pseudoidentifiable
    information from data before making it available for query evaluation. For instance,
    in CRN, FC can remove names and IDs of PUs before making the dataset available
    to SUs for database drive spectrum access. This mechanism provides an effective
    solution for certain internal adversaries, but continuous experimentations have
    revealed that anonymized datasets can also be deanonymized by carrying out various
    linking attacks [48, 49]. Similarly, finding the best combination to remove from
    the dataset is also difficult, e.g. for some participants, coverage area could
    be confidential but not for others. Therefore, developing a consensus among participants
    on pseudoidentifiable information is also tough. A major drawback of anonymization
    in CRN is that it requires a large database to operate, and in case if the database
    is not significantly big, then it can leak privacy. Contrary to all these aspects,
    differential privacy provides a dynamic mechanism which can be used to provide
    efficient privacy in these scenarios. Firstly, it is hard to identify the data
    protected via differential privacy due to its strong privacy guarantee. Secondly,
    differential privacy does not always require a large database, because pointwise
    differential privacy mechanism can also protect a single entity generated by CR
    nodes.  Fig. 4 Intuitive Analysis of Privacy Leakage in Various CR Scenarios at

    Role of Differential Privacy In the previous section, a thorough discussion regarding
    the importance of privacy preservation in CRN from the perspective of SUs, PUs,
    and other involved participants is provided. Moving further to classification,
    we discuss major sources of privacy leakage in CRN alongside an in-depth analysis
    of how differential privacy can play its role in preserving privacy. The sources
    are further categorized into four subtypes on the basis of four major steps of
    cognitive cycle. An illustration of sources is also provided in Fig. 3. Moreover,
    in order to provide our readers an intuitive overview of privacy leakage with
    respect to various prominent CR scenarios (such as fairness degree, SU bidding
    privacy, PU location privacy, PU operation time privacy, SU holding time privacy,
    and privacy in spectrum sensing time), we develop certain intuitive graphs, which
    have been presented in Fig. 4. Privacy Leakage Scenarios During Spectrum Sensing
    SS is considered as a key functionality of CRN, as it provides information about
    available spectrum, which is the core for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). SS in
    CR is performed by SUs in order to detect spectrum holes which they use to carry
    out cognitive communication. The CRN environment is highly mobile and at certain
    times immediate decisions need to be taken in order to utilize the spectrum in
    the most efficient manner. Therefore, the aspects of accuracy, efficiency, timeliness,
    and decision making cannot be ignored [56]. In order to make quick decisions,
    a fine-grained data of participating nodes in CRN which provides efficiency on
    one hand, but on the other leaks the privacy of participants at multiple standpoints
    [57]. In this section, possible scenarios that can leak privacy during SS of CRN
    are discussed. PU Location Privacy from Databases-Driven Access According to General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), location is a personal information and location
    of any participant/node cannot be traced without their approval [58]. Similarly,
    Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has also made it mandatory to preserve
    location privacy of PU nodes while designing CRN sensing techniques [59]. Database-driven
    CRN works over the phenomenon of query evaluation-based spectrum access. It can
    easily be analysed that multiple queries from FC database can leak privacy of
    PUs who are involved in SS. For instance, an adversary can try to launch multiple
    queries from database which collectively form a location inference attack. For
    example, if there is a single PU with name ‘X’ in a region ‘Y’, then the first
    query could be to find the number of PUs operating under a specific band (this
    will be done to find out the availability of spectrum). Similarly, the second
    query could be to find out the number of PUs in this specific region. Afterwards,
    the next query could be, for example, to find out the name of PU organization
    by saying ‘how many PUs have ‘X’ in their name’. In this way, via multiple queries
    one can easily identify the presence and availability of a PU in a region. This
    can lead to harmful consequences because other attacks can be launched to exploit
    such identified PUs. Therefore, location privacy of PUs during database-driven
    DSA should be protected. Prospective Role of Differential Privacy: Since database-driven
    DSA works over the phenomenon of query evaluation, this location privacy issue
    of PU nodes can easily be protected via differential privacy. As differential
    privacy was designed to protect privacy of statistical databases [60], it can
    be applied here to protect location privacy of PUs at the time of query evaluation.
    For instance, at the time of query from FC, a pseudorandom noise generated from
    differential privacy distribution can be added into query output to ensure the
    randomness in the query output. However, the utility can also be maintained by
    controlling the privacy budget (\(\varepsilon\)) to a desired range [61]. Therefore,
    integration of differential privacy during query evaluation of database-driven
    DSA can effectively protect location privacy of PU nodes. SU Location Privacy
    During Collaborative Sensing SS is not only harmful for the privacy of PUs, but
    also poses a risk to the privacy of SUs location [62]. In CSS, all SU nodes have
    to report the sensed values to centralized FC. This collaboration results in an
    efficient and trustworthy sensing, but this also poses a high risk to the location
    privacy of SU nodes. For instance, untrusted, or compromised SUs can act as adversaries
    to locate the exact location of other SUs on the basis of the values received
    for SS [63]. For instance, location leakage of an SU can result in tracking of
    daily life activities of a particular SU. Therefore, considering the catastrophic
    outcomes of location privacy leakage, SUs are also concerned about their privacy
    protection. Considering this discussion, it can be concluded that privacy of SUs
    should be protected during CSS. Prospective Role of Differential Privacy: Since
    SS in a collaborative manner is a critical aspect of CRN, it cannot be ignored.
    Therefore, protecting privacy during CSS is pretty important. Differential privacy
    is a randomization technique which can protect privacy from statistical databases
    to real-time reporting and it can be protected using pointwise differential privacy.
    Pointwise differential privacy means that any individual instance of data can
    be protected by adding pseudorandom noise from differential privacy distribution
    [64]. Usually, Laplace and Gaussian distributions are used to carry out pointwise
    perturbation of differential privacy. Similarly, if one adds a pseudorandom noise
    to protect location privacy of CR node at the time of SS, its privacy can easily
    be preserved. Plenty of research is carried out to integrate the phenomenon of
    differential privacy in location reporting [65]. The need here is to integrate
    this dynamic concept in the reporting aspect of SS in CRN. Identity Privacy Leakage
    During Crowdsourced Sensing Alongside location privacy leakage, another significantly
    important parameter is identity of PU and SUs. We briefly discussed this identity
    in query evaluation, but it is important to mention it separately as well, especially
    in the case of crowdsourced SS. Since crowdsourced SS is a combined activity,
    all CR nodes have to perform their best in order to get optimum results. As all
    nodes share the information, this may lead to identity theft in case of an adversarial
    attack. For example, an adversarial node can pretend to be some other node if
    it gets to know all identity parameters of other nodes. In this way, many malicious
    acts can be carried out, ranging from adversarial decisions to DoS attacks. Therefore,
    it is important to protect identity privacy in SS alongside preserving location
    privacy. Prospective Role of Differential Privacy: In crowdsourced SS, the most
    important parameter to protect is identity of the sensing node, because this identity
    can further be backtracked to locate the specific node. However, at certain phases
    it is also important to check identity in order to ensure the integrity of the
    sensing report. Differential privacy is a strong privacy guarantee that can also
    be used to protect privacy leakage in case of identity theft-based attacks [66].
    For instance, differential privacy can be combined with other provable encryption
    or proofing mechanisms to provide a provable identity alongside preserving the
    actual values [67]. The similar concept can easily be applied for CR nodes during
    the aspect of SS. Therefore, we believe adding calibrated differentially private
    noise with provable security mechanisms can be a viable solution to preserve identity
    theft privacy during crowdsourced SS. Privacy Leakage Scenarios During Spectrum
    Analysis Spectrum analysis comes after SS and is used to select an available spectrum
    [68]. Similarly, the decision of bidding/trading for any specific spectrum is
    also taken on the basis of results from this step [69]. Spectrum analysis is broadly
    divided into two steps named as characterization and reconfiguration. First, the
    prospective scenarios in spectrum analysis which can become the source of privacy
    leakage are discussed and afterwards the role of differential privacy to overcome
    these leakages have been presented. PU Privacy in Spectrum Characterization After
    successful SS, SUs possess information about PUs and the available spectrum band
    which they can use to choose the most suitable. The scrutiny process is called
    spectrum characterization and it works as follows. After collecting all data from
    the sensing step, a list of spectrum bands is formulated involving various parameters
    such as path loss, RF environment, holding time, error rate, and switching delay
    [70]. These parameters are then used by SUs to determine the best available spectrum.
    This process helps in the in-depth spectrum analysis but also leaks privacy. For
    example, the fine-grained values, for example error rate and RF environment, can
    easily be used to identify the private characteristics of PUs. Thus, privacy of
    PUs during characterization needs to be protected. Prospective Role of Differential
    Privacy: Differential privacy is an advanced privacy protection mechanism which
    can be used to protect privacy during the characterization process. Firstly, differential
    privacy can be used to obfuscate the identity values so that the identity does
    not get leaked during characterization. Secondly, differential privacy obfuscation
    can further be applied to parametric values on the basis of requirement. For example,
    a margin of error can be ignored in error rate or a margin of error in path loss
    can also be tolerated. So, the dynamic differential privacy algorithm can take
    advantage of this marginal error and can perturb data within this range in order
    to ensure privacy along with significant utility. Privacy Leakage in Learning
    Network Topology Similar to spectrum characteristics, network topology also carries
    private information in it. For instance, the geolocation of nodes can easily be
    inferred in case of unprotected network topology. In case of an adversarial attack
    on CRN, the adversary node may try to infer and collect all possible information
    collected via sensing, and after this inferring, the adversarial opponent may
    try to get much deeper insights about network topology [71]. This is done in order
    to find out the exact location of all PU nodes in the network. In case if the
    adversary successfully gets this personal information, then it can launch all
    attacks associated with location privacy, as discussed above. Therefore, it is
    important to protect privacy of network topology before publishing data during
    spectrum analysis. Prospective Role of Differential Privacy: Since network topology
    depends upon multiple aspects, such as geo-location and signal strength, they
    are combined together to form a complete topology. To protect privacy during network
    topology formation, one therefore needs to protect individual parameters. The
    obfuscation of differential privacy can efficiently protect this by adding pseudorandom
    pointwise noise to all parameters individually while considering the overall network
    utility [72]. PU Operation Time Privacy During spectrum characterization, an aspect
    of operation time cannot be ignored from a privacy viewpoint. Operation time is
    the total activity time of primary user, which is also known as primary user activity
    time [73]. Usually, during development of CR mechanisms researchers use various
    PU activity models to analyse the mechanism behaviour [74]. These PU models are
    used to determine the presence, absence, and functioning of PU nodes. However,
    in real-life scenarios, if one has this much fine-grained information about activity
    and presence of any node, then it can cause serious consequences to its privacy.
    For instance, if an adversary has fine-grained information about PU activity,
    it can easily infer a daily schedule. For example, if an adversary is active then
    it means it is at a particular place, and if the spectrum band is unused, then
    the licensed user must be sleeping or doing other tasks. This data is fed into
    machine/deep learning models, which further train themselves and try to predict
    the accurate lifestyle. Therefore, privacy of PU operation time needs to be protected
    before sharing this information to SU nodes. Prospective Role of Differential
    Privacy: Protecting real-time lifestyle privacy is one of the key roles of differential
    privacy. Due to this advantage, differential privacy is being used by researchers
    in multiple aspects, for example, protecting privacy real-time smart metering
    data, protecting privacy of real-time EVs data [36]. Similarly, this aspect can
    also be applied to protect PU operation time privacy. For example, PU operation
    time values can be perturbed using differentially private noise from the distribution,
    and this noise can be calibrated according to privacy budget and data sensitivity.
    Spectrum Reconfiguration Parameter Privacy After successful categorization of
    desired channel, the step of spectrum reconfiguration arises in which parameters
    of the transceiver of SU are configured according to the given condition [75].
    This involves configuration of power, bandwidth, frequency, and other communication
    technologies. Although these are important parameters, which need to be configured
    properly, they in return can also leak privacy. For example, power control parameters
    can be used to figure out signal-to-interference ratio (SINR), which can further
    be used to geo-locate the particular SU. Therefore, it is important to protect
    privacy of these parameters as well at the time of system reconfiguration. Prospective
    Role of Differential Privacy: Differential privacy is a viable solution to protect
    the configuration data. Since certain configuration parameters, for example frequency
    and values, are pretty strict and cannot be changed, thus, in such cases differential
    privacy can be combined with some provable mechanism to ensure privacy [66]. Furthermore,
    in case of parameters which can bear some noise or error, pointwise differential
    privacy can be integrated to protect their privacy. Privacy Leakage Scenarios
    During Spectrum Sharing Spectrum sharing/decision is the third step after spectrum
    analysis, this step is further divided into three major steps involving allocation
    of resources, accessing of spectrum, and trading of spectrum [76]. To demonstrate
    it further, after spectrum analysis, CR nodes have the choice to choose the best
    available spectrum, and in order to do so, they first participate in spectrum
    trading to win the best available spectrum slot. Afterwards, the desired resource
    is allocated to them by FC or by some other server, and after completion of these
    two steps, they can access the spectrum for communication. These steps involve
    plenty of informational parameter exchange, which can lead to CR users. In this
    section, various cases of privacy leakage in scenarios involving spectrum sharing
    have been discussed. Privacy Leakage in Spectrum Auctions Spectrum auction is
    a whole new world involving mathematical models. For instance, game theory has
    been applied to it to achieve better results during auctions [77]. Similarly,
    for the majority of auctions, equilibrium is usually evaluated to get best results
    [78]. Alongside this, machine learning is also being applied to spectrum auctions
    to predict best outcomes [79]. Since this step has been explored a lot, the risk
    of privacy leakage has also increased a lot, and plenty of attacks on auction
    mechanisms have been developed in the past. In this section, we also discuss certain
    sub aspects of auctions such as BP. Prospective Role of Differential Privacy:
    Since spectrum auctions are vulnerable to privacy attacks, privacy preservation
    is required during this process. To preserve auction privacy, differential privacy
    obfuscation is a viable solution because with differentially private auctions,
    one can still enhance social welfare of auction alongside preserving differential
    privacy. Similarly, in case of spectrum auctions, differential privacy can be
    used to protect privacy of both SUs and PUs acting as spectrum sellers and buyers,
    respectively. (A detailed discussion about these mechanisms is given in “Differential
    Privacy Approaches for Cognitive Radio Networks”.) PU Asking Price Privacy Submitting
    available spectrum slots alongside asking prices is one of the first step of the
    auction process. In this step PU node submits the available spectrum value alongside
    its asking price to FC or centralized server, which is further displayed to CR
    nodes to collect bids [80]. However, these values are critical, as they contain
    information about PU spectrum usage, and an adversary can get insights that when
    a PU is vacant, or occupied. By this analysis, the adversary can plan an adversarial
    activity or can launch an attack on the basis of previous knowledge. Similarly,
    an adversary can get insights about financial condition/dependencies of PU on
    the basis of total spectrum band and the price he asked for it. Therefore, it
    is important to protect asking price privacy before publicizing these values.
    Prospective Role of Differential Privacy: Exponential shuffling, a mechanism of
    differential privacy can be used to introduce randomness in asking price string
    [81]. Similarly, the Laplace mechanism of differential privacy can be used to
    protect the privacy of asking price while managing social welfare of the complete
    auction process. Similarly, other ways could be to integrate differential privacy
    with some provable mechanism to protect identity indirectly alongside preserving
    privacy of PU nodes. SU Bidding Privacy Apart from PUs asking price privacy, it
    is important to protect valuations/bids of buyers during the auction process.
    Valuations for a specific spectrum band is personal information and the majority
    of CR buyers do not want their private valuations to get leaked [82]. To overcome
    this, researchers integrated sealed bid auctions in CRN, but modern machine learning-based
    attacks have caused privacy leakage even in sealed bid auctions. Therefore, it
    is important to protect privacy of bidding price alongside preserving privacy
    of asking price. Prospective Role of Differential Privacy: Private valuation of
    auction process can easily be protected using randomized differential privacy
    mechanism [83]. For SUs, differential privacy works from the perspective of addition
    of random noise in the set valued data, which plays an important role in hiding
    the actual valuation. For instance, a randomized valuation within the range of
    social welfare maximization can be generated for auction with the help of differential
    privacy. This randomized valuation ensures that the privacy does not get leaked
    and the social welfare for auction still remains positive. SU Demand Privacy Alongside
    valuations, the amount required by a particular SU is also personal, because no
    CR node wants to reveal the exact spectrum usage to any adversary [84]. This is
    because these spectrum usage values can further be used to carry out burglaries
    or other attacks at non-usage/idle times. Similarly, the demand of a particular
    SU does also signify the financial situation and other similar aspects. Therefore,
    SUs usually try not to reveal their actual demand to auction places where there
    is a chance of adversarial attacks. Considering this discussion, it can be claimed
    that if the demand of SUs can be protected, a large gain in spectrum trading can
    be seen because SUs will be able to participate in auction without the risk of
    losing their private information. Prospective Role of Differential Privacy: Demand
    by a particular SU is a personalized information, which it needs to be protected
    [85]. This value can easily be protected by dynamic differential privacy mechanisms.
    Differential privacy can be integrated at multiple steps during this demand protection
    process. The most significant way to overcome this issue is to integrate differential
    privacy with some provable mechanism. By doing this, one will be able to show
    perturbed demand alongside having a protected demand at the backend for verification
    and allocation. Another way could be to collect variable demand from SUs and then
    find out the finalized value via an obfuscation mechanism. Third way could be
    to use the Exponential obfuscation mechanism in a way that does not harm the utility
    but introduces a selection randomness. All these mechanisms can be used to protect
    demand privacy in a viable manner. Privacy Leakage in Spectrum Allocation After
    careful collection of asking price and bids, the next step is the allocation of
    spectrum. This step is usually carried out via some game-theoretic auction model.
    Some prominent auctions used in CRN include double auction, VCG auction, Dutch
    auction [86]. These auction models analyse all collected values and find the auction
    winner according to the prescribed process. Although highest bidder wins the best
    spectrum in these auctions, this can cause privacy leakage at various levels.
    For instance, the identity privacy of the winner can be leaked by analysing the
    auction result [87]. Similarly, the identity privacy of sellers gets leaked and
    it can be analysed that which seller has a specified amount of available spectrum.
    Alongside this, the financial situation of PU and SU nodes can be analysed by
    adversaries as a result of this spectrum. Similarly, the number of available channels
    involved in auctions can also be leaked during allocation. Therefore, designing
    a privacy preserving spectrum allocation model should be considered while developing
    CR auctions. Prospective Role of Differential Privacy: Significant research on
    integration of differential privacy in auction allocation have been carried out
    and these research works have showed that differential privacy protection is a
    suitable method to protect privacy during auctions allocation [88]. From CRN perspective,
    there is a need to design certain works which ensure truthful and private allocation
    alongside enhancing social welfare. In this way, the Laplace mechanism of differential
    privacy can play a significant role to ensure identity and multi-channel privacy
    at the time of allocation by integrating controlled randomized obfuscation. Privacy
    Leakage Scenarios During Spectrum Mobility The fourth and final step in the cognitive
    cycle revolves around movement of SU nodes at the time of PU arrival called as
    spectrum mobility [89]. In this step, first of all, PU tries to access the licensed
    spectrum back, which in return forces SU nodes to leave the spectrum immediately.
    Then SU vacates the spectrum and stops communication on it. SUs then looks for
    another available spectrum or waits for the PU to stop the communication again
    in order to resume their communication [76]. In both cases, privacy gets leaked
    at multiple events ranging from request to hand-off. Let’s discuss that how differential
    privacy can play its role to mitigate these privacy risks. SU Holding Time Privacy
    When a SU occupies a spectrum, it holds the spectrum until the PU arrives, or
    it holds the spectrum until the required communication need is fulfilled [54].
    In both cases, SU does not want other adversaries to know the exact amount of
    time the spectrum was held by it. For instance, if the specific time gets leaked,
    then the adversary can find out that the particular SU held the spectrum on a
    particular place for an ‘X’ amount of time which can further lead to harmful events.
    Therefore, protecting privacy of SUs holding time is important and specific privacy
    preserving mechanisms should be designed for this purpose. Prospective Role of
    Differential Privacy: Channel holding time can be used to infer private information
    of SU, it should therefore be protected by designing privacy preserving mechanisms.
    In this case, differential privacy can play an active role by integrating Laplace-based
    obfuscation in values of holding time [90]. This obfuscation ensures that adversaries
    will not be able to predict with confidence about the presence or absence of a
    specific SU on a spectrum. Similarly, at the time of sharing holding time, the
    exponential randomness can be used to ensure randomized response in order to protect
    privacy of SU. Privacy Leakage During Spectrum Hand-Off When PU arrives, SUs are
    forced to leave the spectrum causing privacy leakage at multiple levels. Firstly,
    PU may know that a particular SU is within its specified region. Secondly, SUs
    might have to carry out SS again to find the new appropriate spectrum, which again
    opens the door for all privacy leakage scenarios during SS. Thirdly, alongside
    SU, the identity privacy of PU is also at risk, because SU can infer the presence
    of PU in its region by visualizing the request [10]. Therefore, it is important
    to integrate a privacy preserving mechanism at the time of spectrum hand-off.
    Prospective Role of Differential Privacy: Spectrum hand-off comprises multiple
    steps, so a simple obfuscation mechanism will not be enough to protect privacy
    as it will only cover a single aspect. Therefore, there is a need to design such
    differential privacy mechanisms which protect the privacy of multiple parallel
    events to ensure a trustworthy CRN. For instance, a Laplace-based location privacy
    mechanism can be used to protect the privacy of SUs location [90]. In this mechanism,
    differential privacy can be used to introduce randomness in the location reporting
    to PU. Secondly, the sensing request should be done in a randomized way to protect
    this request privacy [91]. Afterwards, from the perspective of PU, an Exponential
    mechanism can be used to show randomized PU to SU instead of accurate identity.
    Similarly, the location privacy of PU at hand-off can also be protected by integrating
    Laplace obfuscation at the time of hand-off request. Summary In this section,
    we analysed privacy leakage scenarios during cognitive cycle which can be exploited
    by adversaries to infer privacy of CR participating users. We analysed all four
    steps involved in cognitive cycle ranging from sensing, and analysis to sharing
    and mobility. In SS, majority of sources are linked with location privacy. For
    instance, location privacy of SUs and PUs during collection of their values. Contrary
    to this, the sources in spectrum analysis step are more related identical threats
    such as characteristics privacy and network topology privacy. Moving further to
    spectrum sharing, it can be visualized that literature is more titled towards
    privacy leakage during different steps of trading. Finally, in spectrum mobility,
    the privacy leakage is discussed from the perspective of hand-off, which involves
    both identity and location privacy. Moving further to the mitigation of these
    privacy issues, we also provide an in-depth discussion about each possible scenario
    that how differential privacy can play its role in overcoming privacy issues at
    different steps. We have provided a detailed discussion from the perspective of
    integration of both Laplace and Exponential mechanisms of differential privacy
    in CRN. From the discussion it can be deduced that differential privacy is a dynamic
    privacy preservation strategy that can play a significant role in all four cognitive
    cycle steps. And it can be used by researchers in multiple CR scenarios, where
    there is a risk of privacy leakage. Performance Matrices for Evaluating Differentially
    Private CRN Mechanisms In the previous sections, we highlight significance of
    differential privacy in preserving privacy of CRN. This section highlights performance
    parameters that should be taken care of while developing of differentially private
    CR mechanisms. This section divides performance matrices into three categories,
    first are the matrices which are required while designing differential privacy
    techniques; second are those matrices which should be taken care of to avoid attacks;
    and third are those matrices which should be focused in CR applications. From
    the Perspective of Privacy Preservation There are three important parameters which
    need to be considered while developing of differentially private CRN works. These
    are discussed below. Degree of Privacy While designing any privacy preservation
    mechanism it is important to figure out the degree of privacy required by application.
    For example, some applications might need a high level of privacy, but they can
    compromise on utility, for example, EV battery status reporting [92]. Contrarily,
    some applications might need a high level of utility but can compromise a little
    bit on privacy, for example, industrial manufacturing. Similar is the case in
    CRN, where some aspects in the cognitive cycle might require a higher level of
    privacy. For example, location reporting during SS might need a high level of
    privacy due to involved location inference risks. However, some aspects might
    require a high level of utility, such as available frequency values from a particular
    PU. Considering this discussion, it is important that one should determine the
    degree of privacy before designing and evaluating the privacy preserving model
    for CRN. Due to differential privacy noise addition, the degree of privacy can
    be further divided into: (a) degree of privacy due to noise, and (b) degree of
    privacy due to anonymity. The detailed discussion on these parameters is given
    below. Degree of Privacy due to Noise: While designing a differential privacy
    mechanism, it is important to figure out the level of required noise for the specific
    cycle. In differential privacy, two factors actively contribute in determination
    of noise, first one is privacy budget (\(\varepsilon\)), while second is sensitivity
    (\(\delta\)). In a differentially private CR mechanism, \(\varepsilon\) is used
    to determine the value of noise which is going to add in the output result. This
    \(\varepsilon\) is chosen after careful consideration and is usually backed by
    a strong theoretical guarantee. For instance, specific theoretical contributions
    have been carried out to choose the appropriate \(\varepsilon\) value [93]. This
    \(\varepsilon\) is inversely proportional to noise level, which means the higher
    value of \(\varepsilon\) provides less privacy and low values of \(\varepsilon\)
    provides high privacy values. Similarly, in different CR scenarios different \(\varepsilon\)
    values are required, which is determined at the time of mechanism design. For
    instance, in case of location reporting during SS, the desired \(\varepsilon\)
    value is pretty low, which ensures that the chances of location value getting
    leaked are pretty less. On the other hand, if one is determining final price of
    spectrum band during auction, only a minor level of noise can play the required
    role. Therefore, in such cases even the high value of \(\varepsilon\) can fulfil
    the requirement. Similarly, the sensitivity \(\Delta\) value of a differentially
    private mechanism is usually determined on the basis of data. Formally, sensitivity
    is defined as maximum possible impact of one record in accordance with all neighbouring
    datasets. This value is used in the noise addition and plays a significant role
    in determining the noise value. For instance, a CR database in which the participants
    have such values which differ a lot with each other might have high sensitivity
    value. On the other hand, a CR database in which the difference is pretty small,
    will have low sensitivity. Therefore, it is important to determine the sensitivity
    of model before implementing it. Certain works also highlighted dynamic varying
    sensitivity on the basis of dynamic data, but even in that case a predetermined
    method to choose appropriate sensitivity is required. Degree of Privacy due to
    Anonymity: Another parameter similar to noise level is anonymity level, which
    basically is the level of privacy/anonymity after noise addition. This level is
    determined by comparing the anonymized dataset with original dataset. Similarly,
    certain works also mentioned it as degree of privacy leakage. In differentially
    private CRN, it can be termed as the difference between sanitized and non-sanitized
    CR dataset whether it is in case of sensing, analysis, sharing, or mobility. For
    instance, if one requests a sensing query from a dataset, then the level of privacy
    that an observer will see is the actual anonymity of that privacy preservation
    mechanism. Considering this discussion, it can be concluded that one needs to
    take care of anonymity level as well during development of differentially private
    CR mechanisms. Computational Complexity Computational complexity is a very important
    parameter in designing a privacy preservation strategy [94]. Among all privacy
    preservation mechanisms (such as anonymization, encryption, information-theoretic
    privacy.) differential privacy has minimum computational complexity due to its
    light-weight nature [36]. However, even during development of differentially private
    CR mechanisms, the aspect of computational complexity cannot be ignored. This
    is because of the fact that sometimes, CR nodes are pretty minute, and they cannot
    handle large computations. For instance, let us take the case of a low-powered
    agricultural sensor which is measuring crop parametric values and is carrying
    out communication through CR. In this case, multiple sensors taking these readings
    will be pretty minute and will not have enough computational complexity to carry
    out heavy tasks. And if one thinks of integrating local differential privacy with
    these nodes, then it will need such a local differential privacy mechanism which
    is computationally efficient and can be supported by these nodes. Therefore, it
    is important to ensure that the complexity of differentially private CR mechanisms
    is well suited for the concerned application.  Table 3 Benchmarks achieved from
    the perspective of differential privacy, cognitive radio networks, and their integration
    Full size table Utility Evaluation Utility is one of the most considered factors
    during the development of privacy preservation models because it determines the
    usefulness of the mechanism. Similar is the case with differential privacy models,
    where utility plays a very important role in determining privacy budget and anonymity
    level [99]. Similarly, in differentially private CRN models the utility also plays
    a very important role because this factor is responsible for smooth functioning
    of the network. For instance, if the utility of SS values is low, then CR nodes
    shall not be able to access spectrum in the best way, which in turn shall impact
    the spectrum utilization. Similarly, if utility is not considered during spectrum
    trading then the social welfare being of auction may go negative. Similarly, the
    possibility of auction being in non-equilibrium state is also there if auction
    utility is not considered properly. Therefore, during development of differentially
    private CRN models, utility needs to be considered in detail. In order to do so,
    researchers specifically evaluate utility parameters in their experimental evaluation
    to ensure that the utility of the proposed mechanism is up to a specific level,
    and noise addition has not disturbed utility much. Attack Resilience Preventing
    adversarial attack is one of the most prominent features of a privacy model. Different
    privacy mechanisms provide resilience to different types of attacks. Similarly,
    the differential privacy model also provides strong resilience to a lot of privacy
    attacks [100]. Nevertheless, differential privacy provides resilience to a number
    of attacks. There are some attacks which need special consideration while developing
    differentially private CR models due to the nature of the adversary involved.
    In this section, three major attacks that are of sheer importance in preserving
    CRN privacy are discussed. Inference Attack The first attack that requires special
    consideration is inference attack in CRN. As the name suggests, the adversary
    tries to infer private data of participants by carrying out various statistical
    analysis [101]. Similarly, in certain cases, the adversary tries to use various
    machine/deep learning tools as well to find out more about the participants involved
    in the dataset. In CRN, this inference attack is usually carried out by an external
    adversary who tries to find out more information from a centralized server by
    asking unethical queries or by gaining maximum possible access to the database.
    For instance, the adversary can try to ask multiple queries related to a single
    person in a database to find more about that particular individual. Therefore,
    while developing differentially private CRN models, it is important to evaluate
    and check the effect of inference attacks on databases. This is usually done by
    asking multiple queries and evaluating the privacy leakage effect through differentially
    private answers. In this way, one can analyse if the proposed differentially private
    model is resilient to inference attack or not. Disclosure Attack Disclosure attack
    is more related to leakage of private information about a particular individual,
    spectrum band, or an organization [102]. In certain cases, the organizations/FCs
    have to share the dataset to observers in order to perform certain statistical
    tasks. But they do not share the dataset directly, they first anonymize the database
    through a privacy preservation mechanism and then share the dataset for statistical
    tasks. Indeed, FCs try their best to make the private information protected, but
    if the data analysing observer is an adversary then it tries to carry out a disclosure
    attack in order to infer private information. To overcome this, researchers are
    now integrating the phenomenon of differential privacy before publicizing databases.
    Therefore, disclosure attack analysis is pretty important in cases where the possibility
    of publishing anonymized data is high. Differential privacy mechanism provides
    strong resilience to this attack, as it randomizes databases in a manner that
    the presence/absence of a particular individual cannot be guessed with confidence.
    Because the value of noise always keeps the observer in ambiguity, it cannot predict
    anything with confidence. Correlation Attack Another critical attack that needs
    to be considered while developing differentially private CR models is correlation
    attack. A correlation attack is usually used after query evaluation. For example,
    after query evaluation, the data of queries is stored at the adversary side, and
    then the adversary tries to carry out machine/deep learning-based analysis over
    the collected information. The adversary combines the collected information with
    other publicly available datasets to find out links and correlation between participants
    [103]. This correlation analysis can further be used to infer into private information
    of participating CR users, whether they are the corresponding PUs/SUs or not.
    Therefore, while developing differentially private CR protocols it is important
    for researchers to analyse the effect of correlation attack in order to show resilience
    to it. From the Perspective of Cognitive Radio Alongside privacy and other matrices,
    certain parameters from CR perspective do also need careful analysis and evaluation
    while designing differentially private CR matrices. Usually, a networking protocol
    is evaluated on the basis of enhancement in throughput, communication overhead,
    and communication delay [104]. However, in the case of CRN, it is also important
    to figure out that the proposed model also analyses the effect of PU activity
    in the proposed model. In this section, we provide a thorough discussion of why
    the evaluation of these parameters is important while designing a differentially
    private CR model. Incorporating PU Activity The most important parameter from
    the CR perspective of incorporation of PU activity in the proposed model. CR is
    known for its dynamic capability of allowing CR nodes to carry out communication
    in the presence of PUs. Therefore, evaluating the proposed model with certain
    PU activity is important. PU activity can simply be defined as the usage of spectrum
    by primary nodes. This usage can be of different types and various PU activity
    patterns have been developed by researchers called as long-term, high, low, and
    intermittent. Each of these models has their own significance and cause different
    types of inference to CR usage. A detailed discussion about these models can be
    found in [74]. Since these models pose different types of inferences to utility,
    usability, and privacy of the network, while developing differentially private
    CR models, it is important to incorporate these activities to show a broader perspective.
    Throughput Enhancement Throughput is another critical parameter that is used by
    researchers to evaluate effectiveness of CR protocols [105]. Generally, throughput
    in wireless networks is considered as the total number of messages transmitted
    in a particular time interval [106]. However, in CRN, throughput analysis is pretty
    vast and a number of scenarios come under throughput enhancement and analysis.
    For instance, the sensing of spectrum and PU nodes around CR nodes also comes
    under throughput, as the faster the sensing works, the faster will the throughput
    of the network [105]. Similarly, the spectrum hand-off speed at the time of mobility
    of CR nodes is also considered as throughput. However, the important thing is
    that, if one wants to integrate differential privacy in these aspects then it
    is important to ensure that the throughput of CRN should enhance or at least do
    not decrease by addition of external noise. Therefore, while developing differential
    privacy CR models, authors are suggested to evaluate throughput aspect to ensure
    the speed of the network. Delay Enhancement Delay is usually taken in terms of
    the time taken to carry out some operation; however, in wireless networks it is
    the time that a packet takes from source to destination [107]. This parameter
    is being considered by approximately every second work in the field of CRN because
    they want to ensure that their model is efficient enough to carry out seamless
    communication. But when we talk about integration of differential privacy in CRN,
    it becomes a more critical parameter. Because the communication is now obfuscated,
    and in order to get beneficial output, one has to take special care of delay caused
    due to perturbation. Therefore, while evaluating differentially private CR models,
    researchers are usually advised to evaluate this delay parameter alongside. Communication
    Overhead Analysis Overhead caused by communication cannot be neglected while developing
    differentially private CR mechanisms because it plays an important role to carry
    out smooth communication between nodes [108]. Typically, differential privacy
    works over noise, but this noise addition should not contribute overhead. If the
    overhead increases because of noise addition, then the overall network performance
    will be reduced. Therefore, during development of differentially private CR models,
    researchers perform overhead analysis and compare the overhead of the proposed
    model with previous models without differential privacy. In this way, the proposed
    model is analysed and approved efficiently enough for practical implementation
    in CRN. Summary In this section, a comprehensive analysis of all matrices that
    can play a critical role during design and development of differentially private
    CRN protocols have been presented. Overall, we divide parameters in three categories
    from the perspective of privacy, attacks, and CR. We then subdivide each category
    further to provide a much clearer picture for our readers. Firstly, from the perspective
    of privacy preservation, we first discuss how noise level and anonymity level
    can play the role in determining the degree of privacy. Afterwards, we highlight
    that how computational complexity should be evaluated at the time of designing
    differentially private models, and finally we provide insights about utility evaluation
    of differentially private CR models. Secondly, from the perspective of attack
    resilience, we gave a thorough investigation about top three attacks which are
    important to be prevented in differentially private CR models. First attack is
    inference attack which is caused due to harmful inference of adversary on centralized
    data centres or communication links. Second attack we discuss is data disclosure
    attack, which is more linked to data sharing, while the third attack we analysed
    is correlation attack in which strong machine/deep learning models are used to
    find out correlation between other databases and CR databases. Finally, in the
    third parametric category, we analyse parameters from CR perspective and provide
    discussion about four CR parameters which should be discussed in technical works.
    Firstly, we discuss primary user incorporation; then we provide discussion about
    throughput enhancement; afterwards, we analyse delay and overhead of CRN. Overall,
    it can be concluded that if one is designing a differential privacy-based CR protocol,
    then analysing and evaluating these parameters will help shape the work in the
    best manner. Fig. 5 A Detailed Classification of Technical Works Integrating the
    Concept of Differential Privacy (DP) in Cognitive Radio Networks at Various Cognitive
    Cycle Scenarios Full size image Table 4 A Parameter-based Evaluation of Technical
    Works Integrating Differential Privacy in Cognitive Radio Networks Full size table
    Differential Privacy Approaches for Cognitive Radio Networks In previous sections,
    we discussed how differential privacy can play its role in developing private
    CRN models, and that parameters should be considered while developing differentially
    private CR protocols. In this section, an extensive literature review that involves
    integration of differential privacy with CRN at different models is discussed.
    Based on the cognitive cycle, the technical work has been divided into three categories,
    that is differential privacy in: (i) SS, (ii) spectrum analysis, and (iii) spectrum
    sharing. Evaluation of the technical work is given in Table 4, whereas classification
    of the technical work is given in Fig. 5. Differential Privacy in Spectrum Sensing
    Spectrum sensing involves carrying out measurement and observations for efficient
    utilization of spectrum bands [121]. In SS, SUs sense their surroundings and develop
    a radio environment map by sharing these values with each other to get better
    results [122]. The sensing could be through centralized FC (which is also known
    as database-driven SS) or it could be through collaborative or crowdsourced approach
    in which all CR nodes collaborate to figure out the optimal environment. No matter
    which approach is used; the risk of privacy leakage still exists. For instance,
    location privacy, identity privacy, and behavioural privacy of PUs, SUs, and FC
    are always at risk when multiple parties are involved. Therefore, it is important
    to integrate a privacy preservation mechanism in order to protect privacy in an
    efficient manner. We now discuss technical approaches which propose this integration
    and develop their models. Collaborative Spectrum Sensing Sensing spectrum in a
    collaborative fashion is one of the prominent steps of CRN, as this gives information
    about surroundings in order to access the most beneficial spectrum. However, this
    step is vulnerable to privacy leakage as well, and to overcome this privacy leakage,
    differential privacy can play a viable role. The first work in this direction
    providing detailed insights about the development of a differentially private
    incentive mechanism has been presented by Dong et al. [115]. The work developed
    a CSS model and integrated the concept of differential privacy to protect privacy.
    Authors developed a multi-bid model which collects bids from sensing participants
    and selects sensing winners in differentially private manner. In the proposed
    work, authors ensured that they maximize social welfare alongside enhancing winners’
    cost efficiency. The work provided extensive theoretical analysis for differential
    privacy guarantees; however, an analysis from the perspective of welfare maximization
    is missing in the article. Another work discussing differential privacy for crowdsourced
    SS of CRN have been carried out by Jin and Zhang [114]. Authors proposed two models
    named as PriCSS\(^+\) and PriCSS\(^+\) and demonstrated that both of the proposed
    models preserve location privacy using differential privacy protection. Alongside
    protection, authors also enhanced payment system and proposed a truthful and cost
    minimizing payment mechanisms of SS participants. From the perspective of evaluation,
    authors carried out evaluation on multiple PU activities and evaluated utility
    and network overhead to demonstrate that their proposed model outperforms others
    in this perspective. A similar work on location privacy preservation for CSS is
    presented by Li et al. [116]. Authors proposed a privacy preserving sensing scheme,
    PPSS. The authors further proposed two private protocols of PPSS for aggregation
    and injection during sensing called PPRSA and DDRI respectively. Authors evaluated
    the proposed model on SRLP and DLP attacks by taking values from real-testbed
    sampling region of CRN. From experimental evaluations, it can be seen that the
    proposed model successfully protected privacy of model alongside enhancing entropy
    and fluctuations of received signal strength. The fourth work in the domain of
    differentially private privacy protection for crowdsourced SS have been carried
    out by Huang and Gong [117]. The work featured the method of geo-cast for hop
    by hop message dissemination and broadcast in CRN, and in the article authors
    demonstrated that how location privacy gets leaked via this type of sensing. The
    proposed model enhanced privacy protection for geo-cast SS alongside providing
    enhancement in agents task acceptance, system overhead, and report correlation.
    In the experimental evaluation, the work analysed correlation in the data; however,
    the aspect of privacy leakage and error rate is missing, which is one of the critical
    aspect that should be added in the location reporting works. Private Spectrum
    Aggregation Apart from CSS, a work discussing private sensing aggregation and
    auction in CRN is presented by Zhou et al. [118]. The work first proposed an efficient
    data aggregation model for multiparty CRN, and then demonstrated the sources of
    privacy leakage in this model. Thus, in order to overcome the privacy leakage,
    the authors further propose a light-weight privacy preserving aggregation strategy
    using the concept of dynamic differential privacy. And, alongside providing private
    aggregation, authors also proposed PPSSA for differentially private spectrum auction
    to enhance revenue of auctioneer. The authors further evaluated their proposed
    models and experimental evaluation showing that the proposed strategy not only
    enhances communication cost, but also enhances SUs satisfaction and auctioneers’
    revenue. Authors provide an in-depth theoretical analysis for the proposed work;
    however, it is important to mention that the article does not have any algorithm,
    which is usually helpful in replicating the work for future experiments by new
    researchers. Database Driven Spectrum Sensing In SS for CRN, one cannot ignore
    the discussion about database driven SS, which is the second most prominent strategy
    to carry out SS after CSS [89]. This method is dominantly used by SUs to get efficient
    results, but research has indicated that it can also cause privacy leakage. In
    order to overcome this privacy leakage, researchers have proposed the usage of
    differential privacy in database driven SS. The first work in the integration
    of differential privacy in CSS have been carried out by Wang et al. [97]. It is
    a privacy preserving framework for SU in CRN on basis of cloaking time and named
    the framework as PromCos. Authors draw the motivation that in order to carry out
    efficient sensing, it is important to incentivize and enhance trust of SUs in
    the network. In order to do so, authors computed differentially private theoretical
    privacy guarantees for SU, and afterwards, evaluated these guarantees on SP, SU,
    and collusion attack to ensure privacy. Some other works evaluated database driven
    private sensing from a differentially private perspective. The first work in enhancing
    privacy of database driven CRN was carried out by Zhang et al. [120]. The aim
    of the article is to develop an inference free framework for both SUs and PUs
    in which both will be able to play their part in SS without the risk of losing
    their private location and identity data. The authors formulated theoretical bounds
    for optimal decisions of PUs and SUs, and then evaluated these bounds by carrying
    out extensive experimental evaluation, which ensured utility of both participating
    SUs and PUs. The final work for integration of differential privacy in CRN was
    carried out by Li et al. [119]. The work focused over evaluation of privacy preserving
    models for SU privacy in database driven CRN. The proposed work analysed four
    different types of adversaries and then proposed two security matrices called
    indistinguishable input and adversarial estimation error. Afterwards, the authors
    evaluated the privacy preservation models and showed the effect of these models
    with respect to proposed matrices. Overall, it will not be wrong to say that the
    article is a good piece of literature for a new researcher in the field. But in-depth
    analysis, evaluation, and experiments from the perspective of the field are lacking

    after getting values from SS devices is the second and one of the most critical
    steps in cognitive cycle, because this step is used to opt or bid for a specific
    spectrum or not [68]. It also checks if a specific available spectrum band is
    suitable for the required communication. Therefore, a careful analysis of spectrum
    is carried out in this step which involves two major steps named character analysis
    and parameter configuration. However, careful analysis has shown that the privacy
    of participants, especially the privacy of PUs gets leaked during this step [123].
    Therefore, it is important to protect the privacy of participating nodes alongside
    providing efficient service. In order to protect the privacy of participating
    PUs and SUs during spectrum analysis, we believe the obfuscation mechanism of
    differential privacy can be utilized in an efficient manner. Primary User Data
    Analysis Privacy From the perspective of integration of differential privacy in
    spectrum analysis, it can be observed that work has only been carried out to protect
    PU privacy. In this direction, two significant works have been carried out so
    far. Both focus on preserving privacy of participating PUs during spectrum analysis,
    as PUs are the most vulnerable participants because their data is being analysed
    in this step. The first work for protecting operation-time privacy of PU in CRN
    is carried out by Dong et al. [53]. The authors named the proposed mechanism as
    PriDSS, in which they carried out a two-fold contribution. First from the perspective
    of providing efficient selection of SUs for dynamic sharing systems, and secondly
    from the perspective of providing privacy on operation time of PUs. This work
    integrated and contributed to multiple aspects of spectrum analysis within a single
    article. For instance, they worked on a SU selection problem by calling it a utility
    dependent problem, and then solved it by proposing a utility maximizing model.
    Afterwards, they explicitly mentioned that the operation-time of participating
    PUs is not private, and it can be used for various malicious purposes. For instance,
    detecting presence/absence of a particular PU or channel. After this discussion,
    they propose the strategy to efficiently select SUs from differentially private
    operation-time readings. The evaluation results of the proposed model showed that
    the work efficiently overcome privacy loss alongside providing efficient payments
    to maximize system utility. The second and the final work in the domain of differentially
    private PU privacy protection for CRN is carried out by Liu et al. [52]. The article
    focused on protecting the privacy of PUs in a real-time environment. The major
    motivation of the article is the real-time protection, as the authors mentioned
    that several other works protected privacy in database-driven environments, but
    the works protecting privacy in real-time are missing. Therefore, authors proposed
    a PU privacy protection model, which protects location privacy of PUs during spectrum
    analysis in a real-time environment. The article used the concept of cloaking
    time optimality to design a differentially private utility optimal model which
    also enhances spectrum usage efficiency. Alongside this, authors proposed theoretical
    guarantees to prove that how their proposed model obeys the rules of differential
    privacy in order to protect PUs from harmful adversarial interference. To demonstrate
    it further, they developed the notion of ‘expected interference error’ and evaluated
    and compared this notion with other recent works to show the significance of the
    proposed model. Nevertheless, there is not much work in the domain of differentially
    private spectrum analysis, but the two works demonstrated how differential privacy
    can enhance privacy in this step optimally. Therefore, there is a need for more
    work from the perspective of differentially private spectrum analysis. Differential
    Privacy in Spectrum Sharing Spectrum sharing is a decisive step in the cognitive
    cycle because multiple SUs are competing for an available spectrum at this stage.
    Usually, auctions are carried out to choose the optimal combination of buyer and
    seller which maximizes utility of auction [80]. These auctions are carried out
    in multiple different ways. For instance, some research work is carried out on
    traditional auction styles, while some works proposed crowdsensed auctions. Similarly,
    certain other works highlighted the use of auction grouping for CRN nodes on the
    basis of the double auction model. Among all these auctions, it is made sure that
    the proposed model is rational, truthful, and maximizes social welfare of the
    network [80]. Apart from auction models, another aspect of data analysis during
    spectrum sharing cannot be ignored, because it is used to learn and adapt efficient
    futuristic models of spectrum sharing [10]. Usually, the aspects of game-theory
    and machine/deep learning are used at this step to find optimal sharing strategies.
    In all these models, it is important to mention that the risk of privacy leakage
    cannot be ignored, and in order to overcome this privacy risk, the aspect of differential
    privacy is being integrated by researchers. In this section, we highlight the
    works which integrate the concept of differential privacy in spectrum sharing
    to produce optimal private results. Differentially private spectrum sharing work
    can be categorized into three domains from the perspective of auction model and
    spectrum sharing. The first two categories focus over integration of differential
    privacy in various types of auction, while the third category focus over integration
    of differential privacy in other processes involving spectrum sharing. Traditional
    Spectrum Auctions The first two works in this domain worked over integrating traditional
    auction models with differential privacy to ensure privacy in the trading. The
    first work discussing revenue maximization via approximate privacy guarantees
    is presented by Chen et al. [109]. The work proposed a differentially private
    revenue maximizing auction and named the proposed strategy as DEAR. The proposed
    DEAR algorithm is an auction model which protects the privacy of participating
    entities via the Exponential mechanism of differential privacy. The proposed work
    introduced differentially private randomness in bidders’ group in a hexagonal
    formation to ensure maximum privacy. Afterwards, the work also proved fairness
    enhancing theoretical guarantees of differential privacy to demonstrate that their
    work supports all theoretical bounds. Authors performed extensive experiments
    showing that the proposed work enhanced revenue of the auction market; however,
    it is also significant to mention that the evaluation from the perspective of
    social welfare of buyers is missing. Another work that evaluated differentially
    private auction mechanisms in CR settings was carried out by Wu et al. [110].
    Authors proposed a private auction model named ‘DIARY’ and then evaluated and
    compared the proposed model with four other state of the art models to show effectiveness
    of the proposed model. It can be seen from experimental results that DIARY outperforms
    other models from the perspective of seller, and auction revenue. Authors further
    supported their work by adding extensive theoretical contributions from the perspective
    of differential privacy and auction-based evaluations such as winner selection
    and price determination. Grouping-based Double Auction Another type of auction
    that is commonly used in differentially private CRN is grouping-based double auction.
    From this perspective, Zhu et al. [51] proposed DDSM mechanism which is a double
    auction scheme for differentially private spectrum grouping. Authors used the
    Exponential mechanism of differential privacy to select private optimal prices
    during the double auction process. Afterwards, authors proved using theoretical
    guarantees that their proposed price selection model provides truthfulness and
    rationality alongside providing private pricing. The second work in the domain
    of differentially private auction was carried out by Hu et al. [98]. The authors
    used \(Geom(\alpha )\) distribution to protect bid privacy during the auction
    process. The new distribution is combined with a differentially private noise
    addition model to find out the optimal amount of noise for the bid value before
    encryption. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms
    other similar works in terms of revenue, satisfaction, and privacy of PUs and
    SUs. The article is a twofold contribution from the perceptive of auction and
    differential privacy. But the experimental evaluation only shows the evaluation
    of auction properties, while the evaluation for privacy parameters is missing.
    Data-Driven Spectrum Sharing Apart from auction works, some researchers worked
    over integration of differential privacy in data-driven aspects of private spectrum
    sharing. The first work that falls in this category is carried out by Wang et
    al. [111], which focused on preserving SUs privacy in data-driven spectrum trading.
    The contributions of the articles are twofold: firstly, authors preserved revenue
    of PUs by integrating differential privacy in it, and afterwards, authors preserved
    the demand values of SUs as well through dynamic differential privacy. The work
    first proposed an architecture in which available spectrum of PUs is aggregated
    for selling during spectrum sharing. PUs can sell the spectrum to centralized
    SSP at fixed price or can also sell it directly to SUs at the individual price.
    However, in both of the cases authors ensured that the privacy of PUs gets protected
    by adding a specified level of obfuscation in the trading. Alongside this, the
    centralized PSP also collects values and estimates the demand of SUs, in order
    to develop an efficient utilization matrix. This is also done in a differentially
    private manner to protect privacy of SUs. Overall work ensured that the proposed
    model is optimized with respect to revenue-maximization and risk-minimization.
    Another work targeting truthful aggregation via game-theoretic perspective is
    carried out by Zhou et al. [113]. This work introduced a novel game in CRN and
    called the game as an aggregative game, which is used to carry out large-scale
    modelling of spectrum sharing in CRN. Authors draw the motivation of proposed
    game by saying that in large-scale CRN, the information about each other is incomplete,
    which forms a ‘weak mediator’, and this weak mediator will not be able to reach
    Nash equilibrium with this incomplete information. Therefore, they developed an
    aggregative game to improve the utility of these systems. However, they showed
    that this type of learning can lead to privacy leakage, which they further eliminated
    by using the concept of differential privacy and proposed an incentive-compatible
    and differentially private approximate Nash equilibrium of aggregative game for
    CRN. The final work focusing over privacy enhancement of PUs in spectrum sharing
    has been carried out by Clark and Psounis [112]. The work first studied the trade-off
    between privacy and performance in differentially private CRN, and then proposed
    a generalized spectrum sharing model to overcome this trade-off. Authors considered
    this research gap as an optimization problem of privacy in which one measures
    the level of privacy on the basis of data exposure to possible adversaries. After
    that, the authors tried to fill this research gap by developing an optimal solution
    for multi-utility spectrum sharing model in terms of performance and efficiency
    of using spectrum in the best possible way. Summary In this section, a comprehensive
    overview of integration of differential privacy in CRN from the perspective of
    technical works is presented. We first categorized all technical works from the
    perspective of steps involved in cognitive cycle, and afterwards provide in-depth
    subcategories of these cycle steps on the basis of technical contributions in
    the article. From the discussion it can be seen that a variety of scenarios in
    spectrum analysis have been evaluated ranging from CSS to database-drive SS. Similarly,
    the aspect of differentially privacy spectrum sharing has also been explored a
    lot from trading and database analysis perspective. But, when we move to spectrum
    analysis and spectrum mobility, not much work can be seen. For instance, in spectrum
    analysis, only two technical works have carried out integration of differential
    privacy, and that too to protect PUs privacy. Similarly, from the perspective
    of differentially private spectrum mobility, none of the technical work evaluated
    this aspect in detail. Therefore, we did not provide this cycle step in the classification
    figure and table. This discussion opens a wide-range of future directions especially
    from the perspective of spectrum analysis and spectrum mobility in CRN. Applicability
    of Differential Privacy in Futuristic Cognitive Radios Apart from the privacy
    leakage in traditional usage, the notion of CR is also being applied to various
    applications. For instance, CRN are being integrated with smart grid and other
    similar technologies to carry out resource efficient communication [124]. Nevertheless,
    these integrations provide a vast number of benefits, but they also come with
    certain drawbacks, and one of the largest among them is the privacy leakage. Therefore,
    preserving privacy is of sheer importance in futuristic CR-based technologies.
    In this section, discuss the importance of privacy in these applications, and
    then we provide an in-depth discussion that how differential privacy can be used
    to project privacy in these scenarios. Cognitive Radio-Based Smart Grid Integration
    of CR with traditional energy grids is also one of the key features being considered
    during development of modern smart grid systems [124]. This integration has provided
    a wide range of benefits ranging from power reduction to low-latency communication
    between smart meters and grid utilities [125]. For instance, CR-based smart metering
    nodes can carry out communication over available spectrum bands without having
    heavy license cost. Similarly, the highly adaptive nature of CR communication
    is suitable to carry out almost every possible operation of smart grid, whether
    its real-time reporting, fault monitoring, or meter firmware updates, etc. Nevertheless,
    CR-based smart grid is a viable communication model for modern smart grid scenarios,
    but it also comes up with certain privacy-related issues which needs to be tackled.
    For example, daily lifestyle privacy of residents can be leaked if smart meters
    report their real-time data to grid utility via dynamic CR channel. Similarly,
    location privacy of smart meters can be leaked while carrying out spectrum analysis
    for communication. Therefore, it is important to protect the privacy of CR-based
    smart grid users before practical application of these scenarios. Integration
    of Differential Privacy In order to protect privacy of CR-based smart grid users,
    differential privacy can be used as a viable solution because of its dynamic and
    light-weight nature. For instance, CR-based smart meter nodes reporting their
    real-time data via unlicensed channels can use a perturbation mechanism of differential
    privacy to add noise in their values in order to protect their privacy. Similarly,
    Exponential perturbation of differential privacy can be used during spectrum analysis
    of CR-based smart meters. Apart from these prominent directions, differential
    privacy can also be used to protect usage privacy during firmware updates, fault
    detection, fault reporting, and other similar scenarios where smart grid nodes
    have to use functionalities of CRN to carry out communication. From the perspective
    of literature review in this domain, certain works (such as  [64, 126]) highlighted
    the use of differential privacy in smart grid reporting and other analysis. However,
    a full-fledged work discussing and integrating differential privacy in CR-based
    smart grid has not been carried out yet. Therefore, we believe that this domain
    has potential and this integration of differential privacy with CR-based smart
    grid communication can lead to development of secure and efficient modern energy
    infrastructures. Software-Defined Networks-based Cognitive Radio Since the emergence
    of CR, it has been incorporated with various technologies, and software-defined
    network (SDN) is one of them. This integration of CR and SDNs are in discussion
    for more than a decade due to its tremendous benefits [127]. SDNs provide CR users
    with an efficient architecture to carry out their communication and networking
    needs, which in turn will help to improve the efficiency and latency of CRN. Effective
    network management capabilities of SDN enables CR nodes to carry out efficient
    communication without worrying about network latency and complexity issues. However,
    despite these tremendous advantages, it can also be visualized that even SDN-based
    CR do also suffer with privacy issues because of centrally managed networks. As
    SDN uses various rules to manage network wide traffic, and all this is happening
    in a centralized manner; therefore, if an adversary gets control over this central
    entity or in case of some malicious query evaluation, the privacy of these networks
    is at risk [128]. Therefore, it is important to protect the privacy of these networks
    before integrating them with CR and other similar radios. Integration of Differential
    Privacy To overcome this issue of centralized query evaluation for SDN-based CRN,
    differential privacy serves as one of the most suitable options. Exponential mechanism
    of differential privacy can be used to protect privacy of CR users during query
    evaluation, during spectrum analysis, and during other cognition cycle steps.
    Similarly, critical information of the SDN-based CRN can also be protected via
    direct data perturbation/Laplace mechanism of differential privacy in order to
    reduce adversarial risk. For instance, during SS when every CR node transmits
    their data to a centralized SDN server, then instead of reporting plain-text data,
    one can report differentially private data in order to protect its location and
    identity privacy. Cognitive Radio-Based Internet of Things IoT is a widespread
    domain which is playing a very important role in our daily lives ranging from
    small temperature sensors in homes to massive ubiquitous sensing controllers taking
    decision of transportation [129]. If one looks around, IoT devices are everywhere
    around us and are being integrated with almost all major communication technologies
    to carry out operations in a streamline manner. As a part of this integration,
    researchers also integrated and used the concept of CR to carry out IoT communication,
    which has been proved to be beneficial in many ways [130]. For instance, smart
    in-home applications are being made capable of running over unlicensed spectrum
    in order to overcome spectrum scarcity due to immense increase in in-home sensors
    [131]. Similarly, smart cities are being developed with an aim of developing an
    eco-friendly environment, and one step in them is to carry out communication via
    CR instead of traditional licensed bands to reduce the excessive use of licensed
    spectrum [132]. Despite these tremendous benefits, the aspect of privacy leakage
    from these IoT devices cannot be ignored due to the large amount of data traversing
    across the network [133]. Integration of Differential Privacy IoT devices transmit
    a large amount of data to the network via CR unlicensed channels to carry out
    various operations for the functioning. If this data is not secured, then this
    can leak privacy of the device owners, which can lead to catastrophic results
    [134]. In this perspective, differential privacy can play a key role in both active
    and passive data protection of CR-based IoT devices. For example, in case if IoT
    devices are carrying real-time streaming of their data via CRN, then noise addition
    mechanism of differential privacy can protect data of this real-time streaming
    by injecting i.i.d noise in it. Similarly, in case of passive data protection
    for IoT where surveys, learning, and query evaluation is carried out, the randomization
    mechanism of differential privacy can play a role to produce ambiguity in attackers
    mind regarding presence or absence of a specific user or IoT node during learning.
    Therefore, we believe integrating differential privacy with IoT devices operating
    over CRN can be a viable solution to protect them from external and internal intruders.
    Machine/Deep Learning-Based Cognitive Radio Networks Since the advent of CRN,
    researchers are continuously trying to develop and integrate novel technologies
    to enhance its efficiency. One such pathway is integration of machine/deep learning
    with CRN. CRN by its basic nature is considered to be an artificially intelligent
    radio which is capable of taking intelligent decisions involving spectrum sharing,
    hand-off, etc. However, the integration of modern machine/deep learning models
    with CRN has opened a plethora of research directions via which one can enhance
    the functioning of CRN in an efficient manner [135]. For example, reinforcement
    learning provides CR users the functionality to develop their behaviour via interacting
    with the surrounding environment during the cognition cycle [136]. Apart from
    reinforcement learning, basic machine learning algorithms such as support vector
    machine (SVM), homomorphic machine learning, nearest neighbour, ANN, etc., have
    also aided a lot in development of modern CRN. Similarly, in the modern times,
    the integration of deep learning models with CRN is paving path for future intelligent
    radios, e.g. one such example is the integration of deep reinforcement learning
    with CRN, which enhances the capability of SS a bit further and provides CRN users
    with an efficient signalling results to choose the best possible option [137].
    Similarly, deep neural network (DNN)-based models are also being used to enhance
    the detection accuracy during spectrum sending [138]. Nevertheless, the research
    in machine/deep learning-based CRN is improving day by day, and a large amount
    of data from CR nodes is being collected to enhance the cognition cycle of CRN.
    This data is basically the feed to machine/deep learning models, and it will not
    be wrong to say that more data means high detection accuracy. However, on the
    other hand this data can leak a huge amount of private information of CR users.
    For example, accurate location information during SS can lead to location privacy
    leakage. Similarly, spectrum hand-off information can lead to leakage of holding
    time privacy of nodes. Therefore, alongside collecting this huge amount of data
    for machine/deep learning models, it is equally important to protect this data
    from all sorts of adversaries. Integration of Differential Privacy Nonetheless,
    the collected data during the cognition cycle can pose a huge privacy concern
    for CR users, but on the other hand differential privacy protection can be used
    to protect this privacy leakage to a large extent. Nowadays, differential privacy
    is a universally accepted matrix for privacy protection during machine/deep learning
    scenarios, thus differential privacy is being integrated with almost all state-of-the-art
    learning models to protect privacy at different levels. For instance, local differential
    privacy is being used to protect individual privacy before feeding the data to
    a machine learning model [139]. Similarly, differentially private learning in
    wireless big data networks is also being employed by researchers to test its efficacy
    in wireless scenarios [140]. Apart from these, differential privacy have proved
    its significance in almost all machine learning models, such as naïve bayes, linear
    regression, linear SVM, logistic regression, kernel SVM, decision tree, k-means
    clustering, etc. [141]. Thus, one can imply all these differentially private machine
    learning models in the majority of CR scenarios. For example, during machine learning
    for SS, local differential privacy can be used to protect user privacy. Similarly,
    during query evaluation and learning steps of cognition cycle, noise can be calibrated
    and added to protect individual privacy. Therefore, by keeping in view this discussion,
    it will not be wrong to say that differential privacy is one of the most viable
    solutions to protect privacy during machine learning-based CR applications, where
    users have to share their private data in order to get efficient outcomes. Cognitive
    Radio-Based UAV Communication Nowadays, drone technology (also known as unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV)) is booming, and various different sized drones are being
    used to carry out multiple applications around us ranging from sports streaming
    to carrying critical military operations [142]. In order to carry out efficient
    communication and message exchange between UAVs, researchers are using unlicensed
    CR-bands for communication [143]. In this way, UAVs can exploit the unused spectrum
    and can carry out their operations without causing their part in spectrum scarcity.
    Nonetheless, this integration is fruitful, but research has highlighted that the
    information exchange via this integration is not completely secure and is prone
    to many privacy attacks. For example, in autonomous UAVs, route planning is carried
    out, but this route planning also needs to be reported to neighbouring clusters
    via CR network to overcome possibility of any collusion. However, if this information
    gets leaked, it can reveal the complete planning and movement of UAV clusters.
    Therefore, it is important to protect the privacy of these UAVs in order to carry
    out seamless operations. Integration of Differential Privacy Similar to CR-based
    IoT devices, CR-based UAVs are also reporting their real-time planning, location,
    and identity values to the neighbouring nodes, clusters, and managing authorities
    to carry out operations in a streamline manner. This real-time reporting can cause
    serious privacy leakage because significant strategic information can be leaked
    from the reported values. Similarly, while performing steps involved in the cognition
    cycle, these UAVs also have to carry out SS, analysis, sharing, and mobility,
    which can also cause privacy leakage to a greater extent. In order to overcome
    these issues, the notion of differential privacy can play a critical role due
    to its dynamic nature of privacy protection during a real-time reporting environment.
    Different from other privacy preserving strategies, differential privacy can perturb
    values in real-time depending upon the allowed error rate. This real-time perturbation
    can be integrated with UAV real-time reporting and sensing to protect their private
    values. For example, if a UAV is reporting its identity in real-time just to show
    its presence, then its identity can be protected by adding i.i.d noise, which
    will not affect normal operations of the CR network, but on the other hand it
    will protect the identity theft of that particular UAV. Therefore, we believe
    integrating differential privacy with CR-based UAVs can be a good step ahead to
    develop a secure CR-based drone network. Cognitive Radio-Based Industrial Internet
    of Things Carrying out industrial operations via industrial sensors is a well-developed
    subfield of IoT which is also known as industrial IoT (IIoT). The sensors involved
    in IIoT are responsible to carry out decisions on the basis of received input
    [144]. For example, a sensor in a car manufacturing industry will take input from
    the buyer and will change the colour of the car according to the requirement.
    In order to provide seamless communication, these sensors are now being operated
    over unlicensed CR bands [145]. This integration of CR with IIoT architecture
    is enabling many industries and organizations to reduce their contribution in
    spectrum scarcity. However, on the other hand, these IIoT nodes are now more vulnerable
    to privacy issues because now they have to report their sensing values to the
    centralized CR moderators in order to perform steps involved in cognition cycle.
    Therefore, it is important to protect privacy of these CR-based IIoT nodes so
    that they can carry out their operations without risking them to potential adversaries.
    Integration of Differential Privacy The notion of differential privacy has been
    well researched in literature from the perspective of IIoT [65]. These research
    works have proved that integration of differential privacy with IIoT sensors and
    nodes can result in a fruitful outcome. For example, during sharing of mutual
    information among sensors, differential privacy perturbation can protect sensors
    and involve user’s privacy. Similarly, these concepts can also be applied to CR-based
    IIoT networks because they share pretty much similar space. For example, if an
    IIoT node has to carry out SS to choose the most viable spectrum band, then it
    can perturb its identity and location values to protect itself from network adversaries.
    Similarly, during information sharing on unlicensed spectrum, these IIoT nodes
    can add noise to protect information of users being shared via their medium. That
    is why, we believe that adding differential privacy with a CR-based IIoT network
    will pave the way for futuristic IIoT systems. Blockchain-Based Cognitive Radio
    Networks Blockchain came into sight as a backbone technology after the sudden
    boom in the price of Bitcoin since the past decade [146]. Since then, research
    works are being carried out to integrate blockchain in almost every second aspect
    of our everyday life [147]. In the quest of this integration, blockchain technology
    is now being used to perform various CR operations. For example, the steps involved
    in the cognition cycle are being performed on decentralized distributed blockchain
    networks in order to enhance trust in the network. This recording of CRN data
    on blockchain ledger ensures that all participants receive a fair outcome and
    will prevail a sense of security and trust in the network [148]. However, this
    decentralized nature also raises various questions, and one of the biggest questions
    among them is privacy of CR nodes. As mentioned, that the data from CR nodes will
    be reported and recorded on a tamper-proof decentralized ledger, which means that
    this data will be visible to all participating nodes in case of a public blockchain
    to ensure trust, but on the other hand an adversary or a node with adversarial
    intentions can also misuse this data as well. Similarly, as the data is tamper-proof
    and will always be there on the chain, then some adversarial node can also learn
    about past history of a CR node even if the node has left the network. These are
    certain privacy aspects which need to be addressed in detail before practical
    deployment of blockchain with CRN. Integration of Differential Privacy To preserve
    privacy of blockchain-based CRN, differential privacy can be a feasible solution
    because of the diverse adaptability of differential privacy protection. The biggest
    reason that makes blockchain-based CRN prone to privacy attack is the public availability
    of plain-text data on decentralized distributed ledger. This issue can be countered
    by adding pseudorandom noise via differential privacy to the data before reporting/recording
    it to a decentralized ledger. The noise in differential privacy is controlled
    by privacy budget, which ensures that the noisy values remain useful to carry
    out various operations such as statistical analysis, etc. But on the other hand,
    the strong theoretical guarantee of differential privacy also ensures that the
    adversary should not be able to get private information of CR nodes from the recorded
    data. Similarly, in private blockchain networks, certain analyses have been carried
    out to learn from CR data for futuristic purposes. This analysis can also be secured
    by introducing a layer of differential privacy between blockchain ledger and observer.
    Considering this discussion, we believe that differential privacy is one of the
    critical mechanisms which can play a key role in development of modern blockchain-based
    CRN. Cognitive Radio-Based Vehicular Networks Vehicular communication is not a
    new topic and it has been in discussion in the scientific community since ages
    [149]. Similar to other networks, these vehicular networks have also been made
    capable of running over unlicensed CR spectrum in order to preserve excessive
    usage of spectrum [150]. A plethora of research has been carried out to perform
    all operations of vehicular networks via CR so that modern vehicles do not contribute
    to spectrum shortage [151]. These research works have indicated that this integration
    of CR with vehicular ad hoc network is a viable solution, and vehicles can achieve
    low-latency rate and ultra-reliable communication by incorporating CRN during
    their communication. On the other side of the coin, these CR-based vehicular ad
    hoc networks (VANETS) are not completely secure and are prone to various privacy
    attacks because of their real-time reporting. Therefore, protecting privacy of
    these CR-based VANETS is of sheer importance and this issue needs to be resolved.
    Integration of Differential Privacy To protect privacy of CR-based VANETS, it
    is important to analyse the type of privacy leakages among these networks. If
    we analyse, it is evident that the most critical private information among CR-based
    VANETS is location privacy of vehicles. For example, one does not want to show
    to others whether he/she visited the hospital at a particular time or not. However,
    in case of CR-based VANET reporting, sensing, and analysis, this information is
    prone to adversaries, and any adversary with some background knowledge can get
    insights of exact values. In order to overcome this, differential privacy can
    be used to protect location privacy. As discussed in “Scenarios of Privacy Leakage
    During Cognitive Cycle and Prospective Role of Differential Privacy”, one can
    protect location information pretty easily by just incorporating randomness via
    differential privacy models. For example, if a vehicle adds differentially private
    noise to its location coordinated during SS, then the original coordinates will
    become protected. However, on the other hand the SS results will not have much
    effect because of the vehicle being present in the same region. Therefore, we
    believe integration of differential privacy with CR-based VANETS can serve as
    a viable step towards development of more secure and private vehicular networks.
    Challenges and Future Research Directions Till now, we provide a detailed overview
    of how differential privacy can play a critical role in various aspects of the
    CRN cognition cycle. For instance, we highlight the integration scenarios of differential
    privacy in SS, analysis, sharing, and mobility. Similarly, we highlight various
    parameters that need to be taken care of while designing differentially private
    CRN models. However, apart from all these discussions, there are certain challenges
    and future directions that need special considerations while designing future
    differentially private CRN models. In this section, we provide first provide insights
    about certain prospective integrations that can be beneficial for differentially
    private CRN, and then we highlight certain challenges that researchers exploring
    these directions can face during their evaluations. Integrating Blockchain with
    Differential Privacy and CRN During cognition cycle of CRN, SU, and PU nodes suffer
    with lack of trust due to centralized entities. For instance, during database-drive
    SS, one has to rely on a centralized database to provide efficient results. Similarly,
    this centralization is also a part of other steps in the cognition cycle, and
    it cannot be ignored. Indeed, this centralization provides benefits such as quick
    response, etc., but on the other hand it also raises serious trust-related issues
    in the network. Therefore, there is a need to develop decentralized models for
    modern CRN [152]. In order to provide an efficient alternative to centralization,
    the notion of blockchain came up as a saviour for CRN. Blockchain is a novel paradigm
    which is being applied to a large number of daily life domains because of its
    trust, availability, and tamper-proof nature [153]. Similarly, certain works also
    discussed and evaluated the integration of blockchain with CRN ranging from SS
    to other steps of the cognition cycle [41, 154,155,156,157]. However, just integrating
    blockchain with CRN is not a one-in-all solution to every problem as it also suffers
    from privacy issues due to its public nature [158]. Therefore, it is important
    to protect privacy of decentralized blockchain CRN. In order to ensure privacy
    in decentralized blockchain-based CRN, we believe that differential privacy can
    play a critical role. A very detailed survey on integration of differential privacy
    in various layers of blockchain has been presented in [159]. However, the aspect
    of integration of differential privacy in blockchain-based CRN has not been carried
    out yet. From the works integrating differential privacy with blockchain, it can
    be seen that it is an efficient solution to the privacy problem, but it still
    requires detailed research. For instance, one of the critical challenges for this
    integration is to choose optimal blockchain type, e.g. there could be scenarios
    in which public blockchain will perform the best as compared to consortium or
    private. Contrarily, for some functionalities, private or consortium blockchain
    will outperform public blockchain. Similarly, choosing an optimal differential
    privacy budget according to the decentralized nature of blockchain is another
    challenge that needs to be discussed in future works. Overall, we believe that
    this integration of blockchain, differential privacy, and CRN have a lot of scope
    in future but certain aspects require in-depth addressing before practical implementation.
    Differential Privacy in Game-Theoretic Spectrum Sharing Models Since spectrum
    is a non-renewable resource, it is important to use and allocate the spectrum
    in the most efficient manner. In order to do so, certain researchers worked over
    integration of game-theory in various scenarios of the cognition cycle. For instance,
    some works highlighted use dynamic games to get maximum benefits from CRN [160].
    Similarly, certain works highlighted use repeated games for power/spectrum allocation
    in CRN to maximize spectrum usage efficiency [161]. Alongside this, certain works
    also highlighted to use game-theory-based auctions for CR spectrum trading [86].
    However, the recent studies showed that CRN is vulnerable to certain privacy issues;
    therefore, it is important to integrate privacy preservation mechanisms with game-theoretic
    CRN approaches. The dynamic functionality of differential privacy can play a vital
    role in this integration, e.g. one aspect could be to design game-theoretic differentially
    private auctions that maximizes revenue alongside preserving privacy. This aspect
    has been touched by certain research works that we discussed in previous sections.
    However, it is important to highlight that maximizing revenue while preserving
    privacy is one of the biggest challenges that these mechanisms face. For instance,
    in a simple game-theoretic auction revenue can be maximized by proving various
    equilibriums in the system, such as Nash equilibrium, etc. However, in differentially
    private auctions, we cannot publicize the bids, which becomes a big hurdle to
    find optimal values. Certain works focused over approximate social welfare/revenue
    maximization, but this field still has a lot of potential which needs to be explored
    further. Another direction could be to integrate differential privacy with resource
    allocation of CRN, in which efficient resource allocation/sharing can be carried
    out in a private manner. This aspect of traditional resource allocation while
    maintaining equilibrium has been discussed by researchers [162]. However, from
    the perspective of CRN, this problem is not well addressed, and we need modern
    differentially private strategies specifically designed for game-theoretic resource
    allocation by considering dynamic spectrum access capability of CRN. A significant
    challenge that one can face while designing these differentially private CRN allocation
    strategies is to perform truthful reporting for any game-theoretic mechanism.
    Therefore, researchers should focus over this direction in order to get maximum
    benefit from game-theory for differentially private CRN. Differentially Private
    Cognitive Radio Trade-Offs CR works over the phenomenon of utilization of unused
    spectrum band when PU is not using the specific band. Thus, in order to utilize
    the spectrum in the most efficient manner, SUs are continuously sensing the environment
    to get better opportunities, and they switch to the best available spectrum. However,
    during this cognition cycle process, a large number of processes are taking place,
    which sometime can lead to unwilling circumstances, such as false alarm, energy
    wastage, etc. Thus, in order to eradicate such a phenomenon, SUs try to opt certain
    strategies to ensure the effectiveness of sensing, e.g. increasing sensing time
    duration for a specific band/area, etc. These strategies help in efficient detection,
    but there are certain trade-offs associated with this. For example, one of the
    most famous trade-offs is sensing-throughput trade-off, in which detection probability
    and false alarm probability are taken into account in order to figure out the
    efficiency of the specific CRN [163]. Another famous trade-off for CRN is energy
    efficiency and spectral efficiency trade-off, where different architectures (such
    as cooperative, non-cooperative, etc.), links, analyses, and probabilities are
    considered to figure out efficient balance point among energy and spectral efficiency
    [164]. From the perspective of relevance of these trade-offs with privacy preservation,
    we believe that it is important to highlight that majority of these trade-offs
    can be linked to leakage of privacy in certain aspects. For example, in sensing-throughput
    trade-off, in order to enhance the throughput, sensing time needs to be increased,
    which in turn leads into learning a lot more than required about a specific spectrum/coverage
    area, which directly leads to various privacy leakages. Similarly, in energy related
    trade-offs, selecting a specific architecture or relay model, etc., also require
    learning about a specific area, which leads to leakage of privacy. Therefore,
    it is important to also consider the prospect of privacy preservation while observing
    these trade-offs. In order to protect privacy during these trade-offs, we believe
    that differential privacy can play an active role. For example, the location and
    identity privacy during excessive SS can easily be preserved via Laplacian and
    Exponential perturbation, in which we perturb the values to ensure that individuals
    cannot be re-identified, but on the other hand efficiency and accuracy is also
    taken into consideration in order to enhance throughput. Similarly, differential
    privacy can also perturb the learnt values for a specific architecture in such
    a way that privacy is maintained alongside ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness.
    Differential Privacy in Spectrum Characterization Spectrum characterization is
    the core foundation of the spectrum analysis step during the cognitive cycle.
    In spectrum characterization, all available spectrum bands and channels are collected
    and categorized according to the need [165]. This step ensures that characteristics
    of all available spectrum bands are gathered and grouped in an efficient way to
    get maximum benefits from available spectrum. In order to achieve this, researchers
    are also integrating modern machine/deep learning mechanisms to group these values.
    However, this advancement can also cause privacy leakage during the learning process.
    As it can be seen from experimental evaluations that machine learning algorithms
    can be adversely used to learn about characteristics of participants [166]. Same
    is the case with CRN, that if we integrate machine/deep learning during spectrum
    characterization, then privacy can be leaked in an adversarial manner. In order
    to mitigate this privacy risk, differential privacy can play an active role due
    to its dynamic nature. For instance, one can develop a differentially private
    machine learning model to train and group spectrum bands in an efficient manner.
    This integration of differential privacy ensures that the added noise is pseudorandom,
    and no one can extract private information of participants by just looking into
    it. However, this integration is not as simple as it seems because it involves
    a large number of challenges that needs to be tackled. First of all, one has to
    choose an optimal machine/deep learning model that matches perfectly with the
    nature of dynamic differential privacy and CRN. Afterwards, the second big challenge
    is to figure out parameter training values via which we get both; utility and
    privacy during characterization. Keeping in view this discussion, it can be said
    that differentially private spectrum characterization can provide us a lot of
    benefits, but there are certain challenges that need to be addressed before this
    fruitful integration. Differential Privacy in CRN for Smart Grid System CRN has
    been integrated with smart grid technology for a long time due to its numerous
    benefits such as low communication cost [167]. If one analyses this integration,
    it can be seen that CRN is being used in almost all aspects of smart grid. For
    instance, certain works analysed integration of CRN in home management, while
    other works discussed collection of meter reading, pricing, and power outage values
    via CRN. Similarly, wide area monitoring and power line monitoring is also being
    carried out through CR-based smart grid. A very detailed survey on the integration
    of CR with smart grid has been written by Khan et al. [124]. From these integrations
    it is evident that CR is paving a way for futuristic smart grids. But on the other
    hand, the privacy issues during this integration cannot be ignored. Ranging from
    privacy leakage from real-time energy monitoring to dynamic energy auctions, the
    communication is vulnerable, and it needs to be protected from adversaries. In
    order to do so, differential privacy can play a key role because of its randomization
    mechanisms. Similar to this, differential privacy has been applied with smart
    grid scenarios since long, such as differentially private smart metering [126].
    But the works integrating differential privacy with CRN-based smart grid are not
    yet covered. Therefore, there is a need to carry out this integration of differential
    privacy with CRN-based smart grid in order to get maximum possible benefits from
    these advancing technologies. Nevertheless, this integration is pretty beneficial,
    but this will raise certain challenges as well, the most important among them
    will be maintaining the balance between utility and privacy in the protected data.
    The values reported by smart grid systems involve decisions related to energy;
    therefore, it is important to take special care of data utility because even a
    very small mistake can lead to catastrophic events. Therefore, the researchers
    who are intended to work in differentially private CRN-based smart grids have
    to deal with the challenge of finding optimal privacy budget, sensitivity, and
    other parametric values for differential privacy mechanisms. Integrating Differential
    Privacy in Federated Learning with CRN Federated learning is also a novel paradigm
    which is being used to carry out decentralized learning at users’ end without
    collecting data from them [168]. Federated learning is being applied to various
    scenarios of cognitive cycle [169]. This concept of federated learning is providing
    the advantage of decentralized learning in CRN, and now FCs can learn about the
    characteristics and availability of spectrum without collecting sensitive information
    from CR nodes. This enhances the security and privacy of the whole CRN because
    minimal data is being collected at a centralized server. Research works have shown
    that this integration can also cause privacy leakage, and even in some worst case
    scenarios adversarial federated learning models can be used by adversaries to
    learn private information from users [170, 171]. In order to overcome this risk,
    the integration of differential privacy with federated learning models can play
    a key role. For instance, certain works have been developed which have integrated
    differential privacy with federated learning at the time of model design, and
    learning. Similarly, a differentially private federated learning model can be
    designed for the learning environment of CRN, or differential privacy can be integrated
    with learning outcomes during the run-time. Both of these scenarios can be considered
    to preserve the privacy of CRN. Although both of these scenarios can be pretty
    beneficial to preserve privacy, one also has to overcome certain challenges while
    considering these scenarios. The most important challenge is to figure out the
    best type of federated learning model. For instance, two most prominent models
    for federated learning are horizontal federated learning and federated transfer
    learning. Both of these models have their pros and cons, e.g. if the datasets
    being used in federated learning share the same feature then horizontal federated
    learning is the optimal way. Contrarily, if there are not many overlapping features
    among data, then federated transfer learning needs to be used. Thus, in differentially
    private CRN, for some scenarios, such as SS, horizontal federated learning could
    be more suitable, because the shared features are the same, but in some cases
    this approach might not be feasible. For example, in case of spectrum hand-off,
    the responses after spectrum mobility can comprise multiple disjoint features.
    So, in such cases federated transfer learning could be more suitable. Therefore,
    finding optimal differentially private federated learning models is the key challenge
    that needs to be resolved before this integration. Conclusion Spectrum is a non-renewable
    resource. It is therefore important to use this precious resource in an efficient
    manner. In order to carry out efficient utilization of spectrum, scientists developed
    the notion of CR, which works over the principle of spectrum access at vacant
    times. CR nodes have the ability to sense the loopholes in the spectrum and then
    use these loopholes to carry out communication. In this way, CR nodes can play
    a vital role in overcoming spectrum scarcity. Nevertheless, CRN has a large number
    of benefits, they are not immune to all threats and one of the most critical ones
    is the privacy leakage, which causes serious consequences if not handled properly.
    Certain research works have highlighted the use of various privacy preservation
    approaches to protect privacy of CRN, and differential privacy is one of them.
    Differential privacy can play an important role in the design and development
    of modern, private, and more secure CRN of the future. In this paper, we carried
    out a comprehensive survey targeting the integration of differential privacy in
    CRN from various aspects. Firstly, we highlight the importance of privacy preservation
    in CRN, by discussing the functioning of differential privacy. We then provide
    an in-depth discussion about the sources of privacy leakage in CRN. Next we provide
    insights into how differential privacy can play a critical role in protecting
    this leakage. We then present an analysis of certain parameters that should be
    taken into account while developing differential privacy-based CRN protocols.
    Then, an in-depth analysis of technical works integrating differential privacy
    in various scenarios of CRN. Finally, we provide analysis about prospective future
    directions alongside highlighting certain challenges that researchers may face.

    Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: The spectrum sensing problem has gained new
    aspects with cognitive radio and opportunistic spectrum access concepts. It is
    one of the most challenging issues in cognitive radio systems. In this paper,
    a survey of spectrum sensing methodologies for cognitive radio is presented. Various
    aspects of spectrum sensing problem are studied from a cognitive radio perspective
    and multi-dimensional spectrum sensing concept is introduced. Challenges associated
    with spectrum sensing are given and enabling spectrum sensing methods are reviewed.
    The paper explains the cooperative sensing concept and its various forms. External
    sensing algorithms and other alternative sensing methods are discussed. Furthermore,
    statistical modeling of network traffic and utilization of these models for prediction
    of primary user behavior is studied. Finally, sensing features of some current
    wireless standards are given. Published in: IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials

    I. Introduction The Need for higher data rates is increasing as a result of the
    transition from voice-only communications to multimedia type applications. Given
    the limitations of the natural frequency spectrum, it becomes obvious that the
    current static frequency allocation schemes can not accommodate the requirements
    of an increasing number of higher data rate devices. As a result, innovative techniques
    that can offer new ways of exploiting the available spectrum are needed. Cognitive
    radio arises to be a tempting solution to the spectral congestion problem by introducing
    opportunistic usage of the frequency bands that are not heavily occupied by licensed
    users [1], [2]. While there is no agreement on the formal definition of cognitive
    radio as of now, the concept has evolved recently to include various meanings
    in several contexts [3]. In this paper, we use the definition adopted by Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC): “Cognitive radio: A radio or system that senses
    its operational electromagnetic environment and can dynamically and autonomously
    adjust its radio operating parameters to modify system operation, such as maximize
    throughput, mitigate interference, facilitate interoperability, access secondary
    markets.” [2]. Hence, one main aspect of cognitive radio is related to autonomously
    exploiting locally unused spectrum to provide new paths to spectrum access. Sign

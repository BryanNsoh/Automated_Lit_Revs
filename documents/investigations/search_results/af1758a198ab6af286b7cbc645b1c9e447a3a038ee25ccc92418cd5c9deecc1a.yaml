    1. Introduction As the world’s population increases, there is a need to increase
    food production, which poses a challenge to society [1]. Increased food production
    must be achieved through sustainable management of the entire production system
    [2]. Agricultural intensification is necessary due to limited production areas.
    To achieve this, new technologies and management practices must be introduced
    in agriculture to reduce the side effects of increased use of fertilizers, pesticides,
    and other inputs. Advances in data collection and processing technologies have
    been successfully used around the world to support decision-making in various
    agricultural processes. These advancements include harvest sensors, which are
    capable of estimating grain yields before harvest [3,4,5], weed occurrence, weed
    nutritional status [6], plants [7], top-dressing nitrogen [8], water stress [9],
    and grain protein content [10,11]. Such applications help improve grain yield,
    quality and input use efficiency as well as reduce nutrient losses and negative
    environmental impacts [12,13]. After harvest, storage capacity must be 20% higher
    than yield to avoid product losses and improve logistics and quality [14]. However,
    in some countries, in addition to poor quality control of grains stored in structures,
    there is also the problem of insufficient storage capacity, especially in terms
    of crucial factors such as grain moisture content and the temperature and relative
    humidity of intergranular air, which are necessary for food preservation. Using
    sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, grain quality can be monitored
    and predicted throughout the grain storage period. Therefore, precision agriculture
    tools such as remote sensing can help monitor pre- and post-harvest processes
    by leveraging a range of advanced information, communication, analysis, and data
    processing technologies such as big data analytics, digital platforms, processing
    clouds, and artificial intelligence. These technologies allow for the extraction
    of a wealth of information about data collected during decision-making [15,16].
    2. Review Methodology 2.1. Search Strategy For this review, precise examination
    and evaluation standards were established. The most significant research question
    that directed our review was as follows: How do far-flung sensing, PC vision,
    and their integration contribute to tracking grain properties at the manufacturing
    and post-harvest stages? We evaluated manuscripts addressing advances in far-flung
    sensing and relevant equipment used for tracking the complete grain production
    chain, from the field to the post-harvest process. To this end, we conducted a
    scientific literature search of the “CAPES Journal Portal” as well as the Science
    Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. We selected articles published in
    journals from 2002 to 2023 that provided primary studies associated with the following
    topics: sensors in agriculture; agricultural yield forecasting techniques; equipment
    for far-flung tracking of post-harvest grains; and artificial intelligence in
    agriculture. The database search used a mixture of the following terms: (ALL =
    ((remote sensor OR tracking)) AND production AND post-harvest)). No restrictions
    on language or type of publication were applied at this stage (Figure 1A,B). Figure
    1. Index of publication per year (A) and area (B). 2.2. Eligibility Criteria and
    Selection Process References were selected independently and in parallel by two
    co-authors regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria. Manuscripts that did not meet
    the inclusion criteria were excluded from the posterior analysis. Additionally,
    manuscripts were selected if they met all of the following criteria: a) the abstract
    described a study related to any remote sensing or monitoring (grain, production,
    and post-harvest); b) at least one of the remote sensing or monitoring techniques
    were related to any production or post-harvest stage. After the screening process,
    data were extracted from papers tables or text. 2.3. Studies Evaluation Synthesis
    and Results The selected manuscripts were categorized according to publication
    year, author’s geographic region, and publication journal to provide information
    on the development of research on a particular topic. Furthermore, the remote
    sensing or monitoring technologies featured in each analyzed manuscript were identified
    in conjunction with production management or control of post-harvest grain operations.
    To identify the techniques, technologies, and applications of remote sensing and
    computational technologies in the grain production and post-harvest stages, we
    extracted the data and organized it in a spreadsheet with the following fields:
    spatiotemporal resolutions of satellite sensors (satellite, sensor, temporal resolution,
    precision agriculture application, references); vegetation indices and sensors
    (vegetation indices, equation, types of sensors, applications, references); remote
    sensing techniques used for monitoring grains in the post-harvest stages (sensing
    method, post-harvest stage, references); prediction of results based on easy-to-measure
    parameters, such as soil and weather attributes sensing and monitoring techniques,
    combined with predictive algorithms (applied technique, the objective of the application,
    references). The references were chosen openly and in parallel by two co-authors
    concurring to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Unique duplicates that did not
    meet the consolidation criteria were denied from empower examination. Unique duplicates
    were chosen that met all of the taking after criteria: (a) the hypothetical delineated
    a think approximately related to any more distant identifying or watching (grain,
    era and post-harvest); (b) at smallest one of the more distant recognizing or
    watching methodologies was related to many arrange of era or post-harvest. After
    the screening handle, the data was removed from the tables or works of the articles.
    3. Remote Sensing Applied on the Agriculture 3.1. Remote Sensing Techniques, Applications,
    and Sensors Figure 2 and Table 1 presents a summary of remote sensing techniques
    available, their characteristics, applications, and sensor types. Figure 2. Remote
    sensing techniques, their characteristics, applications, and sensors. Table 1.
    Spatiotemporal resolutions of satellite sensors with high resolution (<30 m) and
    temporal sensors used for precision agriculture. Crop biomass and grain yield
    forecast usually require higher spatial resolution (1–3 m) compared, for example,
    with the application for variable fertilizer and seed rate technology [31]. Besides,
    weed mapping and variable herbicide rate technology require higher spatial resolution
    than identifying only the ridges (for example, 5–50 cm) [32]. Aerial platforms,
    such as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), provide images with a higher spatial
    resolution (<3 m) compared to satellites. Thus, UAVs offer better flexibility
    in providing images with higher spatial and temporal resolution according to the
    target to be sensed. Xie et al. [33] assessed the classification and crop monitoring
    over an agricultural area with corn, soybean, and winter wheat from multi-year
    polarimetric observables from RADARSAT-2 using machine learning. The authors found
    that multitemporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) can estimate
    plant growth with a root mean squared error (RMSE) around 40–50 cm over the cycle.
    Random Forest (RF) approach proved to be more accurate in crop classification.
    Cheng et al. [34], when assessing multispectral information to predict winter
    wheat yield, found contrasts between the multi and hiperspectral approaches. On
    the other hand, the predictions achieved using hyperspectral information was more
    accurate. These findings highlight the potential of the shortwave infrared groups
    to supplant the unmistakable and close infrared groups in yield predictions. 3.2.
    Vegetation Sensors in Agriculture and Applications Figure 3 and Table 2 present
    a summary of the application of crop sensors. Figure 3. Application of vegetation
    sensors in agriculture. Table 2. Vegetation indices and sensors currently used
    in agriculture. The most advantage of red edge vegetation indices is that they
    are less affected by plant canopy structures. Hence, they are more promising for
    the development of models for assessing leaf range record and grain efficiency.
    Eitel et al. [50] found that the use of the red edge improved the ability to estimate
    changes in chlorophyll content (r2 > 0.73, RMSE < 1.69) compared to devices that
    did not use (r2 = 0.57, RMSE = 2.11). Vegetation indices based on the red edge
    such as Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RENDVI), Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDRE), and Red Edge Difference Vegetation Index (REDVI) frequently
    have a better relationship with plant nutrients uptake and biomass production
    under dense canopy conditions than NDVI, such as those present during the advance
    corn growth stages [51]. The measurement of reflectance or emissivity in the near
    and medium infrared bands is particularly useful in the development of indices
    that help to understand intrinsic characteristics of the plant, such as water,
    pigments, sugar, carbohydrates, and protein content. The radiation reflected or
    emitted in thermal infrared bands is related to the temperature of the plant and
    this with the rate of transpiration of the plant. Thus, the indices obtained from
    these thermal reflectance data can be used to understand the level of the plant’s
    water stress and other biotic stresses, such as diseases [52,53]. In this context,
    vegetation indices based on infrared reflectance, and thermal emissions, such
    as crop water stress index (CWSI) and short-wave infrared water stress index (SIWSI)
    are particularly useful. These indices have been successfully used for a broad
    range of objectives in agriculture including plant stress due to excess or water
    deficit, soil moisture, plant diseases, and crop yield forecast [54]. The early
    season assessment of crop yield at regional, State, and National scales is key
    information for agricultural planning and public policy. The applications of this
    information in post-harvest are growing allowing redesign of the whole organization
    strategy for the flow of the production, from the crops to the food processing
    and production industries decreasing loss and keeping the quality. However, the
    crop yield forecast in many countries is based on conventional data collection
    procedures through plot scale or human perception [53,54,55,56]. These techniques
    are often subjective, expensive, time-consuming, and are subject to bias due to
    incomplete or wrong observations, leading to an inaccurate assessment of crop
    yield [57]. The accurate evaluation of the crop performance on large scale has
    been becoming a reality after the progress in remote sensing technology by modern
    satellites and UAV-coupled sensors. The approaches based on remote sensing by
    satellite or UAV provide repeated measurements at different spatial, temporal,
    and spectral scales that allow estimating various canopy parameters, such as vegetation
    cover, leaf area index, and absorbed fraction of photo-synthetically active radiation,
    which can be used in crop yield models [58]. According to Peng et al. [40], the
    remote sensing crop yield forecast is carried out in two ways. The first approach
    uses biophysical parameters of vegetation as a leaf area index (LAI) obtained
    by remote detection and the data is used in specific models to estimate crop yield.
    The second process uses statistical relationships such as regression or empirical
    relationships between parameters and harvest indices derived from remote sensors
    (such as NDVI and NDRE vegetation index), in addition to the harvest yield observed
    in a cultivated area. Maresma et al. [59] presented a regression-based approach
    to assess the relationship between corn yield, biomass, and spectral indices measured
    at corn crop stage V12. Related to other studies, they also found that red NDVI-based
    indices and the wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) had a higher correlation
    with grain yields obtained in a range of fertilizer rate input. Kumar et al. [60]
    correlated the NDVI values of different satellites to estimate the crop yield
    in wheat and found coefficients of determination above 0.90. Rao et al. [61] evaluated
    the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate sugarcane yield
    and reported a strong relationship between yield and NDVI (R = 0.84). Alongside,
    Rahman and Robson, Rahman and Robson [62] reported that the green normalized difference
    vegetation index (GNDVI) derived from the Landsat 30 m resolution had a significant
    correlation (R2 = 0.69) with crop yield. Ali and Imran [62] used the red edge
    extracted from hyperspectral images to predict the leaf area index (R2 = 0.93)
    and the chlorophyll content (R2 = 0.90) to estimate yield (R2 = 0.91) of Kinnow
    tangerines. Reliable estimate of crop yield based on the canopy reflectance throughout
    the different growth stages can be a challenging task, especially during the initial
    stages of crop growth due to the interference of the bare soil surface [63]. To
    overcome this limitation, Zhen et al. [64] used other vegetation indices modified
    to minimize the soil interference in the estimative of leaf area index (LAI) and,
    consequently, crop yield. Recently, vegetation indices based on red-edge have
    shown satisfactory efficiency for estimating the yield of different crops. 3.3.
    Advantages and Disadvantages of the Remote Sensing The advantage of remote sensing
    as a whole, compared to other conventional data collection methodologies, is the
    fast and non-destructive sample collection. For example, it is possible to have
    information on several variables, such as nitrogen content, plant mass, disease
    severity, among others. At the satellite orbital level, the advantages are even
    greater, as it makes it possible to sample large and larger areas with repeatability
    depending on the time span in which the satellite is visited, that is, every so
    often the satellite images the area, enabling a high sampling rate at a lower
    cost and time when compared to traditional sampling in the field, even in conditions
    where there is a need to pay for the satellite. The disadvantages of sampling
    via an orbital satellite sensor are that it is collected when clouds are present
    at certain periods of the year, depending on the region, making sampling and sample
    quality unfeasible. Another disadvantage is obtaining images via free satellites,
    for example Landsat and Sentinel. It is worth noting that the aim is always to
    collect images with the highest spatial resolution, with the greatest possible
    number of pixels, to achieve the desirable detail of the target for analysis.
    This is especially important for smaller areas and objects, such as fruit plots
    or cities. However, it makes no difference for larger areas where target detailing
    is not the main objective. Image collection via drone is an alternative to the
    disadvantages mentioned above, as it is possible to fly below the clouds without
    their interference in image collection. On the other hand, the main disadvantage
    of using a drone is the high initial cost and the need for training to operate
    the drone and process images. Even so, drones make it possible to collect samples
    with the possibility of repeating them daily or on different days. Among the main
    advantages of using vegetation indices are the future diagnosis of elements that
    do not yet have scientific support, for example, a plant attacked by insect pests
    that ends up changing its physiology, which could probably be detected by some
    spectral response, mainly by hyperspectral sensors, being an area still new and
    very little studied. There is still a large scope for development in the application
    of sensors. 4. Using Remote Sensing on the Post-Harvest Grain Monitoring 4.1.
    Post-Harvest Grain Monitoring Although the feasibility of using remote sensing
    techniques in agriculture has been demonstrated since the 1980s, the operational
    use of remote sensing data has recently been intensified and used operationally
    for a variety of agricultural applications [65], among them post-harvest of grains.
    The use of sensors can assist in monitoring quality and reducing losses [66].
    Temperature sensors can be used next to the grains as an indirect indicator of
    the quality of the product during transport, drying, and storage. Obtaining real-time
    information about the conditions of the grains helps in making decisions on the
    post-harvest stages. Table 3 presents studies that used remote sensing techniques
    applied to the monitoring post-harvest grain quality. Table 3. Studies on the
    remote sensing techniques used for monitoring grains in the post-harvest stages.
    4.2. Grain Monitoring in Transport For monitoring grains during transport from
    the field to the storage units and from the storage units to the industry, Danao
    et al. [67] studied the development of a probe to monitor temperature, relative
    humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and logistical information during the transportation
    of soybeans. According to Nunes et al. [84], taking into consideration that grain
    transportation can be carried out over long separations which the grain mass amid
    transportation frequently features a tall dampness substance, there may be dangers
    of warm and dampness exchange, causing the grain mass to warm up and driving to
    quantitative and subjective misfortunes. Nunes et al. [84] approved a method with
    a test framework for real-time observing of temperature, relative stickiness and
    carbon dioxide within the mass of corn grains amid transportation and capacity,
    in arrange to identify early misfortunes of dry matter and anticipate conceivable
    changes within the physical quality of the grains. The hardware comprised of a
    microcontroller, system hardware, advanced sensors for identifying temperature
    and relative mugginess and a non-destructive infrared sensor for measuring CO2
    concentration. Real-time checking frameworks decided changes within the physical
    quality of the grains early and palatably, as affirmed by the physical investigations
    of electrical conductivity and germination. Real-time observing gear and the application
    of Machine Learning were viable in foreseeing dry matter misfortune, due to the
    tall balance dampness substance and breath of the grain mass inside 2 h. All the
    machine learning models, but the back vector machine, gotten palatable comes about,
    in a comparative way to the different straight relapse investigation. Figure 4
    appears an outline of a test for checking these parameters amid grain transportation.
    Figure 4. Illustration of a probe for monitoring temperature, relative humidity,
    carbon dioxide levels, and logistical information during the grain transportation.
    The grain monitoring probe was designed to be placed inside vehicles responsible
    for transporting grain, allowing parameters to be monitored during product movement.
    The probes were constructed with four vertically spaced chambers in the grain
    mass and an optional fifth chamber for the overhead space above the grain mass
    within the loading portion of the transport vehicle. These probes are useful for
    better understanding conditions during soybean transportation, which can lead
    to better management of grain handling and transportation operations to minimize
    soybean quality loss in the post-harvest period [67,82]. In addition to monitoring
    temperature and other parameters during transport, this type of grain mass sensing
    contributes to decision-making in the storage unit. When the product arrives at
    the destination, the operators know in advance its main characteristics, making
    the industrialization processes more efficient. When batches of grain are unloaded
    in the storage units, the grains are submitted to cleaning. For this, Wallays
    et al. [68] used a hyperspectral waveband selection for the online verification
    of grain cleaning. Seeking online monitoring of the percentage of impurities next
    to the grains, these authors developed a multispectral vision sensor able to create
    a virtual image with maximum contrast between the grains and the impurities, allowing
    each pixel to be classified individually. The selected bands were 465–475 nm,
    522–532 nm, 676–705 nm, 849–858 nm, and 906–945 nm, which allowed discriminating
    between clean and impure grains. 4.3. Advantages and Disadvantages of the Grain
    Monitoring in the Transport Thus, it can be stated that monitoring intergranular
    variables, such as temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration in real
    time in the grain mass during transport, especially over long distances, has as
    its main advantage the possibility of monitoring possible changes that occur due
    to the increase in the metabolic activity of the grains and consequently the respiratory
    intensity of the grain mass, avoiding possible losses of dry matter and nutritional
    quality of the grains. Furthermore, monitoring the transport of grains from crops
    to storage units or from units to industry helps to segregate batches and their
    destinations in the following processes for better grain conservation, consequently
    increasing the value of the product. Often the qualitative changes that occur
    in the later stages of post-harvest are due to errors and lack of control that
    occurred in the previous stages. Thus, monitoring grain mass contributes to the
    batch traceability process, consequently bringing greater control over post-harvest
    grain losses. Disadvantages include the initial costs of equipment and sensors,
    as well as training and operational adaptations for installing and handling monitoring
    technologies. 4.4. Grain Monitoring during Drying The cleaned grains are then
    taken to the drying stage. This step also requires constant monitoring. Figure
    5 illustrates a system for monitoring the grains during drying. Lewis et al. [69]
    developed a grain drying system with monitoring of the moisture content reduction
    using a microwave sensor operating at 5.8 GHz. Lewis et al. [69] reported that
    it was possible to determine the moisture content in real-time and with a calibration
    standard error lower than 0.54% when compared to the reference method conducted
    in the oven. In the same way, Li et al. [70] developed an online device for measuring
    the moisture content of the grains during the drying process. The sensor developed
    by Li et al. [69] determines the moisture content of a single grain at a time,
    through the application of a direct current. The generated electrical circuit
    measures the electrical resistance of the grain, which employing mathematical
    equations designed for each species allows reaching the moisture content of the
    product. The results presented by Li et al. [85] showed that the device has an
    excellent performance in grains with varied moisture content (10–35% w.b) and
    temperature (−20–50 ºC), with an absolute measurement error within 0.5%. The data
    obtained with the device are adequate to characterize the uniformity of the drying
    process of the grains. The drying monitoring sensor based on the electrical resistance
    of the grains improves the accuracy and reliability of the measurement and can
    be useful in other intelligent equipment for drying the grains. Figure 5. Illustration
    of a grain monitoring system during drying. Liu et al. [71] developed an online
    detector of the moisture content of the grains during the drying process that
    acts based on the voltage-frequency conversion. The sensor also consists of detecting
    the electrical resistance values of the grain, which is based on the voltage-frequency
    conversion, followed by moisture content and frequency conversion, and the non-linear
    correction as a function of temperature. The operating mechanism of this detector
    is remarkably like that described by Li et al. [85] and presented satisfactory
    results for application in monitoring grain drying. The industry needs good precision
    when reducing the moisture content in the drying process. Grains with high moisture
    content tend to deteriorate more quickly during storage, while excessively dried
    grains result in lower economic yield due to the reduction in total mass. 4.5.
    Advantages and Disadvantages of Monitoring Grains during Drying Thus, monitoring
    the temperature and relative humidity of the dryer’s inlet air, drying and exhaust
    air in real time, allow for the evaluation of the dryers’ performance, for better
    drying efficiency with lower energy costs. Meanwhile, monitoring grain mass is
    a response to drying for the effects of moisture removal. Drying at high temperatures
    has the advantage of high drying speed and flow of batches of grains. On the other
    hand, it causes greater stress to the grains due to the high temperature, which
    can cause physical damage and consequently nutritional changes. Therefore, real-time
    monitoring of the of grain mass temperature can be a parameter for determining
    the intensity of drying in the stages of water removal from the grains. For drying
    at low temperatures, the monitoring of temperature and relative humidity variables
    is associated with the equilibrium moisture conditions of the grains. In this
    case, drying occurs in fixed layers from bottom to top inside the dryers, with
    a drying front in the grain mass, which at the same time remains stored in the
    same space. In this system, the drying air will need to be sufficiently heated
    at ambient conditions and dehydrated to remove moisture from the grains through
    the hygroscopic process (difference in vapor pressure between the grain and the
    drying air) and at the same time, the moisture from the grains at the end of the
    drying process must stabilize within a safe range for storage (between 12 and
    14% w.b.), depending on the region. Real-time monitoring will provide greater
    control of the process and grain quality. The disadvantages are the costs of dryer
    instrumentation and the need for more qualified personnel to handle the equipment,
    as well as sensitivity and knowledge about the differences between the types of
    grains during drying. 4.6. Grain Monitoring in the Storage As most grains are
    delivered at given times of the year and are still required by businesses all
    through the year, an expansive portion of the dried grains are put away. Figure
    6 shows a framework for observing grain amid capacity and its advance over a long
    time. To protect put away grain, it is fundamental to keep the mass with a secure
    water substance of between 11 and 14% and an intergranular temperature underneath
    22 °C (depending on the locale). This requires that air circulation and thermometry
    are working appropriately, checking the conditions of the discuss entering the
    capacity storehouse and the intergranular discuss. As well as observing the temperature,
    measuring the intergranular relative stickiness is vital for deciding the harmony
    dampness substance of the put away item and foreseeing respiratory issues. Given
    that grains are great warm insulin which the temperature of the grain mass is
    measured by sensors interior the silos, the thermometry framework frequently falls
    flat to distinguish item warming problems. Therefore, observing the whole CO2
    concentration interior the capacity storehouse could be a great pointer of item
    breath and air circulation control. At levels above 600 ppm CO2, there is a chance
    of the item disintegrating. The combination of these factors indirectly characterizes
    the quality of the grain and makes it possible to anticipate conceivable dangers
    of the item weakening (Figure 6). Figure 6. Illustration of a grain monitoring
    system during storage. The warming of put away grain favors the advancement of
    creepy crawly bothers. Agreeing to Badgujar et al. [86] the checking of creepy
    crawly bothers in put away items could be a common hone for the post-harvest administration
    of put away cereals and cereal-based items, which makes a difference to ensure
    the quality of the item from gather to the conclusion customer. Be that as it
    may, current inspecting and observing strategies can be time-consuming, labor-intensive,
    costly and require encounter in recognizing creepy crawlies. Hence, Badgujar et
    al. [86] created a computerized image-based distinguishing proof framework for
    common creepy crawly species put away on create utilizing profound learning strategies.
    Top-down pictures of common grown-up creepy crawly species of Rhyzopertha dominica,
    Cryptolestes ferrugineus, Tribolium castaneum, Sitophilus oryzae and Oryzaephilus
    surinamensis were obtained and analyzed. State-of-the-art convolutional neural
    organize (CNN) models based on profound learning (ResNet-50, MobileNet-v2, DarkNet-53
    and EfficientNet-b0) were prepared with an exchange learning approach to classify
    the creepy crawly species. All the models were able to accurately recognize the
    creepy crawly species with at slightest 96% precision and with few classification
    mistakes. One issue with prepared CNNs was that they didn’t clarify the thinking
    behind the classification and were alluded to as “dark boxes”. Subsequently, visualization
    strategies called Gradient-weighted Course Actuation Mapping (Grad-CAM) were executed
    to misuse the dark box network. Grad-CAM employments warm maps to highlight the
    most image highlights on which the organize has centered in order to create creepy
    crawly species expectations. Grad-CAM confirms the network’s expectation conjointly
    makes a difference to make strides the network’s execution. This think about contributed
    to the in general objective of creating a camera-based framework to screen creepy
    crawlies in put away grain. The framework created would engage distribution centers
    and other food offices as an apparatus to rapidly and precisely recognize creepy
    crawly species in put away item situations and may well be actualized as part
    of a real-time checking framework. Neethirajan et al. [72] created a CO2 sensor
    to remotely screen the quality of stored grain. The sensor was created employing
    a conductive polyaniline boronic acid polymer as the electrically conductive region
    of the sensor. The created sensor measured CO2 levels within the 380–2400 ppm,
    recognized at diverse temperatures (between 25 and 55 °C), which needs water from
    the air to operate, permitting CO2 to be recognized between 20 and 70% relative
    stickiness. Amid grain capacity, variables such as temperature and relative stickiness,
    grain dampness substance, CO2 and creepy crawly concentration must be observed
    and controlled, continuously looking for the leading conditions for grain preservation.
    Respiration rate over the time was analyzed by Ubhi and Sadaka [73] using CO2
    concentration sensors. The authors reported that the farther detecting method
    employing a weight sensor was found to be solid and touchy for measuring the respiration
    rate of grains within the parameters tried. As of late, Onibonoje et al. [74]
    considered a remote sensor organize framework to screen natural components (temperature,
    relative humidity and light) that influence grain capacity. The sensors were conveyed
    in settled areas flawlessly disseminated in a grain capacity storehouse. Onibonoje
    et al. [74] detailed that the remote sensor organize framework created makes a
    difference to guarantee nourishment security. As said prior, programmed capacity
    procedures are broadly utilized in capacity units to distinguish grain weakening
    by checking the temperature and relative stickiness of the discuss, the dampness
    substance of the grain and the CO2 concentration. Depending on the measure of
    the storehouse, one or more cables containing an arrangement of sensors are hung
    vertically. On each cable, the sensors are as a rule 1.2 m separated. The number
    of cables in a storehouse depends on variables such as the estimate of the storehouse
    (primarily its breadth), the climatic conditions of the locale and the species
    of grain to be put away. One of the most points of interest of this framework
    is the real-time observing of capacity parameters [80,86]. The commonplace dividing
    between sensors (1.2 m) within the cable comes about in moo spatial determination.
    Asefi et al. [80] evaluated a recent substitute for this monitoring technique
    [80]. These authors used electromagnetic imaging to monitor grain kept in silos.
    Global sensitivity, the utilization of inexpensive electromagnetic radiation,
    the capacity to produce images with high spatial resolution and without disturbing
    or interacting with grain are just a few benefits of using electromagnetic images
    [80]. Similar to this, but on a larger scale, Asefi et al. [80] and Gilmore et
    al. [81] also investigated the monitoring of grain storage conditions. Gilmore
    et al. [81] reported that the electromagnetic imaging system demonstrated the
    ability to identify a 25% moisture-containing deteriorating region in the grain
    mass in addition to a 15% moisture-containing grain mass. Therefore, it is economically
    feasible to monitor stored grain using systems based on electromagnetic imaging
    [81]. The temperature rise in the grain mass caused by insects near the grain
    can also be detected using this sensing technique. Using photos, this technology
    can keep an eye on even the smallest changes to the storage environment [82].
    An inexpensive, low-power single board computer called the Jetson Nano, a manual
    focus camera, and a trained deep learning model made up the fundamental insect
    detection system created by Mendoza et al. [87]. Using a real-time visual feed,
    the model was validated. The authors claim that effective insect control depends
    on the timely detection, classification, and monitoring of insect pests in grain
    warehouses and food facilities. The insect’s image is taken by the camera and
    sent to a Jetson Nano for processing. A deep learning model that has been trained
    to identify the types and abundance of insects is used by the Jetson Nano. The
    detection results are shown on a monitor under three different lighting conditions:
    white LED light, yellow LED light, and no lighting condition. The system was tested
    with various stored grain insect pests and was able to detect and classify adult
    warehouse insects with an acceptable level of accuracy by comparing accuracy based
    on light sources and F1 scores. The outcomes show that the system is an automated
    insect detection solution that is both efficient and reasonably priced. Gilmore
    et al. [81] demonstrated a breakthrough in the application of electromagnetic
    imaging technology. A three-dimensional electromagnetic imaging system for measuring
    grain moisture content during storage was developed by these authors. Data from
    the three-point sensors built into the compartment was compared with the outcomes
    of the 3D image. The electromagnetic imaging system can track the loss of moisture
    during drying and storage, according to Gilmore et al. [83]. They also mentioned
    that the method could indicate when the grains had reached safe storage temperatures.
    External factors such as the presence of insects, in addition to climate factors,
    such as temperature and relative humidity, and intrinsic grain characteristics
    such as moisture content and respiration rate, can lower grain quality standards
    [88,89]. In order to prevent, control, and monitor the presence of insects near
    grain, it is necessary. Consequently, a small gadget was developed by Reimer et
    al. [90] to track insect activity in grain samples. The sensor’s foundation is
    an active microwave cavity, as the authors have shown. Since the presence of insects
    is a drawback for industries looking for optimal grain storage conditions, the
    sensor created by Reimer et al. [90] may be used to track the population density
    of insects in stored grain. The presence of insects must be detected using these
    sensors. Fumigation, or the process of applying phosphine to the grain, is one
    of the primary methods used for this. Upon observing the use of this method, Brabec
    et al. [78] assessed wireless phosphine sensors to track the gas used to fumigate
    grain that was kept in storage. The automated fumigation data, according to the
    authors, gave a thorough picture of the procedure. Those in charge of fumigation
    can use this information to more effectively assess the process and guarantee
    effective insect control. Wireless phosphine sensors, according to Brabec et al.
    [78], offer a practical way to keep an eye on fumigation treatments, giving more
    information on variations in phosphine concentration during treatments. Internet-based
    systems facilitate easy access to data for both active fumigation and treatment
    outcome summaries [78]. As a result, sensor-assisted hermetic vacuum storage has
    become a viable substitute for traditional methods [79]. Kumar et al. [79] used
    hermetic storage, eliminating the oxygen in the storage cell and detecting the
    grains using temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and CO2 sensors in place
    of chemical agents to control insects in stored grains. According to Kumar et
    al. [79], the CO2 sensor can show whether the grains are free of insects. Thus,
    to indicate the quality of grain stored in an airtight system, a decision support
    system based on multiple sensors—such as temperature and relative humidity—in
    addition to the CO2 sensor can be helpful. Furthermore, the authors noted that
    the management of phosphine fumigation may benefit from hermetic storage if the
    aforementioned factors are detected. 4.7. Advantages and Disadvantages of Grain
    Monitoring in Storage Storage is considered the last stage within the post-harvest
    processes, and its main objective is to preserve the grain mass for as long as
    possible, up to a year, for example. At this stage, losses occur due to storage
    conditions, but also due to the effects that the grains suffered in previous stages.
    Thus, at this stage it is very important to maintain the grains with favorable
    intergranular temperature and relative humidity conditions to reduce metabolic
    activity and respiration of the grain mass. Therefore, monitoring the ambient
    and intergranular air automatically is a great advantage for applying the aeration
    operation to the grain mass, mainly to prevent the stored product from breathing.
    Traditionally, grains stored in silos are monitored by measuring temperature (thermometry)
    through thermocouple sensors installed equidistant (for example, 3 in 3 m) in
    the grain mass and more recently by digital sensors. Although measuring the intergranular
    temperature is an acceptable method for evaluating the heating and consequently
    the indirect deterioration of the grains, it is not very efficient, because the
    sensor installed in the grain mass makes the punctual measurement of the temperature,
    i.e., The changes that occur between the sensors are not easily detectable, especially
    since the grains are good thermal insulators, and it may be too late to control
    deterioration. Recently, there have been some advances with the addition of monitoring
    intergranular relative humidity together with temperature, bringing the advantage
    of enabling the real-time determination of the hygroscopic equilibrium humidity
    of the grains, through mathematical models. With this, it is possible to predict
    the appropriate air conditions to carry out aeration or cooling of the grain mass
    without increasing changes in the safe storage water content, avoiding both quantitative
    and qualitative losses. Currently, research has been evolving towards real-time
    monitoring and measurement of CO2 in stored grain mass. Determining the concentration
    of CO2 inside the silo makes it possible to measure the real intensity of the
    total respiration of the grain mass, unlike measuring the temperature. Scientifically
    proven, in the atmosphere under normal conditions we have a concentration of approximately
    420 ppm of CO2. Inside the silo, an acceptable atmosphere of up to 600 ppm of
    CO2 is considered, without changes to the product’s respiration. Between 600 and
    1000 ppm initial conditions for grain deterioration. Above 1000 ppm alert conditions
    and above 5000 ppm the product is already highly deteriorated. In this context,
    the great advantage is that monitoring intergranular temperature and relative
    humidity will determine the hygroscopic equilibrium humidity of the air with the
    stored grains to verify whether aeration is being carried out well, without changing
    the water content of the grain mass. However, the CO2 measurement will guide whether
    or not to activate aeration. 5. Artificial Intelligence Applied on the Grain Production
    Table 4 presents studies on the prediction of results based on easy-to-measure
    parameters using agricultural sensing and monitoring techniques combined with
    predictive algorithms. Tan et al. [91] evaluated the prediction of the protein
    content in wheat grains using satellite images and partial least-square algorithm.
    Tan et al. [91] reported that the NDVI, SIPI, PSRI, and EVI parameters were sensitive
    to predicting the protein content of the grains based on the partial least square
    algorithm and broadband sensor images (HJ-CCD). Also, the authors reported that
    the prediction accuracy was over 90%.A forecast of corn grain yield and nitrogen
    (N) loss in the soil was studied by Shahhosseini et al. [92], through learning
    algorithms. These authors evaluated the potential of four machine learning algorithms
    (LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, random forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting,
    and their ensembles) as meta-models for a cultivation systems simulator to inform
    the development of decision support tools projected with the information available
    at the time of planting. The simulated data set included more than three million
    data, including genotype, environment, and management scenarios. The XGBoost was
    the most accurate model for forecasting corn yields and the random forests predicted
    the loss of N at the time of planting with higher precision. Table 4. Studies
    on prediction of results based on easy-to-measure parameters using agricultural
    sensing and monitoring techniques combined with predictive algorithms. Silva et
    al. [93] identified which vegetation indices can be used to predict soybean grain
    yield using UAV and remote multispectral sensors. The processing of the vegetation
    index models was conducted based on the image reflectance factor data performed
    in the field. A decision tree algorithm was generated considering soybean grain
    yield as a dependent variable. Silva et al. [93] reported that the SAVI and NDVI
    indices stood out for their productivity forecast, where the regions with the
    highest values of these indices can indicate the highest yield observed in the
    field, providing an advantage in management at the property level. The prediction
    of wheat yield based on data from multiple sources and machine learning was studied
    by Han et al. [94]. The authors developed a modeling framework to integrate climate
    data, remote sensing data, and soil data to predict wheat production based on
    the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The findings revelead that the models
    can accurately predict grain yield up to 1 to 2 months before harvest dates, with
    an error lower than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression
    (GPR), and random forests (RF) represent the three best methods for predicting
    yields among the eight typical machine learning models evaluated in this study
    [94]. Wan et al. [95] presented a method of forecasting the yield of rice grains
    using UAV-based multi-temporal RGB and multispectral images and model transfer.
    A UAV platform with RGB and multispectral cameras was used to collect high spatial
    resolution images of the rice crop under different nitrogen treatments over two
    years. The vegetation indices, canopy height, and canopy cover were extracted
    from UAV-based images, which were then used to develop random forest forecasting
    models for grain production. Wan et al. [95] reported that the normalized difference
    yellowing index (NDYI) was the most useful index for monitoring changes in the
    leaf’s chlorophyll content, as well as the leaf’s green throughout the growth
    period. The vegetation indices provided a comparable forecast of grain yield to
    above-ground biomass measured in the field and to the chlorophyll content in the
    leaves. The fusion of the multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI), NDYI, canopy height, and canopy cover achieved the best grain yield prediction
    with a relative mean square error between 2.75 and 3.56%. Also, the authors reported
    that the initial growth stage of the plant is ideal for predicting grain yield.
    Zhang et al. [96] also studied the initial stages of plant growth intermediates.
    These authors studied the forecast of rice grain yield based on the dynamic changes
    in vegetation indices. Spectral reflectance data were collected several times
    during the initial stages of growth intermediates using a mounted active sensor.
    Data were then used to calculate the ideal vegetation indices (normalized difference
    red edge index, NDRE; normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI; ratio vegetation
    index, RVI; red edge ratio vegetation index, RERVI), which were used to develop
    a dynamic change model and a grain yield forecasting model at the station. Zhang
    et al. [96] reported that the NDRE index was more stable than other indexes (NDVI,
    RVI, RERVI), with a lower standard deviation. Besides, this index was used to
    create a high-precision model. The grain yield prediction is the main response
    to the farmer at the field level. However, prediction models are also used and
    applied in the post-harvest stages. Li and Mao [85] evaluated a method for predicting
    grain loss based on the integration of several models. Losses can occur at different
    stages, such as harvest time, degree of pests, mode of harvest, degree of mold
    in the harvest, mode of drying, mode of transport, technical level, whether to
    plant crops in the next season, threshing mode, level of education, economic income,
    the climate in the harvest, quality of the equipment, the abundance of human resources,
    awareness of grain savings, way of packaging, the situation of the land, way of
    cleaning grains, time of planting, operating attitude, the average distance between
    harvest and drying area, the average distance between drying area and storage
    area, harvest maturity, and intercropping with other crops. Li and Mao [85] studied
    the k-nearest neighbor’s algorithm (kNN), soft max regression, decision tree,
    and XG Boost algorithms models. The method of transport in the field had the greatest
    impact on loss, followed by the degree of pests and the mode of harvest. Therefore,
    transportation, pest control, and changing harvesting methods must be improved
    to reduce grain loss in the early post-harvest stages [85]. The correct time to
    harvest is a crucial factor to avoid the loss of grains still in the field. Thus,
    Martinez-Feria et al. [99] studied corn and soybean drying in the field using
    predictive algorithms and genotype and environment analysis. The algorithms used
    were guided by changes in the moisture content of grain balance (function of relative
    humidity and air temperature) and require three input parameters: moisture content
    at physiological maturity, a drying coefficient, and a power constant. Martinez-Feria
    et al. [99] reported that the evaluation of the variance components and treatment
    effects revealed that genotypes, climatic years, and planting dates had little
    influence on the post-maturation drying coefficient, but significantly influenced
    the moisture content of the grains in the physiological maturity. Thus, the precise
    implementation of the algorithms in all environments would require estimating
    the moisture content of the initial grain, through modeling approaches or field
    measurements. 6. Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence Applied
    on the Grain Post-Harvest Still regarding grain conservation during the post-harvest
    stages, the Internet of Things (IoT) can help improve methods for monitoring and
    traceability of food products. Kodali et al. [75] described a system that consists
    of a microcontroller and several sensors that can collect information such as
    temperature, humidity, CO2, and food quality and send that information to the
    operator in charge while responding appropriately to ensure that products are
    kept in optimal storage conditions. The monitoring device also moderates the temperature
    levels and moisture content of the beans using fans and cooling units controlled
    by the IoT system. Any mold and/or insect infestation, for example, is notified
    to the manager so that arrangements can be made [75]. Sindwani et al. [76] also
    indicated the use of a real-time monitoring system based on the IoT system, observing
    storage parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration.
    These authors used a hardware device that contains two sensors and a battery for
    the power supply. The sensors are utilized to detect the parameters of temperature,
    relative humidity, and CO2. The online portal was created to analyze and collect
    data in real-time from the sensors. This portal can be easily integrated with
    the digital portal already present in most storage units. Besides, Parvin et al.
    [77] studied an intelligent system based on a sensor optimized for the efficient
    monitoring of stored grains. These authors used a cyber-physical system (CPSs),
    which is like the Internet of Things (IoT) but provides intelligent mechanisms
    with greater coordination and control between physical communication and computational
    elements. A typical CPS application would be to monitor a particular aspect using
    many wireless sensor networks and communicate the processed information to a central
    node. According to Parvin et al. [77], the monitoring function can be performed
    through continuous detection of various parameters, such as temperature and humidity
    of the interstitial air within the grain storage environment by a wireless sensor
    network and by the efficient collection, processing, and display of data. Once
    the data is collected, the management and control unit are used to predict the
    distribution of the temperature and moisture content of the grains, as well as
    the temperature and humidity of the interstitial air in storage. This will help
    to effectively reduce the temperature and moisture content of the beans to ensure
    their quality. When the temperature and relative humidity in the storage compartment
    are higher than the predefined limit values, the coordinating sensor node sends
    the command to the control sensor node via the serial port. The control node then
    performs the necessary actions, such as turning on the cooling or aeration fan
    to reduce the temperature and relative humidity and thus maintain the quality
    and safety of the stored grains [77]. In a full-scale silo, Duan et al. [104]
    assessed temperature sensors to measure grain mass temperature data over a 423-day
    period in addition to meteorological data. The study used machine learning algorithms,
    support vector regression (SVR) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) to evaluate meteorological
    data and predict the average grain mass temperature. The SVR model would use different
    kernel functions, and the AdaBoost model would select the right base estimator
    and number of estimators. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to examine
    the relationship between a sizable body of historical grain mass temperature data
    and the corresponding weather forecast data. Strong correlations between a few
    meteorological factors were discovered. Principal component analysis (PCA) was
    used to reduce the dimensionality of the data in order to remove unnecessary information.
    The forecast models were then compared both before and after PCA dimensionality
    reduction. The outcomes demonstrated that the suggested strategies are capable
    of achieving high accuracy, with the Adboost method achieving the best performance
    following PCA dimensionality reduction. An adaptive neighborhood clustering algorithm
    (ANCA)-based three-dimensional (3D) temperature visualization technique was assessed
    by Li et al. [105]. There are four calculation modules in the ANCA-based visualization
    method. In order to model the temperature field, discrete grain temperature data
    from sensors is first gathered and interpolated using backpropagation (BP) neural
    networks. After that, a fresh ANCA is used to combine spatiotemporal information
    and categorize the interpolation data. Next, the boundary points of each cluster
    are determined using the Quickhull algorithm. Ultimately, the polyhedra ascertained
    from the boundary points are constructed into a three-dimensional model of the
    grain mass temperature and rendered in various colors. According to the experimental
    results, ANCA performs significantly better in terms of compactness (about 95.7%
    of the cases tested) and separation (about 91.3% of the cases tested) than the
    DBSCAN and MeanShift algorithms. Furthermore, the temperature visualization method
    in the grain mass using the ANCA-based approach exhibits improved visual effects
    and reduced rendering times. In order to help grain warehouse managers maintain
    grain quality during storage, this research developed an effective 3D visualization
    technique that enabled them to get real-time information about the field temperature
    of bulk grain. In order to address these issues, this study suggested a multi-output
    spatiotemporal model that combines Transformer and Graph Convolution Neural Networks
    (GCN). GCN records the topological data of the sensor network in the silo as well
    as the spatial correlations between the sensors. Transformer describes temporal
    dependencies and records both short- and long-term temporal resources. The suggested
    model was constructed using a dataset and its performance was assessed and contrasted
    with that of the four other models. The suggested model performs better than the
    others in terms of MAE and RMSE, according to the findings. Furthermore, a three-dimensional
    interpolation based on the forecast results allowed for a continuous temperature
    field of the entire silo, making the temperature conditions accessible at all
    locations, as well as the discrete areas detected [106]. Evaluation of the primary
    factors leading to the control of insects in stored grain was conducted by Abdelsamea
    et al. [107]. In order to assess the significance of the parameters and predict
    how well the solution would work to heat insect pests to death, several machine
    learning models were used. Through 10-fold cross-validation, the effectiveness
    of the machine learning models was confirmed. Random Forest model achieved an
    F1 score of 99.5%, recall of 99.01%, precision of 100%, and accuracy of 99.5%.
    The optimal environmental factors and parameters that significantly impact rice
    weevil disinfestation were found by a machine learning approach using SHAP values
    as an explainable post-hoc model. A flexible model for determining the optimal
    lethal temperature to eradicate insects from grains kept in clear plastic bags
    was identified by machine learning. The model can predict whether specific set
    of parameters will work well for using thermal control to treat insects. Sitophilus
    oryzae and Sitophilus zeamais are the two primary insect pests that infest stored
    grain globally, according to Yang et al. [108]. Because of their similar appearances,
    it can be difficult to identify the two pests quickly and accurately. In visible
    light, adult S. zeamais are both brighter and darker than adult S. oryzae. The
    high efficiency of the convolutional neural network (CNN) in object recognition
    makes it suitable for effective differentiation. A multilayer convolutional structure
    (MCS) feature extractor was suggested by the authors to extract insect features
    from each layer of the CNN architecture. In the context of wheat, a regional proposal
    network is used to pinpoint the location of a possible pest. Combining softmax
    and soft L1 loss functions, as well as adding deeper layer variables to the classification
    and bounding box regression subnetworks, increases both the robustness of bounding
    box regression and the accuracy of classification. With an average detection speed
    of 0.182 ± 0.005 s per test, the proposed multilayer convolutional structure network
    (MCSNet) achieves an average accuracy of 87.89 ± 2.36% in laboratory test. After
    field testing, the accuracy of the model was determined to be 90.35 ± 3.12%. S.
    oryzae had an average accuracy higher than S. zeamais under all test conditions.
    In tests performed in the lab and field, the proposed MCSNet model proved to be
    a quick and precise technique for identifying sibling groups from visible light
    images. The stages of grain drying and storage also involve predictive outcomes
    (Table 4). Li and Chen [97] investigated a predictive control scheme based on
    a neural network for grain dryers in an effort to increase the precision of the
    moisture content of grains discharged from grain dryers as well as the level of
    automation and intelligence in the grain drying process. For a real grain dryer
    system, a mathematical model based on the theory of grain drying is constructed.
    This model allows for the quick simulation of an adequate number of input and
    output time series of the grain dryer under various conditions. Instead of using
    the mathematical model as a predictive model, a non-linear autoregressive neural
    network is trained using the data series as a training set. Instantaneous input-output
    feedback is introduced by a nonlinear neural network autoregressive model with
    exogenous input (NARX), which is based on the static neural network, in a study
    by Li and Chen [100]. The dynamic input-output characteristic of the grain dryer
    is suggested to be represented instead of the mathematical model based on equations.
    A model predictive control (MPC) controller with a particle swarm optimization
    (PSO) algorithm was created to achieve accurate closed-loop control using this
    NARX neural network as the predictive model. Li and Chen [100] tested sufficient
    simulations under various conditions to the PSO-MPC control scheme’s performance
    and found that the error in grain moisture content is less than 1% (w.b). Using
    a machine learning technique, Nyabako et al. [103] recently predicted the insect
    population and the resulting damage to grain mass. Information from storage units
    was gathered, and it was then correlated with the local weather at each site to
    analyze the data. Using parameter selection algorithms and decision tree learning
    algorithms, models were created from this input data to forecast insect infestation
    and the potential harm to grain that is stored. More than 96% of the variation
    in germination rates was explained by the mathematical models proposed by Jian
    et al. [109] to predict the germination rates of stored canola. The temperature
    distribution and moisture content of soybeans stored in bag silos were predicted
    by Barreto et al. [110] as a result of seasonal climate variation. The authors
    found a temperature differential between the lower, middle, and upper layers and
    suggested a limit of 3% for the reference CO2 concentration in grains that were
    stored. Although Taher et al.’s model [111] sought to forecast soybean loss during
    storage by tracking CO2 concentration over the course of the storage period and
    achieved a 73% correlation. In order to predict the physical and physiological
    quality of stored soybean seeds, André et al. [112] examined the performance of
    machine learning algorithms based on variables monitored during seed conditioning
    (temperature and packaging) and storage time. Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
    Random Forest (RF), Multiple Linear Regression, and the REPTree and M5P decision
    tree algorithms were used to analyze the data. The combination of the input variables
    temperature and storage time for the RF and REPTree algorithms performed better
    than linear regression in predicting the quality of seeds, providing higher accuracy
    rates. Among the most significant findings, the authors verified that T + P +
    ST, T + ST, P + ST, and ST had the highest mean r and the lowest mean MAE for
    predicting apparent specific mass. However, Person’s correlations for these inputs
    were 0.63 and the MAE varied from 9.59 to 10.47. The inputs T + P + ST and T +
    ST performed better for germination prediction (r = 0.65 and r = 0.67, respectively)
    using the ANN, REPTree, M5P, and RF models. For this reason, the use of computational
    intelligence algorithms is an excellent resource for predicting soybean seed quality
    using data from easy-to-measure variables. In order to classify commercial rice
    samples based on dimensionless morphometric parameters and color parameters extracted
    using CV algorithms from digital images obtained from a smartphone camera, Aznan
    et al. [113] studied the application of computer vision (CV) and machine learning
    (ML). Nine morphocolorimetric parameters were used to create an ANN model that
    classified rice samples into 15 commercial rice varieties. To further simulate
    the real-world application models in various scenarios, they were also implemented
    and assessed on an alternative imaging system. The findings demonstrated that,
    with an overall accuracy of 90.7% (Model 2), the best classification accuracy
    was achieved using the Bayesian Regularization (BR) neural network with ten hidden
    neurons, which provided 91.6% (MSE ≤ 0.01) and 88.5% (MSE = 0.01) for the training
    and testing steps, respectively. Additionally, the implementation classified rice
    samples with high accuracy (93.9%). The adoption by the industry of fast, reliable
    and precise techniques, such as those described here, can make it possible to
    include various morpho-colorimetric properties of rice in consumer perception
    studies. Physical classification is the method used by rice unloading, delivery,
    storage, and processing units to commercially characterize the quality of the
    grains, according to Carneiro et al. [114]. Traditional method is often used for
    this stage, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive and produces subjective
    results because the evaluation is visual. Grain quality can be characterized using
    non-destructive technologies and computer intelligence, which can speed up, improve
    accuracy, and reduce reliance on the process. Thus, the purpose of this study
    was to categorize any flaws and to describe and forecast the quality of processed
    brown rice grains. To do this, samples were taken from the top and bottom of four
    drying silos, each of which could hold up to 40,000 bags. The grain samples were
    subjected to dry aeration until their moisture content (w.b.) reached 12%, which
    had previous moisture contents of 16%, 17%, 18%, and 19%. For this, machine learning
    algorithm models (multilayer perceptron ANN, M5P, REPTree and Random Tree decision
    tree algorithms, and Random Forest) and near-infrared spectroscopy technology
    were employed. A strong negative correlation (r = 0.98) was verified between observed
    and predicted values of moisture content and whole grain yield. Conversely, a
    robust positive correlation (r = 0.97) was noted between the moisture content
    and the physical defects categorized within the different physicochemical components
    analyzed. These findings demonstrate how useful near-infrared spectroscopy technology
    is. With a mean absolute error of 0.017, a coefficient of determination of 0.92,
    and a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.96, the Random Tree model is the
    recommended due to its successful prediction of the grain quality results. The
    findings demonstrate that a great non-destructive substitute for physical sorting
    of whole and defective rice grains in terms of assessing their physical and chemical
    qualities is the combination of near-infrared spectroscopy technology and machine
    learning models. Because of this, it is advised to use NIR for monitoring. Additionally,
    the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence can be used to apply
    predictive algorithms that enable the prediction of deterioration, which helps
    to maintain grain quality. 7. Conclusions and Proposal for Monitoring from Production
    Grain to Post-Harvest The information gathered in this review contributes positively
    to the entire grain production chain, from the application of remote sensing in
    the field to the post-harvest stages (Figure 7). The remote sensing associated
    with the techniques of monitoring and prediction of results helps in a precise
    way the management of agricultural properties, increasing the chances of hits
    at the time of taking decisions [107,108]. The present work reviewed grain storage
    strategies focusing on different environmental factors and measurable variables,
    and how current sensor and computational technologies improve the indirect predictive
    monitoring of grain quality. Several scientific studies showed how preventative
    monitoring techniques helped reduce losses on the post-harvest stages of grain
    production. Figure 7. Summary of the monitoring the grain production chain: production
    to post-harvest. New paths for the technological advancement of grain quality
    monitoring in storage and transportation are being opened up by the growth of
    the IoT paradigm and the increasing application of AI approaches in the widest
    range of agricultural sectors. These advances support post-harvest grain deterioration
    prevention strategies. Using the most recent advances in remote sensing, monitoring,
    IoT, and AI technologies, a scheme has been developed to monitor and predict grain
    quality from production to post-harvest (Figure 8). This scheme is based on the
    systematic review and focuses on various environmental factors and measurable
    variables. Based on novel studies [107,108,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130],
    Figure 8 was created in order to calculate the equilibrium moisture content and
    dry matter loss of the grain mass during transportation, drying, and storage as
    well as to predict the physical and physicochemical changes in the grains, we
    suggested that technology and devices be developed to obtain intergranular temperature,
    relative humidity, and CO2 concentration in real time (Figure 8). Figure 8. Illustration

    technologies of remote sensing, monitoring, internet of things, and artificial
    intelligence. Author Contributions Writing (Original draft), D.M.R.; Conceptualization,

  description: Farmers and experts are continuously searching for optimal conditions
    to improve the productivity of tomatoes in greenhouses. To provide an answer to
    their concerns, we have developed a modeling approach to automate the functioning
    of a greenhouse cultivated with tomato plants. For the aeration, heating, and
    irrigation systems, we compared the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller
    response to the Fuzzy logic (FL) controller response. For the aeration system,
    the response of both controllers was stable, with a pick of about 1.09 for the
    PID controller and zero for the fuzzy controller. Likewise, there was no overtaking
    for the fuzzy controller but about 8.28% for the PID controller. The rise time
    for the fuzzy controller was less than that of the PID controller (627 s). We
    signaled a stable response for the PID controller and the fuzzy logic controller
    for the irrigation system. The pick and the overtake were equal to zero for the
    fuzzy logic controller but were 1.28 and 28.2 s for the PID controller, respectively.
    In the case of both controllers, the rise time was the same, equaling 18.3 s.
    The regulation time was less than 35 s for the fuzzy logic controller and 31.1
    s for the PID controller.

    Abstract Farmland irrigation is an essential foundation for good crop growth,
    while traditional farmland irrigation techniques cannot fully consider the impact
    of factors such as natural precipitation and crop transpiration on crop growth,
    which can, to a certain extent, result in poor irrigation decisions and a complex

    concern. As an industry that requires more water resources, the research on water-saving
    irrigation technology is the most urgent. Many scholars at home and abroad have
    conducted extensive in-depth research on water-saving irrigation technology, and
    a large number of research results have been achieved. Regarding the demand to
    model crop waters, some experts have developed the management-oriented cropping
    system model MODERATO [1]. Tolomio et al. [2] proposed a dynamic crop simulation
    model to predict future interactions between water and crop. An et al. [3] used
    the Pearson correlation coefficient method to analyze the intrinsic linkage and
    influence between soil–crop–environment and tomato water demand patterns. The
    inherent association and impact between the regularity and the regression function
    of water and crop physiological parameters were constructed by combining the through-path
    analysis and multiple regression methods. Zhang et al. [4] proposed a coupled
    water–crop growth (CHC) model to overcome the oversimplification of the crop and
    irrigation modules in the water model. Q. Li [5] introduced a new approach named
    the Sparse Fractional Levy Quaternion Extended Kalman Filter (SFLQEKF) for predicting
    stochastic time series. It has also been found that natural conditions, such as
    measuring crop physiological parameters, are more efficient than indirect conditions,
    such as measuring soil environment for irrigation scheduling methods, by comparing
    asparagus crop studies [6]. A mathematical model of maize crop and stage water
    relations under catchment recharge irrigation conditions was developed using the
    BP neural network, which reflects the sensitivity of water requirements at each
    developmental stage of maize [7]. These research methods have laid a solid foundation
    for crop–water interrelationships. Consequently, the ability to measure the parameters
    involved in the individual model accurately becomes a key factor. The development
    of sensor technology has provided technical support for accurate measurements
    [8]. Vijayakumar et al. [9] used wireless sensor network (WSN) technology to collect
    data for accounting and analysis to enhance the intelligence of irrigation systems
    with the help of machine learning algorithms. Jitendra Kumar et al. developed
    and evaluated a soil moisture sensor [10]. Soulis et al. [11] determined the effect
    of soil moisture sensor positioning and the accuracy of soil moisture-based drip
    irrigation scheduling systems under different conditions. It emphasized the selection
    of suitable soil moisture sensors for specific crop needs. Luca Bondesan et al.
    [12] compared the difference between irrigation scheduling and variable rate irrigation
    with the inclusion of sensors and conventional uniform irrigation to demonstrate
    the importance of sensors in irrigation decision making. In the context of research
    on water-saving irrigation equipment, Djalilov et al. [13] studied the main factors
    of vibrations occurring in electric motors in irrigation facilities. They developed
    a virtual tool to detect and analyze vibrations. Yang Yang et al. [14] propose
    a crop rows detection algorithm based on the autonomous extraction of ROI (region
    of interest), which can achieve high accuracy and the robust extraction of ROI
    in various maize fields. The proposed algorithm can provide a new solution to
    the machine vision-based navigation technology for agricultural machinery. The
    system for driving irrigation equipment using solar photovoltaics has also been
    investigated and proposed [15]. An electronic pre-wetting detector was developed
    for irrigation scheduling, which can improve irrigation accuracy [16]. In the
    study of control methods, Mahmoodabadi [17] proposed a robust fuzzy adaptive integral
    sliding mode controller for nonlinear uncertain chaotic systems based on a multi-objective
    grey wolf optimization algorithm. In the paper, a multi-objective gray wolf optimization
    algorithm was used to improve the performance of the proposed controller. This
    method can effectively obtain the correct parameters of the proposed controller
    and avoid the trial-and-error process. J Torres et al. [18] proposed two anti-winding
    algorithms in the framework of sliding mode control to restart the necessary action
    without affecting the control action behavior. Alvaro Javier Prado et al. [19]
    introduced two anti-winding control algorithms in the framework of sliding mode
    control to reset the integral control action in the discontinuous mode promptly
    without inhibiting the robustness of the whole control system against disturbances.
    Zhang Yang et al. [20] proposed a unicycle robot and designed an adaptive fuzzy
    controller based on its dynamics model to achieve equilibrium control. These studies
    provide effective equipment for irrigation. The development of network technology
    is essential for how irrigation equipment can be adapted to intelligent irrigation
    systems. The rapidly developing wireless network technology has been widely used
    in people’s lives and work in recent years, such as the design of office automation
    systems based on Internet of Things technology, the research of fire information
    based on computer network technology, and the research of Chinese medicine health
    rehabilitation [21,22,23], which helps to solve diversified problems encountered
    in different fields. Xu et al. [24] present a natural language query and control
    interface for LoT platforms that effectively parses natural language commands
    entered by users, enabling them to perform more complex operations. Tace et al.
    [25] proposed an intelligent irrigation system that integrates LoT technologies
    and machine learning algorithms in intelligent irrigation systems. A system based
    on deep learning algorithms was developed to monitor the number and height of
    moso bamboo shoots through image acquisition and YOLOv4 modeling [26]. An Arduino-based
    irrigation control system was proposed by conducting extensive experimental trials
    to automatically adjust soil water content within a specific depth range [27].
    Rathod et al. [28] designed and developed an automatic irrigation system for greenhouses
    to optimize water use. Ling Zhu et al. [29] designed a ZigBee-based automated
    irrigation system to achieve real-time monitoring, remote monitoring, and alarm
    functions, providing an intuitive on-site management platform for irrigation users.
    Wireless sensor network systems have also supported irrigation research in recent
    years. Ndunagu et al. [30] proposed an innovative irrigation system using drip
    irrigation methods, which was designed and implemented using wireless sensor networks
    and Thingspeak.com to manage water resources effectively. Scholars also developed
    wireless sensor networks for drip irrigation systems and multi-intelligent body
    automatic irrigation systems [31,32]. In summary, with the development of technology,
    intelligent water-saving irrigation methods and systems will be the future trend,
    and research results in this area will be gradually applied. Although these controllers
    are effective, they have certain limitations. Their model designs are often universal
    and cannot effectively combine the weather conditions of the irrigated area with
    the local soil conditions, which can easily cause significant errors in the irrigation
    operation. For this problem, this paper uses predictive algorithms and crop coefficients
    combined with weather data from the summer maize-growing region of the Yellow
    Huaihai Sea to calculate crop water consumption. We also use wireless sensor technology
    to monitor local soil environment data in real-time and introduce fuzzy algorithms
    and sliding mode control methods to design composite controllers to calculate
    irrigation volumes and achieve irrigation control. The significant contributions
    of the proposed method are as follows: (1) A method of intelligent farm irrigation
    control incorporating multiple models is proposed, integrating sensor technology,
    wireless network communication technology, the ARIMA prediction model, a fuzzy
    algorithm, and sliding mode control. (2) An intelligent irrigation control system
    based on Java language is developed, which realizes the whole smart irrigation.
    This paper proposes an intelligent farm irrigation control method based on the
    crop water consumption model, rainfall prediction, a fuzzy algorithm, and sliding
    mode control. It also develops a farmland irrigation control system based on this
    method. The rest of the study is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the
    intelligent irrigation control method for farmland and the prediction and control
    models used. Section 3 describes the design of the prediction and control models
    in detail based on our dataset. In Section 4, we compare the prediction results
    and discuss the simulation results of the control model. The paper concludes with
    a summary of our results and directions for further research in Section 5. 2.
    Materials and Methods 2.1. Structure of Farmland Irrigation Control System This
    paper proposes an agricultural water-saving irrigation control system, shown in
    a simple schematic diagram in Figure 1. In this system, soil monitoring data,
    multi-year meteorological data, crop water consumption model, and expected soil
    moisture content are used as input data, and the calculation of farmland irrigation
    volume is carried out based on the fuzzy sliding mode control method. Then the
    irrigation valve is controlled by a computer using a 5G network for automatic
    irrigation. The soil moisture sensors deployed in the system farmland use wireless
    network communication to obtain real-time soil temperature and humidity data.
    In addition, a time series model is used to predict future rainfall and crop transpiration
    through multi-year climatological data from weather stations. The precise control
    cloud platform developed receives irrigation volume data and then uses the cloud
    port to control the water and fertilizer machine for regular and quantitative
    irrigation. The water and fertilizer machine controls the solenoid valve for irrigation
    through the field pipe network system. Figure 1. Intelligent irrigation control
    system diagram: (a) irrigation equipment diagram; and (b) system schematic. 2.2.
    Intelligent Irrigation Control Method A diagram of the proposed intelligent irrigation
    method is shown in Figure 2, in which wireless sensor technology and wireless
    network communication technology are used. Firstly, the weather station’s multi-year
    climate database predicts the rainfall and crop transpiration for the coming week.
    The soil moisture is input into the fuzzy algorithm to derive the initial irrigation
    amount. The soil moisture and the desired soil moisture content are used to calculate
    the compensation amount through the sliding mode controller, combined with the
    initial irrigation amount to derive the final crop irrigation amount. The system
    receives the irrigation volume for the coming week as a control volume. It remotely
    controls equipment via the cloud port for irrigation operations when the crop
    needs water. Figure 2. Intelligent irrigation control method. After finishing
    the irrigation operation, the soil moisture and other information in the farmland
    are fed back to the sensors and weather stations in real-time to achieve closed-loop
    irrigation control. The composite controller can calculate whether the soil environment
    meets the suitable conditions for crop growth and development after the actual
    irrigation operation through the feedback data. The irrigation operation can be
    stopped when the soil conditions reach the appropriate growth range. 2.3. Rainfall
    Prediction Model The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model predicts
    future daily rainfall. The ARIMA model requires the time series to be smooth,
    and if a non-smooth time series is obtained, the first step is to make a difference
    of order d until the data is soft and the number of disagreements made is the
    parameter d. The expression is: ∇ 𝑑 𝑥 𝑖 =∇( ∇ 𝑑−1 𝑥 𝑖 )= ∑ 𝑖=0 𝑑 (−1) 𝑖 𝐶 𝑖 𝑑
    𝑥 𝑖−1  (1) where 𝑥 𝑖 (𝑖=1, 2,…,𝑡) is the predicted value and 𝑑(0, 1, 2,…) is the
    number of differences. The lagged values were then fitted with p (autoregressive
    term) and q (moving average term) as parameters, and the present and lagged values
    of the model random errors were regressed to build the model [33]. The prediction
    equation of the ARIMA model with p, d, and q as parameters can be expressed as:  𝑎
    𝑡 = 𝜃 0 + 𝜑 1 𝑎 𝑡−1 + 𝜑 2 𝑎 𝑡−2 +⋯+ 𝜑 𝑝 𝑎 𝑡−𝑝 + 𝜀 𝑡 − 𝜃 1 𝜀 𝑡−1 − 𝜃 2 𝜀 𝑡−2 −⋯−
    𝜃 𝑞 𝜀 𝑡−𝑞 (2) where 𝑎 2 is the sample value, 𝜑 𝑖 (𝑖=1, 2,…,𝑝) , and 𝜃 𝑗 (𝑗=1,
    2,…,𝑞) are the model parameters; 𝜀 𝑡 is a zero-mean white noise sequence. This
    model can use the information criterion method to determine the parameters of
    p and q. First, the AIC criterion (Akaike Information Criterion) is used to weigh
    the complexity of the estimated model and the accuracy of the data fitted by the
    model. 𝐴𝐼𝐶=−2ln(𝐿)+2𝐾 (3) where L denotes the maximum likelihood function of the
    model and K denotes the number of model parameters. When the sample size is large,
    combining the assessment with the BIC criterion (Bayesian Information Criterion)
    is necessary.  𝐵𝐼𝐶=−2ln(𝐿)+𝐾ln(𝑛) (4) where n denotes the sample size and BIC
    considers the sample size and can effectively prevent overfitting due to a large
    sample size. Moreover, BIC can control the situation where k is too high and when
    n is small. It can determine the p and q values corresponding to the smallest
    sum of AIC and BIC values as the parameters p and q of the model. 2.4. Crop Transpiration
    Prediction Model The ARIMA model described above was also used for crop evapotranspiration
    prediction. In the case of obtaining the reference evapotranspiration, the crop
    coefficient 𝐾 𝑐 is used to correct transpiration [34,35]. 𝑎 3 = 𝐾 𝑐 𝐸 𝑇 0 (5)
    where 𝐸 𝑇 0 is the predicted evapotranspiration, 𝑎 3 is the crop evapotranspiration,
    and 𝐾 𝑐 not only varies according to the crop species but also takes different
    values in different crop growth cycles. This paper selected maize as the research
    object. The crop coefficients 𝐾 𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑖 =0.7 for the early stage, 𝐾 𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑑 =1.20 for
    the middle stage, and 𝐾 𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑑 =0.6, 0.35 for the late stage were obtained according
    to the crop coefficient table recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations. 2.5. Controller Design The controller design incorporates
    a fuzzy algorithm and a sliding-mode controller based on a fault observer, as
    shown in Figure 3. The fuzzy algorithm can summarize expert experience and data
    into linguistic control rules, eliminating the need for an accurate mathematical
    model of the controlled object, making it suitable for controlling nonlinear systems
    and less complex to implement [36]. The sliding mode controller can overcome the
    uncertainty of the system; it also has good control performance for nonlinear
    systems, fast response, strong resistance to external disturbances, and good robustness
    so that it can adapt to the complex environment of farmland [37]. Figure 3. Structure
    of the fuzzy sliding mode control system. 2.5.1. Fuzzy Algorithm Design The fuzzy
    model for a continuous-time nonlinear system can be expressed as [38]: 𝑅𝑢𝑙𝑒  𝑅
    𝑖 : 𝐼𝑓  𝑧 1 (𝑡) 𝑖𝑠  𝑀 𝑖 1  𝑎𝑛𝑑…𝑎𝑛𝑑   𝑧 𝑝 (𝑡) 𝑖𝑠  𝑀 𝑖 𝑝  THEN  𝑥 ˙ (t)= 𝐴 𝑖 x(t)+
    𝐵 𝑖 u(t) (6) where 𝑅 𝑖 is the ith fuzzy inference rule, i is the number of inference
    rules, and 𝑀 𝑖 𝑗 (𝑖=1,2,…,𝑟;𝑗=1,2,…,𝑝) is the fuzzy set. ( 𝐴 𝑖 , 𝐵 𝑖 ) is the
    state space matrix of the corresponding dimension of the ith local model and the
    vector of premise variables is defined as 𝑧(𝑡)=[ 𝑧 1 (𝑡)⋯ 𝑧 𝑝 (𝑡)] . The fuzzy
    model can be expressed in the following compact form using the center of gravity
    defuzzification method. 𝑥 ˙ (t)= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑟 ℎ 𝑖 (𝑧)( 𝐴 𝑖 x(t)+ 𝐵 𝑖 u(t)) (7) where
    the normalized MF ℎ 𝑖 (𝑧) is defined as: ℎ 𝑖 (𝑧)= 𝜔 𝑖 (𝑧) ∑ 𝑟 𝑖=1 𝜔 𝑖 (𝑧) ,   𝜔
    𝑖 (𝑧)= ∏ 𝑗=1 𝑝 𝜇 𝑖 𝑗 ( 𝑧 𝑗 ) (8) where 𝜇 𝑖 𝑗 ( 𝑧 𝑗 ) is the affiliation level
    of the premise variable in each fuzzy set 𝑀 𝑖 𝑗 . It is important to note that
    the normalized MFs satisfy the following properties. 0≤ ℎ 𝑖 (𝑧)≤1,  ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑟 ℎ
    𝑖 (𝑧)=1,  ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑟 ℎ ˙ 𝑖 (𝑧)=0 (9) 2.5.2. Sliding Mode Controller Design In 0–15
    cm soils, soil moisture and irrigation volume are approximately linear [39], so
    the irrigation system model is constructed as follows: ℎ− 𝜏 𝐹 =𝑘𝑢 (10) where ℎ
    is the soil moisture, 𝑢 is the irrigation volume of the irrigation system, 𝑘>0
    , and 𝜏 𝐹 is the fault or uncertainty disturbance caused by various adverse factors.
    The systematic error is defined as:  𝑒= ℎ 𝑡 − ℎ 𝑑 (11) where ℎ 𝑡 is the actual
    soil moisture and ℎ 𝑑 is the desired soil moisture. The slip surface is defined
    as: 𝑠=𝑐𝑒 (12) The convergence rate is defined as:  𝑠 ˙ =−𝑘𝑠−𝛽𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠) (13) where
    𝑘>0 and 𝛽>0 . From all the above equations, the controller is obtained as follows:  𝑢=
    1 𝑐𝑘 (𝑘𝑠+𝛽𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠)+𝑐 𝐹 ̂ +𝑐 ℎ 𝑑 ) (14) where  𝐹 ̂ is the estimate of 𝜏 𝐹 , defining
    the Lyapunov function 𝑉=𝑠 , the derivative of which yields 𝑉 ˙ = 𝑠 ˙ =𝑐 , subject
    to 𝑐<0 , when 𝑉 ˙ <0 , the system can be acquired as globally asymptotically stable.
    2.5.3. Fault Observer Design We are constructing a nonlinear fault observer. ⎧
    ⎩ ⎨       𝑧 ˙ 𝑑 =−𝑙 𝑧 𝑑 −𝑙[𝜆+𝑘𝑢] 𝐹 ̂ = 𝑧 𝑑 +𝜆 𝑙= 𝜆 ˙ ℎ (15) where 𝑧 𝑑 is
    the observer’s internal state variable, λ is a nonlinear function, and 𝑙 is the
    nonlinear observer gain. The disturbance estimation error is defined 𝐹 ̃ = 𝜏 𝐹
    − 𝐹 ̂ , considering the slow change of the composite disturbance in the process
    control, and the assumptions of the disturbance observer are set to 𝜏 𝐹 ˙ ≈0 .
    The expression can be described as:   𝐹 ̃ ˙ = 𝜏 𝐹 ˙ − 𝐹 ̂ ˙ =− 𝑧 ˙ 𝑑 − 𝜆 ˙ =𝑙
    𝑧 𝑑 +𝑙[𝑙+𝑘𝑢]−𝑙ℎ=𝑙( 𝐹 ̂ − 𝜏 𝐹 )=−𝑙 𝐹 ̃ (16) The Lyapunov function is defined as  V
    s = 𝐹 ̃ , the derivation of which yields V s ˙ = 𝐹 ̃ ˙ =−𝑙 𝐹 ̃ <0 , so that the
    fault observer is asymptotically stable. 3. Design Example In this paper, soil
    moisture sensors were deployed to obtain soil moisture data in real-time in farmland
    in Suzhou City, Anhui Province, and then to make predictions of future daily rainfall
    and crop transpiration values based on historical data of daily rain in Suzhou
    City from 1951 to 2019 and daily transpiration from 2010 to 2019 [40]. Although
    the datasets of different periods in Cebu City are used, the ARIMA model can be
    used to predict the rainfall and crop transpiration during the same period and
    then to combine the obtained soil moisture data to calculate the initial irrigation
    amount. At the same time, we set up water-saving irrigation equipment in the city
    and developed a monitoring cloud platform to achieve remote irrigation control,
    as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Figure 4. This is a figure. Schemes follow
    the same formatting. Figure 5. Part of the irrigation monitoring cloud platform
    interface. 3.1. Soil Moisture Data Acquisition Some of the historical data on
    soil moisture collected by the soil moisture sensor are shown in Figure 6. A wireless
    gateway also needs to be set up to enable data transfer, which is saved in a database
    and can be viewed and queried in real-time in the developed cloud platform for
    historical data. Figure 6. Soil moisture data for July–September 2021 in Suzhou
    City, Anhui Province. 3.2. Future Rainfall Model Design The ARIMA model order
    was first determined using the information criterion method. When selecting the
    ARIMA (p,d,q) model for forecasting, the parameters were chosen from low to high
    order according to 0, 1, 2, and 3, using the values of AIC and BIC to select the
    optimal value model. The results are shown in Table 1. Table 1. AIC and BIC values
    for each model. Based on the comparison results, it was found that the model ARIMA(2,0,1)
    had the smallest sum of AIC and BIC, so this model was selected for forecasting.
    The model variables were taken to be p = 2 and q = 1. The fitting formula is    𝑎
    𝑡 =0.13632 𝑎 𝑡−1 +0.032244 𝑎 𝑡−2 − 𝜀 𝑡−1 (17) The Durbin–Watson (DW) test, which
    is used to test the first-order autocorrelation of the residuals in the regression
    analysis, is better the closer the value of this statistic is to two. The result
    of the Durbin–Watson test for this model was 1.9998, suggesting that the reasonable
    accuracy was high and the modeling met the requirements. Lastly, the research
    data were analyzed and predicted according to the established ARIMA(2,0,1) model.
    The combined test data and indicated data are shown in Figure 7, showing that
    the ARIMA model’s fitted results are similar to the actual rainfall variation
    trend. Future rainfall forecasts are presented in Figure 8. Figure 7. Combined
    graph of test and predicted data. Figure 8. Graph of anticipated results. 3.3.
    Evapotranspiration Model Design The ARIMA model order was first established in
    conjunction with the information criterion, and the parameters were selected from
    low to high demand according to 0, 1, 2, and 3, using the values of AIC and BIC
    to determine the optimal value model. The results are described in Table 2. Table
    2. AIC and BIC values for each model. The model ARIMA(1,0,3) was considered the
    most effective, given that the sum of AIC and BIC was minimal. Thus, the values
    of the parameters in the model are p = 1 and q = 3. After determining the order,
    the tentative model parameters are estimated, generally using the maximum likelihood
    estimation method, and the final fitted formula based on the model estimation
    results is    𝑎 𝑡 =0.73652 𝑎 𝑡−1 −1.2404 𝜀 𝑡−1 +0.15286 𝜀 𝑡−2 +0.10479 𝜀 𝑡−3 (18)
    The Durbin–Watson operation resulted in 1.9921, with a high fitting accuracy,
    and the modeling satisfied the requirements. Eventually, transpiration was predicted
    by the established ARIMA(1,0,3) model. Comparing the expected data for 2019 with
    the accurate data from 2010 to 2019 indicates that the model prediction results
    and the actual evapotranspiration data have a similar tendency. The comparison
    plots and prediction results are illustrated in Figure 9 and Figure 10. Figure
    9. Comparison chart of test results. Figure 10. Graph of anticipated results.
    3.4. Composite Controller Design This article uses the predicted amount of rainfall
    in Suzhou City, the expected amount of crop transpiration, the soil moisture data
    collected by sensors, and the expected soil moisture content as input parameters
    of the composite controller, with the irrigation amount as the output parameter.
    Three inputs and a single output were employed in the fuzzy algorithm. Based on
    theoretical analysis and the experience of actual operators, the variables were
    fuzzified into five ranks: extra small, slightly small, medium, large, and extra
    large, as displayed in Table 3. The triangular affiliation function is used for
    both input and output quantities and expressed in Figure 11. The fuzzy control
    rules are constructed, and the fuzzy rule variable relationships are shown in
    Figure 12, which offers a nonlinear relationship between the variables. Since
    all three input quantities have five linguistic input values, there are 5 × 5
    × 5 = 125 fuzzy rules. The details are shown in Table 4. Figure 11. Affiliation
    functions for input and output quantities: (a) transpiration affiliation function;
    (b) precipitation affiliation function; (c) soil moisture affiliation function;
    and (d) irrigation volume affiliation function. Figure 12. Fuzzy algorithm rule
    variable relationship diagram: (a) rainfall—soil moisture—irrigation; (b) rainfall—evapotranspiration—irrigation;
    and (c) soil moisture—transpiration—irrigation. Table 3. The subset of fuzzy variables.

    Figure 13. Figure 13. Graph of partial irrigation volume results. 4. Analysis
    and Discussion of the Results 4.1. Analysis of the Predicted Results of the Decision
    Model Inputs The predicted values of some precipitation and evapotranspiration
    in Suzhou City, Anhui Province were selected for comparison and analysis with
    the actual values, as shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15. It can be noted that the
    relative error is relatively small and the model has high prediction accuracy.
    The ARIMA model can be employed to anticipate future rainfall and crop evapotranspiration.
    It also provides a reference basis for irrigation volume decision making. Figure
    14. Comparison of rainfall forecast results. Figure 15. Comparison of predicted
    evapotranspiration results. 4.2. Comparative Analysis of Control Results Simulation
    experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and good performance of
    the proposed sliding mode controller (SMC). We set up the simulation environment
    in MATLAB/Simulink R2021a. To better evaluate the proposed controller performance,
    the traditional SMC controller and proportion integration differentiation (PID)
    controller are also given for comparison purposes [41]. The nominal parameters
    of the control parameters of the three controllers are listed in Table 5. Table
    5. Controller parameters. The simulation of the PID controller and the SMC controller
    in the case of faults is presented in Figure 16. The incorporation of flaws in
    the system will enhance the control difficulty of the system to a greater extent.
    The proposed composite controller has superior tracking accuracy compared to the
    PID controller in the case of faults because the fault observer is added to the
    proposed composite controller to estimate flaws accurately and efficiently. According
    to the comparison results, the composite controller designed in this paper has
    a higher control accuracy and better robustness than the PID controller. Furthermore,
    it can achieve faster error convergence and better tracking of the reference signal
    in fault operation mode. Figure 16. Comparison of simulation results for different
    controllers: (a) simulation results of the PID controller; and (b) simulation
    results of the SMC controller. Moreover, we clearly see from the graph that the
    tracking curves under the SMC control are pretty smooth, while the ones under
    the PID control have a more apparent chattering phenomenon. The reason is that
    the SMC control exhibits smoother control inputs than the PID controller, resulting
    in a smoother tracking response for the proposed control. 5. Conclusions This
    study has designed an intelligent irrigation control system for crop irrigation
    in agricultural fields. At first, a brilliant irrigation control method incorporating
    multiple models is proposed in this system. Through the comprehensive employment
    of sensor technology, wireless network communication technology, the ARIMA prediction
    model, and a composite controller, real-time soil moisture data can be acquired
    and combined with crop coefficients to achieve crop transpiration and future rainfall
    prediction. Then, the controller is designed using the expected soil moisture
    content. Furthermore, in response to better monitoring of the collected data and
    irrigation operations, an intelligent irrigation control cloud platform based
    on Java language was developed to achieve intelligent and automated irrigation
    control throughout the process. Eventually, MATLAB/Simulink verified the proposed
    fuzzy sliding mode control’s effectiveness in setting faults. The simulation results
    demonstrate that the SMC has efficient tracking performance and ensures the stability
    and security of the irrigation system effectively. The method proposed in this
    study still has some limitations. Because there are many influencing factors,
    such as climate and soil, to facilitate the research, we only adopted soil moisture,
    rainfall, and evapotranspiration for modeling in this paper. Consequently, there
    are still some things that could improve irrigation estimation. The following
    work will sufficiently consider more relevant parameters and combine them with
    machine learning theory to further enhance the accuracy of the decision model.

  description: Technological advances have played a critical role in the production
    of flower crops, enabling farmers to maximize yields and reduce losses while also
    improving the quality of flowers. These advances have included the development
    of new breeding techniques, such as molecular marker-assisted breeding, and the
    use of modern technologies like high-throughput phenotyping to identify and select
    superior cultivars. In addition, precision farming techniques, such as the use
    of sensors and remote monitoring systems, have made it possible to closely monitor
    crop growth and optimize inputs like water and fertilizer, leading to higher yields
    and improved resource efficiency. Advancements in biotechnology have also resulted
    in the development of transgenic plants that are resistant to pests and diseases,
    reducing the need for chemical pesticides and improving plant health. Modern molecular
    genetic tools, particularly genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases, are emerging
    in addition to conventional approaches of investigating these plants. Furthermore,
    the use of novel growing systems, such as hydroponics and vertical farming, has
    allowed for year-round flower production in controlled environments, mitigating
    the challenges associated with seasonal changes and climate variability. These
    innovations have also made it possible to produce high-quality flowers in urban
    areas, bringing fresh blooms closer to consumers. Overall, technological advances
    in flower crops have revolutionized the floriculture industry, enabling growers
    to produce high-quality flowers in a more sustainable and efficient manner. These
    advancements have not only improved the productivity and profitability of flower
    farming but have also contributed to the conservation of natural resources and
    the protection of the environment.

    India Technological advances have played a critical role in the production of
    flower crops, enabling farmers to maximize yields and reduce losses while also
    improving the quality of flowers. These advances have included the development
    of new breeding techniques, such as molecular marker-assisted breeding, and the
    use of modern technologies like high-throughput phenotyping to identify and select
    superior cultivars. In addition, precision farming techniques, such as the use
    of sensors and remote monitoring systems, have made it possible to closely monitor
    crop growth and optimize inputs like water and fertilizer, leading to higher yields
    and improved resource efficiency. Advancements in biotechnology have also resulted
    in the development of transgenic plants that are resistant to pests and diseases,
    reducing the need for chemical pesticides and improving plant health. Modern molecular
    genetic tools, particularly genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases, are emerging
    in addition to conventional approaches of investigating these plants. Furthermore,
    the use of novel growing systems, such as hydroponics and vertical farming, has
    allowed for year-round flower production in controlled environments, mitigating
    the challenges associated with seasonal changes and climate variability. These
    innovations have also made it possible to produce high-quality flowers in urban
    areas, bringing fresh blooms closer to consumers. Overall, technological advances
    in flower crops have revolutionized the floriculture industry, enabling growers
    to produce high-quality flowers in a more sustainable and efficient manner. These
    advancements have not only improved the productivity and profitability of flower
    farming but have also contributed to the conservation of natural resources and
    the protection of the environment. 1 Introduction The cultivation of flowers has
    been intertwined with human civilization for centuries. Ancient cultures like
    the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans were known to cultivate and use flowers for
    various purposes, including as offerings to their gods, for medicinal purposes,
    and to make fragrances and perfumes (Dafni et al., 2006). Flower production saw
    a seminal shift when colonial powers used Naval power along with railways to transport
    planting material across the continents thus bringing hitherto newer ornamental
    species and cultivars into gardens. As the demand for flowers increased over time,
    growers began to adopt new technologies to improve the quality and yield of their
    crops (Wani et al., 2018). The 20th century saw the advent of air and refrigerated
    transport and hence the ability to move flowers over long distances, particularly
    in the post-fifties which was the single most contributor to development of floriculture
    into a trans-continental and global enterprise. Flower production moved to areas
    around the equator that required less investment in energy in comparison to traditional
    production areas in northern latitudes. Newer flower types and cultivars were
    bred that withstood the rigours of long-distance transport, including improved
    post-harvest technologies and marketing that completed the value chain. Technologies
    have been rapidly developed and deployed to reduce the collective carbon footprint
    of the floriculture industry. In the post-2000s, flower industry has undergone
    the most rapid and paradigm shift in harnessing technologies that have emerged
    as the world ushered in the 4.0 industrial revolution (Hossen et al., 2020). Today,
    growers have access to cutting-edge technologies that have revolutionized flower
    production (Maraveas, 2023). As a result, the ability to handle big data in recent
    years has allowed the floriculture industry to make use of the most significant
    technological advances like genetic engineering (Cardoso and Vendrame, 2022; Khan
    et al., 2022) to create new flower varieties with improved characteristics, such
    as longer shelf-life, unique colors, and fragrance. By manipulating the plant’s
    genetic code, breeders can develop flowers that are more resistant to pests and
    diseases, which reduces the need for harmful chemicals and makes the industry
    more sustainable (Huylenbroeck, and Bhattarai, 2022). AI and IoT have enabled
    the flower industry to reap the benefits of precision agriculture. This technology
    involves the use of sensors, drones, and GPS mapping to optimize crop inputs,
    reduce waste, and increase yields. By monitoring plant health and growth, growers
    can adjust irrigation, fertilization, and pest management practices more precisely,
    which reduces the overall environmental impact of flower production (Belal et
    al., 2021; Ferroukhi et al., 2023). Automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence
    (AI) have also played a significant role in reducing labor costs and increasing
    efficiency in flower cultivation. For example, automated planting and harvesting
    systems can perform tasks much faster and more accurately than manual labor, reducing
    the need for human workers (Jha et al., 2019). While these technological advances
    have greatly improved the quality and yield of flower crops and made the industry
    more sustainable, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. Genetic engineering
    raises questions about the safety of modified plants and their potential impact
    on the environment. Automation and use of artificial intelligence may lead to
    job losses, particularly in the global south where most of the production areas
    are currently located. Therefore, it is essential to explore the potential impact
    of these technological innovations on the environment, economy, and society and
    use them responsibly to promote sustainable and equitable flower production. According
    to a report by the International Trade Centre, the global flower trade was valued
    at over USD 104 billion in 2019, with exports from developing countries accounting
    for a significant share of this value. However, the flower industry also faces
    challenges, including increasing competition, climate change, environmental degradation
    and gender equity. Technological innovations can help address some of these challenges,
    but they should be used responsibly and in conjunction with other sustainable
    practices such as organic farming, biodiversity conservation, and fair labor standards
    and health issues. In addition, technological advances should be accessible to
    all stakeholders, including small-scale farmers, and should not contribute to
    widening the existing economic and social disparities in the flower industry.
    By promoting sustainable and equitable flower production, we can ensure that this
    beautiful and culturally significant part of crop husbandry continues to thrive
    for generations to come. Technology has significantly impacted the floriculture
    industry, leading to significant advances in production, management, and sustainability.
    However, the looming challenge is to sustain and promote equity, inclusion and
    reduction of economic disparity by harnessing fourth industrial revolution in
    channelling its effects on advances in genetic engineering, climate control, carbon
    neutrality and making technologies available to all. Previous reviews on ornamental
    crops have primarily focused on a few technologies as evidenced by several available
    reviews (Rihn et al., 2022; Lea-Cox et al., 2013; Mahmud et al., 2023) whereas
    Rihn et al. (2022), on the other hand, examined factors linked to the inclination
    of the nursery industry to utilize automation and mechanization, and discussed
    the barriers to adoption for currently available technologies. This review article
    stands out as a comprehensive overview of available technologies for ornamental
    crop production. It discusses the potential benefits of using advanced technologies
    that are already employed in other crop industries and introduces the concept
    of virtual flowers, a new idea presented in this article. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first review article to delve so deeply into the significant technological
    advances for the ornamental industry, which have the potential to transform the
    floriculture industry. The ornamental industry is continuously enhancing its production,
    distribution, and marketing processes by leveraging existing agricultural technologies,
    while also exploring new and emerging ones. Below are several technologies that
    are either currently being utilized or hold promising potential for adoption within
    the ornamental industry. 2 Biotechnology Biotechnology has made significant advances
    in ornamental crops, such as flowers and decorative plants (Darqui et al., 2017).
    Tissue culture has been employed to produce a large number of identical plants
    within short period and efficiently, which can be useful for breeding and propagating
    new varieties of ornamental crops (Din et al., 2022). This technique can also
    be used to produce new varieties of plants with desirable traits. Using genetic
    engineering technology and transgenics, new varieties of ornamental crops with
    desirable traits, such as brighter colors, longer vase life, resistant to insect
    pests have been developed (Table 1) (Azadi et al., 2016; Boutigny et al., 2020).
    Marker-assisted breeding has been used to identify desirable traits in ornamental
    crops, such as improved color or longer vase life (Ahn et al., 2020; Chandler
    and Tribe, 2022; Suprasanna and Jain, 2022). This technique can be used to speed
    up the breeding process and create new varieties of ornamental crops more quickly.
    RNA interference has been used to silence specific genes in ornamental crops,
    leading to improved traits such as longer vase life or improved resistance to
    pests and diseases. Genome editing has been used to make precise edits to the
    DNA of ornamental crops, leading to improved traits (Table 1) (Sirohi et al.,
    2022; Ahmad et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2023). Overall, biotechnology has made significant
    advances in ornamental crops, leading to new varieties of plants with improved
    traits, increased resistance to pests and diseases, and more sustainable production
    practices (Din et al., 2021). The spread of the commercialization of GM ornamentals
    has been impeded by economic and regulatory constraints despite the positive scientific
    outlook for transgenic flowers. It is now time to deal with the legal challenges
    to the commercial distribution of GM plants, including flowers. Due to the costs
    and skills required for commercial development, the release of ornamental items
    will remain exceedingly challenging in the absence of an internationally suitable
    and authorised framework for regulation of GM crops. Reduced regulatory requirements
    for decorative plants and other non-food plants are needed to reduce this nuisance
    (Noman et al., 2017). By leveraging these advances, horticulturists can produce
    new varieties of ornamental crops that are more resilient, beautiful, and sustainable.
    In this review, we have made an effort to highlight recent advances and the need
    for attention in order to maximise the long-term sustainability of technology
    and society (Table 1). table 1 TABLE 1. Some specific examples of various biotechnological
    interventions in improving targeted ornamental traits. 3 Nanotechnology Nanotechnology
    is a field of science that involves manipulating matter at the nanoscale level,
    which is typically between 1 and 100 nm in size. In the flower industry, nanotechnology
    is being explored for various applications, including improving flower quality,
    disease resistance, and shelf life. One application of nanotechnology in flowers
    is the use of nanoscale particles to improve the efficiency of fertilizers and
    pesticides. By attaching fertilizer or pesticide molecules to nanoparticles, growers
    can increase the efficiency of these products, reducing the amount needed and
    minimizing environmental impact. Nanoparticles can also be used to deliver nutrients
    and other compounds directly to plant cells, improving uptake and reducing waste.
    Another application of nanotechnology in flowers is the development of nanosensors
    for monitoring plant growth and health. Nanosensors can be designed to detect
    changes in temperature, humidity, nutrient levels, and other factors that affect
    plant growth. Nano biosensors have the potential to revolutionize agriculture
    by not only monitoring soil and plant health but also by predicting outbreaks
    of pests or diseases. By detecting changes in the biochemical makeup of plants
    or soil at a molecular level, nano biosensors can provide farmers with early warning
    signs of potential problems (Rai et al., 2022). This allows them to take preemptive
    measures to mitigate the impact of these issues, such as applying targeted treatments
    or adjusting their growing practices. This information can be used to optimize
    growing conditions and improve flower quality. In addition, nanotechnology can
    be used to develop materials with unique properties that are useful in the flower
    industry. For example, researchers are developing nanomaterials that can absorb
    and release water slowly, helping to maintain proper moisture levels in flower
    arrangements. Nanomaterials can also be used to develop coatings that improve
    the durability and longevity of flowers, reducing waste and improving the sustainability
    of the industry. Cut flowers have ornamental value and are commercially very important,
    but the flowers’ shelf-life is very short (Solgi et al., 2009), due to higher
    microbial contamination (Lu et al., 2010a). The early wilting of the flowers is
    due to microbial and stem barrier infection that causes stem blockage which limits
    the uptake and transport of water, leading to water imbalances (Lü et al., 2010;
    Witte et al., 2014). Hence, it is important to overcome stem blockage by controlling
    microbial infections. Several reports have suggested that nano-silver has the
    potential to broaden the vase life of cut flowers (Li et al., 2012; Alekasir et
    al., 2017; Amingad et al., 2017). The most important nanoparticle, graphene oxide
    (GO) is a graphene-imitating carbon-based NPs containing enormous quantities of
    oxygenated groups with an extensive surface area that contributes a first-rate
    capability to transfer nourishment for sluggish-discharge fertilizers (Zhang et
    al., 2014; Rana et al., 2021). Overall, nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize
    the flower industry by improving efficiency, reducing waste, and improving flower
    quality and sustainability. While many of these applications are still in the
    research phase, they offer exciting possibilities for the future of flower production
    and distribution. 4 Smart greenhouse technology Greenhouse technology is widely
    used in horticulture to create an optimal growing environment for plants. Greenhouses
    allow growers to control the temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors
    to create an optimal growing environment for plants (Koukounaras, 2021). This
    can be particularly important for growing plants in regions with extreme climates
    or for producing crops out of season. Greenhouses can help to protect plants from
    pests and diseases by creating a barrier between the plants and the outside environment.
    This can help to reduce the need for pesticides and other chemical interventions
    (Messelink et al., 2021). Greenhouses can extend the growing season for plants
    by providing a sheltered environment that protects them from the elements. This
    can be particularly important for producing crops out of season or in regions
    with short growing seasons (Nassar and Ribeiro, 2020; Pereira et al., 2021). Greenhouses
    can help to conserve water by collecting and recycling irrigation water. This
    can be particularly important in regions with limited water resources or in areas
    with high water usage. Greenhouses can help to increase the productivity of horticultural
    crops by providing a controlled environment that promotes plant growth and reduces
    the risk of crop loss due to weather or pests. Greenhouses can help to maximize
    space utilization by allowing plants to be grown vertically or in tightly spaced
    rows (Stanghellini, 2013). This can help to increase the yield per unit area of
    land. Overall, greenhouse technology is a key tool in modern horticulture, allowing
    growers to produce high-quality crops year-round in a controlled environment.
    Keeping in view the sustainability there is an urgent need to upgrade or device
    smart greenhouses (Figure 1). Smart greenhouses use sensors and automation technology
    to monitor plant growth and create an optimal environment for flowers to flourish.
    This technology can increase crop yields, reduce waste, and improve the overall
    quality of the flowers. By leveraging the benefits of greenhouse technology, horticulturists
    can increase productivity, conserve resources, and produce crops that are healthier
    and more sustainable. figure 1 FIGURE 1. Conceptual design of smart greenhouse
    and individual overhead bench system. 5 Post-harvest technology Post-harvest technology
    in flowers has advanced significantly in recent years, with new technologies and
    techniques being developed to extend the vase life of cut flowers and improve
    their quality. Here are some of the key advances in post-harvest technology in
    flowers. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) involves storing cut flowers in an
    environment with controlled levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and humidity. This
    can help to extend the vase life of cut flowers by reducing respiration rates
    and slowing the growth of bacteria and fungi. Ethylene is a gas produced by plants
    that can cause flowers to wilt and decay. New technologies, such as ethylene-absorbing
    sachets and controlled atmosphere storage, can help to reduce the levels of ethylene
    around cut flowers, extending their vase life (Yang et al., 2021). Temperature
    is a critical factor in post-harvest flower care. New techniques, such as hydrocooling
    and forced-air cooling, can help to reduce the temperature of cut flowers quickly
    after harvest, reducing respiration rates and extending vase life (Rabiza-Świder
    et al., 2021). The quality of water used to hydrate cut flowers can affect their
    vase life. New techniques, such as reverse osmosis and ultraviolet sterilization,
    can help to improve the quality of water used in post-harvest flower care. New
    treatments, such as pulsing with sugar or plant hormones, can help to extend the
    vase life of cut flowers by promoting water uptake and reducing the growth of
    bacteria and fungi (Ichimura et al., 2007; Kazaz et al., 2019). Research and development
    in the floriculture industry are ongoing, and new chemicals are continually being
    developed to improve the vase life of cut flowers. Here are some examples of new
    chemicals that have shown promising results in recent studies: Nitric oxide (NO):
    NO is a natural signaling molecule that plays a role in regulating plant growth
    and development. Studies have shown that treating cut flowers with NO can delay
    senescence (the aging process) and increase vase life (Hussain et al., 2022).
    NO can also improve the quality of flowers by enhancing color, scent, and overall
    appearance. Polyamines are organic compounds found in all living cells, including
    plants. They are involved in various physiological processes, such as cell division,
    differentiation, and stress response. Recent studies have shown that treating
    cut flowers with polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, can improve their
    vase life by reducing senescence and preserving flower quality (Qu et al., 2020;
    Mazrou et al., 2022). Chitosan is a biodegradable polymer derived from chitin,
    which is found in the shells of crustaceans. It has antimicrobial and antifungal
    properties and has been shown to improve the vase life of cut flowers by reducing
    microbial growth and maintaining water balance (Ali et al., 2022). Essential oils:
    Essential oils are volatile compounds extracted from plants, and they have been
    used for centuries in various applications, including aromatherapy and medicine.
    Recent studies have shown that treating cut flowers with essential oils, such
    as lavender and rosemary, can improve their vase life by reducing microbial growth
    and enhancing flower quality (Teerarak et al., 2019; El-Sayed et al., 2021). Overall,
    advances in post-harvest technology in flowers are helping to improve the quality
    and longevity of cut flowers, reducing waste and improving the sustainability
    of the floral industry. By leveraging the latest technologies and techniques,
    horticulturists can produce high-quality flowers that retain their beauty and
    freshness for longer periods of time. 6 Smart irrigation technology Irrigation
    technology has been playing an essential role in flower crop production by providing
    the right amount of water to the plants, increasing crop yield, and optimizing
    the use of water resources. In general, irrigation technology in flower crops
    involves the application of water in the right amount and at the right time, using
    advanced systems and methods. One of the main advances in irrigation technology
    for flower crops is the use of drip irrigation systems. These systems provide
    water directly to the root zone of plants, minimizing water loss due to evaporation
    and runoff. They also allow for precise control of water application, reducing
    the risk of over- or under-watering. Another irrigation technology that has gained
    popularity in recent years is the use of soil moisture sensors. These sensors
    measure the moisture content in the soil and provide real-time data to growers,
    allowing them to adjust irrigation schedules and avoid water stress or over-watering.
    In addition, advanced irrigation controllers are now available that use weather
    data to adjust irrigation schedules automatically based on the local climate conditions,
    further optimizing water use. Finally, fertigation technology is also being used
    in flower crops, where fertilizers are injected into the irrigation system to
    provide nutrients directly to the roots. This approach ensures that the plants
    receive the necessary nutrients for healthy growth while minimizing fertilizer
    waste and runoff. Overall, irrigation technology has revolutionized flower crop
    production by providing precise control over water and nutrient application, resulting
    in increased yields, improved quality, and reduced water usage. Automation through
    an IoT system could be an effective approach to improve a conventional surface
    irrigation system operation. An automated surface irrigation system refers to
    its operation with timers, sensors or computers or mechanical appliances with
    minimal manual involvement (Figure 2). Many researchers have reported that automation
    in irrigation projects using an intelligent irrigation controller and wireless
    sensor network could save water up to 38% (Al-Ghobari, et al., 2013; Bowlekar
    et al., 2019). Automation is a smart technique to deal with the problem of high
    labor requirements and low water application efficiency of surface irrigation
    systems (Table 2). Many soil moisture sensors such as tensiometer, gypsum block,
    granular matrix sensor, time-domain reflectometer, dielectric probe are commercially
    available for soil moisture measurement and they could generally be used for manual
    or integrated with automatic irrigation control systems through an IoT system
    (Bowlekar et al., 2019; Hardie, 2020; Vera et al., 2021; Pramanik et al., 2022).
    The sensor senses the water advance front and gives a signal to cut-off the flow.
    figure 2 FIGURE 2. Conceptual design of smart irrigation system under protected/open
    cropping systems. table 2 TABLE 2. Summary of reports smart irrigation system
    helping in conserving water efficiently. Smart irrigation systems using Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology have been successfully implemented for ornamental crop
    production. For example, Banda-Chávez et al. (2018) developed an IoT-based sensor
    network using an IoT platform and soil moisture sensors (YL-69) to automate the
    irrigation of ornamental plants (Figure 2). Beeson and Brooks (2006) also used
    an evapotranspiration (ETo) model-based smart irrigation system for wax-leaf privet,
    reducing water usage by 22.22% annually compared to traditional overhead irrigation
    methods. While there are limited studies on IoT-based automatic irrigation systems
    for the ornamental industry, the promising potential of this technology in other
    crop industries suggests it could benefit ornamental crop production. However,
    sensor-to-sensor variability and accurate sensor positioning are important factors
    that can affect efficacy. Determining the optimal number of sensors for a particular
    nursery environment depends on various factors such as the accuracy and repeatability
    of the sensors, variation among sensors, spatial variability of the nursery environment,
    and cost. 7 Soilless technology Limited resources, such as fertile soil and clean
    water, are already a reality in many parts of the world. Climate change further
    exacerbates the challenges of conventional farming practices, as the availability
    and quality of arable land become increasingly limited. Soilless cultivation,
    also known as hydroponics, is a method of growing plants without soil, using a
    nutrient-rich solution instead. By eliminating the need for soil, soilless cultivation
    systems can help conserve water and open up urban areas, such as residential rooftops,
    for food production in close proximity to consumers (Fussy and Papenbrock, 2022).
    The development of automation and computer technology, coupled with the greenhouse
    feature, has accelerated the adoption of soilless cultivation in many developed
    countries in recent years. Conventional farming practices typically rely on soil-bound
    methods, which can have a range of negative impacts on the environment, including
    high and inefficient water demand, large land requirements, fertilizer use, soil
    degradation, and loss of biodiversity. It is imperative to explore alternative
    approaches to food production, such as soilless cultivation, to address these
    challenges and ensure sustainable agricultural practices for the future (Killebrew
    and Wolff 2010; Walls 2006). In the flower industry, soilless cultivation is gaining
    popularity due to its ability to improve crop yields, reduce water consumption,
    and minimize the use of pesticides and fertilizers (AlShrouf, 2017). One of the
    benefits of soilless cultivation in flowers is the ability to control growing
    conditions more precisely. By controlling the temperature, humidity, and nutrient
    levels of the growing solution, growers can optimize plant growth and flower quality
    (Zimmermann and Fischer, 2020). Soilless cultivation also eliminates the need
    for soil, which can reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases and pests (Savvas,
    2002; Hussain et al., 2014). There are several methods of soilless cultivation
    that can be used in the flower industry (Kahraman and Akçal, 2018; Khalaj and
    Noroozharaf, 2020; Kromwijk and van Os, 2020). For example, one common method
    is to grow flowers in a nutrient-rich solution that is recirculated through a
    series of pipes or channels. This method is known as a recirculating hydroponic
    system. Another method is to grow flowers in a substrate, such as rockwool or
    coco coir, which is soaked in a nutrient-rich solution (Leiva et al., 2019; Kharrazi
    et al., 2020). This method is known as a substrate-based hydroponic system. Soilless
    cultivation can also be combined with other technologies to further improve flower
    production. For example, some growers use vertical farming techniques to maximize
    space utilization and improve growing conditions. Vertical farming involves growing
    plants in stacked layers, using artificial lighting and environmental controls
    to optimize plant growth. Overall, soilless cultivation has the potential to revolutionize
    the flower industry by improving crop yields, reducing water and fertilizer consumption,
    and minimizing the risk of pests and diseases. By using nutrient-rich solutions
    and advanced environmental controls, growers can produce high-quality flowers
    with less waste and environmental impact (Figure 3). figure 3 FIGURE 3. Conceptual
    design of smart Soilless culture system-NFT. 7.1 Aeroponics Aeroponics is a modern
    agricultural technique that involves growing plants in an air or mist environment
    without soil. Instead of soil, plants are grown in a nutrient-rich solution that
    is misted onto the roots. Aeroponics is becoming increasingly popular in flower
    crop production because of its many advantages (Nir, 1982). One advantage of aeroponics
    is that it allows for more efficient use of resources like water and nutrients.
    Because the nutrient solution is misted onto the roots, plants can absorb more
    of the nutrients and water than they would if they were grown in soil. This can
    lead to faster growth and higher yields. Another advantage of aeroponics is that
    it reduces the risk of disease and pests. Because plants are grown in a sterile
    environment, there is less chance of soil-borne diseases or pests affecting the
    crop. This can reduce the need for pesticides and other chemicals, making aeroponics
    a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly option. Aeroponics can also be
    used to grow flowers year-round, regardless of weather conditions. This makes
    it possible to produce flowers in areas where traditional outdoor growing methods
    may not be feasible. The performance of the system has been tested successfully
    (growing and rooting) with several plants, such as ornamental plants like carnation,
    croton, chrysanthemum, Eustoma geranium, euonymus, Ficus, philodendron, dracaena,
    dieffenbachia, Zantedeschia, etc (de Kreij and van der Hoeven, 1997; Christie
    and Nichols, 2004; Hayden, 2006; Fascella and Zizzo, 2007). In order to analyse
    plant root systems for a variety of studies, researchers need a practical growing
    system. An aeroponic system that was created by a French engineer and modified
    by members of the legume community, was detailed by Cai et al. (2023) and was
    initially intended for nodulating legume root systems. For researchers looking
    to better understand root growth and development, this approach offers various
    benefits. With this aeroponic device, researchers can grow hundreds of plants
    at once. Even though it is not a sterile system, it may be kept axenic in the
    lab with appropriate procedures. During plant growth, the nutritional medium can
    be changed based on the demands of the experiment. Overall, aeroponics is a promising
    technology for flower crop production, offering many benefits over traditional
    growing methods. However, it requires careful monitoring and management to ensure
    optimal plant growth and health. 7.2 Smart vertical farming Vertical farming is
    a growing trend in the agriculture industry, and it is also being explored for
    flower production. Vertical farming in flowers involves growing plants in vertical
    layers, often in controlled environments, such as indoor facilities or greenhouses
    (Touliatos et al., 2016). Numerous countries including Korea, Japan, China, Germany,
    the United Arab Emirates, China, France, India, Sweden, Singapore, and the United
    States, have convened to discuss vertical farming. They have repeatedly endorsed
    the concept as integral to the long-term sustainability of their cities (Despommier,
    2014). Vertical farming can provide several benefits to flower growers (Figure
    4). Firstly, it allows for the efficient use of space, as plants can be stacked
    vertically, increasing the amount of production per unit area of land. Furthermore,
    indoor farming provides a low-impact system that can significantly reduce travel
    costs, as well as reduce GHG emissions, by cutting down on travel distances between
    distant farms and local markets (Astee, and Kishnani, 2010; Mukherji and Morales,
    2010). Also, vertical farming could ignite local economies by providing much-needed
    “green collar” jobs to urban areas (Healy and Rosenberg, 2013; Mukherji and Morales,
    2010). This is particularly advantageous in urban areas where land is limited
    and expensive. Secondly, vertical farming can offer precise control over growing
    conditions, such as temperature, humidity, light, and nutrient levels, ensuring
    consistent plant growth and reducing the risk of disease and pest infestations
    (Al-Kodmany, 2018). By using artificial lighting and hydroponic or aeroponic systems,
    vertical farms can provide optimal growing conditions for flowers, resulting in
    higher quality and more consistent blooms (Despommier, 2010; Eve, 2015; Levenston,
    2017; Meinhold, 2017). Thirdly, vertical farming can reduce the need for pesticides
    and herbicides, as plants are grown in a controlled environment with fewer pests
    and diseases. This reduces the environmental impact of flower production and provides
    safer working conditions for growers. Finally, vertical farming can also reduce
    water usage, as hydroponic and aeroponic systems recycle water, reducing waste
    and conserving resources. While vertical farming in flowers is still in its early
    stages, it has the potential to transform flower production by providing a more
    sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective way to grow flowers. With further research
    and development, vertical farming could become a key method of flower production
    in the future. figure 4 FIGURE 4. Conceptual design of smart vertical farming
    system. 8 Green roofs and walls Green roofs and walls are becoming more popular
    in urban areas as a way to add green space and reduce the urban heat island effect.
    Advances in materials and installation techniques have made it easier and more
    cost-effective to install and maintain these features. Green roofs and walls are
    innovative and sustainable solutions to improve urban environments by incorporating
    vegetation into buildings. Green roofs are roofs that are covered with plants
    and vegetation, often including a layer of soil and a drainage system, to support
    the growth of vegetation. They can provide several benefits, including reducing
    urban heat island effects, improving stormwater management by retaining rainwater,
    and providing additional insulation to buildings to reduce energy consumption
    (Mayrand and Clergeau, 2018). They can also provide habitat for wildlife and improve
    air quality by filtering pollutants (Haaland and van den Bosch, 2015). Green walls,
    also known as living walls or vertical gardens, are similar to green roofs, but
    they are installed vertically on the side of buildings. They can be made up of
    a variety of plant species and can be used for both aesthetic and functional purposes.
    Green walls can also provide similar benefits to green roofs, such as improving
    air quality and reducing urban heat island effects. Both green roofs and walls
    require proper installation and maintenance to ensure their long-term viability.
    They can also provide unique opportunities for urban agriculture and rooftop gardens,
    creating additional benefits for local communities. Overall, green roofs and walls
    are sustainable solutions to improve urban environments and promote green infrastructure
    (Elmqvist et al., 2015). Green roofs and walls can support a variety of vegetation,
    including flower crops. In fact, adding flower crops to green roofs and walls
    can increase their aesthetic value and provide additional benefits to the environment.
    Flower crops such as sedum, lavender, and wildflowers are often used in green
    roofs due to their hardiness and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions.
    They can also attract pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, which play an
    important role in the pollination of plants. When it comes to green walls, flower
    crops can be arranged in different patterns and designs to create beautiful living
    walls (Pétremand et al., 2017). For instance, a mix of flowering plants such as
    petunias, pansies, and geraniums can be used to create a colorful and vibrant
    wall. In addition to their aesthetic benefits, green roofs and walls with flower
    crops can also provide environmental benefits such as reducing urban heat island
    effects and improving air quality (Ode et al., 2023). They can also provide opportunities
    for urban agriculture, such as growing edible flowers and herbs (Li et al., 2016).
    However, it is important to note that green roofs and walls with flower crops
    require regular maintenance to ensure their health and viability. This includes
    proper irrigation, fertilization, and pest management. Overall, incorporating
    flower crops into green roofs and walls can be a sustainable and beautiful solution
    for urban environments. 9 Robotics Robotics is a rapidly developing field that
    is also making strides in the floriculture industry. Despite the clear benefits
    of existing approaches to robotizing harvesting operations in gardens, the relationship
    between a robot’s degree of autonomy and its ability to perform multiple agricultural
    tasks on a single platform has not been thoroughly investigated. Developing effective
    calculation methods will be crucial to unlocking the full potential of mobile
    robots by increasing their autonomy and expanding their functionality. At the
    same time, the issues of increasing the technical efficiency of solutions aimed
    at achieving a high level of robot autonomy require development. This can be achieved
    by applying intelligent approaches to the complex processing of data coming from
    a complex of information devices (Bechar et al., 2016; Grimstad, 2017) Robotics
    in flower crops involves the use of automated and autonomous systems to perform
    various tasks related to the cultivation, care, and harvesting of flower crops
    (Abarna and Selvakumar 2015). Robotic mowers, trimmers, and other automated maintenance
    equipment can now be used to maintain lawns and other outdoor spaces (Oliveira
    et al., 2021). In addition, the availability of a skilled workforce that accepts
    repetitive tasks in uncomfortable greenhouse conditions is decreasing rapidly,
    causing a reduced availability of workforce (Adegbola et al., 2019; Arad et al.,
    2020). Furthermore, the issue of labor shortage has become even more relevant
    during the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has
    limited international travel for migrant workers (Woo et al., 2020). These machines
    can work continuously and efficiently, reducing the need for manual labor and
    improving overall maintenance quality. One significant benefit of using robotics
    in flower crops is the potential for increased efficiency and productivity. Robots
    can work 24/7, perform tasks with precision and consistency, and work in harsh
    environments without risking the health and safety of human workers. Robots can
    be used to perform tasks such as planting, pruning, weeding, and harvesting (Sori
    et al., 2018; Uchida et al., 2019; Verbiest et al., 2020; Tarannum et al., 2021).
    For example, robots equipped with sensors, cameras, and other technology can navigate
    fields, identify flowers, and accurately harvest them with minimal damage to the
    plant. Some examples of flower harvest robots currently on the market include
    the Flower Robotics’ “Ryden” and the “Harvest Croo” system, which is designed
    specifically for harvesting strawberries but could potentially be adapted for
    use with other types of flowers. QuickFlora is testing another robot ‘FloraBot’
    to automate the flower arrangement process. FloraBot designs advanced technologies
    which enable customers to automate the handling and assembly of fresh flower arrangements
    something that was impossible in the past (www.flora.bot). Everything starts with
    a vision of how to increase efficiency, improve product quality and provide scalability
    when needed, using flower-friendly robotics. In simple terms, robots do things
    that have not been possible before in mass-production floral environments. We
    are able to automate the assembly of floral products and processes that were previously
    off-limits to automation. These robots can also monitor plant growth and detect
    any diseases or pests that could harm the crops, allowing for quicker response
    times to prevent the spread of disease and reduce the need for chemical treatments
    (Figure 5). Similar robots can be designed using a combination of computer vision
    and machine learning algorithms to recognize flower types and colors and arrange
    them into a desired pattern or design. The robots can be equipped with a specialized
    gripper that can pick up and handle delicate flowers without damaging them. Similarly,
    “Starship robots” are designed to transport food packages over short distances
    and have been successfully used to deliver flowers to customers (www.starship.xyz).
    They are operated by Starship Technologies, a company founded by two Skype co-founders,
    Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis. figure 5 FIGURE 5. Conceptual design of robotic systems
    for performing various tasks in ornamental nurseries, (A) plant health monitoring,
    and (B) plant carrier platform with loading and unloading system. An automated
    system for harvesting Gerbera jamesonii cut flowers grown in greenhouses has been
    developed using image processing (Kawollek, and Rath, 2008). The harvesting process
    uses an industrial robot with six axes and an additional linear axis, equipped
    with an end-effector using razor blades for cutting the flower stems. The whole
    harvesting system, including the robots, end-effectors, transport unit, and cameras,
    is calibrated online using special calibration algorithms. The system analyzes
    image data from eight different viewpoints to identify all flower stems in at
    least one of the positions, enabling stepwise harvesting, if necessary, in different
    positions of the plant. To ensure a collision-free process, a path-planning module
    is integrated, and an algorithm for flower stem tracking predicts the emerging
    of the stem in the following non-visible area. In harvesting experiments, 80%
    of all flower stems were harvested, with a decreasing rate of harvest with an
    increasing number of flower stems per plant. For plants with one or two flower
    stems, 98% of the flower stems were harvested, while for plants with five or more
    flower stems, 51% of all flower stems were harvested. Al-beeshi et al. (2015)
    designed a self-propelled robot, which can analyze soil moisture and monitor and
    adjust the water pump’s condition in order to activate the soil watering function.
    A multi-task robotic work cell for greenhouse transplanting and seedlings has
    been developed by Han et al. (2018). The work cell mainly consists of two conveyors,
    a filling unit, a control system, and a transplanting system, which is made up
    of multi-grippers designed to automatically pick up and plant whole rows of seedlings.
    Several studies have been conducted on the development of robots that can perform
    various agricultural tasks with precision and accuracy. Chang et al. (2016) developed
    a low-cost planting robot that can navigate straight lines with great accuracy.
    The robot is equipped with a drilling mechanism that can dig up to 30 cm depth,
    and an ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the drilling depth. Gao et al. (2017)
    designed a prototype of a robot sprayer that can adjust the spray angle according
    to crop height, canopy shape, thickness, and plant density. The system uses magnetic
    sensors installed on the tracks to detect the canopy ridge. Wang et al. (2022)
    designed an intelligent and modular greenhouse seedling inspection robot that
    can acquire images of seedlings and environmental data during cultivation. The
    robot’s environmental data collection module can accurately obtain data on the
    light intensity, temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration in the greenhouse.
    Masuzawa et al. (2017) developed a mobile robot capable of supporting flower harvesting
    by utilizing a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm to map the
    environment. The robot has an RGB-D camera installed not only to measure the distance
    to objects but also to allow for person-following capability. The robot uses image-based
    person detection and tracking and trajectory generation for following movements
    to trace the person’s trajectory as a guide to safe path planning. Ohi et al.
    (2018) utilized the same technology to develop a robot that can perform fully
    autonomous precision pollination of bramble plants in a greenhouse environment.
    The robot uses vision techniques to detect the position of flowers for pollination,
    and an RGB-D camera installed on the robotic arm enables precise short-range positioning.
    These advancements in robot technology show great potential for improving agricultural
    practices and increasing efficiency in various tasks, from planting and spraying
    to harvesting and pollination. While the use of robotics in flower crops is still
    in its early stages, it has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency,
    quality, and sustainability of flower production. However, the development and
    adoption of flower harvest robots face challenges such as cost, technical complexity,
    and the need for further refinement to ensure they can operate in diverse field
    environments. By leveraging robotics, floriculturists can maximize their yields,
    reduce labor costs, and minimize their environmental impact, leading to a more
    sustainable and profitable industry. 10 Imaging technology Imaging technology
    has become an important tool for the floriculture industry. Imaging technology
    in flower crops involves the use of advanced cameras and sensors to capture detailed
    images of plants, flowers, and their surrounding environments. These imaging techniques
    include visible imaging (machine vision), imaging spectroscopy (multispectral
    and hyperspectral remote sensing), thermal infrared imaging, fluorescence imaging,
    3D imaging and tomographic imaging (MRT, PET and CT) (Li et al., 2014). These
    images are then analyzed using advanced algorithms and computer programs to provide
    insights into plant growth, development, and health. One of the primary applications
    of imaging technology in flower crops is for the detection and diagnosis of plant
    diseases and pests (Saleem et al., 2020). By capturing high-resolution images
    of plants and analyzing them using artificial intelligence and machine learning
    algorithms, floriculturists can quickly and accurately detect early signs of disease
    or pest infestations, allowing for timely intervention and treatment (Sasaki et
    al., 1999; Chaerle et al., 2007). Imaging technology can also be used to monitor
    plant growth and development, including factors such as leaf area, stem diameter,
    and flower size. This information can be used to optimize growth conditions, such
    as lighting, temperature, and irrigation, to maximize plant health and productivity
    (Nakarmi and Tang, 2012; Tilly et al., 2012; Longchamps et al., 2023). Plant phenotyping
    robots are cutting-edge technology that allows for the high-throughput measurement
    of morphological, chemical, and physiological properties of a large number of
    plants. Multiple robotic systems have been developed for different phenotyping
    missions. Robotic phenotyping has the potential to efficiently monitor changes
    in plant traits over time, both in controlled environments and in the field (Atefi
    et al., 2021). Various studies have discussed the use of image-based techniques,
    including 2D and 3D reconstruction, to extract architectural traits such as inflorescence
    length and width, inflorescence volume (weight), grain shape and size, grain angle,
    number of grains, and number of flowers (Faroq et al., 2013; Crowell et al., 2014;
    Gage et al., 2017; Rudolph et al., 2019). To measure morphological traits in plant
    phenotyping, a robot equipped with LIDAR or a camera can automatically capture
    images or point cloud data from various angles of the inflorescence. Physiological
    traits are important indicators of stress or disease in plants. For example, the
    temperature of the spikes has been used to detect water stress in plants (Panozzo
    et al., 1999). A robotic arm equipped with a temperature sensor can potentially
    grasp the spike and insert the sensor into spikelets to record their temperature.
    In fruit quality assessment, various properties such as water content, sugar content,
    chlorophyll, carotenoid, soluble solids, acidity, and firmness need to be measured.
    Spectroscopy and spectral imagery are non-destructive and high-throughput methods
    that can be used to estimate these qualitative parameters (Atefi et al., 2021;
    Shao and He, 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Nishizawa et al., 2009; Penchaiya et al.,
    2009; Ecarnot et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2013; Dykes et al., 2014; Wang et al.,
    2015; Mancini et al., 2020). A robotic system can be utilized to monitor the dynamics
    of fruit attributes for hundreds of growing fruits per day. For instance, a portable
    spectrometer can be attached to the robot’s end-effector. The robot can detect
    the fruit on the plant, grasp it, and gather its spectral data to infer its quality
    parameters. This approach offers a high-throughput and non-destructive method
    for fruit quality assessment, enabling efficient monitoring of fruit development
    over time. In addition, imaging technology can also be used to assess the quality
    of flowers, providing insights into factors such as color, shape, and size, which
    are important for marketability and consumer appeal (Prunet and Duncan, 2020).
    Overall, imaging technology is proving to be a valuable tool in the floriculture
    industry, providing floriculturists with the ability to detect and treat plant
    diseases, optimize growth conditions, and improve the quality of their products.
    11 Computerized monitoring systems Computerized monitoring systems in agriculture
    are technology-driven systems that use sensors and automated data collection to
    track and monitor various aspects of crop production. These systems can provide
    farmers with real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, weather patterns, and
    other environmental factors, allowing them to make more informed decisions about
    irrigation, fertilization, and other inputs. Computerized monitoring systems can
    also be used to detect and respond to potential problems, such as pest infestations
    or disease outbreaks before they have a chance to cause significant damage. Overall,
    computerized monitoring systems are helping to improve the efficiency and productivity
    of agricultural operations, while also reducing waste and environmental impact.
    12 Data analytics Data analytics is playing an increasingly important role in
    agriculture, helping farmers to make more informed decisions and improve crop
    yields. Here are some of the key areas of data analytics in agriculture: Predictive
    analytics: Predictive analytics uses data analysis techniques to make predictions
    about future outcomes, such as crop yields or weather patterns. This information
    can help farmers to make more informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and
    other aspects of agricultural production (Lassoued et al., 2021). Precision agriculture:
    Precision agriculture involves using data analytics to optimize crop production
    by tailoring inputs such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides to specific areas
    of a field (Griffin et al., 2018; Akhter et al., 2021). This approach can improve
    crop yields while reducing waste and environmental impact. Remote sensing: Remote
    sensing involves using satellites, drones, and other technologies to collect data
    on crop health, soil moisture, and other environmental factors. This data can
    be used to identify areas of a field that require additional inputs or interventions.
    Data visualization tools can be used to display data in an easy-to-understand
    format, helping farmers to identify trends and make informed decisions (Kumar
    et al., 2019a; 2019b). For example, farmers can use data visualization tools to
    track weather patterns, crop yields, and other key metrics. Supply chain analytics:
    Supply chain analytics can be used to optimize the distribution and delivery of
    agricultural products, reducing waste and improving efficiency. Overall, data
    analytics is transforming agriculture by providing farmers with real-time data
    on crop health, weather patterns, and other environmental factors. By leveraging
    the power of data, farmers can make more informed decisions about planting, harvesting,
    and other aspects of agricultural production, contributing to a more sustainable
    and secure food supply. 13 Internet of things (IoT) The Internet of Things (IoT)
    is a new technology that allows devices to connect remotely to achieve smart farming
    (Patil and Kale, 2016). The IoT has begun to influence a vast range of industries,
    from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to enhance efficiency
    and performance across all markets (Elijah and Rahman, 2018; Sisinni et al., 2018;
    Shi et al., 2019). The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of connected devices
    and sensors that communicate and exchange data with each other. In the flower
    industry, IoT is being used to improve the efficiency of flower production and
    supply chain management. IoT sensors can be used to monitor environmental conditions
    such as temperature, humidity, and light levels, which are critical factors in
    flower growth and development. By collecting data on these factors, growers can
    optimize growing conditions to ensure the best quality and yield of flowers. For
    example, sensors can be used to adjust the temperature and humidity levels in
    a greenhouse to create the ideal environment for flower growth. IoT can also be
    used to monitor the health and growth of flowers. For instance, sensors can be
    placed on individual plants to measure their growth rate, nutrient uptake, and
    water consumption. This can help growers to identify any issues early on and take
    corrective measures before they become serious. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    enables the remote monitoring of plants and animals, retrieving information from
    mobile phones and other devices. Through the use of sensors and instruments, farmers
    can assess weather patterns and anticipate production levels. The IoT also plays
    a crucial role in water management, allowing for the monitoring and control of
    water flow, assessment of crops’ water requirements, and optimization of water
    usage, like never before (Yong et al., 2018). With sensors and cloud connectivity
    through the gateway, the status of the water supply can be remotely monitored
    based on soil and plant needs (Mekala et al., 2017). The benefits of IoT technology
    extend to correcting nutrient deficiencies, pests, and diseases, as farmers cannot
    manually monitor every plant. This technology has ushered farmers into a new era
    of modern agriculture (Mittal and Singh, 2007). In addition, IoT can be used to
    improve supply chain management by providing real-time data on the location and
    condition of flowers during transportation. IoT sensors can track the temperature,
    humidity, and other conditions during shipping and alert growers and distributors
    if there are any deviations from the ideal conditions. Overall, IoT has the potential
    to improve the efficiency and quality of flower production and supply chain management.
    By using IoT sensors and devices, growers and distributors can optimize growing
    conditions, reduce waste, and ensure the best quality and freshness of flowers
    for consumers. 14 Artificial intelligence (AI) Artificial intelligence (AI) is
    a broad term that refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically
    require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
    In the flower industry, AI is being used to improve flower production and quality,
    as well as to optimize supply chain management. One application of AI in flowers
    is to analyze and interpret data from sensors and cameras to optimize growing
    conditions. AI algorithms can be used to analyze large datasets of environmental
    and plant growth data to identify patterns and make predictions about the optimal
    conditions for growing different types of flowers (Figure 6). For example, AI
    algorithms can help growers optimize the amount of water, fertilizer, and light
    that flowers receive, which can improve yield and quality (Song and He, 2007;
    Eli-Chukwu, 2019; Vincent et al., 2019). Another application of AI in flowers
    is to improve disease detection and prevention (Adedoja et al., 2019). AI algorithms
    can be trained to recognize the symptoms of different plant diseases and to detect
    them early on. This can help growers take corrective measures before the disease
    spreads and affects the entire crop. AI can also be used to develop predictive
    models for disease outbreaks based on environmental and weather data. In addition,
    AI can be used to optimize supply chain management by analyzing data from sensors
    and cameras to monitor the condition and location of flowers during transportation
    (Figures 5, 6). AI algorithms can predict the best routes and transportation methods
    for delivering flowers while minimizing waste and reducing costs (Wang et al.,
    2017). Overall, AI has the potential to improve the efficiency, quality, and sustainability
    of flower production and supply chain management. By analyzing data and making
    predictions (Talaviya et al., 2020), AI can help growers optimize growing conditions,
    detect and prevent diseases, and improve supply chain logistics for delivering
    high-quality flowers to consumers. figure 6 FIGURE 6. AI-based monitoring wireless
    sensor network and IoT concept. 15 Machine learning (ML) Machine learning is a
    type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and
    improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. In the
    flower industry, machine learning is being used to improve flower production and
    quality, as well as to optimize supply chain management. One application of machine
    learning in flowers is to analyze and interpret data from sensors and cameras
    to optimize growing conditions (Benos et al., 2021). Machine learning algorithms
    can be used to analyze large datasets of environmental and plant growth data to
    identify patterns and make predictions about the optimal conditions for growing
    different types of flowers. For example, machine learning algorithms can help
    growers optimize the amount of water, fertilizer, and light that flowers receive,
    which can improve yield and quality (Sun et al., 2019; Virnodkar et al., 2020).
    Another application of machine learning in flowers is to improve disease detection
    and prevention. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize the symptoms
    of different plant diseases and to detect them early on. This can help growers
    take corrective measures before the disease spreads and affects the entire crop.
    Machine learning can also be used to develop predictive models for disease outbreaks
    based on environmental and weather data. In addition, machine learning can be
    used to optimize supply chain management by analyzing data from sensors and cameras
    to monitor the condition and location of flowers during transportation (Liakos
    et al., 2018; Zhang J. et al, 2021). Machine learning algorithms can predict the
    best routes and transportation methods for delivering flowers while minimizing
    waste and reducing costs. The integration of IoT, AI, and machine learning has
    significant potential to revolutionize flower production and supply chain management
    (Figure 7). IoT sensors and devices can help growers and distributors optimize
    growing conditions and reduce waste, while AI and machine learning can help them
    make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency, quality, and sustainability.
    For instance, the use of IoT sensors can monitor factors such as soil moisture,
    temperature, and light levels, helping growers create the ideal growing conditions
    for each flower variety. This can lead to increased yields, reduced water usage,
    and lower energy costs. Additionally, IoT devices can monitor the flowers’ post-harvest
    conditions, ensuring they are stored and transported at optimal temperatures to
    maintain their quality and freshness. The use of AI and machine learning can further
    enhance flower production and supply chain management. By analyzing vast amounts
    of data, AI can help growers make informed decisions on when to harvest their
    crops, reducing waste and increasing efficiency. AI can also predict and detect
    diseases early, allowing growers to take preventive measures and reduce the need
    for harmful pesticides. Furthermore, machine learning can help growers optimize
    their logistics and supply chain management, ensuring that flowers reach consumers
    quickly and efficiently. By analyzing historical data on demand and supply, machine
    learning can help growers forecast demand accurately, reducing overproduction
    and minimizing waste. In conclusion, the integration of IoT, AI, and machine learning
    can help flower growers and distributors to create a more efficient, sustainable,
    and high-quality supply chain. By leveraging these technologies, they can reduce
    waste, improve growing conditions, and deliver fresher, higher-quality flowers
    to consumers. This not only benefits the flower industry but also helps promote
    sustainability and environmental protection. figure 7 FIGURE 7. The Future of
    Ornamental industry: Unleashing the Potential of integrated IoT, AI, and Robotics.
    16 Radio frequency identification (RFID tags) RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
    technology is an automated identification system that uses radio waves to transfer
    data between a tag attached to an object and a reader. A Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID) tag functions as a barcode that can hold information (Kumar and Srivastava,
    2014). There are two main types of RFID tags: active and passive, with a variety
    of shapes and forms available for different applications (Fernandez, 2014). Passive
    tags can be made from paper, plastic, or vinyl (Want, 2006) and are designed to
    withstand continuous exposure to the elements, including water, heat, dirt, and
    chemicals, making them suitable for outdoor nursery production environments. Each
    RFID label has a unique identification code and can be encoded with important
    production information such as genus, species, cultivar, and planting dates. Passive
    RFID labels are relatively inexpensive, and as adoption increases, costs are expected
    to decrease due to economies of scale. These labels are read using a specific
    UHF radio frequency with an RFID interrogator. One of the advantages of RFID in
    agricultural operations is that it does not require a clean label, unlike barcodes
    which can be obscured by dirt or damage (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). RFID
    tags have been used for tagging and tracking animals and plants, health monitoring
    (Wang et al., 2006), identifying and tracking livestock, and monitoring irrigation
    system management (Floyd 2015; Deng et al. 2020). In the flower industry, RFID
    technology is used for tracking and tracing flowers from the field to the store,
    providing greater transparency and efficiency in the supply chain (Ampatzidis
    et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2005; Verdouw et al., 2013). One application of RFID
    in flowers is the tracking of individual flower stems from the time they are harvested
    to the time they are sold. Each stem can be tagged with an RFID tag, which contains
    information about the grower, variety, and other key details. As the flowers move
    through the supply chain, RFID readers can be used to track their location and
    monitor temperature and humidity levels, ensuring that the flowers are properly
    handled and stored (Luvisi et al., 2010). RFID tags are also used to monitor temperature
    and humidity during transport, ensuring that the flowers are kept in optimal conditions
    (Dose et al., 2021). RFID technology can also be used to improve inventory management
    and reduce waste in the flower industry. By tracking the movement of flowers in
    real-time, retailers can better manage their inventory levels, reducing the risk
    of overstocking or stockouts. This can help to reduce waste by ensuring that flowers
    are sold before they spoil or lose their freshness. Another application of RFID
    in flowers is the ability to provide consumers with information about the flowers
    they are purchasing. By scanning the RFID tag with a smartphone or other device,
    consumers can access information about the flower’s origin, growing conditions,
    and other details. This can help to build trust between consumers and growers
    and promote greater sustainability and transparency in the industry. Overall,
    RFID technology offers numerous benefits for the flower industry, including improved
    supply chain efficiency, better inventory management, and greater transparency
    for consumers. As RFID technology continues to evolve, its use in the flower industry
    will likely become even more widespread and impactful. 17 LED (Light Emitting
    Diode) LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology is revolutionizing the way flowers
    are grown by providing a more efficient and customizable light source for plants
    (Al Murad et al., 2021). LEDs are more energy-efficient than traditional light
    sources, and they can be tuned to specific wavelengths that optimize plant growth
    and flowering. One application of LEDs in flower cultivation is in the production
    of cut flowers. By using LEDs to provide the optimal light spectrum for flower
    growth, growers can achieve faster growth, increased flower size, and improved
    color and fragrance. This can help to increase yield and quality while reducing
    production costs, as LEDs use less energy than traditional lighting methods (Table
    3). Another application of LEDs in flowers is in the production of potted plants
    and indoor flowers (Mills-Ibibofori, et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2019). LEDs can
    be used to provide a specific light spectrum that promotes healthy growth, even
    in low-light environments. This can be particularly useful in urban areas or areas
    with limited access to natural light, where plants may struggle to thrive without
    artificial lighting. In addition, LEDs can be used to control the timing and quality
    of flower blooms (Paradiso and Proietti, 2022). By adjusting the light spectrum
    and duration, growers can induce flowers to bloom at specific times of the year
    or in response to certain environmental cues. This can be particularly useful
    for the production of holiday flowers, such as Cyclamen, chrysanthemums, poinsettias,
    gerberas, petunias, Easter lilies (Heo et al., 2003; Higuchi et al., 2012; Park
    et al., 2016; Mills-Ibibofori, et al., 2019). However, in general, studies investigating
    the effects of LED light on flower crops typically vary in terms of the specific
    flower species (Mills-Ibibofori et al., 2019) being studied, the type and intensity
    of the LED light used, the duration and timing of the light treatments, and the
    specific growth or developmental parameters being measured (Craig and Runkle,
    2013; Park and Runkle, 2016; Matysiak, 2021; Vendrame et al., 2022). These studies
    often aim to optimize plant growth and development, increase yield, improve flower
    quality and color, or reduce disease incidence (Cioc et al., 2022; Rashidi et
    al., 2023). Results can vary widely depending on these factors, and further research
    is needed to better understand the effects of LED lighting on flower crops under
    different growing conditions. Overall, LEDs offer numerous benefits for the flower
    industry, including improved growth and flowering, reduced energy costs, and greater
    control over bloom timing and quality. As LED technology continues to evolve,
    it is likely that its use in the flower industry will become even more widespread
    and impactful. table 3 TABLE 3. Some specific examples of effects of LEDs on some
    ornamental species. 18 Virtual flowers Virtual flowers refer to computer-generated
    images or animations of flowers that are created using software programs and displayed
    on electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, or virtual reality headsets.
    Virtual flowers can be used in a variety of ways, including as digital decorations
    for websites or social media posts, as 3D models for gaming or animation, and
    as virtual bouquets or gifts. Virtual flower gardens can also be created for educational
    or entertainment purposes, allowing users to explore and learn about different
    types of flowers in a virtual environment. One advantage of virtual flowers is
    that they can be created and shared easily and quickly, without the need for physical
    flowers or transportation. This can be particularly useful for events or occasions
    where flowers may be difficult to obtain or transport, such as in remote or urban
    areas. Virtual flowers also offer the opportunity for greater customization and
    personalization than traditional flowers. Users can choose from a wide range of
    flower types, colors, and arrangements to create a unique and personalized gift
    or message. Virtual flowers can also be easily modified or updated, allowing for
    changes in color or arrangement to suit different preferences or occasions. Overall,
    virtual flowers offer a fun and creative way to enjoy the beauty of flowers in
    a digital environment. While they cannot replace the physical experience of receiving
    or giving real flowers, they offer a unique and convenient alternative for those
    who may not have access to physical flowers or who want to explore the creative
    possibilities of digital technology. 19 Advances in landscaping technology Advances

    has experienced noteworthy benefits due to the ongoing advancement of technology,
    including enhanced efficacy in production procedures, superior flower quality,
    and increased profitability. As the floral sector experiences further development
    and expansion, the imperative for sustainable and ethical methodologies becomes
    increasingly pressing. The overuse of pesticides and fertilisers in flower cultivation
    is a significant ecological issue that can result in detrimental consequences
    for the environment and the wellbeing of labourers engaged in the production process.
    The implementation of precision agriculture methodologies, which entail the utilisation
    of sensors and data analytics, can potentially mitigate the excessive application
    of chemicals by furnishing precise insights regarding soil quality, pest invasions,
    and crop nourishment necessities. In addition, the adoption of biodegradable packaging
    materials and the integration of energy-efficient systems within the flower production
    sector can substantially mitigate the industry’s carbon emissions. The attainment
    of this objective can be realised by embracing sustainable energy alternatives,
    such as solar or wind energy, and integrating circular economy tenets, which involve
    the recycling or repurposing of waste materials. One additional ethical issue
    prevalent in the flower industry pertains to the potential exploitation of labour
    in developing nations, which serve as the primary location for flower cultivation.
    In order to tackle this matter, it is possible to implement fair trade practises
    and certifications, which can guarantee that labourers are remunerated equitably,
    provided with secure working environments, and granted access to educational and
    healthcare resources. Moreover, the utilisation of technology can facilitate the
    advancement of social and economic growth within regional communities by creating
    novel employment prospects and fostering entrepreneurial activities. The utilisation
    of e-commerce platforms has the potential to establish a direct connection between
    consumers and small-scale flower growers, thereby obviating the requirement for
    intermediaries and augmenting the profit margins of the growers. To conclude,
    the flower industry must prioritise sustainability, ethical practices, and social
    responsibility in the development and implementation of novel technologies. By
    endorsing these principles, the floral industry can sustain its growth and satisfy
    the increasing need for aesthetically pleasing and significant flowers, all while
    making a positive impact on both the environment and society. Author contributions

    Palavras-chave: agricultura de precisão; gestão da água; economia de água; tecnologias
    na irrigação INTRODUCTION: Precision agriculture currently plays a significant
    role in the spatial and temporal management of the inputs involved in agricultural
    production. This science focused on the optimization of water resources in irrigated
    areas is called precision irrigation (PI), whose objective is to develop appropriate
    technologies to increase water productivity in irrigated agriculture through the
    application of water in precise and accurate amounts at the right time, according
    to the spatial and temporal variability of the irrigated areas (ABIOYE et al.,
    2020 ; BWAMBALE et al., 2023 ; ABAGALE & ANORNU, 2023; CAPRARO et al., 2018 ).
    In addition, considering irrigation management, this is elaborated, according
    to soil, plant and climate information, which generate a large volume of data
    to be transformed into prescription maps of irrigation depths, based on the variability
    of soil attributes, landscape features and growing conditions (STONE et al., 2015
    ). In view of this, precision irrigation has tools capable of identifying contrasting
    spatial differences in an agricultural production area and establishing personalized
    management in a rational way in the field (CASANOVA et al., 2014 ; CORWIN, 2013;
    PAN et al., 2013 ). The technologies being used, including in an integrated way,
    are as follows: automatic weather stations, remote sensing, global positioning
    system (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS) (BARKER et al., 2018 ; GIOTTO
    et al., 2016; MENDES et al., 2019 ; MILLER et al., 2017 ; NEUPANE & GUO, 2019
    ), multispectral cameras, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (GAGO et al., 2015 ;
    MATESE & DI GENNARO, 2018 ), network of wireless sensors (WSN) (IBRAHIM et al.,
    2015 ), software (GOLDSTEIN et al., 2017 ; MCCARTHY et al., 2014 ), and plant
    growth and water flow simulation models (LIAKOS et al., 2019 ; LOZOYA et al.,
    2016 ; OLDONI & BASSOI, 2016 ; PEREA et al., 2017 ). Therefore, in this review,
    we focused on strategies, methods, new technologies and trends that are available
    to farmers and professionals in the context of precision irrigation with a focus
    on optimizing water use. Precision irrigation technologies and trends Soil moisture
    sensors in agriculture Irrigation management via soil moisture sensors has recently
    undergone several commercial innovations, many of which have been introduced by
    technology companies and independent research groups around the world (FERRAREZI
    et al., 2020 ). Many of these innovations are due to a significant decrease in
    the prices of monitoring equipment and data storage in digital agriculture. TIGLAO
    et al. (2020 ), who used a system of wireless sensors that cost half the price
    of commercial systems, achieved savings of 81% in water consumption applied in
    irrigation management. Although, the accessibility of sensors has increased in
    recent years, their operation still has the same fundamentals based on physical,
    chemical and mechanical methods for the determination of information of interest,
    which can be obtained electrically, electromagnetically, optically, radiometrically,
    mechanically, acoustically, pneumatically or electrochemically, with the methods
    of electrical resistance (Boyoucus), tensiometry, neutron moderation and time
    domain reflectometry (TDR) being the most used to estimate the amount of water
    available in the soil (ZINKERNAGEL et al., 2020 ). The most common and simple
    sensors that use indirect (non-destructive) methods to measure soil moisture are
    resistive sensors that work by monitoring the variation in electrical resistance
    between two electrodes embedded in the soil. Advantages of their use include low
    acquisition cost, simple sensor operation and easy availability in the market;
    as a disadvantage, they do not have high accuracy in soil moisture readings. Models
    such as FC-28 and SEN0114 are found on the market. The other sensors are capacitive,
    such as the SHT10 and EC-5 models; they work by measuring the dielectric constant
    of the soil by the time elapsed after emitting an electromagnetic pulse generated
    by metal rods embedded in the soil. These sensors have the advantage of high accuracy
    in readings; however, due to the construction of their sophisticated and expensive
    electronic components, their acquisition costs can be high (GASCH et al., 2017
    ; GOMES et al., 2017 ; MATOS et al., 2017 ). Other models found on the market
    include Decagon 10HS, Meter TEROS-12 (also measures temperature and electrical
    conductivity), Sentek Drill & Drop (measuring moisture, temperature and salinity
    every 10 cm) and Watermark 200SS (measures the tension of water held in the soil
    in kPa). Due to the wide variety of methods for obtaining data and the very nature
    of construction of humidity sensors, a series of usage characteristics and recommendations
    for each field condition can be specified in each specific situation ZINKERNAGEL
    et al. (2020 ). One of the biggest advantages of using soil moisture sensors is
    linked to irrigation management, since monitoring the amount of water in the soil
    is a direct indication of the irrigation needs of an agricultural area (HAMAMI
    & NASSEREDDINE, 2020 ).This applicability can be observed in research carried
    out by O’SHAUGHNESSY et al. (2020 ) in the state of Texas, USA, studying the productivity
    of Sorgum bicolor L., in which the productivity of irrigation water was quantified
    based on three different management methodologies, via plant-based thermal patterns,
    via soil-based neutron probe measurements, and a hybrid method combining plant
    and soil monitoring over a period of three consecutive years. The researchers
    reported that in the periods of joint use of monitoring methods (hybrid method),
    there was a consistent increase in the accumulation of biomass, resulting in both
    productivity gains per unit of area and water savings. EL-NAGGAR et al. (2020
    ), in an experiment in New Zealand with bean and pea crops under two irrigation
    management methods, via climatological water balance and via capacitive soil moisture
    sensors (FDR) coupled with radiofrequency data transmission systems (IoT), observed
    a difference in the volume of water applied and at the beginning of irrigation
    operations, resulting in savings between 27-44% of the volume of water used in
    areas managed with soil moisture sensors. This result was attributed to the imprecision
    of the balance methodology of water in predicting the effects of poor soil drainage,
    especially resulting from the presence of a physical impediment in the soil profile,
    which underestimates the real volume of water available to the plants. In addition
    to monitoring, the use of sensors also encompasses the use of automation in irrigation
    systems, as can be seen in a study carried out by CONESA et al. (2021 ), where
    the use of an automatic irrigation system based on capacitance sensors (FDR) showed
    better results in the efficiency of water use, resulting in a decrease in the
    irrigation depth compared to methods based on monitoring the evapotranspiration
    of the water reference (ETo) and in the use of crop coefficients (Kc) in the literature.
    JAISWAL & BALLAL (2020 ) used an automatic system based on soil and climate sensors
    operating with fuzzy logic to control the flow of the irrigation system, achieving
    a smaller volume of water between 45% and 30%, respectively, as well as lower
    irrigation costs, when compared to the flood irrigation system. According to DOMÍNGUEZ-NIÑO
    et al. (2020 ), the use of sensors in agriculture also allows a better understanding
    of the real situation of humidity in different areas with plants in different
    stages of growth, since monitoring via sensors takes place directly at the place
    of interest and not in a generalized way, such as in climate monitoring, which
    often considers irrigation sites based on a single stage of plant growth. The
    automation of irrigation systems based on soil sensors associated with the use
    of IoT technologies can be observed in the research of BARKUNAN et al. (2019 )
    in which the soil moisture and climate monitoring sensors were connected through
    a microcontroller capable of sending messages to the operator’s smartphone, providing
    information on the soil moisture conditions and the beginning of the irrigation
    period. This is possible through the use of wireless communication devices that
    allow data transfer between applications without cables. The use of a wireless
    sensor network is very important in precision irrigation because, according to
    irrigation management, extension of the area to be irrigated and producer preferences,
    it is necessary to use spatially distributed sensor mesh to attend to data collection
    remotely from several irrigated sectors, for example. Cabe points out that the
    choice of type of wireless device must consider the range of the device. For example,
    a Bluetooth device, model HC-06, with an SPP usage profile (Serial Port Profile),
    has a maximum distance of 10 m between connected devices, with a point-to-point
    connection. Another model, the XBee XB24-Z7WIT-004, of ZigBee specification, uses
    radiofrequency signals for communication and low operating power, with a range
    limit of about 100 m, which allows point-to-point and multipoint connections,
    making it possible to form a mesh network of wireless devices. Challenges in the
    application of sensors for soil moisture monitoring One of the challenges for
    using FDR or TDR sensors in soil water monitoring is the relationship between
    factory calibration and sensor installation orientation in the soil profile (vertical
    or horizontal), which can cause systematic variations in the humidity readings.
    This effect was observed by CHEN et al. (2019a ),who when comparing a capacity
    sensor and three TDR sensors in three positions on the ground, observed a significant
    variation in the readings of water content in the soil under irrigation, concluding
    that, in general, for sensors with factory calibration, the vertical orientation
    presents greater precision when compared to horizontal orientation, attributing
    this phenomenon to the greater disruption in the soil that the installation in
    the horizontal position of the sensor causes at the time of installation of the
    sensor. They suggested that irrigators should follow the positioning that manufacturers
    recommend for their equipment. However, SHARMA et al. (2017 ) pointed out that,
    not infrequently, the calibration of sensors provided by manufacturers can overestimate
    the volume of water in the soil and that, although they may be suitable for soils
    of similar texture, they often do not consider factors such as type, amount of
    organic matter and apparent density of the soil, which influence the dielectric
    properties, making a local calibration necessary for better accuracy in the readings.
    For the positioning of sensors in soil layers of different textures, KARGAS &
    SOULIS (2019 ) observed interesting results, concluding that for the correct management
    of irrigation in productive areas, it is necessary to use a different sensor for
    each soil layer or a single sensor installed in the middle portion of the root
    system that is in contact with both layers simultaneously. SILVA et al. (2018
    ), in a study on banana, observed that the ideal positioning of the sensors may
    not be constant throughout the development of the plant; that is, the most representative
    position for the sensor to read the soil moisture may vary along with the phenological
    stage of the plant. Other factors such as salinity, soil textural class and temperature
    where the sensor is installed can also affect the accuracy of soil moisture monitoring,
    which may limit the use of these sensors in areas with higher temperatures, such
    as semi-arid and arid regions, or the use of reused water in irrigation (CARDENAS-LAILHACAR
    & DUKES, 2015 ; INCROCCI et al., 2019 ; OATES et al., 2017 ). Naturally, the use
    of soil moisture sensors in agriculture results in a large amount of data for
    analysis. It is possible to observe a growing trend in researches that use data
    science techniques to interpret the readings of these sensors based on artificial
    intelligence techniques. Researches such as the one by GOLDSTEIN et al. (2017
    ) trained several machine learning algorithms in the interpretation of a series
    of climatic and soil data to propose assertive recommendations for the management
    of irrigation in the field based on data storage in cloud computing. Using more
    robust computational techniques, such as “neural networks” it is possible to employ
    a network of sensors for the precise determination of soil moisture, resulting
    not only in more homogeneous irrigation in the areas but also in water and electrical
    energy savings through the best use of the pumping system (DURSUN & ÖZDEN, 2016
    ). The use of mobile sensor systems, together with graphical software, to better
    understand the determination and monitoring of soil moisture distribution; although,
    in smaller quantities, also expands the options for new research areas and future
    applications at the field level (SHAN et al., 2019 ). Finally, the development
    of the following new types of sensors demonstrate industrial innovations to be
    used in future research: mm-sized soil moisture sensors (ZHOU et al., 2019 ),
    which have the ability to perform better monitoring of water distribution in the
    soil profile; perforated coaxial cylinder (CHEN et al., 2019c ), capable of monitoring
    both soil water volume and temperature; thick film conductivity sensors (SOPHOCLEOUS
    et al., 2020 ), capable of monitoring changes in soil structure through changes
    in conductivity and soil water content; and a Fiber Bragg Grating sensor (ZHANG
    et al., 2019 ), developed for monitoring water pressure in the field. Use of satellites
    and spectral sensors for precision irrigation Advances in spectroscopy have allowed
    the execution of specific analyses of different types of materials in a non-destructive
    and fast way, revealing valuable information through the energy reflection of
    the targets (LILLESAND & KIEFER, 1994). Spectral sensor technology has been used
    to efficiently generate information on a large time-space scale. Data collected
    in the field with point equipment can be, in some cases, more accurate, while
    cost, speed and practicality are advantages of spectral sensors coupled to satellites
    or UAVs to capture information spatially distributed over large areas. The remote
    data analyzed allow considerations about photosynthesis, physiological disturbances,
    phenology and water interactions in real time, which are fundamental for water
    planning and management (KARTHIKEYAN et al., 2020 ). Satellites and sensors There
    are currently several satellites in operation that perform this type of work remotely:
    MODIS, Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A. The great acceptance of this technology
    is because they are free products, with good spatiotemporal resolution and radiometric
    quality and with ease of data integration with APIs. The data generated by satellites
    can be useful in several applications at the irrigation level. VANINO et al. (2018
    ) combined meteorological data with data captured by the sensors of the Sentinel
    2A satellite to estimate the leaf area index and surface albedo to use this information
    to calculate the evapotranspiration of tomato crops and validate it through comparison
    with evapotranspiration data obtained by the soil-water balance. The results of
    this research showed the satisfactory suitability of the Sentinel 2A satellite
    to determine water demand. SHADMAN et al. (2017) used thermal band data from the
    Landsat 8 satellite to estimate water stress in sugarcane plants through the crop
    water stress index (CWSI). According to the author, the data capacity of the satellite
    sensors was positive and sufficient to carry out monitoring via remote sensing
    of the water stress of sugarcane without the need for auxiliary soil data. MARINO
    et al. (2014 ) evaluated spectral differences in tomato leaves located in 3 irrigated
    regions, classifying them as high (H), medium (M) and low (L) in terms of water
    use and efficiency; NETO et al. (2017 ) evaluated the spectral reflectance in
    the visible (VIS) and near-infrared region (NIR) of sunflower leaves in water
    deficit to obtain models capable of estimating the status of water and chlorophyll.
    CHEMURA et al. (2017 ) used information from VIS and NIR to create a machine learning
    model using the random forest algorithm to predict the water content in the plant
    in the coffee crop. All studies were conclusive and showed variations in spectral
    identity in relation to variations in water content in plants. In precision irrigation,
    indices generated from orbital satellites have been mainly used to: (a) monitor
    irrigation systems in macro-regions; (b) adapt local crop coefficients for a better
    calculation of plant evapotranspiration; and (c) estimate vegetative metrics such
    as plant density, coverage fraction (fc) and leaf area index (FRENCH et al., 2020
    ). According to CHEN et al. (2018 ), many studies focus only on mapping the extent
    of irrigated areas without considering important information that could also be
    extracted with the use of remote sensing, such as the amount of water with drawn
    from the system and the frequency and time of irrigation. Different levels of
    decision can be used in irrigated macro-regions using satellite systems, since
    it is possible to track the temporal growth of crops, deriving this information
    in basal coefficients that allow a better estimate of regional evapotranspiration.
    Thus, GONZÁLEZ-DUGO et al. (2013 ) developed a methodology called MINARET (monitoring
    irrigated agriculture ET), which uses Landsat data capable of constantly monitoring
    the water consumption of different irrigated crops. MASELLI et al. (2020 ) used
    meteorological data together with Sentinel 2A data to estimate evapotranspiration
    in monitoring irrigated areas in the Italian semi-arid region. Obtaining evapotranspiration
    values with greater precision is a fundamental factor, as it is a key parameter
    in the water and energy balance equation. FAO bulletin 56 states that crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) can be calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
    and a specific crop coefficient (Kc) (ALLEN et al., 1998). Although, the coefficients
    provided by the FAO are general, throughout the growing season, there are variations
    in crop characteristics, so the parameter is intrinsically linked to species,
    variety, plant population density, phenology, water availability, climate and
    other factors. Therefore, a standard Kc may not well represent some localities,
    causing less reliable estimates and directly impacting good water use (MOKHTARIA
    et al., 2018 ). In recent years, several works have contributed to more accurate
    irrigation, developing methods to estimate Kc or Kcb (basal crop coefficient)
    and considering vegetation indices, which are considered great phenological thermometers,
    called Kc-VI (ALAM et al., 2018 ; CAMPOS et al., 2017 ). Still, more recently,
    PEREIRA et al. (2021 ) published a newsletter (Updates and forward to the FAO56
    crop water requirements method - Case studies using ground and remote sensing
    data; applications to update and upgrade the FAO56 method) with updates of these
    coefficients through a collection of several studies, with the use of new tools,
    such as remote sensing and IoT, which bring more precision to the calculation
    of the water needs of crops, which are important advances for precision irrigation.
    FRENCH et al. (2020 ), using data from Landsat and Sentinel mission satellites,
    determined a Kc-VI used to calculate wheat evapotranspiration. The experiment
    was carried out in the American southwest, and it was concluded that the best
    values of Kc and ETc were obtained in the middle of the season until the end of
    senescence, while at a time point sooner than 60 days after planting, a high and
    overestimated ETc was observed due to the low coverage canopy at the time, which
    contributed to the low reflectivity of the plants. Electromagnetic approach applied
    to the determination of the spatial variability of the water status of plants
    in the field based on UAVs Four components must be considered before selecting
    the appropriate UAV for IP (GAGO et al., 2015 ): experimental design, type of
    data to be obtained, data acquisition, and data processing and results. In addition
    to UAVs, sensors are essential for the quality of the images obtained. Decision-making
    regarding the type of camera to be used depends directly on the project objective.
    The cameras embedded in UAVs most used in the IP concept aiming intelligent management
    of water are thermal, multispectral, hyperspectral, RGB and near infrared (NIR)
    cameras. To monitor biotic and abiotic stress, thermal (1 band) and hyperspectral
    (100-250 bands) cameras are recommended, while multispectral (6-12 bands) and
    RGB cameras (3 bands) are indicated for growth and biomass assessment (ADÃO et
    al., 2017 ). High-resolution RGB cameras are traditionally used in agroforestry
    applications; however, they lack the precision and spectral range to trace the
    material characteristics that hyperspectral and multispectral cameras can provide.
    SUSIČ et al. (2018 ) demonstrated the potential of using hyperspectral images
    ranging from 400 to 2500 nm to assess the water deficit status in tomato plants.
    ZARCO-TEJADA et al. (2012 ) used UAV-based hyperspectral and thermal cameras to
    assess water stress levels in citrus crops and confirmed a link between PRI and
    canopy temperature. Recently, LOGGENBERG et al. (2018 ) used hyperspectral technology
    combined with machine learning to discriminate between water-stressed and non-stressed
    vines. Hyperspectral imaging cameras generally capture more detail in spatial
    and spectral ranges compared to other cameras. LOGGENBERG et al. (2018 ) observed
    that the main limiting factor in the application of hyperspectral data is the
    inherent issue of dimensionality, which results in reduced precision. In addition,
    hyperspectral cameras are very expensive and complex (ELVANIDI et al., 2018 ),
    which limits their expeditious and wide application, especially in commercial
    agriculture. Multispectral cameras are composed of multiple sensors with high-quality
    filters that can simultaneously capture images using different wave frequencies.
    They can record both the light spectrum that is visible to the human eye and the
    non-visible spectrum; thus, these cameras allow for much more accurate measurements
    of plant health and phenological status than conventional cameras (RGB) (KHANAL
    et al., 2017 ). Multispectral and hyperspectral cameras do not have a resolution
    comparable to traditional RGB cameras, which causes some initial frustration for
    users new to the spectral area accustomed to traditional high-resolution images.
    The resolution of RGB cameras is in the range of 20-120 MB, while multispectral
    and hyperspectral cameras have a resolution between 0.2-3 MB. According to POBLETE
    et al. (2017 ), plant water status is not accurately predicted using multispectral
    imaging between the 500 and 800 nm spectral bands due to the lack of sensitivity
    to water content; however, wavelengths greater than 800 nm are best for this purpose.
    RALLO et al. (2014 ) observed that satisfactory estimation of leaf water potential
    at leaf and canopy levels can be obtained using vegetation indices based on the
    NIR shortwave infrared domain, with specific optimization of the “central bands.”
    Recently, some researchers have developed artificial neural network (ANN) models
    derived from multispectral images to predict the spatial variability of water
    potential in agricultural crops. ROMERO et al. (2018 ) classified the water status
    of the vine based on 10 vegetation indices (VI) using bands of Red, Green, Red-Edge,
    and NIR wavelengths and found that there were no significant relationships between
    individual VIs, with values of correlation lower than 0.3 for almost all the studied
    indices. There is a very specific spectral band called RedEdge, which lies between
    red and infrared, has excellent correlation with chlorophyll fluorescence and
    effectively differentiates between healthy and senescent vegetation (MATESE &
    DI GENNARO, 2018 ). There is already a range of specific multispectral cameras
    for use embedded in UAVs (MATESE & DI GENNARO, 2018). Among them, Tetracam, Airinov
    and Micasense camera manufacturers can be highlighted. Tetracam’s modular cameras
    can be mounted in different arrangements, depending on which bands you want to
    capture and which bandwidths. Airinov’sagro Sensor has 4 bands and has been used
    by the famous eBee AG, the version of the fixed-wing UAV for agricultural applications
    in Switzerland Sensefly (MATESE & DI GENNARO, 2018 ). The American Micasense manufactures
    the RedEdge sensor, a multispectral camera that simultaneously captures 5 different
    narrow-width bands and a more recent dual camera that captures 10 spectral bands.
    In addition to the RGB bands of the visible spectrum, the camera also captures
    the NIR in the non-visible spectrum and the RedEdge, a spectral band that is positioned
    exactly on the threshold between the visible and the non-visible. In addition
    to increasing the sensitivity of certain indices, it is with this spectral band
    that certain diseases and crop pests can be identified (DEVIA et al., 2019 ).
    DEVIA et al. (2019 ) studied biomass production in rice crops using multispectral
    imaging. The authors presented a method for biomass estimation using near-infrared
    (NIR) images captured at different crop scales. The approach estimated the biomass
    of large areas of the crop with an average correlation of 0.76 in relation to
    the traditional manual destructive method. KITIĆ et al. (2019 ) proposed a low-cost
    portable active multispectral optical device for accurate detection of plant stress
    and to perform field mapping called Plant-O-Meter. The device has an integrated
    multispectral source that comprises light in four more indicative wavelengths
    (850, 630, 535 and 465 nm) and allows the simultaneous illumination of the entire
    plant. Sequential illumination and detection provide fast reflectance measurements,
    which are transmitted by wireless to Android-powered devices for data processing
    and storage. The device was tested under laboratory conditions by comparing Plant-O-Meter
    measurements with imaging results from a SPECIM hyperspectral camera and a GreenSeeker
    handheld device under field conditions. The comparison revealed comparable performance,
    showing a strong correlation in both the hyperspectral (R2 = 0.997) and portable
    GreenSeeker (R2 = 0.954) from the laboratory measurements and R2 = 0.886 for the
    field experiments), indicating that the device exhibited strong potential for
    accurate stress measurements. The scientific articles reviewed in this research,
    referring to the use of different spectral technologies in agriculture, indicate
    the types of multispectral and thermal cameras used by the scientific community
    for the rapid detection of water stress in culture. Artificial intelligence in
    precision agriculture Due to climatic uncertainties, the growing demand for food
    and the rapid expansion of the population, the agricultural sector is increasingly
    dependent on the use of new technologies to obtain higher yields in a sustainable
    way with each harvest. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly
    developing applications in agriculture aiming productivity gains in a precise
    and effective way, avoiding the waste of resources (SHAIKH et al., 2022 ). In
    recent decades, researchers have strived to allow computers to extract enough
    information from raw data to model the real world. To achieve this, many have
    turned to machine learning algorithms to capture a large amount of information
    and automatically discover the representations needed to detect or classify input
    patterns and solve the various problems and needs of the agricultural sector (KHALIL
    & ABDULLAEV, 2021 ). Machine learning algorithms are computation models with particular
    properties such as learning, generalizing, grouping or organizing data. They consist
    of distributed structures formed by a large number of very simplified processing
    units connected to each other. Intelligent behavior occurs through the interactions
    of the neural network processing units (CANZIANI et al., 2016 ). The first neural
    networks to achieve widespread repercussions were based on unsupervised pre-training.
    However, it was the rediscovery of convolutional neural networks (CNN) (LECUN
    et al., 1998 ) that made this topic one of the main topics in machine learning,
    parallel processing technologies in GPUs (Graphal Processor Unit) and large databases
    that allowed these networks to be used fully. With the good performance being
    demonstrated by such models, other areas of knowledge besides the area of computing
    have been using these models for different purposes, as in the area of agricultural
    sciences since the 1990s with the pioneering work of MCQUEEN et al. (1995 ), in
    which the authors investigated the use of machine learning techniques existing
    at the time for some problems in agriculture and horticulture and presented a
    case study to infer management rules for some invasive plants. Recent research
    has used PCN-type networks (pulse-coupled networks) for the separation of wheat
    grains and to evaluate the physical characteristics of the soil and the growth
    of the cultures, concluding after field experiments that the developed model assisted
    in choosing the crop that best suited the evaluated soil (SHAIKH et al., 2022
    ). Works that involve not only agronomic data but also other technologies, such
    as satellite images, have been developed, such as the classification of management
    areas using satellite images (KHALIL & ABDULLAEV, 2021 ). In the context of the
    use of neural networks for agriculture and with the advent of cheaper computing
    resources combined with the new sensors that are being developed, proposals that
    increasingly use cutting-edge technological resources are noted (SOBAYO et al.,
    2018 ). As a tool to aid strategic decision making, smart agriculture has emerged
    as a new scientific area that employs, among other technologies, machine learning
    algorithms to assess and monitor the conditions of growing areas, such as soil
    and weather conditions, leading to more accurate results (LIAKOS et al., 2018
    ). BACHOUR et al. (2015 ) used a methodology that combines wavelet mult-iresolution
    analysis with the MVRVM algorithm (multivariate relevance vector machine) to predict
    16 days of ETo. More recently, deep learning (DL) is a machine learning technique
    that has shown good results in solving agricultural problems. KAMILARIS & PRENAFETA-BOLDÚ
    (2018 ) presented a review of 40 relevant studies in the area and found that,
    in addition to improvements in the performance of classification/prediction problems,
    DL also reduced resource engineering in many of the works. For crop management,
    for example, yield predictions can be made from satellite images, as presented
    by KHALIL & ABDULLAEV (2021 ). In this research, the authors concluded that it
    is possible to predict wheat yield from image processing with supervised Kohonen
    networks. Another beneficial activity is pest and disease control, where the spraying
    of pesticides is now directed only to the affected plants, reducing financial
    and environmental costs (JIAO et al., 2022 ). In water and soil management, important
    practices have been developed not only to increase crop productivity but also
    to use these resources efficiently. PATIL & DEKA (2016 ) used the extreme learning
    algorithm to estimate the weekly evapotranspiration of a crop in India. In soil
    management, GU et al. (2021 ) presented a new method for estimating soil moisture
    based on ANN models. ANN shave also been the subject of scientific investigations
    in the field of irrigation engineering to estimate the localized pressure drop
    caused by connectors and special parts present in irrigation systems. According
    to ELNESR & ALAZBA (2017 ), the use of neural networks presents a powerful tool
    for estimating the load loss caused by initial connectors when compared to the
    use of empirical models. KADHEM et al. (2017 ) used a neural network to predict
    wind speed data with chronological and seasonal characteristics. The authors concluded
    that the neural network was able to portray variations in wind speed with good
    performance during the different seasons of the year. LIU et al. (2018 ) developed
    a wind speed prediction model based on WPD (wavelet packet decomposition), CNN
    (convolutional neural network) and CNNLSTM (convolutional long short-term memory
    network). To verify the prediction performance of the proposed model, it was compared
    with 8 neural models widely used by the scientific community. The authors concluded
    that the proposed model is robust and effective in predicting wind speed time
    series. Definition of management zones in precision irrigation One way to manage
    physical, chemical and/or biological variations within a growing area is through
    the delineation of management zones (ZM). Management zones are sub-areas within
    a cultivation area that have similar characteristics but differ to a certain degree
    from the others in such a way that a particular agronomic management is justified
    to be adopted in each of them (KITCHEN et al., 2005 ). For management zones to
    be determined, it is necessary to obtain data from the area of interest, which
    can be of various types, such as crop productivity, soil physical and chemical
    properties, topography, vegetation indices, and aerial images. From these individual
    or combined data, thematic maps are created, and this spatial information is then
    interpreted. In this context, BAZZI et al. (2018 ) used soil property data to
    define management zones, such as soil texture and apparent electrical conductivity.
    YAO et al. (2014 ) used soil physicochemical properties and crop yield data and
    determined management zones. Generally, irrigation is carried out uniformly in
    a cultivated area, regardless of the spatial characteristics of that area. In
    the field, the water content in the soil is not homogeneous due to its spatial
    variability, which ranges from crop development, difference in relief and variation
    of soil hydraulic properties and rainfall distribution. Thus, the proper use of
    irrigation in each management zone reduces the volume of water used in the irrigation
    system, as there is an increase in efficiency that provides growth in productivity,
    reducing nutrient leaching and water waste. Management zones are used to optimize
    irrigated areas, where a heterogeneous area is separated into homogeneous zones
    and irrigation management will be the same in these regions (LIANG et al., 2016
    ; PEREA et al., 2017 ). For XIANG et al. (2007 ), cluster analyses and empirical
    analyses are the categories in which most of the methods used to define management
    zones are inserted. Since the empirical methods are simpler, based on specialized
    knowledge and on the distribution of productivity in the production areas, in
    this way, it is possible to divide a heterogeneous area into homogeneous sub-areas.
    However, cluster analysis is a more complex, less subjective method that uses
    multiple variables during the establishment of management zones. In cluster analysis
    methods, data points in a cropping area are divided into different classes, where
    the similarities between the points are evaluated to define the classes, and with
    that, the management zones are defined (GAVIOLI et al., 2019 ; LI et al., 2007).
    To define management zones, several factors and data are often used; in this case,
    a multivariate analysis was used to define the zones. OLDONI et al. (2019 ) also
    used geostatistical and multivariate analyses to determine management zones in
    a peach orchard, with a clustering approach on both soil (soil texture, water
    content, organic matter content) and plant (amount of fruit per tree, average
    fruit weight, total soluble solute content) for differentiated management. Another
    form of multivariate geospatial analysis is kriging factor analysis, a data interpolation
    method that identifies variability and was used in the study by BEVINGTON et al.
    (2019 ), where soil properties and hydraulic parameters were measured to define
    management zones using kriging factor analysis and the fuzzy-c means algorithm.
    CHEN et al. (2019b ) used an RGB camera attached to a UAV to determine the plant
    cover and vigor of the peanut and cotton canopy through the green-red vegetation
    index to determine management zones in Italy, used as indicators of irrigation
    uniformity, which they also served as an indication for the application of variable
    rate irrigation (VRI) in a pivot system. In the research by SCHENATTO et al. (2017
    ), management zones were also created using the fuzzy-c means algorithm, focusing
    on soil characteristics, such as elevation, slope, density, organic matter, clay
    and sand contents, and plant attributes, such as yield. In the study by ANASTASIOU
    et al. (2019 ), multivariate geostatistical techniques were also used to unite
    the multitemporal data from a multiband radiometer and a geophysical sensor and
    thus delimit the management zones of a vineyard, considering the electrical conductivity
    of the soil and canopy area. OHANA-LEVI et al. (2019 ) used a weighted multivariate
    spatial clustering model to determine irrigation management zones in a vineyard.
    Management zones were determined using a multivariate k-means cluster, and machine
    learning and spatial statistics were also used to analyze the variables, which
    comprised soil properties, terrain characteristics and environmental impact. Another
    tool used to collect data and define management zones is the proximal sensing
    of the soil, based on electromagnetic induction techniques, radiometry and fluorimetry
    (CASTANEDO, 2013 ). In the research by CASTRIGNANÒ et al. (2017 ), proximal and
    remote sensors were used in a tomato growing area, and there was integration with
    multivariate geostatistical data to define management zones based on the electrical
    conductivity of the soil, which was measured at different frequencies, sensor
    polarizations and depths. Likewise, MOUAZEN et al. (2014 ) used a soil sensor
    to measure electrical conductivity, soil water holding capacity, available water,
    organic matter, density, clay content and organic carbon, establishing a multi-sensor
    and data fusion approach to delineating management zones for site-specific irrigation,
    best addressed in section 1 of this review. To define management zones, low-cost
    remote sensing data are viable options (section 2 of this review), where spatiotemporal
    information on the biological and physical parameters of vegetation are used (FONTANET
    et al., 2018 ). FONTANET et al. (2020) used remote sensing to define management
    zones in a corn planting area, analyzing normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI) time series by remote sensing, soil moisture sensors, and root zone simulation
    predictions. GOBBO et al. (2019 ) also used NDVI in defining management zones
    in corn plantations and combined it with soil texture data to create irrigation
    management zones. In the research by GEORGI et al. (2017 ), remote sensing was
    used together with an automatic delineation algorithm. An automatic segmentation
    algorithm was developed using multispectral satellite data, which is a cheaper
    method for defining management zones. We emphasized that the creation of management
    zones for irrigation is not strictly associated with the application of water
    at a varied rate but rather in specific fields or areas and not exclusively on
    a lateral line of an irrigation system. The creation of these zones can help in
    the sizing of localized irrigation systems, enabling the differentiation of water
    needs by sector, such as ZM, which differs from SS-VRI (site-specific variable
    rate sprinkler). Another point to consider is the limitations of the use of remote
    sensing to create ZM. FONTANET et al. (2020 ) suggested the integration of spatial
    and temporal information, since there are soil and/or plant attributes with spatial
    differences that also change over time; that is, they are not static. For example,
    the NDVI must be combined with a measurement of available soil water to dynamically
    delineate both space and time ZM for irrigation. Irrigation systems with variable
    water application rates Irrigated agriculture is one of the agricultural activities
    with the highest consumption of fresh water in the world. In this sense, precision
    irrigation is an important tool for the development of profitable and sustainable
    agriculture (DU et al., 2015 ; MATEOS & ARAUS, 2016 ). Thus, as discussed in the
    previous section, the creation of irrigation management zones is essential to
    increase the efficiency of the application and use of water in the field. Within
    this tool, Site-specific Variable Rate Irrigation (SS-VRI) is a management method
    that consists of applying water according to spatial variability due to characteristics,
    such as soil and culture; and therefore, through rational application, it is possible
    to increase water conservation and productivity, in addition to reducing the leaching
    rate of nutrients and agrochemicals and optimizing inputs (DU et al., 2015 ; MATEOS
    & ARAUS, 2016 ). SS-VRI differs from conventional sprinkler systems and requires
    variable rate sprinklers, which are based mainly on pulse modulation, angle of
    departure and arrival points, and sprinkler head (SADLER et al., 2005 ).The main
    research covers linear and center pivot sprinkler systems due to the level of
    automation and coverage of the cultivation area through a single side tube (ADEYEMI
    et al., 2017 ). However, this type of management has already been studied for
    other types of irrigation methods, such as drip, considering the challenges of
    directionality and the invariable rate of lateral lines (LINKER, 2020 ). Therefore,
    the main commercial equipment developed thus far is linked to central pivot and
    linear mechanized sprinkler irrigation. The greatest success of implementing VRI
    in center pivot systems, and the focus of this review, is that it allows: first,
    the control of the travel speed of the center pivot, allowing the variation of
    water application/infiltration depth by sector, and second, controlling the variation
    of water application by zone; that is, it allows the differentiation of irrigation
    rates along the lateral pipeline (ANDRADE et al., 2020 ; O’SHAUGHNESSY et al.,
    2019 ; SUI & YAN, 2017 ). SOBENKO et al. (2018 ) developed a sprinkler with flow
    adjustment through the cross section based on an iris mechanism controlled by
    a stepper motor using a deterministic model for flow prediction, but the idealized
    nozzle discharge coefficient (0.60) was below the average values (0.90-0.92) observed
    in conventional fixed nozzles. The management of SS-VRI can be carried out efficiently
    in several ways, such as monitoring the soil moisture content, a subject discussed
    in greater depth in sections 1 and 4. For this, the positioning and number of
    sensors should be chosen with care so that the generated data are representative
    of the area under cultivation. Through analyses of variance and temporal stability
    of soil water content monitored by a neutron probe, BARKER et al. (2017 ) concluded
    that for management zones divided to minimize variations within the zones, the
    number of sensors may be more important than their position in the area. In addition,
    due to the high cost of a number of sensors, a partnership between modeling and
    monitoring soil water is proposed. In a similar study focusing on the placement
    of soil sensors, ZHAO et al. (2017 ) stated that the clay percentile of management
    zones should be considered for the placement of sensors. The use of spectral images
    obtained via satellite or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been used in the
    management of variable-rate irrigation systems. The principle of this use is based
    on understanding the spectral response of the leaf, which is applied at the canopy
    level and is used to establish management zones (HANK et al., 2018 ). MENDES et
    al. (2019 ), using images obtained from satellites, carried out the mapping of
    areas considering the variability for the application of variable-rate irrigation
    depths via the central pivot system. With the same objective, SHI et al. (2019
    ), with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), obtained multispectral images
    of the vegetation and used vegetation indices to determine the spatial variability
    and constitution of homogeneous areas. Similar work was developed by BHATTI et
    al. (2020 ), in which the comparison of multispectral images obtained by UAV and
    satellites was performed to evaluate the response of crops to variable irrigation
    based on canopy temperature and surface energy balance modeling. More examples
    of the use of images in precision irrigation are mentioned in sections 2 and 3.
    Despite all the benefits, the uptake of SS-VRI systems has grown slowly. The main
    justifications for this are that this type of management requires qualified technical
    assistance, and the acquisition of the necessary equipment still has a high cost,
    requiring a careful analysis of the economic viability of production (ABIOYE et
    al., 2020 ). To assist in these matters, simulation models are viable options
    for assessing the response of crops to different irrigation management methods.
    MCCARTHY et al. (2014 ) used a model called VARIwise based on the predictive control
    model methodology to evaluate the performance of cotton cultures grown on a center
    pivot with variable application rate irrigation compared to conventional systems.
    In most results, simulations of precision irrigation performance had superior
    results. In a similar research, THORP (2019) carried out a long-term evaluation
    through simulations using the same crop under soil variability parameters to analyze
    the advantages of the system. However, modeling applied to precision irrigation
    can be complex because it deals with the dynamics of water in soil. The following
    topic discusses in-depth examples of models and applications of modeling in irrigated
    agriculture. Modeling agricultural crops and their interaction with the prescription
    of variable water depths in precision irrigation Extreme drought events have increased
    in intensity in recent decades and predictions from agrometeorological modeling
    indicate that climate extremes of drought will become more frequent and prolonged
    due to a set of factors, among which global warming stands out (IPCC, 2018). Agriculture
    is one of the human activities most dependent on climatic conditions, especially
    traditional rainfed crops, so the development of studies to evaluate the effects
    of these on agricultural production is important. However, carrying out field
    experiments becomes limiting due to a series of factors, such as manpower, available
    time and financial resources. An alternative or complementary solution is the
    use of agricultural modeling to forecast the development of agricultural crops
    in new climate scenarios. Crop simulation models are based on biophysical processes
    to make estimates such as growth, development and production, based on physiological
    characteristics of the crop in question and environmental variables (MONTEITH,
    1996 ). Understanding these models becomes the conceptual basis for modeling agricultural
    crops. Mechanistic models, based on the physics and physiological processes of
    plants, become allies in the development of teaching, research and crop management.
    Among them, the DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) presents
    a set of models developed for several important crops, such as corn and soybean
    (JONES et al., 2003 ). In a review of the opportunities and approaches for modeling
    spatial variations of water at the field level, TENREIRO et al. (2020 ) pointed
    out that, among the irrigation methods, there are three ways to simulate irrigation
    applications in crop models: a) determination of a calendar by the user; b) an
    irrigation program based on the water capacity of the soil, applying constant
    or variable rates; and c) through a schedule based on multiple criteria, such
    as the phenological stage of the crop, water content in the soil, restrictions
    on the availability of water and type of cultural management. These methodologies
    have the potential to calculate the varied rate of irrigation to be provided to
    plants, “when,” “where” and “how much” they need, resulting in the optimization
    of the use of this water resource (HAGHVERDI et al., 2016 ), thus validating the
    three ways to simulate field-level irrigation applications in the models. In the
    literature, the prescription of variable irrigation depths follows two methodologies:
    a) make individual use of crop simulation models or hydrological models, which
    focus on the movement of water in the soil and b) make combined use of these two
    models. The DSSAT model, because it is a simulation of cultivation, is advantageous
    in the study of irrigation management scenarios, as presented by MALIK & DECHMI
    (2019 ) in a study carried out in Spain with different cultures. They evaluated
    two scenarios, one based on irrigation applied by producers and another on irrigation
    adjusted to the water demand of the crop, with crop and soil data collected for
    model calibration and validation. The authors reported up to a 27% reduction in
    the application of irrigation depths. Similar researches are presented by CAMARGO
    & KEMANIAN (2016 ), PEREZ-ORTOLA et al. (2015) and XIANGXIANG et al. (2013 ).
    Another well-established model is APSIM, which also focuses on modeling agricultural
    crops and assesses the impacts of different crop management practices, including
    irrigation (AMARASINGHA et al., 2015 ; DUTTA et al., 2020 ). PEREA et al. (2017
    ), for example, carried out an integrative modeling coupling a deterministic model
    of water application with the Aquacrop model, simulating the impacts of heterogeneous
    irrigation caused by wind drift and pressure variation in the irrigation system.
    They concluded that variable-rate irrigation was the best method in all scenarios
    of pressure variation in the system to save water and increase onion yield. ROY
    et al. (2019 ) also proposed the integration of crop and hydrological models using
    HYDRUS-2D software and DSSAT to identify the most appropriate irrigation management
    to maximize water use efficiency through precision irrigation using retention
    technology of subsurface water, together with a computational procedure of evolutionary
    multi-objective optimization to link the two models. The authors concluded that
    the optimization procedure reduced water use and increased corn yield prediction
    by 6-fold compared to non-optimized and randomized irrigation management without
    subsurface water retention membrane. For the combination of models, another proposal
    developed by GARCÍA-VILA & FERERES (2012 ), in which they combined the AquaCrop
    model with an economic optimization model, identified irrigation strategies and
    predicted their impact on income. in which the simulated results indicated that
    the best strategy under water restrictions combined the planting of crops with
    low water use in part of the area as a way of making more water available for
    the most profitable crops and with the greatest water need. In this review, several
    premises involving precision irrigation were addressed, from the use of soil sensors,
    remote sensing, artificial intelligence, management zones for irrigation, and
    variable-rate irrigation to agricultural modeling in view of optimizing the use
    of water resources. However, there are other techniques and technologies used
    in RI that help in the efficient use of both water and energy resources, such
    as the use of wastewater (IBEKWE et al., 2018 ; SHANNAG et al., 2021 ; VERGINE
    et al., 2016 ), solar panels to reduce energy costs with water pumping and automation
    in irrigation systems (GRANT et al., 2022 ; SINGH et al., 2021 ) and the use of
    microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) to mitigate damage caused by water deficit
    (ASHWIN et al., 2022 ). CONCLUSION: This review of trends and prospects for precision
    irrigation for irrigation monitoring and management is based on relevant past
    and current research work that has contributed to achieving greater water savings
    in agriculture. It is hoped that this review article has given a broad overview
    of research trends and generated new ideas for readers on implementation and execution
    approaches to choosing the best smart irrigation strategy, paying attention to
    the fact that the combination of monitoring methods via soil, plant and climate
    is the most assertive strategy to increase the energy efficiency of water use
    in irrigated fields. However, it results in a large volume of data to be analyzed,
    making it necessary to use algorithms based on artificial intelligence, which
    promotes a fast and efficient monitoring system of the collected data, aiming
    the assertive recommendation of irrigation at a variable rate in the area irrigated
    to save water and energy so as not to overload the irrigating farmer with the
    daily decision in determining the irrigation dose. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors

    © 2021 1 Introduction to Smart Agriculture Agriculture is the principal source
    of food supply and gross domestic product (GDP), as it accounts for 6.4% of the
    entire global GDP. Agriculture is at least a significant source of business in
    nine countries on the globe. Agriculture provides fuel as well as jobs for millions
    of people [1]. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
    claims that global food demand must grow to 70% by 2050 to meet increased population
    needs [2]. At the moment, enough food is produced to feed everyone on the planet,
    but still, 500 million people suffer from malnutrition, and over 821 million go
    hungry. About two-thirds of the world’s population will live in cities in next
    coming decades. An increase of over half of this total global population will
    be in the countries in Africa, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of
    Congo, India, Indonesia, Egypt, the United States, and Tanzania. 473 million people
    are expected to join the middle class in India and Nigeria by that year [1]. A
    rapid increase in the number of people in this population represents a challenge
    to attain the target of eliminating hunger laid out in the text Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs); it may be difficult to meet 40% of water needs by 2030; over the
    same time period, 20% of cropland may become degraded. Because food production
    requires more resources than the available supply will allow, farmers must use
    more sustainable methods to increase production and conserve resources [3]. The
    world must increase its annual cereal production by 3 billion tons and meat production
    by more than 200% by the year 2050 to supply the global population’s needs. The
    cereal will be provided by yield increases in production [4]. An increase in crop
    size and farm structure is required as well as an up-to-date approach to technologies.
    Although this might be possible, it is still unclear if it can be done in a sustainable
    manner and inclusive manner. However, there is a significant and rapid transformation
    required to reengineer the farm operations at tremendous scale and speed. Agricultural
    industries are interested in implementing new technology for getting more out
    of each harvest because of unpredictable weather, increasing demand for food,
    and rapid growth in the population [5]. More and more uses are being found for
    artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture as it develops. At the same time,
    the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0)
    allow for new technologies and innovations to be generated. The modern agricultural
    technologies and innovations are known as “smart agriculture,” or “Agriculture
    4.0,” can help crop production while also reducing water and energy use [6]. Through
    the integration of environmental measurements, prediction technologies, these
    will be possible. As new capabilities have been created by smart farming, agricultural
    processes can be optimized to allow greater productivity and fewer natural resources
    to be used. Smart farming uses diverse technologies and platforms to enable farmers
    to leverage new ideas [6]. The “digital agricultural revolution” in agriculture
    will transform the systems and help increase efficiency, sustainability, inclusiveness,
    and transparency. Nonetheless, technologies must be integrated into the agricultural
    sector on a larger scale to take advantage of their more excellent capabilities.
    Due to these factors, such as compatibility, heterogeneity, the handling of large
    amounts of information, and the processing of massive amounts of data, however,
    numerous security issues remain to be addressed in Agriculture 4.0. Agriculture
    4.0 needs to generate, transfer and process data correctly and protect against
    attacks [7]. Without careful management of data integrity, data-related technologies,
    such as analytics and smart systems, can’t function properly. The system can become
    inoperable if there is faulty hardware or when used in conjunction with other
    attacks, putting the security of the whole network and all connected devices at
    risk. When diverse resources are included, security risks arise, such as loss
    of privacy, maintaining trust, and making sure the resource is there in the first
    place. Because the internet of things, cellular, and wireless technologies are
    inextricably intertwined, it’s possible that it will solve many of the new and
    existing threats to our modern society’s agriculture. It must address issues of
    new to date integrity, date accuracy, and device security, as well as specific
    security elements, like encryption, data accuracy, and availability [8]. 1.1 Smart
    Farming and Precision Agriculture: A Definition Farm smart devices are exposed
    to climate changes (sunlight, rain, hail), engines (used in agriculture), animals,
    passing through, and people. The above elements allow our farm’s smartness to
    be exposed to vulnerabilities that have not yet been explored elsewhere. One prominent
    example of the creative use of artificial intelligence in agriculture is the insertion
    of sensors and actuators in open spaces where external agents, like humans or
    machinery, could potentially interact with the surrounding environment. If an
    agent accidentally removes the sensor from the original location or damages it,
    these controls will lose their functionality. More often than not, the external
    agents are able to circumvent these devices when they aren’t physically tethered,
    for example, in smart cities. The lack of protection presents a distinct vulnerability
    in agricultural systems. Larger-scale applications of machine learning in farming
    are just being worked out. With time, magical results will be achievable for all
    stages of agricultural research and development. As quoted by Allan Savory, “Agriculture
    is the foundation of civilization and any stable economy”. Precision agriculture
    (PA) became a prominent component of the third wave of the modern agricultural
    revolution in the 1980s. PA was first used to focus the application of fertilizers
    to specific soil conditions. Since then, PA has been used to construct automated
    guidance systems for agricultural vehicles and tools, autonomous machines and
    processes, farm research, and agricultural production system management. In agriculture,
    the fundamental principle of AI automated machine learning (AutoML) is its adaptability,
    speed, precision, and cost-effectiveness. Artificial intelligence in Agriculture
    not only assists farmers in the use of their farming abilities but also moves
    to directed farming to achieve larger yields and better quality with fewer resources.
    Smart agriculture attempts to reduce farmers’ workloads while increasing farm
    output by incorporating modern technologies such as sensors and actuator networks,
    unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), satellite imagery, IoT, and drones, and so on
    [9]. Smart agriculture is a crop management idea that lets farmers to handle geographical
    and temporal variability in agriculture, such as water management, production
    management, and fertilizer management, as well as intrusion attacks and real-time
    data monitoring. Modern agricultural operations frequently employ chemical, pH,
    wind, rain, temperature, moisture, and auditory sensors. Each sensor has its own
    set of capabilities and hardware requirements, which are tailored to the conditions
    in each location. IoT peripherals, image processing systems, big data capabilities,
    data analytics, and wireless technologies contribute to the development of smart
    agriculture management. Smart and precision agriculture has an essential role
    to play in all aspects of agriculture. That’s the coming together of the internet
    of things (IoT) and information technology (IT). They want to collect data from
    diverse sources to try to figure out, predetermine, and organize farm activity
    with regard to their environments. Sensors have become ubiquitous to collect disparate
    sets of data (soil temperature, moisture, foliage, sunlight levels, and direction).
    Smart agriculture (SA) is grounded on the combination of digital automation, data
    collection, data transmission, decision-making, data processing, and data analysis.
    A sensor network is among the most common data collection and communication technologies
    in this sector. In smart agriculture, data from the environment plays a critical
    role [9]. As the soil is a big factor in climatic disease forecasting, meteorological
    information can alert farmers of infection outbreaks. Increased yield and lower
    environmental impact are both possible with increased use of the data collected
    for crop protection. Human has limited capacity to process this data, so they
    must be made easier with the help of tools and techniques that facilitate analysis
    to benefit decision-making [10]. The use of data mining techniques is vital in
    analyzing data. Big data includes patterns, so using different ways of looking
    at the data is critical in order to discover these patterns. Data mining techniques
    have been applied to a number of other tasks in the agricultural sector, including
    the identification of pests, disease detection, and the prediction of yield, and
    the planning of fertilizer and pesticide use, to date, for example. They are also
    used for crop management, but other than that, they can explore other models that
    can assist in measuring the organization of farms. Therefore, collecting this
    data is such a new input that can directly affect agricultural efficiency, thus
    providing better results [11]. Figure 1 presents an overall general framework
    of the applications of the ICT in agriculture domains. Fig. 1 An ICT framework
    in transforming traditional agriculture to smart agricultural practices Full size
    image The integration of information and communication technologies in agriculture
    is known as smart farming. It allows for the use of data collection and analysis
    in work processes that use ICT to be utilized. European Union (EU) believes that
    the best technologies and techniques to be the ones that can be fully utilized
    are satellite imagery, robotics for data collection, and UAVs [12]. A sustainable
    digital future for European agriculture and rural areas was agreed upon in the
    EU cooperation declaration of April 2019 on “Information technology for European
    agriculture and rural areas” by 24 EU countries. Where connectivity is the biggest
    problem, that is, in rural areas, digital inclusion is the first obstacle that
    must be solved, according to the SF official declaration. This is quite exciting
    about 5G as it is expected to improve these scenarios in rural and low-income
    regions across the EU, but we should be wary of these projections because of their
    inconsistency [13]. At the end of 2017, Europe’s first half-century of IPv6 deployment,
    only 25 to 53% of rural regions are covered by Next Generation Access Networks
    [14]. Digitization of agriculture now appears to be a staggering number of initiatives.
    A recent EU-funded thematic network, known as Smart AKIS, aims to close the knowledge
    gap in order to generate practical solutions. Even so, the purpose of SF should
    not only be to make the whole agricultural process more industrial but should
    also serve the needs of farmers. Today, we see new methods for agricultural practices,
    as well as business models, taking advantage of technological innovations faster
    than ever before [15]. Another benefit of rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, includes reduced costs for farmers and support systems
    that mechanize processes. Such an initiative may be viewed as promoting SF adoption
    in low-income communities. A French firm is attempting to combine both web-based
    and hardware technologies to make legacy infrastructure flexible and usable. To
    meet farmers’ needs, Karnott Systems sells a control unit that can be installed
    on agricultural machinery, combines collecting and exchanging real-time data and
    geofencing capabilities, and also offers geographic information. Data can be shared
    via an online service like the API-platform agro’s for getting information. Data
    is available to various farms, providing a valuable research library [15]. Tarris
    offers an aerial and satellite image in order to support precision farming (PF)
    using artificial intelligence (AI) as a supporting platform. AgriOpenData provides
    a Decision Support System (DSS), taking advantage of blockchain, and supports
    additional services. Robotic agriculture offers a comprehensive solution to the
    whole plant life cycle from seeding to harvesting with reduced water consumption.
    With digital ledgers, traceability is, at last, is experiencing a revolution.
    No matter what level of science fiction you might choose to bring it under, the
    origin and quality of agricultural products are still significant issues that
    must be considered. Carrefour, a French multinational retailing company, is interested
    in using blockchain to help shoppers and industry participants believe in the
    legitimacy of their transactions. Hectare Agritech use blockchain in their farm
    trading platform highlights the capacity to take different approaches in different
    use cases. The system of smart agriculture is illustrated in the graphic form
    in Fig. 2. It consists of a perceptual device, network functions, and capabilities
    available at the edge, all wrapped in cloud-based services [16]. For these types
    of applications, data is gathered and used in the perception layer; sensors, GPS,
    RFID tags, and cameras may be placed on the farm. Because of this, they cannot
    process or store information close to the client or perform in the cloud, and
    they cannot utilize these devices. This component is linked to internal sensor
    networks via networking technologies, so it can be used with the wireless sensor
    network (WSN). Security features, data filters, intelligence, diversified processing,
    multiple in/outbound interfaces, and the gateway may all be located on the creative
    edge. The edge adds one or more resources, depending on the appliance’s features.
    While some devices only support data returns, others are capable of much more
    complicated tasks. One of the strengths of programmable gateways is their ability
    to process data, make decisions, send commands to devices, and send data to the
    cloud. When you make a connection to the Internet through an Internet Service
    Provider (ISP), the gateway connects to the cloud; it is helpful for storing and
    delivering data to customers. Although a large amount of data produced by perception
    devices will soon be encountered in the big data world, processing in the cloud
    is costly [17]. For several proposed solutions, cloud computing, bandwidth, and
    investment costs are immense. Using a heavy gateway with part of the processing
    on the edges can be advantageous. Moving subsystems to the outer reaches of the
    farm could decrease its financial expenses. Data downloaded or processed at the
    edge minimizes network bandwidth, protects and preserves battery life, as well.
    Thus, the cloud storage of large amounts of data and continual process and decision
    making allows decisions with users to interact. Processing big data may necessitate
    the use of high-tech artificial intelligence and pattern recognition tools. Fig.
    2 Structure of smart agriculture components [17] Full size image 1.2 Need for
    Automated and Smart Farming By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach
    nine billion people. The UN International Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    estimates that the food supply needed by the people of the world in the year 2050
    is about 70% greater than today [18]. For those reasons, climate change will significantly
    threaten the productivity of food, livestock, and the economic viability of rural
    communities in the United States, according to the 2018 National Climate Assessment
    by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. On the majority of U.S. crops, yields
    will decline as a result of hotter and dryer weather, soil erosion, disease, and
    pest pressure, and outbreak, especially in the region of these issues while they
    remain high. As the country’s agricultural land usage has led to the destruction
    of numerous ecosystems, including the prairies of North America and the Atlantic
    Forest of Brazil [19]. As seen in Fig. 3, there are around 500 billion hectares
    of agricultural land today; about 40% of the total land on Earth is used for farming
    [20]. Fig. 3 Total agricultural area over the long-term in hectares [20] Full
    size image Agriculture accounts for over the course of the past 70% of the global
    water use, as shown in Fig. 4 [21]. Since agricultural land has expanded so much,
    global water withdrawals have almost quintupled from 500 to 2500 cubic kilometers.
    Population growth, as well as climate change, have made increasing food production
    a serious problem. It is apparent that the agriculture industry must alter current
    approaches to production and adoption to favor land and water use practices while
    also avoiding the threat of volatile markets. The use of several new information
    technologies allows the agriculture industry to enter into a data-driven era.
    Fig. 4 Water withdrawals by sector [21] Full size image India is an agrarian country,
    with agriculture accounting for 16% of India’s GDP and 10% of overall exports,
    respectively. Approximately 75% of India’s population is dependent on agriculture,
    either directly or indirectly. Around 3,50,000 hectares of land in India are utilized
    for tomato farming, yielding 5.3 million tonnes of tomatoes and ranking India
    as the world’s third-largest tomato producer. India is the world’s second-largest
    producer of potatoes, with 48.60 million tonnes produced annually [21, 22]. India
    is the world’s sixth-largest apple grower, with a production of roughly 2371.0
    million tonnes. With a yield of approximately 116.42 million metric tonnes, India
    ranks second in rice production. Diseases squander more than 15% of India’s crops,
    which ultimately weakens its economy. Agriculture today accounts for more than
    10% of greenhouse gas emissions and 44% of water use in Europe, owing to the steady
    expansion of food production requirements [22]. Chemical treatments (pesticides)
    are widely employed to increase fruit crop market penetration, resulting in significant
    impacts on pollinators and the planet’s environment. Plants account for more than
    80% of the human diet. As a result, there is a growing interest in new approaches
    for reducing water consumption and optimizing pesticide treatments in order to
    protect natural resources. Thus, agriculture is in constant need of developing
    innovative ways to increase crop yields, as weather fluctuations, population growth,
    and food security make it difficult to expand. Agriculture is increasingly is
    being seen as a technology industry leader in terms of the advancement of artificial
    intelligence. Therefore, since this process is difficult or impossible for humans,
    we must automate with methods and tools to facilitate this with the decision-making.
    Advances in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning technologies
    can be utilized to identify crop diseases accurately, promptly, and earlier from
    a variety of existing crop diseases to meet the aforementioned issues in today’s
    farming settings. Fast and exact results from computerized apprehensions employing
    image processing methods are among the benefits of implementing this technology.
    Computer vision and precision developments can be used to eliminate high labour
    costs and time waste, as well as improve crop quality and total production. Early
    information on the condition of the crop and the area of illness can aid in the
    spread of disease management through the use of appropriate delivery methods.
    1.3 Research Contribution Our research’s significant contributions can be stated
    as follows: 1. The essential techniques in agricultural pre-harvesting automation
    chores such as soil and seed, crop disease detection, irrigation, weed control,
    pesticides, yield management, and so on are covered in this work. 2. We have discussed
    how ML in general and DL, in particular, have helped identify fruit and leaf diseases
    in plants. The role of IoT and smart agriculture, drones, and improved crop yield
    tasks, which consist of both image-processing approaches and other techniques
    involved in this process, are also discussed. 3. Various diseases and infections
    seen in various crops such as apples, grapes, bananas, and other fruits and vegetables,
    as well as their symptoms for classification purposes, are discussed. The steps
    involved in the automatic detection and classification of illnesses in plants
    are discussed, as well as the numerous strategies and algorithms that can be used
    in each phase. 4. Future promises and discussions, as outlined in this comprehensive
    study, are also offered, as are challenges and issues in the adoption of these
    machine learning models for smart agricultural chores. 1.4 Outline of the Paper
    The rest of the paper is divided into four sections. The automation of the pre-harvesting
    tasks like soil and seed, disease diagnostics tools, crop phenotyping, irrigation
    control, pesticides management, crop yield, etc., occupy the core part in Sect.
    2. Various types of probable diseases present in various plants such as tomato,
    rice, apple, and others are described, as well as the symptoms that may be utilized
    to diagnose and classify them. The generic steps involved in sutomatic plant disease
    detection and classification using machine learning and deep learning, such as
    image acquisition, data pre-processing, image segmentation, image extraction,
    and disease classification, are discussed in detail, as well as the various algorithms
    and techniques commonly used in each step. The findings and the research potentials
    in smart agriculture and smart farming are discussed, debated, and presented in
    Sect. 3 as Discussions. Section 4 presents various challenges and open issues
    in the deployment of these machine learning and computer vision models for plant
    disease detection and classification, as well as future research directions, based
    on observations of various existing frameworks in the literature, are discussed
    in the paper. The size of the dataset and the classifiers employed have a significant
    impact on how these frameworks are displayed. As a result, Sect. 5 contains an
    attempt to summarise the existing research and issues identified in this study,
    as well as the paper’s final remarks.. The complete layout of this manuscript
    is shown graphically in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Complete layout of the paper Full size

    Eventually, farmers will need to use fewer resources to produce the same amount
    of food, reducing the amount of water used and decreasing the use of chemicals.
    With higher production and lower costs, farmers want to maximize the quantity
    and profitability while the public desires nutritious food. New products, practices,
    as well as new technologies are sought after in the agriculture industry. To meet
    these different needs, farmers can use precision agriculture. To remain innovative,
    agriculture must employ a combination of technologies that permits data collection
    and analysis. Many of these new technologies, especially web technologies, generate
    huge amounts of data for everyone to obtain and share. With regards to smart agriculture,
    the critical attributes of data mining are these: (i) It is imperative that we
    must deal with large amounts of data so we can explore that fast and effectively.
    (ii) For use in smart agriculture, the data sources need to be diverse; for example,
    sensors will need to be in various formats, as will images, strings, numbers,
    and so on. We must understand and communicate with various device types, along
    with websites, as well as pull information from the web. The term ‘smart agriculture’
    is used chiefly for soil and water use planning, monitoring crop health, and reducing
    pollutants, such as pesticides and herbicides [23]. Everything is becoming more
    brilliant in this fast-changing world of technology and agriculture. Performance
    relies both on historical data and on incorporating computer vision technology
    to meet the growing agricultural demand. While it does affect crop classification,
    agro chem production, disease detection, and prevention, it does not guarantee
    it. All it takes is the place, the time, and the right product. Precision farming
    does away with repetitive and time-consuming operations, controlled agriculture,
    and labor-intensive part of farming with more accurate and controlled techniques
    than conventional ones [23]. When it comes to the use of communication technology
    in production systems, it’s viewed as an extension of existing equipment and the
    installation of sensors to be put into agricultural systems and state-of-the-art
    information processing like variable-rate technology, aerial and satellite-based
    sensors, as well as geographic information systems (GPS), all contribute to the
    current concepts of precision agriculture [24]. Livestock applications as well
    as the possible uses of satellite GPS are included under the umbrella of precision
    agriculture [24]. It also manages, integrates, measures, and analyses several
    technologies to enhance output while lowering the overall cost of the total process
    [25]. Profitability and productivity in agriculture would be significantly improved
    if soil conditions, available land, and equipment remained stable [26]. Image
    processing and computer vision have grown in recent years due to reduced equipment
    costs, increased computational power, and the corresponding reduced desire to
    use destructive methods has [27]. In the survey, technology such as GPS/GNSS,
    autonomous vehicles, the internet of things (IoT), and agricultural robots was
    found to be invaluable for precision farming. These four phases of precision farming
    include the process of gathering data, analyzing that data, making decisions,
    utilizing that data, and agriculture based on that data. In the last two decades,
    technologies have been developed using artificial intelligence to regulate temperature
    and humidity in artificially controlled greenhouses, i.e., ANNs and fuzzy controllers,
    for more precise farming practices have emerged. These autonomous mobile robots
    are used in farming for a diverse array of applications. Agriculture is a dynamic
    process in which constantly evolving robots have the ability to acquire new strategies
    to carry out their assigned tasks. The main characteristic of an autonomous robot
    has sensors that collect information and then convey it to the control unit. Fuzzy
    logic may be used to govern the robot control system. While performing agriculture
    tasks, the steps as below is generally followed by farmers. Step 1: Selection
    of Crop. Step 2: Land Preparation. Step 3: Seed Sowing. Step 4: Irrigation & fertilizing.
    Step 5: Crop Maintenance [use of pesticides, crop pruning, etc.] Step 6: Harvesting.
    Step 7: Post-Harvesting activities. As per the above algorithm, the agriculture-related
    tasks are categorized in three major sub-areas. Figure 6 shows these three sub-domains
    of agriculture tasks. In the following sections, the review of the most recent
    techniques of machine vision systems used for classification and object detection
    in the pre-harvesting stage of farming is presented. Fig. 6 General categorization
    and important parameters considered at each agriculture task Full size image 2.1
    Pre-harvesting The real growth of the crops is influenced by pre-harvesting conditions.
    Machine learning is utilized in pre-harvesting to record soil, seed quality, fertilizer
    treatment, pruning, genetic and environmental variables, and irrigation factors.
    It is critical to concentrate on each component in order to reduce total production
    losses. A few key pre-harvesting components are discussed, as well as how neural
    networks and machine learning are utilised to capture the parameters of each component
    in this section. 2.1.1 Seed and Soil The classification and assessment of soil
    attribute aid farmers in reducing fertilizer costs, reducing the need for soil
    analysis experts, increasing profitability, and improving soil health. pH values
    and soil fertility indices classification and prediction model were presented
    by Suchithra and Pai [28]. pH values and Soil Organic Matter (SOM) are critical
    markers of soil fertility; according to Yang et al. [29], hence the authors predicted
    SOM and pH parameters in paddy soil. Organic carbon (OC), nitrogen (TN), and moisture
    content (MC) parameters of the soil have been predicted by Morellos et al. [30].
    The goal of this research was to compare machine learning algorithms and linear
    multivariate algorithms in terms of prediction performance. Seed germination is
    a critical element in seed quality, which is a key determinant of yield and production
    quality. Huang et al. [31] and Zhu et al. [32] have shown applications of many
    computer vision, machine learning, and convolution neural network (CNN) algorithms
    in automated seed sorting amd soil quality estimations. Veeramani et al. [33]
    employed a CNN-based deep neural network (DNN) model to estimate the number of
    seeds per pod in soybeans and to categorize haploid seeds based on form, phenotypic
    expression, and embryo position. To improve the accuracy of the classification
    method, Keling et al. [34] employed a multilayer perceptron neural network model
    to separate high-quality pepper seeds from low-quality pepper seeds. A detailed
    summary of work done by different authors on soil and seed parameters is mentioned
    in Table 1. Table 1 Analysis of pre-harvesting parameters of soil and seed Full
    size table 2.1.2 Crop Disease Detection, Prediction, and Monitoring Plants are
    vulnerable to infection because they are surrounded by the outside environment.
    The spread of disease depends on the current crop conditions and susceptibility
    to infection. It is crucial to identify plant diseases in order to avoid any losses
    in the yield and quantity of agricultural products. Ranging from leaves, stems,
    seeds, and roots of the plant to flowers, fruit, and seeds in the plant [35].
    For many regions of the world, therefore, early diagnosis is problematic [36].
    Smartphone diagnosis is increasingly being enabled by deep learning advances in
    computer vision. Risk reduction is critical because of the tedious task of spotting
    and then counting disease among large populations of crops on large farms; thus,
    automation is helpful. Even in underdeveloped countries, most infections are too
    subtle for the naked eye to be able to perceive, and for that reason, medical
    assistance is critical. Therefore, using image processing software to help classify
    diseases of plants became a high priority, given that many species could not be
    distinguished by looking at photographs alone. The wide range of soil conditions
    and nitrogen levels are vital players in the good or bad health of crops. Pesticides
    were traditionally applied equally to each square of the field. If farmers are
    overly budgeting for the water use on their farms, it significantly reduces the
    number of species that are pollinators for flora and fauna. ML can be used in
    conjunction with analysis software for crop health assessment. The data is used
    to pinpoint which infestation areas are most critical, thus allowing farmers to
    target pesticide usage in those specific locations. Environmental customization
    can be significant. An example of this is Plantix, a German start-up, which combines
    machine learning with image recognition in an app to identify plant diseases and
    nutrients. Tools like these really make a difference for smaller farmers because
    they’re flexible. Bigger businesses use digital platforms connected to the internet
    of things (IoT) devices to collect both visual and thermal data. A concept commonly
    used by Swiss-based companies, for example, such as Gamaya, employs precisely
    this practice. Trace Genomics’ approach to soil health differs in that it looks
    at soil quality and how the particular plant species respond to the quality of
    the soil rather than at the conditions that surround them. ML is used to keep
    crops healthy so that the company is trying to prevent disease instead of finding
    it. Some farmers ship their soil directly to Trace Genetics and receive an evidence-based
    answer about the soil condition in advance. Here, a detailed survey of the recent
    techniques in computer science for automated disease diagnosis and detection in
    the agricultural domain is performed. 2.1.2.1 Detecting and Classifying Crop Diseases
    Using Conventional Data Mining Methods Computer vision can use various classification
    and detection algorithms and methods for crop disease. Using deep convolution
    neural networks (DNNs) helped [37] to achieve a 99.53% correct result in diagnosing
    the plant disease. Neural networks have also been applied to issues in rice, like
    identifying illness [38]. Generally, principal component analysis (PCA) [39],
    support vector machines (SVM) [40], and multiple linear models [41] are alternative
    models most often used in the smart farming context. In an experiment, it was
    found that K-means clustering [42] for the classification of healthy and infected
    leaves was more effective and that support vector machines (SVM) provided a better
    solution than an artificial neural network (ANN). While discovering and classifying
    their visual similarities, Bashir and Sharma [43] found color and texture to be
    helpful in agriculture and horticulture disease detection techniques. The start-up
    Prosper developed a system that consists of networked cameras, sensors, and an
    algorithm based on machine learning to keep track of crops and notify farmers
    as soon as they’re sick [44]. By applying neutral network processing procedures
    to hyperspectral data, Golhani et al. [45] concentrated on the study of plant
    disease. Mosh et al. [46] used multilayered neural networks to find yellow rust
    in wheat. Using ANN technology, class performance rose from 95 to 99%. Based on
    an experiment conducted by Rangan et al. [47], where they generated a dataset
    of six types of tomato leaves from PlantVillage for the classification of tomato
    crop disease. Both the AlexNet and the VGG16 net used a deep learning architecture,
    and the dataset from PlantVillage was used as input to it. The accuracy of classification
    of VGG16’s 13,262 image signatures was 97.29%, and of AlexNet’s was noted at 97.49%.
    Machine vision techniques are more effective in identifying plant disease at the
    beginning stages of growth rather than the late stages [48]. The start of the
    process begins with the preparation and acquisition of a sample. The machine vision
    process has been applied to crops like rice [49], papaya [50], and chili pepper
    [51] with accuracies of 87.9%, 87.5%, and 90.15%, respectively. Figure 7 displays
    a demo of the diseases in banana and rose leaves. Fig. 7 Diseases in plants (a,
    b) Banana leaf disease, (c, d) Rose leaf disease Full size image The SVM classifier
    was used by researches to detect grape leaf disease in [52]. Powdery mildew &
    DownyMildew are two grape plant diseases that were identified with an accuracy
    rate of 88.89% in [53]. In [54], authors detected diseases, such as anthracnose
    and canker on oranges, limes, lemons, and grapefruit citrus trees. The research
    outcome received a true accuracy rate of 95%. The authors showed an overall classification
    accuracy of around 90% [55] while detecting septoria leaf blight, frog eye, downy
    mildew, diseases in soybean crops by using a large dataset. The authors of [56]
    designed a system for diagnosing diseases in tea crops and detecting 3 different
    diseases by using limited features and claim to have gained 90% accuracy rate.
    In [57], authors developed a system to determine disease presence in wheat crop
    photos with a fuzzy classifier. The accuracy of unhealthy and healthy leaves classification
    was 56% and 88%, respectively. A thorough survey on crop diseases identification
    with the KNN classifier is performed in [58]. The authors [59] used the GLCM feature
    extraction approach with the KNN classifier for cotton crop disease (Grey Mildew)
    and achieved 82.5% accuracy. An in-depth data of plant diseases detection using
    an ANN classifier is offered in [60]. The authors [61] analyzed various supervised
    machine learning algorithms like RF, SVM, DT, KNN, NB, and KNN with image processing
    methods to uncover the best algorithm for plant disease classification. RF algorithm
    achieved 89% accuracy compared with other algorithms. Similarly, the authors [62]
    evaluated the performance of SVM, RF, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)) & DL
    (Inception-v3, VGG-16, VGG-19) in terms of citrus plant disease detection in which
    DL methods overtook the ML methods. The work [63] illuminates various types of
    plant disease (PD), different progressed ML & image processing techniques to identify
    plant PD. [64] aimed at tweaking & assessing cutting-edge deep CNN for picture-based
    PD characterization. Hossain et al. [65] proposed a method for plant leaf disease
    detection (PLDD) & characterization utilizing the KNN classifier. An improved
    artificial plant optimization (IAPO) calculation using ML has been presented in
    [66] that distinguishes the PD & arranges the leaves into sound & tainted on a
    dataset of 236 pictures. Arora and Agarwal [67] gave the acknowledgment and categorization
    of maize plant leaf illnesses by utilizing a deep forest method. In [68], a global
    pooling dilated CNN (GPDCNN) is suggested for recognizing PD. The authors in [69]
    developed a vision-based program to detect symptoms of olive quick decline syndrome
    (OQDS) on leaves of Olea europaea. Again, a convolutional neural network for end-to-end
    detection of red grape vine (Sangiovese) using color images of leaf clippings
    is recommended by [70]. In [71], researchers developed a system to detect disease
    in glycine max with a k-means based segmentation algorithm. The design catches
    downy mildew, frog eye, and septoria leaf blight from images collected by the
    PlantVillage project. Again, in [72], the authors proposed an intensity thresholding
    method for measuring the progression of powdery mildew in cherries. A hybrid method
    detecting and identifying diseases in citrus plants is presented in [73]. An approach
    based on color difference to segment diseased parts of known mandarin leaves is
    given [74]. A method to detect diseases in beans using CNN is offered in [75].
    The research is carried on wheat disease detection in [76] and banana field images
    in [77]. The study in [78] proposed a method to classify apples into rotten or
    good apples and found SVM as the best classifier with 98.9% performance. An approach
    for apple leaf disease detection that achieved 98.54% classification accuracy
    is given in [79]. The work in [80] investigated the use of KNN and SVM for detecting
    of leaf deficiencies and leaf diseases. A hybrid method for detection and classification
    of diseases in citrus plants is recommended in [81] and achieves 97% classification
    accuracy on the citrus disease image gallery dataset. Table 2 gives an idea of
    the state of the art works on automated disease detection in the agriculture domain.
    Figure 8 displays the sample of different stages of grape leaf disease. Table

    Multimodal Crop Data Analysis Hybridizing data from both hyperspectral and multi-spectral
    imaging allowed for early detection of disease performed by the authors in [93]
    and attained 94.5% accuracy. The authors here propose a Hydra, which provides
    for multivalued data fusion, application event identification, and makes better
    decisions based on the data [94]. The elements can be grouped using different
    techniques: Low-level, medium-level, and high-level. Again, the grouping can be
    performed using different levels (decision fusion based on multiple applications).
    Two apps were developed with Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation)
    in partnership with the smart agriculture domain: One provided data and information
    on best practices to help farmers; the other, information on how to apply them
    in small-scale water harvesting. The first step was to find out if there was a
    critical moisture level, and the second step estimated adequate irrigation time
    was done by measuring crop evaporation (transpiration from the soil) [94]. Figure
    9 displays the sample of all apple disease leaves on different stages. Fig. 9
    Sample of Apple Leaf Images at all stages a Healthy Stage, b Early Healthy Stage,
    c Middle Healthy Stage, d End Healthy Stage Full size image 2.1.2.3 Detecting
    and Classifying Crop Diseases Using Deep Learning This section provides a brief
    summary of different DL methods for the transformation of traditional agriculture
    into a creative and intelligent practice. A plant disease detection model was
    constructed using the Berkley vision and learning center DL framework [95]. The
    model is able to identify 13 different types of disease. An approach proposed
    in 2017 that combined CNN and K-means feature for plant disease identification
    and suppression is put forward in [96]. Identifying and generalizing features
    may lead to the degradation of consistent results due to human errors in creative
    design. This indicates that the application of DL and K-means resulted in a 92.89%
    accuracy of recognition [97]. Istanbul Technical University says in 2017 that
    CNN algorithms outperform feature-based learning algorithms in discrimination
    of phenological stages [98]. A new deep learning model for plant phenotype was
    proposed by Namin et al. [99]. New LSTM designs were created by combining CNNs.
    While CNN is particularly beneficial for reducing the error from sensor readings
    due to its time-series data [100], RNN is additionally used for crop yield prediction,
    which uses a time series approach to reduce sensor-derived bias. The work in [101]
    implements two RNN-based classifiers, one a long short term memory unit (LSTM)
    model and another a gated recurrent unit (GRU), in winter plant phenology mapping
    to find out how much water to give the crops and the crop environment. Table 3
    presents state-of-the-art deep learning works on automated disease detection in
    the agriculture domain. Table 3 A summary of the papers dealing with the task
    of detecting and classifying diseases using deep learning Full size table The
    authors in [118] used deep learning (DL) to detect powdery mildew (PM), persistent
    fungal disease in strawberries to reduce the amount of unnecessary fungicide use,
    and the need for field scouts. ResNet-50 gave the highest CA of 98.11% in classifying
    the healthy and infected leaves; however, considering the computation time, AlexNet
    had the fastest processing time, at 40.73 s, to process 2320 images with a CA
    of 95.59%. The four selected CNNs, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-50
    were found to be commonly used in agriculture applications [119]. In [120], authors
    evaluated AlexNet and SqueezeNet for detecting disease in tomatoes and yielded
    similar accuracies. Similarly, GoogLeNet (Inception), has been used for disease
    detection in cassava [121, 122]. Lastly, [123] compared different versions of
    the ResNet algorithm for detecting tomato diseases, where it was determined that
    ResNet-50 outperformed ResNeXt-50. The authors [124] trained a deep convolutional
    neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases. The trained model
    achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility
    of this approach. 2.1.3 Crop Phenotyping The total of all observable characteristics
    of an organism can be defined as phenotype. The essential features may include
    personality, biochemical properties, size, and color. The plant’s ontogenic, physiological,
    anatomic, and biochemical characteristics vary with the stage of development,
    while it has constant morphological characteristics [125]. Additionally, during
    growth and development, the phenotype incorporates an enormous number of functions,
    structures, processes, and structures [126]. For cultivar development, successful
    breeding, efficient phenotype evaluation are required. Research bears that the
    main challenge in plant breeding is improving the yield. In order to increase
    the time and lower the cost of data acquisition and analyses, Dee and French [127]
    aimed to propose an automated system that could identify and measure objects from
    an image without human assistance in 2015. Coppens et al. in 2017 [128] presents
    advances in robotized imagery characterization techniques which allow increases
    in the number of phenotype evaluations, mitigating the supposed measurement bottleneck
    for functional genotyping research. In 2016, Bai et al. [129] utilized five different
    types of sensors, ultrasonic distance sensors, portable spectrometers that use
    red, green, RGB cameras, and near-infrared spectroscopy for high throughput phenotyping
    in plant breeding and developmental phenotyping. There are four different hyperspectral
    sensor technologies: push broom, filter-based, non-imaging, and two, which are
    specialized for various purposes. They may be used for the resistance of a particular
    disease in agriculture, however. Another prominent example of a set of an application
    of mathematical algorithms to classification is the simplex volume maximization
    (SVM) approach [130]. SVM methods are primarily applied in the literature for
    classification and stress phenotyping [131]. However, an improved understanding
    of the process may make it possible to apply methods such as K-means clustering,
    ANN, Gaussian Mixture Models, etc., more efficiently. Autonomous ground vehicles
    can be used for things like a telepresence robot that can test plant stalks for
    strength and gather plant genetic data with an array of sensors that does not
    make contact, more importantly [132]. Another phenotypic platform is a metaphorical
    platform [133]. Autonomous ground vehicles (Vinobot) and mobile observation platforms
    (Vinoculer) work together to form an architecture [134]. This is advantageous
    because the ground vehicle could be outfitted with sensors to obtain specific
    information about individual plants, while the lookout tower could monitor an
    entire field and focus on particular specimens. Remote sensing and on-the-the-the-ground
    technologies are yet another way to access or collect data [135]. Deep Phenomics
    (pre-trained neural networks) provide pre-trained models for phenotyping, as well
    as personal application to plant scientists [136]. Three experiments were performed
    to evaluate the image-based phenotype tasks: the leaf counting test, the classification
    of mutants, and the age-regression work. Reynolds et al. [137] studied cost-effective
    imaging devices and environmental sensors, focusing on their trade-off in investment.
    Lowering the cost of ecological sensors [138] or embedded mobile phone sensors
    [139] has allowed new options such as “affordable phenotyping” or “cost-effective
    phenotyping” to emerge in recent years. The crop phenotyping process is depicted
    in Fig. 10 below. Fig. 10 Crop phenotyping process. a Computation for Phenotyping
    diagram [140], b Image acquisition for Phenotyping [141] Full size image 2.1.4
    Optimised Management of Input Fertilisers and Pesticides Filtration of soil involves
    enormous effort and money. That study found that a conservative estimate says
    about 5.6 billion pounds of pesticides are applied every year globally. Pattern
    recognition and decades of crop conditions allow an effective reduction in pesticide
    usage. Identifying pests is made easier with image-based pest control apps, and
    then one can use an app to guide in finding the proper one. Agents help deliver
    only the appropriate amount of pesticides to the crop, as excessive quantities
    can be dangerous to humans. Diverse environmental conditions, such as improper
    temperature and humidity during plant production cycles, allow plant pathogens,
    such as fungal and nematode microorganisms and rodents to proliferate. Thirty
    years ago, products for farmers that contained agrochemicals started appearing
    on the market and rapidly changed agriculture. With new technological advances
    in chemical treatments, including pesticides, antibiotics, and insecticides, farmers
    finally made unwanted insects and bacteria less of a problem. Of course, crop
    damage is lessened by using these chemicals, but on both the environment and human
    health, and it does so in different ways like more environmentally friendly and
    less toxic chemicals. The researchers at the University of Delhi were able to
    produce chemicals only for specific insect species using ML tool-based technology
    called NeuroPIpred. However, in insects and certain other animals such as mollusks,
    so-like neuropeptides are considered necessary for all of their biological and
    behavioral activities such as metabolism and reproduction. NeuroPIpred takes in
    an insect neuropeptide composition and turns this into a new kind of insect poison
    that kills only the target species. Agrochemical pollution has been a worldwide
    concern for the past few decades. 2.1.4.1 Pest Detection Using Conventional Data
    Mining Methods Several works have been carried out by the researchers for rice
    pest detection. Zhou et al. [142] proposed an enhanced area-based fully convolutional
    networks panicle identification and counting system in order to detect and count
    the rice in the field, and this system can be used to automate the rice phenotype
    measurements. Liu et al. [143] proposed a UAV-based computer vision system to
    identify the agricultural airboat position information, which is used in autonomous
    fertilizing as well as herbicide applications. The presented system can inspect
    the paddy field with the help of UAV. Barrero et al. [144] proposed a method to
    fuse high resolution RGB and low-resolution multispectral images for identifying
    the Gramineae weed in case of rice fields dealing with plants by considering fifty
    days after emergence. Li et al. [145] focus on Capsnet to track rice images. The
    Capsnet is used to train classification, and the output vector is predicted by
    focusing on routing by agreement protocol. Kitpo et al. [146] proposed an IoT-based
    drone implementation system for the detection and classification of rice diseases.
    Qin et al. [147] focus on the impact of spraying parameters such as operation
    velocity and height of UAV on the droplet deposition in the case of rice canopy
    as well as the protection efficiency against the hoppers (plant). Table 4 gives
    the state of the art works on automated pesticide tasks in the agriculture domain.
    Table 4 A summary of the papers dealing with the optimal use of fertilizers &
    pesticides in smart agriculture context Full size table 2.1.4.2 Pest Detection
    Using Deep Learning Methods The authors in [156] present an embedded system enhanced
    with ML functionalities, ensuring continuous detection of pest infestation inside
    fruit orchards. The embedded solution is based on a low-power embedded sensing
    system along with a neural accelerator able to capture and process images inside
    common pheromone-based traps. Results show how it is possible to automate the
    task of pest infestation for unlimited time without the farmer’s intervention.
    Deep learning techniques have been used to achieve an entirely automated, real-time
    pest monitoring system by removing the human from the loop [157]. Lima et al.
    [158] is one of the recent works that exploit ML techniques to classify insects.
    The researchers [159] build a deep learning model having the ability to explore
    the meaningful features in the task of classification automatically that actually
    prepare a complete roadmap in order to detect the seriousness of the disease.
    The VGG model reached its best, having an accuracy of 93.5% over existing validation
    data. Barbedo [160] worked on image segmentation method to identify plant diseases
    in black and white background and try to reduce human error while taking less
    time in identifying these diseases. Many of the papers [161, 162] on image-based
    plant diseases identification follow some basic approaches for pre-processing
    by removing the background and segmenting the lesion tissue of the diseased plant.
    In [163], the authors have discussed the detection of the unhealthy region of
    plant leaves; they have used minimum distance criteria and an SVM classifier on
    the plant leaf diseases using texture features. In [164], the authors propose
    a method to detect infections in apple fruit and timely prevention of further
    infections caused by environmental factors and claimed to have achieved 88% recognition
    rate. Jiang et al. [165] proposed a CNN model for apple leaves disease detection
    by improving CNN for real-time detection of the disease from an image dataset.
    A new mobile application to automatically classify pests using a deep-learning
    solution for supporting specialists and farmers is introduced in [166]. The study
    has been successfully validated on five groups of pests; called Aphids, Cicadellidae,
    Flax Budworm, Flea Beetles, and Red Spider, and the method displayed 99.0% accuracy.
    Various capabilities of state-of-the-art (SoA) object detection models based on
    CNN for the task of detecting beetle-like pest insects on non-homogeneous images
    is studied in work [167]. The authors in [168] developed a disease detection tool
    for banana plants with five different CNN architectures. Table 5 gives some more
    state-of-the-art works on automated pesticide tasks in the agriculture domain.
    Table 5 A summary of the papers of optimal use of fertilizers & pesticides in
    smart agriculture context using deep learning Full size table 2.1.5 Weed Detection
    and Management Weeds proliferate, interfere with yield and profits, followed by
    fungus. Currently, they are the most popular choice, but in terms of both effectiveness
    and cost, herbicides are problematic. Secondly, the longer herbicides are left
    in the soil, the more weeds are developing resistance to them and can survive.
    The system is about to fundamentally change how farmers detect infested regions.
    Autonomous herbicide-spraying has been implemented by California-based Blue River
    Technology’s creation, called See & Spray, which can select and dispense herbicides
    only on unwanted plants. The technology reduces the amount of chemicals required
    by 80%. Tailoring herbicide programs is also made easier because of the use of
    See & Spray’s weed profiling feature. Extreme over-irrigation is a risk factor
    for pseudomonas, amoeba, and larvae of eels and parasites and biocides (pharmaceuticals,
    chemicals, etc.) in the produce. Many data-mining techniques have been developed
    to study the need for various crop and growth cycles for irrigation systems. Data
    mining is critical to measuring the consumption and distribution of water using
    climatic elements, crop factors, and economic factors. In a farm, it is imperative
    to have control of the pests. Many researchers have studied plant mapping by using
    ML, though [176, 177]. Lots of unmanned aerial mapping machines for doing optimization
    of the field have been designed and used. IoT-controlled flying machines NB-IoT
    is suitable for handling and shaping a large amount of data. Table 6 gives some
    more state-of-the-art works on automated weed detection in the agriculture domain.
    Table 6 Machine learning techniques for weed detection Full size table 2.1.6 Water
    Analysis and Optimal Irrigation If the fields are to be productive, they must
    be irrigated frequently. ML uses historical data to ensure adequate irrigation
    of each field’s unique moisture levels. Optimal irrigation had been a challenge
    for farmers in the past, but now machine learning has taken care of it. The ML
    robots can also measure the moisture of the field in real-time and ensure that
    irrigation water application on all points of the field is allocated in an isobotonic
    pattern. Even with traditional agriculture, it is impossible to accomplish this
    on the cheap. The necessity of the water to the global food supply can be imagined,
    given that 70% of global freshwater is for irrigation. Especially in regions where
    rainfall is scarce, water management is critical. Nevertheless, here again, this
    has more to do with the environment as the global population and food consumption
    are increasing. This is a problem in the worldwide market, and ML-powered smart
    irrigation solutions could help to solve it. Advanced meteorological and geographic
    sensor systems are connected to multiple in-field sensors or satellites that can
    measure the temperature, moisture, rainfall, and growth data. Given enough data,
    the irrigation system becomes smart and minimizes efforts to use water while increasing
    water use. For example, among other things, California-based ConsertWater uses
    satellite data, weather, topography, and geographical location to determine the
    amount of water required for a particular field. The app’s beauty is that it doesn’t
    require ground sensors to be installed and works all the time. Even though the
    app looks simple, it claims to save 30% of the water that’s used by farmers. Several
    methods for water control in an agricultural setting, as well as a water quality
    analysis, have been implemented [190, 191]. An automated irrigation system to
    conduct the study of water needs in the field is proposed in [192]. These sensors
    are installed throughout the field to gather data regarding different factors,
    namely soil moisture, soil temperature, and soil composition (PH). The Naive Bayes
    technique is used to estimate the required amount of water. For an agricultural
    operation, this technique considers the weather forecasts to regulate the amount
    of water supply to be applied to the crops and recommends specific fertilizers.
    Perea et al. [193] propose an intelligent irrigation system that ensures a just
    and well-considered use of water by integrating the Decision Tree with the Non-Dominated
    Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) genetic algorithm. Xie et al. [194], in
    2017, suggest a smart irrigation system consisting of the components: A solar
    demand estimation used to determine the time and energy required to do the following
    task using the support vector regression method, and on-demand scheduling is used
    to reduce the cost of irrigation. This feature takes advantage of numerical weather
    prediction (NWP) and incorporates it into the time of use model (TOU). Results
    showed that water and energy resources could be saved by 7.97%, and this resulted
    in a total amortization of 25.34%. Kokonis et al. [195] made a case for using
    a fuzzy neural network for irrigation by suggesting the FITRA. The algorithm determines
    how much water the irrigation should be applied based on data. To cut down on
    water consumption, several sensors are used to increase production and maximize
    moisture levels. Goldstein et al. [196] devised an irrigation recommendation system
    in 2018. Several regression and classification algorithms were applied using a
    number of prediction models. Data from different sources, including weather sensors,
    meteorological, and sensor-based systems, was utilized to make real-time control
    possible. The authors [197] proposed a novel CNN calibration method for the NIR
    image data. Its architecture is extremely simple, with one layer of convolution
    and one layer of pooling layer. In a data-driven way, the decision tree algorithm
    was used to extract the most informative features. The work [198] proposes a framework
    that enables advanced fuzzy logic to control a pump’s switching time according
    to user-defined variables, whereby sensors are the central aspect of and contributor
    to the system. An overview of IoT-based irrigation systems for agriculture is
    presented in [199]. A review of monitoring and control mechanisms for precision
    irrigation systems is considered in [200]. IoT technologies, practices, and future
    studies are investigated in [201] for smart agriculture, and important agricultural
    applications are highlighted and discussed. In these studies, a detailed survey
    is carried out on smart agricultural monitoring in both simulated and real environments.
    A LoRaWAN and fog computing-based architecture for deploying smart irrigation
    systems is proposed in [202]. In [203], a graphical user interface application
    for multifractal analysis of soil and plant structures is presented for Windows
    platforms. In [204], a user-friendly mobile application called REUTIVAR-App for
    fertigation scheduling using reclaimed water is presented in olive groves, and
    daily real-time irrigation and fertilization schedule recommendations at farm
    scale are monitored. In [205], the authors developed an algorithm named optimized
    algorithm of sensor node deployment for agricultural (OASNDFA) for intelligent
    agricultural monitoring based on an optimized theory for the least required sensor
    nodes in agricultural fields. The authors in [206] used drone remote sensing techniques
    to detect trees with similar symptoms to trees infected with PWD. The SVM had
    an overall accuracy of 94.13%, which is 6.7% higher than the overall accuracy
    of the ANN, which was 87.43%. The study proposes developing the low-cost unmanned
    aerial system (UAS) for precision agriculture tasks called AgriQ [207]. Table
    7 gives some more state-of-the-art works on automated irrigation control in the
    agriculture domain. Table 7 Features of the studies dealing with the irrigation
    task in smart agriculture Full size table 2.1.7 Harvesting Robots, Drones, Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in Smart Agriculture
    For large-scale farming, labor costs form a significant part of farming expenses.
    Like many other steps in traditional plantation agriculture, harvesting, too,
    uses an enormous workforce. Anything that causes the crop to remain unharvested
    will lower the return on investment. Robotic harvesters identify and extract the
    crops at the appropriate stage. This is both good for saving on labor costs and
    helps assure that the quality of the harvest is preserved and delivered to the
    customer at the right time and in the process. The ML techniques and tools employed
    in crop production also show up in livestock production. The machines do the work
    and supervise or manage the farms. The datasets are combined to aid in the diagnosis
    of disease and/damage detection. This example, as shown here in Fig. 11, gives
    an excellent view of the general health of the plants’ conditions. Drones use
    scanning systems that cover large areas on pre-set routes. Computer vision is
    used throughout the production of these as well. Images are used for creating
    multi-spectral images for crop analysis, plant monitoring, weed detection, and
    to determine if the disease is present and if plant health and drought is affecting
    crop productivity. When taking the total amount of potential yields into consideration,
    this is a reasonable estimate of the crop yield. More widely used robot applications
    include weed picking [217] and precision chemical application [218] employing
    machine vision. Fig. 11 Autonomous Mobile Robots used in Precision Agriculture

    [225] Full size image Various different uses of drones and automated vehicles
    in smart agriculture are discussed in the following sub-section. It’s a good match
    for greenhouse horticulture due to its low maintenance demands and controllable
    ecosystem. Environmental variability among crop parameters makes it difficult
    for traditional agriculture and environmental regulations to adjust to plant growth
    cycles. IoT sensors and actuators are proposed to control the environmental conditions
    for a specific kind of plant species. Artificial neural network (ANN) determines
    the conditions in the IoT cloud [226,227,228]. Waheed et al. [229] conducted a
    series of experiments in 2006 to classify hyperspectral imagery of experimental
    cornfields into categories of moisture stress, weediness, and nitrogen application
    rates using classification and regression trees (CART). A full spectrum analysis
    found that classification accuracy was 96% for the irrigation factor, 83% for
    the nitrogen, and 100% for the weed management methods. Additionally, both ANN
    [230] and SVM [231] are pattern recognition methods that may be used to handle
    hyperspectral data. Aqeel-ur-Rehman, in 2014 et al. [232] reviewed the applications
    of WSNs in agriculture and cited the necessity for sensors in this area. The major
    purpose of the authors’ work was to implement sensors and networks for beneficial
    and productive solutions in agriculture. Keshtari and Deljoo [233] applied WSN
    to farming in 2012. Usually, WSNs are used for data collection, storage, collection,
    and data sharing. The primary goal is to be in tune with the real-time environmental
    properties of climatology and sensing data. High-quality remote monitoring and
    control for the design, construction, installation, and verification of a distributed
    WSN was the primary goal for this project. Bhatnagar and Chandra [234] focused
    on soil health monitoring that shows the instantaneous reading of various parameters
    such as temperature, soil moisture, pH, and humidity in the screen of a farmer’s
    smartphone. Dasig et al. [235] have discussed the implementation of IoT and WSN
    for precision agriculture in detail, emulating the advancement toward Agricultural
    4.0. Yu et al. [236] have developed “Plant Spike,” a low-cost, energy-efficient
    WSN system for soil health monitoring. Nurzaman et al. [237] used IoT for crop
    health monitoring and also to maximize agricultural output. AgriTalk, a cost-effective
    IoT platform, was designed and tested for turmeric cultivation in [238]. Goswami
    et al. [239] developed an IoT-based soil health monitoring system that monitors
    macronutrients N (Nitrogen), P (Phosphorus), K (Potassium), pH, soil moisture,
    and soil humidity. Authors in [240] designed and developed an IoT enhanced device—FarmFox,
    which can analyze the sensed information and transmitting it to the user via the
    internet. In [241], the researchers propose a holistic smart agriculture application
    that consists of various agricultural sensors, drones, and IoT hardware and software
    utilities. Table 8 gives some more state-of-the-art works on Iot and WSN in the
    smart agriculture domain. Table 8 Example of IoT/AI applications in smart agriculture
    Full size table 2.1.8 Crop and Yield Management Crop yield prediction is an essential
    task for the decision-makers at the national and regional levels (EU level) for
    rapid decision-making. An accurate crop yield prediction model can help farmers
    to decide on what to grow and when to grow. There are different approaches to
    crop yield prediction. The primary reason for farmers’ concerns is the assumption
    that crop yields will be low, with the environmental parameters expected to have
    the most significant impact on the market. Like any other type of modeling, it
    can be characterized as a machine learning problem. Extensive research has been
    done on this subject. If yield mapping was done using an ML technique, it could
    be used in farms utilizing IoT information for yield surveillance through the
    old molecularly. Information collected will be used to provide data on land-use
    yields. In addition, ML systems, together with IoT, are utilized in agriculture
    to estimate and improve yields. There is a direct correlation between the Internet
    of Things and agriculture. Other works demonstrate that ML systems can be built
    on the IoT and can give real-time feedback [268, 269]. 2.1.8.1 Crop Yield Prediction
    Using Conventional Data Mining Methods The authors in [270] proposed an improved
    multilayer perceptron (MLP) approach to predict the amount of sugar yield production
    in IoT agriculture. Experimental results show that the proposed MLP algorithm
    has maximum accuracy of 99%, the precision of 95%, recall of 96%, minimum mean
    absolute error (MAE) of 0.04%, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.006% for
    detecting sugarcane yield production. Tumer et al. [271] proposed a classification
    method to evaluate the process of crystallization syrup in sugar production using
    an artificial neural network. Kaburlasos et al. [272] presented a fuzzy-based
    approach to predict inclusion measure function for hellenic sugar industry (HIS).
    Elavarasan et al. [273] performed a survey of publications on machine learning
    models associated with crop yield prediction based on climatic parameters. Liakos
    et al. [274] discussed the application of machine learning in the agricultural
    sector. The authors in [275] performed a review study on determining the ripeness
    of fruits to decide the optimal harvest time and yield prediction. 2.1.8.2 Crop
    Yield Prediction Using Deep Learning Methods Table 9 gives some more state of
    artworks of deep learning in crop yield prediction. Table 9 A summary of the works
    of optimal crop yield in the smart agriculture context Full size table Table 10
    below offers some commercially available AI-based smart tools for precision agriculture
    and farming. Table 10 Commercially available Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based
    tools for smart agriculture Full size table 3 Discussions Agriculture has faced
    considerable challenges such as a lack of irrigation systems, climate changes,
    groundwater density, food scarcity and waste, and much more. The reception of
    distinct cognitive solutions has a significant impact on the fate of cultivating.
    Despite the fact that large-scale research is still underway and some applications
    are now on the market, the industry remains underserved. Farming is still in its
    infancy when it comes to dealing with real-world difficulties and solving them
    with autonomous decision-making and predictive solutions. It is pretty obvious
    that two activities must be completed in order to diagnose and classify a disease
    from a leaf: Image processing techniques such as pre-processing, segmentation,
    and others are first applied to the image samples, followed by machine learning
    approaches. The state-of-the-art research points that the Fuzzy K-NN was proven
    to be quite effective and accurate for nutrient deficit and potassium shortage
    in tomato leaves. SVM and CNN, on the other hand, outperform K-NN and random forest
    algorithms in terms of disease detection and categorization of tomato leaves.
    Bacterial spot, early blight, late blight, leaf mold, septoria spot, spider mite,
    healthy, target spot tomato mosaic virus, and tomato yellow leaf curl virus were
    all detected with 99.25% accuracy by the CNN. In addition, the PlantVillage dataset
    was the most commonly utilized dataset for training in most of the current research
    work in the literature linked to the categorization of illness and infected tomato
    leaves. Pretrained transfer learning techniques, such as AlexNet architecture,
    might be an easy alternative for not only obtaining high detection accuracy but
    also saving both expenses and coding labor in the identification of potato leaves.
    CNN has the highest accuracy of 98.33% among the available classifiers, followed
    by BPNN, MSVM, ANN, SVM, and RF techniques. Deep learning models such as DCNN
    performed admirably, while machine learning approaches such as MSVM, ANN, SVM,
    and RF also performed admirably. Various existing works had captured real photographs
    for their rice illness diagnosis. In detecting and categorizing illnesses in paddy
    leaves, CNN-based models have reached the highest level of accuracy. The use of
    deep learning in the field of agricultural disease picture recognition has yielded
    a number of significant results. Deep learning approaches, on the other hand,
    are primarily data-driven, rendering them vulnerable to the following drawbacks:
    The training process is prone to over-fitting in the absence of large-scale labeled
    training sets, making it challenging to develop an optimum model. The number of
    parameters in the model grows exponentially as the complexity of the models grows,
    limiting their generalizability. The models must be trained from scratch for each
    new dataset and task, increasing the hardware requirements and computational cost
    and potentially limiting their practical applicability. Transfer learning may
    take models taught in one domain and apply them to another, resulting in high-quality
    model learning and creation on the basis of minimal amounts of data. This strategy
    avoids the drawbacks of deep learning techniques, such as their reliance on vast
    volumes of labeled training data. When faced with low data resources, transfer
    learning is particularly well suited for agricultural disease picture recognition.
    Applications must be more resilient in order to explore the vast potential of
    AI in agriculture. Only then would it be capable of handling frequent changes
    in external conditions, facilitating real-time decision making, and utilizing
    a suitable framework/platform for efficiently collecting contextual data. Another
    significant factor is the high expense of many cognitive farming technologies
    available on the market. To ensure that technology reaches the masses, solutions
    must become more affordable. The solutions would be more economical if they were
    built on an open-source platform, leading to faster acceptance and higher penetration
    among farmers. Farmers will benefit from the technology since it will help them
    achieve higher yields and a more consistent seasonal harvest. Artificial intelligence,
    from detecting pests to predicting which crops will yield the best returns, can
    help humanity meet one of its most pressing challenges: feeding an additional
    2 billion people by 2052, despite climate change disrupting growing seasons, turning
    arable land into deserts, and flooding once-fertile deltas with seawater. Farmers
    in many nations, including India, rely on the monsoon for their crops. They are
    primarily reliant on weather forecasts from several departments, particularly
    for rain-fed agriculture. AI will be useful in predicting weather and other agricultural
    circumstances such as land quality, groundwater, crop cycle, and pest assault,
    among others. These sensors have a lot of potential in agriculture. Data such
    as soil quality, weather, and groundwater level, among other things, can be derived
    by agriculture scientists and used to optimize the cultivation process. In order
    to collect data, AI-enabled sensors can be integrated in robotic harvesting equipment.
    It’s been suggested that AI-based advisories could help enhance productivity by
    30%. The most difficult aspect of farming is crop damage caused by natural disasters,
    such as pest attacks. The majority of the time, farmers lose their crops owing
    to a lack of sufficient information. In this cyber age, technology might be beneficial
    to farmers in protecting their crops from cyber-attacks. Many businesses have
    adopted this strategy. Such operations have shown to be helpful in the past, providing
    motivation to develop a system to monitor and safeguard crops. NatureFresh Farms,
    a 20-year-old company that grows veggies on 185 acres between Ontario and Ohio,
    is developing and researching the technique. Knowing how many tomatoes will be
    available to sell in the future makes the sales team’s job easier and benefits
    the bottom line directly. According to data from prominent universities, there
    is a significant amount of food waste around the world, which may be addressed
    with the correct algorithms, which will not only save time and money but also
    lead to long-term development. 4 Challenges and Future Scope of Data Mining in
    Smart Agriculture A wide range of challenges applies to the gathering, processing,
    and making use of data for agricultural productivity. One of the significant issues
    that farmers have to face in order to thrive in the age of information is data
    security and ensuring privacy. Data availability and quality problems are frequently
    found in agricultural information systems. When there is more data in real-time,
    this gets much more complicated. Data efficiency and spatial semantic integration
    are often a struggle when it comes to data mining. 4.1 Challenges The applications
    of machine learning and deep learning in the field of agriculture are huge, with
    many challenges. 4.1.1 Privacy The agricultural information contains their personal
    data (identity, geographical location, financial data, entrepreneurial knowledge,
    etc.). Most farmers who have their information made available through digital
    platforms will be unaware of what it says about them. True, farmers are unaware
    that their personal information is being gathered and used, and even more worrisome,
    what it is being used for. Data mining provides organizations with the opportunity
    to focus on people to accumulate and collect enormous amounts of information about
    farmers, which could be enough to create and analyze a personality or psychological
    portrait of the subjects. Even if this data could be misused, there is the danger
    that it will injure his reputation or just get discovered and fall into the wrong
    hands. This could also make it difficult for him to carry out his normal activities.
    They need to be reassured that their data will be used to develop creative ideas
    but not for competitive advantage. Data mining can make it difficult for farmers
    to keep their personal information private. Privacy and confidentiality policies
    require substantial time and resources to implement. 4.1.2 Available Databases
    and Size Issue It is difficult to obtain leaf images for specific plant infections.
    Due to this fact, the sizes of the available plant data sets are very small. Only
    limited works have reported thousands of images for research purposes. Due to
    the small database size problem, a large portion of the data set is used for the
    training phase in most of the deep learning methods. Furthermore, the available
    database images are collected in very constrained environmental conditions. We
    believe that images must be gathered in real-world conditions to make the algorithms
    more practical. Efficient image acquisition of leaf images is the need of the
    hour. If these images are captured in real-time scenarios, such databases would
    be warmly welcomed in the research community. From this survey, it is observed
    that many researchers use data source sites like Kaggle, Meandly, IEEE Dataport,
    etc., to get the data to build models. If the required data is not available then
    researchers need to build their own dataset. 4.1.3 Quality and Precision of Data
    A lot of data needs to be gathered and transformed into information if we want
    to succeed in agriculture. Traditional analytical tools have been ineffective
    against the sheer weight of this new data. Crop management will be vastly improved
    with the use of data mining analysis. Excellent data quality is needed to get
    helpful information from the DM process. Agricultural data usually comes from
    different databases and models and is thus messy, as well as the presence of many
    missing pieces. Data collected through these systems is missing, has lots of problems
    and inconsistencies. There is significant work that needs to be done before the
    data can be processed in the data mining process. Providing data for models can
    face a number of obstacles and challenges such as uncertainty, indefinite persistence,
    and incapability, and therefore calls for data processing (geographical and temporal).
    Using more data is inevitable. Accordingly, both syntax and semantics must be
    harmonized to guarantee data portability in a (definitions). Better data handling
    allows all kinds of new kinds of analysis and product development. Reliability
    is a major concern for IoT devices in terms of data transmission. Devices need
    to gather and transfer reliable data in order to make appropriate decisions when
    necessary. False reading will greatly reduce system reliability. 4.1.4 Unnecessary
    Noise and Background in Crop’s The technique of image segmentation is utilized
    to retrieve the infected section from an image. When the image background comprises
    colors other than white and black or other features such as plants, leaves, dirt,
    grass, and so on, extracting the contaminated leaf segment from an image becomes
    difficult. If farmers want to diagnose crop illnesses in real-time from the fields,
    the photo may have a lot of background features. As a result, the system must
    be able to remove all extraneous elements from the image so that just the desired
    segment remains. 4.1.5 Image Capture Conditions The images in all available datasets
    were recorded in a controlled environment in laboratories, and in other cases,
    images were generated utilising animation techniques, according to the literature.
    Consider what happens if a farmer or capturing equipment in the field tries to
    catch the same thing at different times of the day. Because of many variable characteristics
    such as different light intensity, dampness, and other environmental factors,
    it is difficult to acquire a similar image in that circumstance. As a result,
    photographs of the same leaf must be captured from several perspectives, at various
    times, and under various climatic circumstances. 4.1.6 Issues with Available Feature
    Extraction Methods Preprocessing, feature extraction, and segmentation are all
    important steps in constructing a machine learning-based system. The type of data
    collection plays a role in determining the best preprocessing and segmentation
    strategy. The technique that is best suited for a certain acquisition is usually
    the one that is used. We’ve seen a lot of variation in the algorithms that have
    been published so far across different modules. 4.1.7 Difficulties in Classification
    Module For a long time, plant disease automation and detection have been a hot
    topic of research. Researchers claim highly acceptable results despite using very
    few photos for training and testing. Researchers in this field are looking into
    a variety of classifiers. According to the findings, backpropagation neural networks,
    SVM, and discriminant analysis (especially linear) outperform the competition.
    After that, Nave Bayes, random forest, nearest neighbor, and multilayer perceptron
    are used. However, newly established optimized deep neural networks significantly
    improve state-of-the-art outcomes. Deep convolutional neural networks can assist
    improve the outcomes for enormous data sets if they are used more effectively.
    4.1.8 Evaluation Measures There are a variety of metrics that can be used to compare
    different classification algorithms. True-positive (TP) refers to the number of
    infected samples that were correctly recognized; true-negative (TN) refers to
    the number of healthy photos that were correctly detected. False-positives (FPs)
    are a measure of the number of healthy samples that were mistakenly identified
    as infectious. Finally, false-negative (FN) samples are infected samples that
    were mistakenly classified as healthy. The ratio of correct classifications (TP + FP)
    to total classifications (TP + FP + TN + FN) is known as accuracy. The ratio of
    correctly recognized samples as infected (TP) to the total samples identified
    as infected is known as precision (sum of TP and FP). Similarly, recall is the
    ratio of TP to the actual number of infected samples (sum of TP and FN). Lastly,
    F-measure represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall. 4.1.9 Concerns
    on devices Device standardization is necessary to ensure that technology may be
    used in a wide range of applications. However, there are no data-processing standards
    formats. And the misreading of the mismatched code can result in different outcomes.
    Machine standardization can help to resolve system, application, equipment, and
    product interoperability difficulties. Furthermore, the development of the 5G
    network has made communication between devices and servers 100 times faster than
    it was with 4G. 5G is a suitable technology for sending data from remote sensors
    because it can transport substantially more data. As a result, the adoption of
    5G as a new communication network is required to meet the needs of more secure
    users and faster data transfer rates. One of the most serious issues is a lack
    of interoperability. 4.1.10 Spatial Data Importance The overall goal of smart
    agriculture is to manage environmental impacts and maximize profit. Conventional
    data mining approaches are typically designed for relational databases but are
    not entirely applicable to geographically dispersed data. For smart farming, new
    data mining methods are required to take into account spatial and temporal correlations
    in the data. 4.1.11 Incorporation of Agricultural Domain Knowledge in Data Mining
    Agriculture is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses a variety of subjects,
    including environmental sciences, agronomy, soils, etc. The data we use in a data
    mining project can come from various sources. Due to the sensor and high data
    throughput, new challenges arise, particularly operable semantics: figuring out
    how to keep the meaning of data and correctly representing it over time? The problem
    of integrating domain knowledge is one of the most challenging problems in data
    mining. It can be thought of as a form of fusion of agriculture, making agricultural
    domain knowledge compatible with data mining research. 4.1.12 Scalability of Data
    Mining algorithms Smart agriculture is responsible for generating enormous amounts
    of data as a result of all the various gadgets in use. Heterogeneous data, in
    particular, is being produced by remote sensors. They will probably have a large
    data set, which will allow them to demonstrate the real relationships. Data mining
    algorithms, however, face the constant requirement of needing to make countless
    decisions in the agricultural sector: Can they handle the volume of data quickly.
    Data mining algorithms need to be scalable with exponential search problems to
    search through these large data sets. The development of parallel and distributed
    algorithms are of critical importance in agricultural data mining. 4.1.13 Drones
    Because the drone can only fly for an hour or less, the flight line path must
    be set with the overlap between the flight lines in mind. Drones are expensive,
    especially those with high-resolution cameras and thermal cameras, as well as
    good software, hardware tools, and devices. Drone operations require licences,
    which can be challenging in many nations, as well as the height not exceeding
    400 feet. Climate conditions have an impact on drone operation. Wind speed and
    wetness have an effect on drone operation; thus, the weather should be considered
    before beginning work. There are a few extra challenges to be aware of: (1) Identifying
    the problem and understanding the business need. (2) Gaining a better understanding
    of the consumer and how they engage with technology. (3) An application that is
    easy to use. (4) Model performance in real-world circumstances. (5) Model power
    consumption and battery restrictions for running the model on devices. (6) Camera
    configurations at the user end for computer vision models. Following are a few
    recommendations based on the results of this in-depth study to make the implementation
    process more efficient, accurate, seamless, and deployable. (1) Concentrate on
    developing a machine learning model to address a specific problem, such as classification
    or recommendation. (2) Create your own dataset for training the model and make
    it available to other researchers via open platforms such as Kaggle, Meandly,
    IEEE Dataport, and so on. (3) Use publicly available datasets for model testing
    and validation. (4) Use “Transfer Learning” approaches to shorten the time it
    takes to train a model. (5) AutoML is a cutting-edge method for creating more
    accurate, high-quality machine learning models in less time. (6) It is advised
    that the model be deployed in a real-time application to assist the intended users.
    4.2 Future Scope The following paragraphs describe some elements that may help
    to improve and enhance the current state-of-the-art and provide researchers with
    some prospective ideas for future research: 4.2.1 Disease Stage Identification
    One of the most critical aspects of plant disease identification is disease stage
    identification. There are various stages to each disease. The majority of the
    researchers concentrated their efforts on disease type identification, but none
    of them focused on disease stage identification. Furthermore, such systems must
    be able to recommend specific measures based on the stage of the disease. Disease
    forecasting will aid agriculturists in taking the appropriate activities and precautions
    to limit the percentage of damage. 4.2.2 Quantification of a Disease The quantification
    of a certain disease is another intriguing subject to investigate. Despite the
    fact that significant research has been done in this area, only a few researchers
    have determined the extent of the disease’s impact. They can be quite beneficial
    since corrective steps can be implemented based on the severity of the sickness.
    This type of quantification will discover the fraction of a culture that is infected
    with a disease. Because the number of pesticides can be managed, this study perspective
    is critical. Normally, farmers use chemicals to treat diseases without first analyzing
    or quantifying them. Such behavior is exceedingly hazardous to human health. Developing
    an effective image processing application will aid in determining whether or not
    specific chemicals are required. 4.2.3 Mobile and Online Applications Several
    solutions for disease identification applications have been presented in the literature.
    However, just a few of the portals and mobile apps are publicly published and
    accessible via the internet. Assess Software and Leaf Doctor are two of these
    applications, both of which are free to use. These programs, on the other hand,
    function with photographs that have a flat, black background. As a result, such
    online systems and apps are critical for identifying plant diseases. The availability
    of technologies like this will aid farmers in identifying a specific illness.
    Such software can be used to generate analysis reports, which can then be sent
    to a disease expert for advice. 4.2.4 Exploring Transfer Learning to Increase
    Data Size Similarly, current tendencies in CV development, which are rapidly going
    toward DL approaches, are not very promising for plant disease diagnosis. Given
    the difficulty of the data, particularly at the training stage, transfer learning
    is the best choice to consider. A heterogeneous domain strategy can be used to
    investigate knowledge transmission. LSTMs, optical flow frames, temporal pooling,
    and 3D convolution are some of the keywords that might be explored in terms of
    automatic plant disease identification. Last but not least, better and more thoroughly
    constructed methodologies are required for further research in this area. The
    case of data augmentation, for example, might be examined further. 4.2.5 Incorporating
    New Technologies in Agriculture Agri-food supply chain traceability requires more
    attention and has significant IoT potential. Meanwhile, the most commonly utilised
    IoT communication technologies in these publications are LoRa, ZigBee, and WiFi,
    while emerging high-speed communication technologies such as 5G and NB-IoT are
    expected to be widely used to enhance agricultural production modernization and
    intelligence. With the advancement of current technology, there is a lot of room
    for IoT-based agriculture to develop new and effective solutions. Low-cost systems
    with advantages such as autonomous operation, low maintenance, energy efficiency,
    ease of use, and sturdy architecture are, particularly in demand. 5 Conclusions
    The value of artificial intelligence is widely recognized across a wide range
    of industries, including agriculture. A segment of technologies in the agricultural
    sector is becoming crucial to business survival. Data lies at the heart of farming
    decisions, and the potential is enormous. More importantly, ML is expected to
    be a source of greater resource efficiency in sustainable resource utilization
    and an enabler of massive environmental benefits. This technology can make a significant
    difference in agriculture if stakeholders in the process see it, have a different
    attitude towards it, and funding can be found. The agricultural industry has a
    number of concerns, including a lack of appropriate irrigation systems, weeds,
    crop yields, plant monitoring issues owing to crop height, and extreme weather
    conditions. However, with the help of technology, performance may be improved,
    and thus these issues can be resolved. It can be improved with AI-driven techniques
    such as remote sensors for detecting soil moisture content and GPS-assisted automated
    irrigation. Farmers’ difficulty was that precision weeding techniques were able
    to offset the high amount of crops lost during the weeding procedure. The self-driving
    robots not only increase productivity but also cut the use of unneeded pesticides
    and herbicides. Aside from that, farmers may use drones to successfully spray
    pesticides and herbicides on their farms, and plant monitoring is no longer a
    hassle. For starters, in agriculture difficulties, man-made brain power can be
    used to understand resource and job shortages. In traditional tactics, a significant
    amount of labor was necessary to get agricultural parameters such as plant height,
    soil texture, and content, which necessitated manual testing, which was time-consuming.
    Quick and non-damaging high throughput phenotyping would be possible with the
    help of the various systems investigated, with the added benefit of flexible and
    favorable activity, on-demand access to information, and spatial goals. In this
    paper, we have discussed how ML in general and DL, in particular, have helped
    identify the diseases in plants, optimal irrigation, pesticides control, crop
    phenotyping, and improved crop yield. If the diseases are not correctly identified,
    they affect the crop yield and ultimately result in long-term issues, such as
    global warming and even famine. It can be deduced from the studies that with precision
    farming, more pragmatic farming may be carried out utilizing scientific methodologies
    such as remote sensing, GPS, data analytics, and so on, resulting in increased
    agricultural productivity and reduced potential environmental damage. In addition,
    the abnormality can be recognized in the plant at an early stage using image recognition
    software, artificial neural networks, and a variety of other technologies. Because
    there are so many different types of crop diseases and so few datasets, fine-tuning
    models that have been pre-trained on large-scale public datasets like PlantVillage
    and ImageNet to be able to do image recognition on the basis of few samples is
    desirable. It can be demonstrated that these methods can reach great levels of
    accuracy when performing plant disease image detection when they are based on
    large-scale open-source datasets and pre-trained models. However, further research
    revealed that the scale of the plant image collection used for modeling, as well
    as the context in which the photos were obtained, might have a significant impact
    on recognition accuracy. The recognition accuracy of systems built using the PlantVillage
    dataset is more remarkable since most of the photos in the dataset were captured
    with a simple background or in a laboratory environment with less interference.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Horticultural protected cultivation has spread
    throughout the world as it has proven to be extremely effective. In recent years,
    the greenhouse engineering research field has become one of the main research
    topics within greenhouse farming. The main objectives of the current study were
    to identify the major research topics and their trends during the last four decades
    by analyzing the co-occurrence network of keywords associated with greenhouse
    engineering publications. A total of 3804 pertinent documents published, in 1981–2021,
    were analyzed and discussed. China, the United States, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands
    have been the most active countries with more than 36% of the relevant literature.
    The keyword cluster analysis suggested the presence of five principal research
    topics: energy management and storage; monitoring and control of greenhouse climate
    parameters; automation of greenhouse operations through the internet of things
    (IoT) and wireless sensor network (WSN) applications; greenhouse covering materials
    and microclimate optimization in relation to plant growth; structural and functional
    design for improving greenhouse stability, ventilation and microclimate. Recent
    research trends are focused on real-time monitoring and automatic control systems
    based on the IoT and WSN technologies, multi-objective optimization approaches
    for greenhouse climate control, efficient artificial lighting and sustainable
    greenhouse crop cultivation using renewable energy. Keywords: automation; bibliometric
    analysis; energy efficiency; greenhouse heating; horticulture; monitoring and
    control systems; protected agriculture; renewable energy; sustainability 1. Introduction
    The need to increase a sustainable food production for a predicted world population
    of 9 billion by 2050 represents a priority for all countries [1]. Protected agriculture
    has enabled us to extend the food production capability in many developed countries
    and, recently, to less prosperous regions of the world. Greenhouses represent
    a symbol of modern agriculture and can have several relevant effects on the economy,
    society, and on agro-ecosystems [2]. The worldwide protected agriculture area
    (including greenhouse and any crop “under cover” production systems) was estimated
    to be 5.6 million ha [3]. Globally, the greenhouse area is estimated to have expand
    multifold in the last decades, comparing the 200,000 ha in 1980 to the 2 million
    ha in 2010, particularly in Asia and the Mediterranean basin [4]. More than 60%
    of the total area of greenhouses in the Mediterranean region was concentrated
    in three countries: Spain (53,843 ha), Italy (42,800 ha) and Turkey (30,669 ha)
    [5]. In Asia, large greenhouse areas were recorded in China (3.4 million ha in
    2010) and Japan (46,000 ha in 2012) [4,6]. In particular, the greenhouse area
    in China underwent a rapid expansion from 1982 to 2010 [6]. Greenhouse systems
    represent a defense measure against unfavorable climatic conditions as well as
    pests and diseases. Furthermore, greenhouses have the great advantage of remarkably
    increasing off-season products, thus satisfying the demand for quality fresh products
    throughout the year by the large-scale retail chains. Greenhouse farming is mainly
    involved in vegetable crops (tomato, pepper, eggplant, zucchini, cucumber, melon,
    squash and lettuce), and to a lesser extent of other commodities, like flowers,
    ornamentals and fruits (mainly strawberries). Tomato, cucumber and sweet pepper
    are the dominant crops [7]. In countries with a mild and warm climate, the greenhouse
    systems are characterized by low technology and a low use of energy inputs, which
    are characteristics that have created, however, some critical issues. The low
    night-time temperatures in winter, and the excessively high day-time temperatures
    in warm periods require proper solutions. These issues are related to the strong
    and direct dependence of the internal microclimate on the external climatic conditions
    [8]. The dominant trend in these areas is the minimal control of the greenhouse
    microclimate that is often limited to natural ventilation, shading techniques
    and emergency heating [9]. In the warmest Mediterranean areas, the greenhouse
    technology is generally based on the principle of minimizing capital investments,
    running costs and energy consumption, thus greenhouses are commonly characterized
    by lightweight structures without artificial heating systems [9,10]. In Northern
    Europe, there is a clear trend to optimize the greenhouse environment in order
    to obtain the maximum crop production potential [8,11]. Greenhouse farming in
    North-Western Europe has evolved in parallel with the emergence of advanced engineering
    technologies, including computerized climate control, soilless cultivation systems
    and agro-robot systems [12,13]. In Mexico and Colombia, naturally ventilated structures
    are mainly used, and greenhouse climate dynamics are primarily affected by the
    local weather conditions because greenhouses are not equipped with heating and
    cooling systems [14,15]. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) studies were applied
    to greenhouses in order to evaluate the inside air flow patterns and temperature
    distribution as affected by the slope of the terrain [16] and by the height and
    ventilation configuration in a Colombian greenhouse [17], the airflow and ventilation
    rates as affected by the greenhouse orientation and roof vent and screen characteristics
    [18]. The great diffusion of greenhouses, however, has been criticized for its
    associated environmental impact due to energy use, plastic waste generation, soil
    pollution, biodiversity degradation, local runoff alteration [19,20], as well
    as for their impact on the visual quality of the surrounding rural landscape [21,22,23].
    The major environmental burden in high-tech greenhouses is represented by the
    high fossil fuel-based energy use; the soilless cultivation with the recirculation
    of drain water allows for achieving a high resource and water use efficiency and
    low N emissions [24]. The greenhouse structure, fertilizers and auxiliary equipment
    were found to be the major environmental burdens in unheated, plastic covered
    multi-tunnels [25]. The necessary frequent replacement of plastic covering films
    generates huge quantities of post-consumer materials that are often improperly
    disposed of, causing environmental and economic problems [26]. Studies on greenhouse
    engineering have been previously reviewed by Hanan [27], Critten and Bailey [28],
    Montero et al. [29], Shamshiri et al. [30], Syed and Hachem [31] and Achour et
    al. [32]. The bibliometric analysis approach, including the performance analysis
    and science mapping techniques, has been used to analyze the quantity and quality
    of the scientific production and to graphically represent the structure of scientific
    activity within a discipline, a research field or a topic area, by applying mathematical
    and statistical methods and data mapping techniques [33,34,35]. This methodology
    is a useful and powerful tool to analyze publishing activities at the level of
    countries, institutions or research groups for comparative analyses of productivity,
    cooperation between universities and research centers, for the description, evaluation
    and monitoring of scientific and technological activities and projects and to
    identify research trends and areas that are developing or regressing [36]. A bibliometric
    analysis can facilitate the development of science-based strategies including
    private and public research management, the development of science and technology
    programs and policies and research strategic decision making [34,37]. HistCite
    [38], CiteSpace [39] and VOSviewer [40] are freely available software widely used
    to create networks of publications, journals, researchers, research institutions,
    countries, keywords or terms [41]. The science mapping approach has been widely
    used in several research areas [42]. In agricultural sciences, this methodology
    has been employed to analyze research trends into various research fields, such
    as global biodiversity [43], structure and evolution of the Mediterranean forest
    [44], plant phenotyping [45], precision agriculture [46], unmanned aerial vehicles
    in agricultural and forestry [47], soil remediation [48], greenhouse farming [49],
    durum wheat and pasta quality [50], agricultural pollution [51], mapping of agricultural
    greenhouses and plastic-mulched crops by remote sensing approach [52] and in the
    study of natural ventilation in protected agricultural structures in tropical
    and subtropical climatic regions using CFD [15]. Considering that the several
    studies published on greenhouse engineering cover a wide range of scientific areas,
    an advanced visualization methodology, such as science mapping, could provide
    a useful alternative tool to analyze the pertinent literature and reveal the structure
    and the evolution of the research activity. The objective of the current work
    was to analyze the global research trends on greenhouse engineering in the last
    four decades through a bibliometric mapping approach. Particularly, our aims were:
    (1) examining the number of publications per journal, country and research institutions
    and the trends in scientific publication outputs; (2) identifying and visualizing
    the main research topics and their relations; and (3) providing a general overview
    of the main topics and their trends over time. To our knowledge, there are no
    studies that have applied this method to analyze the research on such a wide topic
    in the last four decades. This work will provide a general comprehensive knowledge
    on the structure and progress of research in this scientific field. Such knowledge
    could be beneficial to research project funding and to university curricula as
    well as to young researchers, research managers and policy makers who may be interested
    in knowing where, by whom research is being carried out and what are the main
    recent directions of the research progress in greenhouse engineering, a field
    that is undergoing increasing technological and sustainable improvement and application.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Collection The Elsevier’s Scopus database was
    chosen as one of the most widely used data sources for bibliometric analyses.
    It is one of the largest abstract and citation repositories of peer-reviewed literature,
    covering scientific journals, books, conference proceedings, etc. [53]. T bibliographical
    records related to greenhouse engineering research were retrieved using the Scopus
    database. The relevant scientific documents were identified using appropriate
    keywords in the combined fields of title, abstract and keywords; the search terms
    always included “greenhouse” and the terms related to the principal topics of
    the research in greenhouse engineering. Some terms were used with an asterisk
    in order to retrieve documents associated with the derived words. The following
    search equation was typed into Scopus to collect relevant publications: (TITLE-ABS-KEY
    ((greenhouse) AND (“environment monitoring” OR “environment control” OR “wind
    load*” OR “snow load*” OR “construction element” OR “structural element” OR “shading
    net*” OR “insect screen*” OR “covering material” OR “CFD” OR “computational fluid
    dynamic” OR “internet of things” OR “thermal* control*” OR “pest protection” OR
    “ventilation system” OR “cooling system” OR “heating system”)) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY
    (“greenhouse energy” OR “intelligent greenhouse” OR “intelligent agricultural
    greenhouse” OR “greenhouse automation” OR “greenhouse cover*” OR “greenhouse cladding”
    OR “greenhouse climate control” OR “greenhouse conditioning” OR “greenhouse heating”
    OR “greenhouse cooling” OR “greenhouse dehumidification” OR “greenhouse glazing”
    OR “greenhouse lighting” OR “greenhouse microclimate” OR “greenhouse monitoring”
    OR “greenhouse shading” OR “greenhouse structure” OR “greenhouse design” OR “greenhouse
    engineering” OR “sustainable greenhouse” OR “photovoltaic greenhouse” OR “smart
    greenhouse” OR “greenhouse film”)). The document search was carried out in April
    2022 by restricting the research to original publications written in English (article,
    book chapter, book, reviews and conference papers) and published in the last four
    decades (1981–2021) in order to capture the evolution dynamics of the research
    field over a long period. Regional research published in other languages was therefore
    not included in the current bibliometric analysis. Although the initial number
    of documents retrieved was high, the number was reduced after conducting a search
    refinement based on the application of filters for terms included in the title,
    abstract or keywords, based on the abstract reading and keywords analysis in order
    to get a more detailed view on greenhouse engineering for crop production. Some
    keywords such as “global warming”, “greenhouse warming”, “greenhouse gas”, “greenhouse
    effect”, “paleo*”, “cretace*”, “icehouse”, “thermosphere*”, “ionosphere*” were
    excluded to prevent the downloading of documents on climate change, climatology
    and related aspects, or on technologies based on the exploitation of the greenhouse
    effect. 2.2. Bibliometric Analysis and Clustering The records were analyzed in
    order to obtain the number of publications per year in the examined period, the
    subject categories of each publication, the journals where the documents were
    published and their SCImago Journal Rank (SJR), their Scopus CiteScore (CS) and
    their highest CiteScore percentile (HP), as well as the articles with more citations.
    The SJR indicator is built on the Scopus database and considers the number of
    citations received by a given journal and the prestige of the journals where the
    citations are mentioned. It is defined as the average number of weighted citations
    received in a year per document published in a given journal in the previous three
    years. The SJR weighs each incoming citation of the journal by the SJR of the
    citing journal [54]. The CiteScore is calculated as the ratio of the number of
    citations received by articles, reviews, conference papers, book chapters and
    data papers of a given journal over four years and published in those same four
    years, over the number of the same documents [55]. The CS and HP are also calculated
    from the Scopus data. The VOSviewer bibliometric mapping program version 1.6.16
    (www.vosviewer.com, accessed on 1 June 2021), developed by Van Eck and Waltman
    [40], was used for the bibliometric analysis. We conducted a co-occurrence keyword
    analysis and a co-authorship analysis of the retrieved publications, and some
    bibliometric maps were built to represent, in two dimensions, the research area
    of greenhouse engineering and to identify the knowledge structure of the research
    topics. The keywords network representing the different research themes on greenhouse
    engineering was built by assigning keywords to a cluster based on their co-occurrences
    in the publications. One cluster is represented by terms (in the same color) belonging
    to a general or specific research theme; one or more research topics can be identified
    in a cluster. The terms occurring at least five times were considered in the current
    study. Duplicated keywords as singular and plural of a term or synonymous terms
    were previously merged into a single keyword in order to conduct a more accurate
    assessment of the relative importance of specific keywords within the thematic
    clusters. The co-operative network of key authors was used to identify the collaboration
    among contrasting key researchers. All co-authors of an article were considered,
    excluding papers with more than 25 authors. Authors with a minimum of 10 documents
    were considered in the current study. The different colors highlight the clusters
    of authors who usually collaborate with each other. Figure 1 summarizes the methodology
    followed in the present study to carry out the bibliometric analysis and science
    mapping. More detailed explanations about the cluster analysis and the graphical
    map representation are available in the VOSviewer manual [56]. Figure 1. Workflow
    for the data screening and analysis. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Greenhouse
    Engineering Publication Trends 3.1.1. Annual Evolution of Published Papers A total
    of 3804 scientific documents fitting the search on greenhouse engineering in the
    last 40 years (1981–2021) were retrieved from the Scopus database and analyzed.
    Only a few papers (n = 42) were present before 1981 with 0 to 14 articles/year.
    A percentage of 48.9% (n = 1861) of the 3804 documents were original research
    articles and 2.4% (n = 92) were reviews; 46.7% (n = 1778) of the documents were
    conference papers published in journals, conference proceedings or book series
    and 1.9% (n = 72) were book chapters or books. In the first 15 years of the considered
    period (1981–1995) few papers per year were present (n = 7–36, mean 21.2). In
    the following 15 years (1996–2010) the number per year significantly increased
    (n = 35–140, mean 66.1), and even more in the last period 2011–2021 (n = 170–365,
    mean 226.8), when the growth is most evident for articles published in journals
    than in conference proceedings (Figure 2). Figure 2. Trends in publications on
    greenhouse engineering from 1981 to 2021. The histogram represents the number
    of articles published in indexed journals with respect to other papers reported
    in conference proceedings and book chapters. 3.1.2. Journals of Publication The
    documents were published in several journals and conference proceedings or book
    series. Ninety-seven sources published at least five documents. The leading 30
    sources published more than 16 documents each. Table 1 shows their principal characteristics,
    such as the publisher, total number of publications, CS, SJR and HP within the
    Scopus categories. Overall, 1634 documents out of 3804 (43.0%) were published
    in these journals. Only three sources published more than 50 documents. Most of
    the documents are present in Acta Horticulturae: 812 (21.3%). Acta Horticulturae
    is a Belgian peer reviewed series (publisher: International Society for Horticultural
    Science, ISHS) that mainly publishes the proceedings of the ISHS Symposia and
    of the International Horticultural Congresses. Some ISHS symposia focus specifically
    on advanced technologies and innovative greenhouse management, and over time have
    become an important opportunity for researchers to discuss the state of the art
    and future perspectives within these research topics. Biosystems Engineering is
    the second top journal in relation to the number of papers (n = 86) published
    on the subject. It is a monthly peer reviewed scientific journal, owned by The
    Institution of Agricultural Engineers (IAgrE) and published by Elsevier; it is
    also the official scientific journal of the European Society of Agricultural Engineers
    (EurAgEng). Its topic reflects the interdisciplinary nature of research in biological
    systems engineering. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, the third journal
    with 53 papers, focuses on developments and applications of computers or electronics
    in plant or animal agricultural production, including agronomy, horticulture,
    forestry, aquaculture and animal/livestock farming; it also includes the technological
    aspects of artificial intelligence, sensors and robotics. Table 1. Publisher,
    number of documents, Scopus CiteScore (CS), Scimago Journal Rank (SJR) and highest
    CiteScore percentile (HP) of the top journals publishing studies on greenhouse
    engineering. The top five journals with the highest SJR were Renewable and Sustainable
    Energy Reviews (3.522), Applied Energy (3.035), Energy Conversion and Management
    (2.743), Energy (1.961) and Agricultural and Forest Meteorology (1.837). These
    five journals, along with Renewable Energy, Energy and Buildings and Solar Energy,
    also showed a high CiteScore (higher than 8.8) and ranked in the 87th–99th CS
    percentile. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews mainly publishes studies
    that have a significant review element on renewable and sustainable energy resources
    and related systems, applications, utilizations and techno-socio-economic aspects.
    Applied Energy focuses on the research on energy conversion/conservation, the
    optimization of energy resource uses and energy processes and sustainable energy
    systems. Energy Conversion and Management is principally focused on energy production,
    use, conversion, storage, transmission, management and sustainability and also
    includes renewable energy resources. Energy covers research on energy analysis,
    modelling, prediction, conservation, efficiency, planning and management, supply
    and demand, storage, renewable energy and integrated energy systems. Agricultural
    and Forest Meteorology mainly focuses on the inter-relationship between agriculture,
    meteorology, natural ecosystems and forestry. 3.1.3. Subject Area The publications
    on greenhouse engineering overall fall mainly under the subject areas of agricultural
    and biological Sciences (28%) and engineering (21%), and to a minor extent into
    other subject areas such as computer science (11%), energy (8%) and environmental
    science (6%) (Figure 3). It should be noted that papers, particularly those that
    are multidisciplinary or dealing with different aspects of greenhouse engineering,
    are classified simultaneously in several subject areas. Overall, the documents
    were classified into more than 12 different Scopus subject areas, which may suggest
    the broad interest that this research field has generated in the scientific community.
    Figure 4 shows the trend of the principal subject areas into which Scopus has
    classified the documents related to greenhouse engineering in more recent years
    (1991–2021). The growing trend of publications in the areas of engineering, computer
    science, energy and mathematics, at the expense of agricultural and biological
    sciences, emerges. This may be due to the increase of complex interdisciplinary
    studies on greenhouses and their automation stimulated by advances in technology,
    modelling and simulation techniques, artificial intelligence, as well as to the
    increasing demand for environmentally sound greenhouse productions and for using
    renewable energy sources. Figure 3. Subject areas of the publications on greenhouse
    engineering. Figure 4. Trend of the distribution of the publications by Scopus
    category in 1991–2021. 3.1.4. Most Relevant Countries The countries to which the
    authors’ affiliations belong were analyzed. At least one hundred and six countries
    were identified as publishing on greenhouse engineering during the period 1981–2021,
    and 70 countries participated in at least five papers. These numbers point to
    the great interest that greenhouse engineering has captured worldwide. In this
    analysis, more than one country can be assigned to the same document in cases
    of international collaborations. Figure 5 shows the most active countries identified
    as those having participated in more than 50 papers. The countries with higher
    paper productivity were China (n = 593; 15.6%), the United States (n = 356; 9.4%),
    Spain (n = 260; 6.8%), Italy (n = 235; 6.2%) and the Netherlands (n = 209; 5.5%).
    However, the analysis of the scientific productivity of the countries in relation
    to the year of publication allows to highlight that 88% of the Chinese documents
    were published in the last decade, and this is reflected in the main themes addressed
    in the research. In effect, the cluster analysis on the keywords of the Chinese
    publications highlighted that the research focused mainly on the following topics:
    greenhouse automation; climate monitoring and control systems; design of wireless
    sensor networks; greenhouse heating systems performances. Research groups from
    the United States mostly focused on: microclimate and crop growth in photovoltaic
    (PV) greenhouses; energy efficiency of artificial lighting systems; optimal design
    of lighting systems in relation to plant response; CFD greenhouse modelling for
    climate uniformity; cooling systems performance. The prominent topics in Spanish
    research were the following: ventilators configurations and evaporative cooling
    systems performances; light transmission properties and the effect on the greenhouse
    microclimate of insect-proof screens; pest control by using plastic films. Italian
    research has principally focused on: radiometric and mechanical properties of
    greenhouse plastic covering films and shading nets; energy saving strategies in
    greenhouses; integrated use of several renewable energy sources for greenhouse
    heating and cooling; light distribution modelling and analysis in PV greenhouses;
    ventilation efficiency evaluation by means of CFD modeling. The dominant topics
    of the research carried out in the Netherlands were: greenhouse climate and crop
    growth modeling; lighting technologies and strategies for ventilation efficiency
    optimization; interaction of technology and plants. Up until 2010, France, Japan,
    Israel and Greece also had a significant role among the authors’ affiliated countries
    on greenhouse engineering. Figure 5. Countries publishing more than 50 articles
    related to greenhouse engineering from 1981 to 2021 (countries are related to
    the authors’ affiliations). 3.1.5. Most Relevant Research Institutions The paper
    productivity of the most active institutions on greenhouse engineering is reported
    in Table 2. While China leads the country distribution of research output in this
    field, the distribution by institution is dominated by non-Chinese research institutions.
    Emerging as the leader in this field is Wageningen University and Research, Netherlands
    (n = 183; 4.8%) followed by the University of Almeria, Spain (n = 95; 2.5%), the
    University of Thessaly, Greece (n = 90; 2.4%), the INRAE Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur
    Research Centre, France (n = 84; 2.2%), the Agricultural Research Organization
    (Volcani Center), Israel (n = 78, 2.1%) and the University of Bari Aldo Moro,
    Italy (n = 62; 1.6%). The total number of papers published by these institutions,
    along with the Agricultural University of Athens, Greece, and the Institute of
    Agriculture and Food Research and Technology (IRTA), Spain, received more than
    1000 citations and achieved a higher h-index. However, considering the average

    engineering from 1981 to 2021. 3.1.6. Co-Operative Network of Authors The co-operative
    network of key authors based on the number of documents on greenhouse engineering
    is reported in Figure 6. It indicates the collaborations between the authors interconnected
    in terms of the number of articles co-authored. The node size indicates the number
    of published articles. The connecting links indicate the co-authorship between
    a given author and other researchers and the strength of a link indicates the
    intensity of the cooperation. The collaboration clusters are represented by different
    colors. The red cluster emerges as the largest one and is represented mainly by
    Chinese authors. The dark green cluster highlights a close collaboration between
    authors from the Netherlands, Germany and Greece. The dark blue cluster is mainly
    composed of researchers from the United States and Japan. It also emerges that
    some clusters are located particularly close together, namely the dark blue and
    the pink clusters, which indicates the strong collaboration among research groups
    from the United States, Japan and Israel, and the pale blue, yellow, orange and
    green clusters, which indicates the extensive collaboration among researchers
    from Greece, Spain, Portugal, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Germany. Figure 6.
    Co-operative network of the key authors. 3.2. Principal Topics and Trends of Greenhouse
    Engineering Research in the World The results of the cluster analysis on the keywords
    of the 3804 documents related to the greenhouse engineering research field are
    shown in Figure 7. Each keyword is represented by a circle in the map. The circles
    diameter and the size of the keyword labels are correlated to the keyword frequency.
    The distance between two circles indicates the relatedness of the two keywords
    (the smaller the distance between two keywords the larger the number of papers
    in which those two keywords were found). The lines connecting the circles represent
    the co-occurrence of the two keywords, while their thickness is related to their
    frequency (the thicker the line, the more frequently those two keywords are found
    together). A total of 768 keywords with a minimum number of occurrences of eight
    are grouped in five hot themes highlighted by different colors: (1) climate modification
    and energy resources; (2) covering materials and plant growth; (3) automation
    and smart technology; (4) structural and functional design; (5) climate monitoring
    and control. While the first three research themes are clearly defined and do
    not overlap each other, the “structural and functional design” theme overlaps
    to those of “climate modification and energy resources” and “covering materials
    and plant growth”, and the “climate monitoring and control” overlaps with “automation
    and smart technology”, because of their closer relationships. However, it should
    be noted that the five clusters are tightly interconnected and that some aspects
    of greenhouse research can be included in more than one cluster. Figure 7. Keywords
    network based on the greenhouse engineering publications from 1981 to 2021. 3.2.1.
    Climate Modification and Energy Resources The climate modification and energy
    resources cluster (in blue in Figure 7) consists of 170 keywords. The high frequency
    keywords are: “solar energy”, “renewable energy”, “geothermal energy”, “energy
    use”, “heating systems”, “cooling”, “heat storage”, “photovoltaic systems”, “solar
    heating” and “economic analysis”. This research theme mainly focuses on energy
    efficiency and the use of climate control systems based on the exploitation of
    different renewable energy resources. Studies on passive solar greenhouses, energy
    collection, storage and production systems, cogeneration plants, industrial waste
    heat recovery systems and energy efficient equipment are also included. The reduction
    of greenhouse heating demand and costs within temperate and cold climate regions
    has been one of the major research topics in the last two decades [57], as heating
    and to a lesser extent cooling costs can be about 70–85% of the total operating
    costs, in northern latitudes, and about 50% or less in warmer areas [58]. The
    share of heating and cooling in the total operating cost varies widely depending
    also on the technology level used in the greenhouse and on the needs of the different
    cultivated crops: vegetables, flowers and ornamentals. Passive greenhouses were
    designed as solar collectors in order to make maximum solar heat gains by using
    the appropriate coatings and structural materials, thereby allowing energy savings
    of about 40% [59]. Several strategies have been studied to minimize heating, cooling,
    air-conditioning, lighting and ventilation demands of conventional greenhouses
    in order to reduce operational costs, the dependency on fossil fuels and ultimately
    the emissions of harmful gases into the atmosphere. These strategies include:
    the design of energy efficient greenhouses based on the local climate and some
    relevant parameters such as shape and orientation [60]; the use of energy-efficient
    covering materials [61,62]; the utilization of thermal screens [63]; the optimal
    control of indoor microclimates [64]; and the use of sustainable and renewable
    energy based systems such as PV modules, solar thermal and photovoltaic-thermal
    (PV/T) collectors, heat pumps, cogeneration systems, solar cooling systems, thermal
    energy storage technologies, ventilation technologies, and efficient lighting
    systems [57,65,66,67]. Different thermal energy storage techniques were investigated
    in order to reduce the greenhouse energy consumption for heating and to improve
    the solar energy utilization. The use of thermal energy storage has the benefit
    of providing less fluctuation of the solar greenhouse temperatures [68]. The underground
    thermal energy storage systems, such as thermal storage with boreholes and aquifers,
    can be used in greenhouses for seasonal storage [68]. The optimal control of an
    energy system including both short term buffers and aquifer long term energy storage
    was addressed and the high potential of the system for cost savings (29%) was
    demonstrated [69]. The most important drivers of the environmental impacts were
    identified by a combined greenhouse energy demand-yield simulation tool and a
    life cycle assessment in the five main climate world regions and future climate
    scenarios. The energy systems, inside air temperature, covering materials and
    crop growth features were identified as the most affecting factors on climate
    change impacts, with a different ranking according to the climate zone of the
    greenhouse [19]. The life cycle assessment was frequently used as a tool to evaluate
    or compare the potential environmental impacts of several greenhouse typologies
    and structures [70,71], heating systems [72], renewable energy sources implementation
    in greenhouses [73,74], lighting technologies [75], greenhouse production versus
    open field [76] and integrated rooftop greenhouse versus conventional [77,78].
    Energy Sources Mathematical models were developed to minimize energy inputs, and
    several researchers focused on finding innovative energy sources such as solar
    and wind power, industrial waste heat, geothermal energy and wood biomass [79,80,81].
    The impacts of various PV module arrangements on the greenhouse roof on the shading
    effect and energy efficiency [82,83], or the dynamic PV systems allowing variable
    shading that are able to balance the interior irradiance and the PV energy generation
    [84,85], were investigated. The use of concentrating PV modules allows for the
    reduction of the dimensions of the PV system and of its capital cost for the same
    power output [66]. An alternative solution for roof applications could be the
    semi-transparent PV modules that can allow for the reconciling of energy generation
    and agricultural activities [86,87]. The application of the concentrating photovoltaic/thermal
    (CPV/T) modules permits for the lighting and temperature control of the greenhouse
    environment while delivering enough energy to cover the heating demand of a greenhouse
    in Northern Europe [88]. The flat-plate solar thermal collectors are considered
    in various applications because of their modest cost and their ability to alleviate
    the greenhouse heating loads. When considering concentrating solar thermal collectors,
    the Fresnel lens system is considered to be the best solution due to its higher
    amount of available energy per unit aperture area in comparison with the parabolic
    trough collector [66]. A wood biomass can be considered a viable option as an
    alternative fuel for greenhouse heating [89]. A techno-economic analysis on wood
    biomass boilers showed that providing 40% of the annual heat demand through a
    wood biomass boiler and the remaining 60% with a natural gas boiler was more economical
    than using only natural gas [90]. However, the economic feasibility of using a
    wood biomass should be evaluated considering the technical and market changes
    such as wood pellets or natural gas prices and greenhouse sizes [91]. Research
    efforts were spent on the improvement of technologies and management strategies
    for using renewable energy for the CO2 enrichment of the greenhouse air, which
    is useful for improving the photosynthetic efficiency and, consequently, the crop
    yield. Pure CO2 in bulk or in hydrocarbon fuel combustion, such as propane or
    natural gas, are commonly used for CO2 supplementing. Using exhaust gases taken
    from biomass heating systems for CO2 enrichment provides several benefits including
    the recovery of a waste product, the reduction of the environmental footprint
    of the greenhouse production and its dependency on fossil fuels [92]. Wood biomass
    boilers produce a larger amount of particulate matters and ash emissions than
    other fossil fuels, thus the CO2 enrichment from biomass boiler flue gases is
    still both challenging and costly [93]. The use of industrial waste heat could
    be a potential solution to lower the heating costs of greenhouses as in the case
    of low-temperature industrial wastewater [94], low-temperature waste heat [95]
    and the waste heat from biogas driven power plants [96]. The technical, economic
    and environmental performance of hybrid systems for heating and cooling was investigated
    with the aim of enhancing the utilization of renewable energy resources in the
    greenhouse sector; this is the case of: solar photovoltaic system assisted earth-to-air
    heat exchangers consisting of underground air tunnels [97]; solar assisted water-to-water
    heat pumps [98]; air-to-water heat pumps using underground air [99]; PV assisted
    ground source heat pumps [100]; and heating systems based on solar-hydrogen energy
    and biomass or geothermal energy [79,101]. 3.2.2. Climate Monitoring and Control
    The climate monitoring and control cluster (in violet in Figure 7) consists of
    73 terms. The crucial terms are: “climate control”, “controllers”, “temperature
    control”, “PID control”, “climate model” and “fuzzy control”. Greenhouse climate
    monitoring and control has been one of the main objectives of agricultural engineering
    publications because of the direct relationship between the environmental conditions
    and crop yield and quality. During the last three decades many studies have examined
    different technologies and strategies for controlling the main inside environmental
    factors (temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration and solar radiation
    intensity) [102,103]. Researchers were interested in building reliable and accurate
    mathematical models that describe the greenhouse environmental dynamics, since
    most control theories rely on the mathematical model of the system to fine-tune
    the proposed algorithms, and on discussing the efficiency of different microclimate
    control theories (reviewed by Duarte-Galvan et al. [104]). Research on greenhouse
    climatic models also received notable attention in order to develop and validate
    methods for greenhouse design in the context of different climatic and economic
    conditions [105,106]. Some publications focused on traditional greenhouse climate
    models based on energy and mass balances, also involving many factors influencing
    the greenhouse behavior for temperature prediction [107,108,109]. Extensive models
    that even predict the temperature of the greenhouse air, cover, plants, and soil
    [110], crop response to environmental conditions such as photosynthesis or transpiration
    processes [111] and air relative humidity [112] have further been developed. Time
    and effort were dedicated to the optimal climate control to maximize growers’
    profits [113] or to minimize energy consumption by exploiting the dynamic ambient
    conditions [114]. The optimal control approach requires that the models describe
    both the dynamic behavior of the greenhouse climate and crop, and reliable forecasts
    of the weather conditions [115]. Many researchers considered only one objective
    in the greenhouse crop optimization [116,117,118]. Other researchers combined
    more objectives (fruit quality, water-use efficiency, energy saving and profits)
    by using multi-objective techniques embedded within a hierarchical control scheme
    [119]. Different types of control algorithms have been applied to the management
    of greenhouse systems such as the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), non-linear,
    robust, fuzzy logic, neural network and hybrid control algorithms [120]. The focus
    of the research has shifted from classical (feedback controllers) and artificial
    intelligence controllers to modern ones such as model predictive, robust and adaptive
    controllers, due to advancement of the wireless sensor network (WSN) technological
    field. Modern control systems allow for both more precise management of the microclimate
    parameters and energy consumption reduction by considering the uncertainties arising
    from the weather conditions, energy production and storage and the operating mode
    of physical devices [32]. 3.2.3. Smart Technology and Automation The smart technology
    and automation cluster (in red in Figure 7) consists of 204 words and phrases.
    The crucial terms are: “sensors”, “wireless sensor networks”, “internet of things”,
    “greenhouse environment”, “greenhouse monitoring”, “precision agriculture”, “digital
    storage”, “computer software”, “intelligent greenhouse” and “irrigation”. The
    application of the internet of things (IoT) technology has been recently investigated
    for the model-based evaluation of the microclimate parameters and to develop optimization
    algorithms for the microclimate control and for the energy efficient crop production
    [121,122,123]. The high costs of greenhouse structures, equipment and energy,
    and the need of an efficient, sustainable, high quality and quantity crop production,
    has incited several researchers to study and apply the WSN and IoT technologies
    to the greenhouse automation [124,125,126]. Recent trends in research and technology
    development on the greenhouse environmental monitoring show the shift from offline
    systems to wireless and cloud-based data collection [127,128]. The research on
    the continuous and remote monitoring and collection of data about air temperature
    and humidity, CO2, solar radiation, growing medium moisture and mineral nutrients
    content (mainly nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium) by the WSN and IoT provided
    useful information for understanding the effects of each factor on plant growth,
    in order to maximize plant productivity, to achieve significant energy savings
    and to ensure an efficient greenhouse automation system without the use of several
    manual inspections [128,129,130,131,132]. Automated systems were developed on
    mobile cloud connected robots for climate and irrigation control in greenhouses;
    in addition to air temperature and relative humidity, substrate moisture and pH
    data, images for detecting unhealthy plants were also collected [133]. The automatic
    feature extraction provided by the deep learning techniques allows for achieving
    a human-level accuracy in several crop operations [134]. Deep learning was applied
    to plant disease detection and classification [135,136], fruit recognition/counting
    and harvesting [137] and plants/leaves recognition and classification [138]. 3.2.4.
    Structural and Functional Design The structural and functional design cluster
    (in yellow in Figure 7) consists of 121 terms. The important keywords of this
    cluster are: “ventilation”, “wind effects”, “airflow”, “air temperature”, “CFD
    analysis”, “fluid dynamics”, “evaporative cooling system”, “heat transfer”, “temperature
    gradient”, “structural design”, “finite element method” and “transpiration”. This
    research theme mainly focused on the influence of the design parameters on greenhouse
    ventilation and microclimate, and on the design of structures capable of resisting
    to all types of loads due to extreme conditions such as significant snow/ice loads
    and strong winds. Many studies all over the world concerned the effects of different
    greenhouse parameters on energy conservation, and various options (greenhouse
    orientation, shape, north wall insulation, double wall glazing, thermal screens
    and cladding materials) were investigated to reduce heat losses and for the design
    of energy efficient greenhouses [139,140,141]. Climate is the principal determinant
    of greenhouse design and several studies focused on optimizing the structure of
    a greenhouse with respect to the local climatic conditions, which poses a challenge
    both technologically and financially. However, the spread of some types of greenhouses
    also depends on the local economic, technical and legal frameworks [142]. Glass
    and rigid plastic greenhouses are classified into wide-span and Venlo-type greenhouses,
    in relation to the roof design. Plastic film greenhouses range from the simplest
    tunnel greenhouses to the more complex pitched roof and arch-shaped roof greenhouses
    [142]. Several types of shapes, such as the gothic arch, vinery, Quonset, even-span
    and uneven-span, were investigated in relation to the solar gain [143] and the
    heating requirement [144,145]. Depending on the specific local climate conditions
    and the greenhouse dimensions, different shapes have emerged as energy efficient.
    The climatic control equipment, physical data and plant physiological processes
    were studied in order to formulate models and for their application on the design,
    operational control and the evaluation of energy conservative systems [146]. The
    researchers were interested in proposing climate models of greenhouses equipped
    with evaporative cooling systems in order to improve their design and management;
    the effect on greenhouse air temperature and on crop transpiration of different
    outside climate conditions, ventilation and shading strategies were also evaluated
    [147,148]. Modern greenhouses are characterized by lightweight structures with
    a low rigidity, which are particularly vulnerable to wind loads. Several researchers
    were interested in estimating the wind pressures on the structure by carrying
    out numerical simulations, wind tunnel experiments and full-scale field experiments,
    which are useful for the structural design [149,150,151,152]. Despite providing
    a lot of quantitative data, the full-scale field experiments involve the use of
    expensive instruments and long test cycles, and the related results are strictly
    related to the test surrounding environment; in order to overcome the limitations
    of the field tests, wind tunnel tests were widely carried out on scaled models
    [153]. The research has shown that the CFD models can successfully reproduce experimental
    results. The CFD models were developed to estimate the wind pressure coefficient
    of various kind of greenhouses, such as large multi-span greenhouses for which
    wind tunnel tests are difficult to perform [154] and of greenhouses covered with
    plastic films whose shape may undergo instantaneous distortion due to the wind
    action [155]. The research results were also compared with the greenhouse design
    standards to ensure its structural safety by compensating for the insufficient
    detail in the greenhouse design standards [149,150]. The CFD was also used to
    study greenhouse ventilation (natural and mechanical) that is one of the key factors
    for controlling the greenhouse climate. Since ventilation is complex to characterize,
    the CFD procedures were conveniently used to predict the ventilation rate, airflow,
    temperature and humidity patterns inside the greenhouse, to compare several scenarios
    such as the greenhouse geometries and meteorological conditions, and to perform
    sensitivity studies to improve the microclimate [156,157,158]. The research mainly
    focused on: the effect of the ventilation arrangement of a greenhouse on the airflow
    and temperature trends [159]; the effect of the presence of insect screens on
    the natural ventilation in greenhouses [160]; evaluating the fluid-dynamic properties
    of greenhouse shading screens [161]; the effect of the neighboring buildings on
    the thermal performance of naturally ventilated greenhouses [162]; the influence
    of wind direction on the airflow and air temperature patterns in the roof openings
    and inside a naturally ventilated greenhouse [163] and the influence of the orientation
    of crops rows on the inside air temperature and humidity conditions [156]. 3.2.5.
    Covering Materials and Plant Growth The covering materials and plant growth cluster
    includes studies on the greenhouse covering materials and on the plant growth
    in relation to the inside greenhouse microclimate. The cluster consists of 200
    terms and short phrases (in green in Figure 7). The crucial terms are: “solar
    radiation”, “covering material”, “plastic films”, “polyethylene”, “light transmission”,
    “photosynthesis”, “transparency”, “microclimate”, “temperature”, “light”, “humidity”,
    “crop yield”, “plant growth”, “physiology”, “hexapoda”, “fungi”, “vegetable”,
    “Lycopersicon esculentum” and “Cucumis”. Covering Materials The cover of a greenhouse
    has the main functions of protecting the crop from the external unfavorable climate
    and of promoting the greenhouse effect in order to provide the favorable microclimatic
    conditions for the crops. The main research topics within this theme were focused
    on the radiometric and mechanical properties, the chemical composition of the
    covering materials, and particularly for the plastic materials, in order to deliver
    solar radiation spectral modifying capabilities and energy-saving abilities. The
    radiometric properties of the cover are fundamental in affecting the intensity
    and the spectral and physical distribution of the solar radiation wavelengths
    entering and leaving the greenhouse. The radiometric properties of the cover,
    along with the thermal properties, are the key factors in determining the greenhouse
    microclimate in order to maximize the yield and quality of the crop production
    by making very efficient use of the incoming solar radiation and minimizing the
    demand for external resources such as energy and water. The covering materials
    should be characterized by a high transmittance to photosynthetically active radiation
    (PAR, 400–700 nm). The PAR fraction of the incoming radiation is absorbed by plants
    and is significant for their growth and yield. The transmissivity of the solar
    radiation outside the PAR, such as ultraviolet (UV, 280–400 nm) and near infrared
    (NIR, 700–2500 nm), should be considered in relation to the desired inside climatic
    conditions and external weather conditions, and to the needs of the crops grown
    inside the greenhouse. A low transmissivity of the long wave infrared (LWIR, 2500–25,000
    nm, with the maximum radiation emitted by the bodies at the ambient temperature
    centered on 7500–12,500 nm) radiation results in lower radiative losses during
    the night [62]. The thermo-mechanical performance, the radiometric properties
    and the impacts of a wide range of covering materials on the incoming solar radiation,
    also in relation to the different climatic regions [164,165,166,167,168], as well
    as the proper testing methods of the radiometric and thermal properties [62] were
    investigated. The effect of water condensate on the inside surface of the greenhouse
    cladding, on the transmittance and the forward diffusion pattern of the plastic
    and glass claddings, was evaluated and analyzed in numerous studies [169,170,171].
    Several researchers were interested in studying the effects on their mechanical
    and physical properties due to the exposure of plastic films to weathering conditions,
    agrochemicals and to dust accumulation [172,173,174,175]. Greenhouse climate models
    were used to study the impact of whitening and dust accumulation on the optical
    properties of the covering materials, on canopy parameters and greenhouse microclimate
    [176,177]. Recent studies are focusing on the development and the performance
    evaluation of advanced optical materials and of greenhouse covering systems able
    to adapt their properties by themselves to the dynamic sunlight conditions [178,179,180].
    The topic of the reduction of the impact of plastic coverings on the environmental
    sustainability in greenhouse production was addressed by considering the carbon
    emissions in the production phase, their durability and the related amount of
    waste generated during their use in greenhouses [181]. The technical design of
    the plastic coverings was also considered in relation to the improved suitability
    of the material for further recycling [182]. Microclimate and Plant Growth Within
    the microclimate and plant growth theme, the important aspects are the optimal
    microclimate and the effects of the greenhouse microclimate on plant growth. Several
    publications focused on the physiology of the greenhouse crops and on the optimal
    values of the microclimate parameters (air and root-zone temperature, relative
    humidity, vapor pressure deficit, lighting condition, intensity of solar radiation
    and CO2 concentration) with the goal of increasing both the yield and crop quality
    [183,184,185,186]. Most papers considered the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)
    as being one of the most cultivated vegetables in greenhouses as well as being
    a consumer demand throughout the year. Plant requirements at different growth
    stages were studied in order to design adaptive control strategies for a sustainable
    greenhouse production [187,188,189,190]. Many papers published the investigations
    on the relations among plant physiology, yield and fruit quality with the greenhouse
    environmental factors in order to achieve a sustainable crop production [189,191,192].
    The effects of the main microclimate parameters on tomato growth and the effects
    of the suboptimal values on the fruit quality and yield were reviewed by Katsoulas
    and Kittas [193] and Shamshiri et al. [194]. Numerous studies have been carried
    out on the effect of shading due to the integration with greenhouse structures
    of PV modules on greenhouse microclimate and crop productivity [68,195,196] and
    several approaches were proposed for improving the energy generation and crop
    production. These strategies include the partial roof covering with opaque PV
    modules [197] and the replacement of the entire roof with semi-transparent modules
    [198]. The introduction of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting systems was recently
    evaluated with respect to the potential for achievable electricity savings and
    an improved greenhouse crop production, by the optimized supplemental lighting
    regimens [199,200]. It has been found that switching from high-pressure sodium
    lighting to LED lighting can result in total energy savings of 10–25% [201]. By
    using LED panels, plants can be supplied with an optimal light spectrum with the
    proper intensity for their growth and a low power consumption [202]. LED lighting
    offers significant opportunities to produce energy savings and provide benefits
    by leveraging the rich knowledge of photobiology. The proper manipulation of the
    lighting, made possible by using LED lamps, can enhance production yield, plant
    quality, crop morphology, nutritional value, flavor, as well as can be used as
    part of an integrated disease management system [199]. Through the LEDs’ use as
    a supplementary lighting technology, more food can be produced while preserving
    the high quality production [203]. In the context of more sustainable alternative
    pest management solutions to insecticides, several studies have been conducted
    to demonstrate the potential of using UV-absorbing plastic cover films and nets.
    These have shown that they can be effectively used as photoselective barriers
    to control various pests and the related viral diseases in greenhouse environments
    without compromising the crop yield and quality and even increasing the percentage
    of marketable plants [204,205,206]. Several research studies were focused on improving
    the water use in irrigation and on the development of irrigation methods and control
    systems for the greenhouse irrigation process based on growing medium monitoring,
    crop evapotranspiration (which is directly affected by greenhouse microclimate
    conditions) and phyto-sensing [207,208]. The semi-closed soilless cultivation
    systems were studied in order to enhance the efficiency in the use of water and
    nutrients and to reduce the fertilizer run-off and thus pollution of aquifers
    by nitrate contamination, while preserving the crop production yield and quality
    [209]. A machine learning model was developed to analyze the hyperspectral sensor
    data in order to automatically detect plant water and nitrogen deficit stress
    [210]. 3.3. Research Trends The publications that have received more than 130
    citations and at least an average value of five citations per year are reported
    on Table 3. The analysis of these publications allows for the identification of
    the following key research topics that has considerably attracted the attention
    of researchers: photovoltaic and solar energy for heating the greenhouses, renewable
    and sustainable energy saving strategies for greenhouse systems, energy efficient
    greenhouse lighting, applications of the CFD in the modelling and design of ventilation
    systems, radiometric and thermal properties of greenhouse covering materials,
    crop transpiration in plastic tunnels and greenhouse monitor systems based on
    WSNs and on IOT technologies. Three articles received more than 250 citations.
    The paper with most citations (n = 564) was published in Energy and Buildings
    in 2013 by two researchers working at Firat University, Elazig, and Cumhuriyet
    University, Sivas, Turkey [80]. This study experimentally investigated a hybrid
    heating system of a ground source heat pump, solar collectors and a biogas production
    plant with the objective to evaluate the technical feasibility of using various
    renewable energy sources (biogas, soil and sun) for the sustainable greenhouse
    heating. The performance of the different combinations of these three systems
    to meet the heating demands of a small-scale greenhouse was evaluated in different
    climatic conditions and operating parameters. The proposed system was considered
    adequate to heat greenhouses located in the eastern and southeastern regions of
    Turkey, especially due to the presence of livestock production. In fact, the proposed
    hybrid system could use biogas from livestock production, so considerably reducing
    the primary energy use for greenhouse heating. This could be an economic alternative
    over other conventional heating methods. The second most cited article (n = 289)
    was published in the Journal of Cleaner Production in 2014 by two Macedonian research
    teams belonging to Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, Macedonia [211].
    In order to monitor and control some environmental parameters (temperature, humidity
    and radiation) that are important for greenhouse crop production and quality,
    the authors designed a low-cost, efficient and easy to use monitoring system based
    on the WSN technology. They tested, by simulation and measurements, the performance
    of several wireless network topologies and communication algorithms. The proposed
    architecture would be useful to farmers wishing to optimize their crop production
    and quality in a greenhouse environment while decreasing the farming and management
    costs. Table 3. Published papers that received more than a total of 130 citations
    and at least an average value of five citations per year (30 December 2021). The
    third most cited paper, with 264 citations, was published in Bioresource Technology
    in 2007 by three Irish research groups working at the University College Dublin
    and at Teagasc Agricultural Research Centre, Ireland [212]. This paper presents
    a state-of-the-art of the application of the CFD in the modelling and design of
    ventilation systems in agricultural buildings and describes the CFD studies on
    the developments of greenhouse technology and different technical aspects for
    the optimal greenhouse climate management in order to achieve higher crop yields.
    The greenhouse CFD modelling that takes into consideration the responses of plant
    physiology, according to the environmental conditions, was found to be of a superior
    standard than the animal housing CFD applications. The keyword year map is reported
    in Figure 8. It is based on the keywords’ occurrence and average year of publication.
    Blue and dark green colored circles represent terms with a higher frequency in
    early publications. Terms such as “climate control”, “ventilation”, “greenhouse
    heating”, “heat transfer”, “plastic films” and “geothermal energy” are related
    to the “conventional” themes of greenhouse engineering research. Early studies
    mainly focused on the design of greenhouses in relation to different loads such
    as significant snow and wind, the study of the characteristics and effects of
    the use of different roofing materials and the improvement of the ventilation
    efficiency. The yellow and light green terms are more frequently represented in
    the more recent publications, which are related to the themes of “greenhouse monitoring”,
    “wireless sensor network”, “internet of things”, “agricultural robots”, “smart
    greenhouse”, “photovoltaic panels” and “light emitting diodes”. Figure 8. Keywords
    year map based on the greenhouse engineering publications (the blue, green and
    yellow colors represent earlier, recent, and most recent terms, respectively).
    Future Developments of Research Recent research trends, that provide a context
    for future studies, are centered on: the development of smart monitoring and automatic
    control systems of greenhouse operations including climate control, transplanting,
    harvesting, soilless culture and fertigation, based on the exploitation of wireless
    sensor networks and the internet of things; the use of agricultural robots equipped
    with sensors for monitoring plants abnormalities, disease or insects; the application
    of multi-objective optimization approaches for greenhouse climate control systems;
    the implementation of energy sustainable greenhouse crop cultivation using renewable
    energies and efficient energy storage systems, energy efficient lighting and photovoltaic
    technologies. Research studies on the optimal and autonomous control of greenhouse
    operations have recently been further promoted by the advancement of the WSN field.
    Research efforts are needed to develop low-cost technology and methods and mathematical
    models for accurately simulating the complex microclimate and energy dynamics
    in greenhouses. In addition, research efforts are needed to develop a global greenhouse
    control that takes into account the different active systems that can be part
    of a greenhouse in order to implement the correct control means for an overall
    improvement of its function [32]. The technical performance and proper control
    strategies for the integrated use of the different renewable energies in order
    to reduce heating costs in greenhouse production and to support a sustainable
    growth of the greenhouse industry should be further studied, considering also
    the financial aspects [32]. Further studies are needed to prove the feasibility
    of self-sufficient, fossil fuel-independent integrated generation plants based
    on the synergistic operation of solar panels, wind turbines, gasifiers, digesters,
    etc. to meet the heating, cooling, electricity and CO2 demand of a greenhouse
    [9]. Research efforts are needed to explore the methods and technologies for the
    biomass post-combustion CO2 capture, on strategies for improving the overall efficiency
    of the systems for greenhouse heating and CO2 enrichment by using an excess heat
    storage [225]. The optimization of the lighting systems design and control will
    be required in the near future with the improvement of LED systems and with the
    advancement of knowledge on pest, pathogens and different plants responses to
    LED lighting [57,199]. Modeling approaches will be of growing importance in order
    to avoid costly and time-consuming experimental testing of new approaches to lighting
    crops with LEDs [199]. Supplemental lighting can also contribute to significantly
    heating the greenhouse, according to the different types of lamps used. The expected
    important transition from the widely used high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps to
    the more efficient LED lamps will therefore require further studies on the greenhouse
    operation that consider the effect of LEDs on the greenhouse energy budget and
    consider the various climates and greenhouse settings [201]. Furthermore, the
    experimental comparison between the HPS and LED lamp effect on plants should consider
    that HPS lamps can raise leaf temperature, and this can influence plant growth
    rates [199]. Tomato plants under LED exhibited a higher photosynthetic capacity
    and gas exchange in comparison with the HPS lamps, which may be related to the
    lower leaf temperature under LED [226]. 4. Conclusions Research and studies on
    greenhouse engineering over the past decades have addressed the issues surrounding
    and the need for reducing the environmental and landscape impacts, lowering production
    costs and satisfying the requirements of consumers of large-scale retail chains.
    Research is constantly applied to: (a) explore strategies in order to balance
    the production and environmental impacts in a socially acceptable and economically
    feasible way through an optimal use of natural resources, and an efficient integrated
    use of the different renewable energies; (b) the greenhouse design optimization
    and the improvement of energy saving techniques for reducing the heating and cooling
    energy demands and costs; (c) the development of innovative and efficient greenhouse
    covering materials; (d) the microclimate control optimization according to specific
    crops, crop growth stage, agro-techniques and climate circumstances; (e) an enhanced
    incorporation of rooftop greenhouses, vertical farms and plant factories in buildings
    and in cities; (f) the exploitation of wireless sensor networks and internet of
    things technologies for greenhouse monitoring and control; g) the automation of
    crop operations using deep learning. The greenhouse design represents a complex
    task for the relevant interactions among the several factors affecting the production
    processes, for the large variety of greenhouse types, level of technology and
    control and the external climatic conditions. The current bibliometric analysis
    on greenhouse engineering, carried out on 3804 publications, highlighted that
    the number of articles per year increased considerably in the last decade and
    showed a growing trend towards publish in indexed journals rather than in conference
    proceedings or book series. About 61.1% of articles were published after 2010,
    and of these more than 53.4% were in indexed journals. The search for renewable
    and sustainable energy sources, the environmental impact of greenhouse farming
    and the complex interdisciplinary research on greenhouse engineering has led to
    an increase in publications in journals falling into the engineering, computer
    science, energy and mathematics subject areas. The leading countries are China,
    the United States, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands that published over 36% of
    the relevant literature on greenhouse engineering. The cluster analysis identified
    five main research themes related to: climate modification and energy resources;
    climate monitoring and control; automation and smart technology; covering materials
    and plant growth; structural and functional design. Recent research trends are
    focused on finding innovative solutions for replacing the fossil-fuel energy with
    alternative energy resources exploiting the benefits of their integrated use,
    natural resources conservation, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, integrating
    precision agriculture technologies and improving smart monitoring and automatic
    control systems, automation of crop operations and a sustainable growth of the
    greenhouse production sector. Author Contributions Conceptualization, I.B., L.D.B.,

  description: Irrigation is a critical component of agriculture that consumes both
    power and water. As a result, intelligent irrigation systems that can manage the
    utilized resources are required. Using the Lagrange Multiplier approach, an optimal
    strategy for managing water and power resources is proposed in this work. It is
    employed because of its high accuracy solution and low hardware complexity. In
    the agricultural area, the optimization issue is phrased as a trade-off between
    water and power consumption. In order to test the proposed method, MATLAB software
    is used in two case studies. The obtained results confirmed the claimed efficiency
    and optimality of power and water resource management.

  description: Precision irrigation, defined as accurate and appropriate agricultural
    techniques characterized by optimal management and best collaboration of various
    irrigation factors, attracts great attention and obtains wide employments in different
    irrigation conditions or cultivation processes. Moreover, it becomes well-established
    in major areas of agricultural researches and across the broad spectrum of agricultural
    techniques especially in specific sectors of scientific frontiers, including soil
    quality, irrigation scheduling, water resource distribution, crop productivity,
    tillage management, climate adaptation, and environment monitoring, etc. This
    paper reviews the research developments and integrated applications of precision
    irrigation in typical domains of mechanism and performance, covering key aspects
    such as process optimization, schedule modelling, and effectiveness evaluation,
    indicating that advanced irrigation optimization methods support higher productivity
    of crop field and better environmental conditions of soil; Current schedule modelling
    techniques provide a set of instructive demonstrations and heuristic descriptions
    for the working principles of precision irrigation and the quantitative assessments
    of irrigation productivity; The novel investigation on effectiveness evaluation
    is extremely significant to obtain higher infiltration efficiency, simultaneously
    to achieve the optimized irrigation qualities for water balance condition, soil
    water redistribution, and soil moisture uniformity so that the effectiveness quality
    of irrigation infiltration could be improved remarkably. It is concluded that
    precision irrigation owns an outstanding collaborating capability and possesses
    much better working advancement in typical calibration indexes of cultivation
    accuracy and infiltration efficiency, meanwhile, a high agreement between the
    predicted and actual irrigation effectiveness could be expected. This novel irrigation
    review concentrating on the conceptual and systematic progress should be promoted
    constructively to improve the quality uniformity for precision irrigation and
    its constructive influences in different applications, and to facilitate the integrated
    management of agricultural production by higher irrigation efficiency consequently.

    demonstrations and heuristic descriptions for the working principles of precision
    irrigation and the quantitative assessments of irrigation productivity; The novel
    investigation on effectiveness evaluation is extremely significant to obtain higher
    infiltration efficiency, simultaneously to achieve the optimized irrigation qualities
    for water balance condition, soil water redistribution, and soil moisture uniformity
    so that the effectiveness quality of irrigation infiltration could be improved
    remarkably. It is concluded that precision irrigation owns an outstanding collaborating
    capability and possesses much better working advancement in typical calibration
    indexes of cultivation accuracy and infiltration efficiency, meanwhile, a high
    agreement between the predicted and actual irrigation effectiveness could be expected.
    This novel irrigation review concentrating on the conceptual and systematic progress
    should be promoted constructively to improve the quality uniformity for precision
    irrigation and its constructive influences in different applications, and to facilitate
    the integrated management of agricultural production by higher irrigation efficiency
    consequently. Keywords: precision irrigation, process optimization, schedule modelling,

    1.1. General Context of Machine Learning in Agriculture Modern agriculture has
    to cope with several challenges, including the increasing call for food, as a
    consequence of the global explosion of earth’s population, climate changes [1],
    natural resources depletion [2], alteration of dietary choices [3], as well as
    safety and health concerns [4]. As a means of addressing the above issues, placing
    pressure on the agricultural sector, there exists an urgent necessity for optimizing
    the effectiveness of agricultural practices by, simultaneously, lessening the
    environmental burden. In particular, these two essentials have driven the transformation
    of agriculture into precision agriculture. This modernization of farming has a
    great potential to assure sustainability, maximal productivity, and a safe environment
    [5]. In general, smart farming is based on four key pillars in order to deal with
    the increasing needs; (a) optimal natural resources’ management, (b) conservation
    of the ecosystem, (c) development of adequate services, and (d) utilization of
    modern technologies [6]. An essential prerequisite of modern agriculture is, definitely,
    the adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), which is promoted
    by policy-makers around the world. ICT can indicatively include farm management
    information systems, humidity and soil sensors, accelerometers, wireless sensor
    networks, cameras, drones, low-cost satellites, online services, and automated
    guided vehicles [7]. The large volume of data, which is produced by digital technologies
    and usually referred to as “big data”, needs large storage capabilities in addition
    to editing, analyzing, and interpreting. The latter has a considerable potential
    to add value for society, environment, and decision-makers [8]. Nevertheless,
    big data encompass challenges on account of their so-called “5-V” requirements;
    (a) Volume, (b) Variety, (c) Velocity, (d) Veracity, and (e) Value [9]. The conventional
    data processing techniques are incapable of meeting the constantly growing demands
    in the new era of smart farming, which is an important obstacle for extracting
    valuable information from field data [10]. To that end, Machine Learning (ML)
    has emerged, which is a subset of artificial intelligence [11], by taking advantage
    of the exponential computational power capacity growth. There is a plethora of
    applications of ML in agriculture. According to the recent literature survey by
    Liakos et al. [12], regarding the time period of 2004 to 2018, four generic categories
    were identified (Figure 1). These categories refer to crop, water, soil, and livestock
    management. In particular, as far as crop management is concerned, it represented
    the majority of the articles amongst all categories (61% of the total articles)
    and was further sub-divided into: Figure 1. The four generic categories in agriculture
    exploiting machine learning techniques, as presented in [12]. Yield prediction;
    Disease detection; Weed detection; Crop recognition; Crop quality. The generic
    categories dealing with the management of water and soil were found to be less
    investigated, corresponding cumulatively to 20% of the total number of papers
    (10% for each category). Finally, two main sub-categories were identified for
    the livestock-related applications corresponding to a total 19% of journal papers:
    Livestock production; Animal welfare. 1.2. Open Problems Associated with Machine
    Learning in Agriculture Due to the broad range of applications of ML in agriculture,
    several reviews have been published in this research field. The majority of these
    review studies have been dedicated to crop disease detection [13,14,15,16], weed
    detection [17,18], yield prediction [19,20], crop recognition [21,22], water management
    [23,24], animal welfare [25,26], and livestock production [27,28]. Furthermore,
    other studies were concerned with the implementation of ML methods regarding the
    main grain crops by investigating different aspects including quality and disease
    detection [29]. Finally, focus has been paid on big data analysis using ML, aiming
    at finding out real-life problems that originated from smart farming [30], or
    dealing with methods to analyze hyperspectral and multispectral data [31]. Although
    ML in agriculture has made considerable progress, several open problems remain,
    which have some common points of reference, despite the fact that the topic covers
    a variety of sub-fields. According to [23,24,28,32], the main problems are associated
    with the implementation of sensors on farms for numerous reasons, including high
    costs of ICT, traditional practices, and lack of information. In addition, the
    majority of the available datasets do not reflect realistic cases, since they
    are normally generated by a few people getting images or specimens in a short
    time period and from a limited area [15,21,22,23]. Consequently, more practical
    datasets coming from fields are required [18,20]. Moreover, the need for more
    efficient ML algorithms and scalable computational architectures has been pointed
    out, which can lead to rapid information processing [18,22,23,31]. The challenging
    background, when it comes to obtaining images, video, or audio recordings, has
    also been mentioned owing to changes in lighting [16,29], blind spots of cameras,
    environmental noise, and simultaneous vocalizations [25]. Another important open
    problem is that the vast majority of farmers are non-experts in ML and, thus,
    they cannot fully comprehend the underlying patterns obtained by ML algorithms.
    For this reason, more user-friendly systems should be developed. In particular,
    simple systems, being easy to understand and operate, would be valuable, as for
    example a visualization tool with a user-friendly interface for the correct presentation
    and manipulation of data [25,30,31]. Taking into account that farmers are getting
    more and more familiar with smartphones, specific smartphone applications have
    been proposed as a possible solution to address the above challenge [15,16,21].
    Last but not least, the development of efficient ML techniques by incorporating
    expert knowledge from different stakeholders should be fostered, particularly
    regarding computing science, agriculture, and the private sector, as a means of
    designing realistic solutions [19,22,24,33]. As stated in [12], currently, all
    of the efforts pertain to individual solutions, which are not always connected
    with the process of decision-making, as seen for example in other domains. 1.3.
    Aim of the Present Study As pointed out above, because of the multiple applications
    of ML in agriculture, several review studies have been published recently. However,
    these studies usually concentrate purely on one sub-field of agricultural production.
    Motivated by the current tremendous progress in ML, the increasing interest worldwide,
    and its impact in various do-mains of agriculture, a systematic bibliographic
    survey is presented on the range of the categories proposed in [12], which were
    summarized in Figure 1. In particular, we focus on reviewing the relevant literature
    of the last three years (2018–2020) for the intention of providing an updated
    view of ML applications in agricultural systems. In fact, this work is an updated
    continuation of the work presented at [12]; following, consequently, exactly the
    same framework and inclusion criteria. As a consequence, the scholarly literature
    was screened in order to cover a broad spectrum of important features for capturing
    the current progress and trends, including the identification of: (a) the research
    areas which are interested mostly in ML in agriculture along with the geographical
    distribution of the contributing organizations, (b) the most efficient ML models,
    (c) the most investigated crops and animals, and (d) the most implemented features
    and technologies. As will be discussed next, overall, a 745% increase in the number
    of journal papers took place in the last three years as compared to [12], thus
    justifying the need for a new updated review on the specific topic. Moreover,
    crop management remained as the most investigated topic, with a number of ML algorithms
    having been exploited as a means of tackling the heterogeneous data that originated
    from agricultural fields. As compared to [12], more crop and animal species have
    been investigated by using an extensive range of input parameters coming mainly
    from remote sensing, such as satellites and drones. In addition, people from different
    research fields have dealt with ML in agriculture, hence, contributing to the
    remarkable advancement in this field. 1.4. Outline of the Paper The remainder
    of this paper is structured as follows. The second section briefly describes the
    fundamentals of ML along with the subject of the four generic categories for the
    sake of better comprehension of the scope of the present study. The implemented
    methodology, along with the inclusive criteria and the search engines, is analyzed
    in the third section. The main performance metrics, which were used in the selected
    articles, are also presented in this section. The main results are shown in the
    fourth section in the form of bar and pie charts, while in the fifth section,
    the main conclusions are drawn by also discussing the results from a broader perspective.
    Finally, all the selected journal papers are summarized in Table A1, Table A2,
    Table A3, Table A4, Table A5, Table A6, Table A7, Table A8 and Table A9, in accordance
    with their field of application, and presented in the Appendix A, together with
    Table A10 and Table A11 that contain commonly used abbreviations, with the intention
    of not disrupting the flow of the main text. 2. Background 2.1. Fundamentals of
    Machine Learning: A Brief Overview In general, the objective of ML algorithms
    is to optimize the performance of a task, via exploiting examples or past experience.
    In particular, ML can generate efficient relationships regarding data inputs and
    reconstruct a knowledge scheme. In this data-driven methodology, the more data
    are used, the better ML works. This is similar to how well a human being performs
    a particular task by gaining more experience [34]. The central outcome of ML is
    a measure of generalizability; the degree to which the ML algorithm has the ability
    to provide correct predictions, when new data are presented, on the basis of learned
    rules originated from preceding exposure to similar data [35]. More specifically,
    data involve a set of examples, which are described by a group of characteristics,
    usually called features. Broadly speaking, ML systems operate at two processes,
    namely the learning (used for training) and testing. In order to facilitate the
    former process, these features commonly form a feature vector that can be binary,
    numeric, ordinal, or nominal [36]. This vector is utilized as an input within
    the learning phase. In brief, by relying on training data, within the learning
    phase, the machine learns to perform the task from experience. Once the learning
    performance reaches a satisfactory point (expressed through mathematical and statistical
    relationships), it ends. Subsequently, the model that was developed through the
    training process can be used to classify, cluster, or predict. An overview of
    a typical ML system is illustrated in Figure 2. With the intention of forming
    the derived complex raw data into a suitable state, a pre-processing effort is
    required. This usually includes: (a) data cleaning for removing inconsistent or
    missing items and noise, (b) data integration, when many data sources exist and
    (c) data transformation, such as normalization and discretization [37]. The extraction/selection
    feature aims at creating or/and identifying the most informative subset of features
    in which, subsequently, the learning model is going to be implemented throughout
    the training phase [38]. Regarding the feedback loop, which is depicted in Figure
    2, it serves for adjustments pertaining to the feature extraction/selection unit
    as well as the pre-processing one that further improves the overall learning model’s
    performance. During the phase of testing, previously unseen samples are imported
    to the trained model, which are usually represented as feature vectors. Finally,
    an appropriate decision is made by the model (for example, classification or regression)
    in reliance of the features existing in each sample. Deep learning, a subfield
    of ML, utilizes an alternative architecture via shifting the process of converting
    raw data to features (feature engineering) to the corresponding learning system.
    Consequently, the feature extraction/selection unit is absent, resulting in a
    fully trainable system; it starts from a raw input and ends with the desired output
    [39,40]. Figure 2. A graphical illustration of a typical machine learning system.
    Based on the learning type, ML can be classified according to the relative literature
    [41,42] as: Supervised learning: The input and output are known and the machine
    tries to find the optimal way to reach an output given an input; Unsupervised
    learning: No labels are provided, leaving the learning algorithm itself to generate
    structure within its input; Semi-supervised learning: Input data constitute a
    mixture of labeled and non-labeled data; Reinforcement learning: Decisions are
    made towards finding out actions that can lead to the more positive outcome, while
    it is solely determined by trial and error method and delayed outcome. Nowadays,
    ML is used in facilitating several management aspects in agriculture [12] and
    in a plethora of other applications, such as image recognition [43], speech recognition
    [44], autonomous driving [45], credit card fraud detection [46], stock market
    forecasting [47], fluid mechanics [48], email, spam and malware filtering [49],
    medical diagnosis [40], contamination detection in urban water networks [50],
    and activity recognition [51], to mention but a few. 2.2. Brief Description of
    the Four Generic Categories 2.2.1. Crop Management The crop management category
    involves versatile aspects that originated from the combination of farming techniques
    in the direction of managing the biological, chemical and physical crop environment
    with the aim of reaching both quantitative and qualitative targets [52]. Using
    advanced approaches to manage crops, such as yield prediction, disease detection,
    weed detection, crop recognition, and crop quality, contributes to the increase
    of productivity and, consequently, the financial income. The above aspects constitute
    key goals of precision agriculture. Yield Prediction In general, yield prediction
    is one of the most important and challenging topics in modern agriculture. An
    accurate model can help, for instance, the farm owners to take informed management
    decisions on what to grow towards matching the crop to the existing market’s demands
    [20]. However, this is not a trivial task; it consists of various steps. Yield
    prediction can be determined by several factors such as environment, management
    practices, crop genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, and their interactions.
    Hence, it necessitates a fundamental comprehension of the relationship between
    these interactive factors and yield. In turn, identifying such kinds of relationships
    mandates comprehensive datasets along with powerful algorithms such as ML techniques
    [53]. Disease Detection Crop diseases constitute a major threat in agricultural
    production systems that deteriorate yield quality and quantity at production,
    storage, and transportation level. At farm level, reports on yield losses, due
    to plant diseases, are very common [54]. Furthermore, crop diseases pose significant
    risks to food security at a global scale. Timely identification of plant diseases
    is a key aspect for efficient management. Plant diseases may be provoked by various
    kinds of bacteria, fungi, pests, viruses, and other agents. Disease symptoms,
    namely the physical evidence of the presence of pathogens and the changes in the
    plants’ phenotype, may consist of leaf and fruit spots, wilting and color change
    [55], curling of leaves, etc. Historically, disease detection was conducted by
    expert agronomists, by performing field scouting. However, this process is time-consuming
    and solely based on visual inspection. Recent technological advances have made
    commercially available sensing systems able to identify diseased plants before
    the symptoms become visible. Furthermore, in the past few years, computer vision,
    especially by employing deep learning, has made remarkable progress. As highlighted
    by Zhang et al. [56], who focused on identifying cucumber leaf diseases by utilizing
    deep learning, due to the complex environmental background, it is beneficial to
    eliminate background before model training. Moreover, accurate image classifiers
    for disease diagnosis need a large dataset of both healthy and diseased plant
    images. In reference to large-scale cultivations, such kinds of automated processes
    can be combined with autonomous vehicles, to timely identify phytopathological
    problems by implementing regular inspections. Furthermore, maps of the spatial
    distribution of the plant disease can be created, depicting the zones in the farm
    where the infection has been spread [57]. Weed Detection As a result of their
    prolific seed production and longevity, weeds usually grow and spread invasively
    over large parts of the field very fast, competing with crops for the resources,
    including space, sunlight, nutrients, and water availability. Besides, weeds frequently
    arise sooner than crops without having to face natural enemies, a fact that adversely
    affects crop growth [18]. In order to prevent crop yield reduction, weed control
    is an important management task by either mechanical treatment or application
    of herbicides. Mechanical treatment is, in most cases, difficult to be performed
    and ineffective if not properly performed, making herbicide application the most
    widely used operation. Using large quantities of herbicides, however, turns out
    to be both costly and detrimental for the environment, especially in the case
    of uniform application without taking into account the spatial distribution of
    the weeds. Remarkably, long-term herbicide use is very likely to make weeds more
    resistant, thus, resulting in more demanding and expensive weed control. In recent
    years, considerable achievements have been made pertaining to the differentiation
    of weeds from crops on the basis of smart agriculture. This discrimination can
    be accomplished by using remote or proximal sensing with sensors attached on satellites,
    aerial, and ground vehicles, as well as unmanned vehicles (both ground (UGV) and
    aerial (UAV)). The transformation of data gathered by UAVs into meaningful information
    is, however, still a challenging task, since both data collection and classification
    need painstaking effort [58]. ML algorithms coupled with imaging technologies
    or non-imaging spectroscopy can allow for real-time differentiation and localization
    of target weeds, enabling precise application of herbicides to specific zones,
    instead of spraying the entire fields [59] and planning of the shortest weeding
    path [60]. Crop Recognition Automatic recognition of crops has gained considerable
    attention in several scientific fields, such as plant taxonomy, botanical gardens,
    and new species discovery. Plant species can be recognized and classified via
    analysis of various organs, including leaves, stems, fruits, flowers, roots, and
    seeds [61,62]. Using leaf-based plant recognition seems to be the most common
    approach by examining specific leaf’s characteristics like color, shape, and texture
    [63]. With the broader use of satellites and aerial vehicles as means of sensing
    crop properties, crop classification through remote sensing has become particularly
    popular. As in the above sub-categories, the advancement on computer software
    and image processing devices combined with ML has led to the automatic recognition
    and classification of crops. Crop Quality Crop quality is very consequential for
    the market and, in general, is related to soil and climate conditions, cultivation
    practices and crop characteristics, to name a few. High quality agricultural products
    are typically sold at better prices, hence, offering larger earnings to farmers.
    For instance, as regards fruit quality, flesh firmness, soluble solids content,
    and skin color are among the most ordinary maturity indices utilized for harvesting
    [64]. The timing of harvesting greatly affects the quality characteristics of
    the harvested products in both high value crops (tree crops, grapes, vegetables,
    herbs, etc.) and arable crops. Therefore, developing decision support systems
    can aid farmers in taking appropriate management decisions for increased quality
    of production. For example, selective harvesting is a management practice that
    may considerably increase quality. Furthermore, crop quality is closely linked
    with food waste, an additional challenge that modern agriculture has to cope with,
    since if the crop deviates from the desired shape, color, or size, it may be thrown
    away. Similarly to the above sub-section, ML algorithms combined with imaging
    technologies can provide encouraging results. 2.2.2. Water Management The agricultural
    sector constitutes the main consumer of available fresh water on a global scale,
    as plant growth largely relies on water availability. Taking into account the
    rapid depletion rate of a lot of aquifers with negligible recharge, more effective
    water management is needed for the purpose of better conserving water in terms
    of accomplishing a sustainable crop production [65]. Effective water management
    can also lead to the improvement of water quality as well as reduction of pollution
    and health risks [66]. Recent research on precision agriculture offers the potential
    of variable rate irrigation so as to attain water savings. This can be realized
    by implementing irrigation at rates, which vary according to field variability
    on the basis of specific water requirements of separate management zones, instead
    of using a uniform rate in the entire field. The effectiveness and feasibility
    of the variable rate irrigation approach depend on agronomic factors, including
    topography, soil properties, and their effect on soil water in order to accomplish
    both water savings and yield optimization [67]. Carefully monitoring the status
    of soil water, crop growth conditions, and temporal and spatial patterns in combination
    with weather conditions monitoring and forecasting, can help in irrigation programming
    and efficient management of water. Among the utilized ICTs, remote sensing can
    provide images with spatial and temporal variability associated with the soil
    moisture status and crop growth parameters for precision water management. Interestingly,
    water management is challenging enough in arid areas, where groundwater sources
    are used for irrigation, with the precipitation providing only part of the total
    crop evapotranspiration (ET) demands [68]. 2.2.3. Soil Management Soil, a heterogeneous
    natural resource, involves mechanisms and processes that are very complex. Precise
    information regarding soil on a regional scale is vital, as it contributes towards
    better soil management consistent with land potential and, in general, sustainable
    agriculture [5]. Better management of soil is also of great interest owing to
    issues like land degradation (loss of the biological productivity), soil-nutrient
    imbalance (due to fertilizers overuse), and soil erosion (as a result of vegetation
    overcutting, improper crop rotations rather than balanced ones, livestock overgrazing,
    and unsustainable fallow periods) [69]. Useful soil properties can entail texture,
    organic matter, and nutrients content, to mention but a few. Traditional soil
    assessment methods include soil sampling and laboratory analysis, which are normally
    expensive and take considerable time and effort. However, remote sensing and soil
    mapping sensors can provide low-cost and effortless solution for the study of
    soil spatial variability. Data fusion and handling of such heterogeneous “big
    data” may be important drawbacks, when traditional data analysis methods are used.
    ML techniques can serve as a trustworthy, low-cost solution for such a task. 2.2.4.
    Livestock Management It is widely accepted that livestock production systems have
    been intensified in the context of productivity per animal. This intensification
    involves social concerns that can influence consumer perception of food safety,
    security, and sustainability, based on animal welfare and human health. In particular,
    monitoring both the welfare of animals and overall production is a key aspect
    so as to improve production systems [70]. The above fields take place in the framework
    of precision livestock farming, aiming at applying engineering techniques to monitor
    animal health in real time and recognizing warning messages, as well as improving
    the production at the initial stages. The role of precision livestock farming
    is getting more and more significant by supporting the decision-making processes
    of livestock owners and changing their role. It can also facilitate the products’
    traceability, in addition to monitoring their quality and the living conditions
    of animals, as required by policy-makers [71]. Precision livestock farming relies
    on non-invasive sensors, such as cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, radio-frequency
    identification systems, pedometers, and optical and temperature sensors [25].
    IoT sensors leverage variable physical quantities (VPQs) as a means of sensing
    temperature, sound, humidity, etc. For instance, IoT sensors can warn if a VPQ
    falls out of regular limits in real-time, giving valuable information regarding
    individual animals. As a result, the cost of repetitively and arduously checking
    each animal can be reduced [72]. In order to take advantage of the large amounts
    of data, ML methodologies have become an integral part of modern livestock farming.
    Models can be developed that have the capability of defining the manner a biological
    system operates, relying on causal relationships and exploiting this biological
    awareness towards generating predictions and suggestions. Animal Welfare There
    is an ongoing concern for animal welfare, since the health of animals is strongly
    associated with product quality and, as a consequence, predominantly with the
    health of consumers and, secondarily, with the improvement of economic efficiency
    [73]. There exist several indexes for animal welfare evaluation, including physiological
    stress and behavioral indicators. The most commonly used indicator is animal behavior,
    which can be affected by diseases, emotions, and living conditions, which have
    the potential to demonstrate physiological conditions [25]. Sensors, commonly
    used to detect behavioral changes (for example, changes in water or food consumption,
    reduced animal activity), include microphone systems, cameras, accelerometers,
    etc. Livestock Production The use of sensor technology, along with advanced ML
    techniques, can increase livestock production efficiency. Given the impact of
    practices of animal management on productive elements, livestock owners are getting
    cautious of their asset. However, as the livestock holdings get larger, the proper
    consideration of every single animal is very difficult. From this perspective,
    the support to farmers via precision livestock farming, mentioned above, is an
    auspicious step for aspects associated with economic efficiency and establishment
    of sustainable workplaces with reduced environmental footprint [74]. Generally,
    several models have been used in animal production, with their intentions normally
    revolving around growing and feeding animals in the best way. However, the large
    volumes of data being involved, again, call for ML approaches. 3. Methods 3.1.
    Screening of the Relative Literature In order to identify the relevant studies
    concerning ML in respect to different aspects of management in agriculture, the
    search engines of Scopus, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science,
    and MDPI were utilized. In addition, keywords’ combinations of “machine learning”
    in conjunction with each of the following: “crop management”, “water management”,
    “soil management”, and “livestock management” were used. Our intention was to
    filter the literature on the same framework as [12]; however, focusing solely
    within the period 2018–2020. Once a relevant study was being identified, the references
    of the paper at hand were being scanned to find studies that had not been found
    throughout the initial searching procedure. This process was being iterated until
    no relevant studies occurred. In this stage, only journal papers were considered
    eligible. Thus, non-English studies, conferences papers, chapters, reviews, as
    well as Master and Doctoral Theses were excluded. The latest search was conducted
    on 15 December 2020. Subsequently, the abstract of each paper was being reviewed,
    while, at a next stage, the full text was being read to decide its appropriateness.
    After a discussion between all co-authors with reference to the appropriateness
    of the selected papers, some of them were excluded, in the case they did not meet
    the two main inclusion criteria, namely: (a) the paper was published within 2018–2020
    and (b) the paper referred to one of the categories and sub-categories, which
    were summarized in Figure 1. Finally, the papers were classified in these sub-categories.
    Overall, 338 journal papers were identified. The flowchart of the present review
    methodology is depicted in Figure 3, based on the PRISMA guidelines [75], along
    with information about at which stage each exclusive criterion was imposed similarly
    to recent systematic review studies such as [72,76,77,78]. Figure 3. The flowchart
    of the methodology of the present systematic review along with the flow of information
    regarding the exclusive criteria, based on PRISMA guidelines [75]. 3.2. Definition
    of the Performance Metrics Commonly Used in the Reviewed Studies In this subsection,
    the most commonly used performance metrics of the reviewed papers are briefly
    described. In general, these metrics are utilized in an effort to provide a common
    measure to evaluate the ML algorithms. The selection of the appropriate metrics
    is very important, since: (a) how the algorithm’s performance is measured relies
    on these metrics and (b) the metric itself can influence the way the significance
    of several characteristics is weighted. Confusion matrix constitutes one of the
    most intuitive metrics towards finding the correctness of a model. It is used
    for classification problems, where the result can be of at least two types of
    classes. Let us consider a simple example, by giving a label to a target variable:
    for example, “1” when a plant has been infected with a disease and “0” otherwise.
    In this simplified case, the confusion matrix (Figure 4) is a 2 × 2 table having
    two dimensions, namely “Actual” and “Predicted”, while its dimensions have the
    outcome of the comparison between the predictions with the actual class label.
    Concerning the above simplified example, this outcome can acquire the following
    values: Figure 4. Representative illustration of a simplified confusion matrix.
    True Positive (TP): The plant has a disease (1) and the model classifies this
    case as diseased (1); True Negative (TN): The plant does not have a disease (0)
    and the model classifies this case as a healthy plant (0); False Positive (FP):
    The plant does not have a disease (0), but the model classifies this case as diseased
    (1); False Negative (FN): The plant has a disease (1), but the model classifies
    this case as a healthy plant (0). As can be shown in Table 1, the aforementioned
    values can be implemented in order to estimate the performance metrics, typically
    observed in classification problems [79]. Table 1. Summary of the most commonly
    used evaluation metrics of the reviewed studies. Other common evaluation metrics
    were the coefficient of correlation ( 𝑅 ), coefficient of determination ( 𝑅 2
    ; basically, the square of the correlation coefficient), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
    Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE), which can
    be given via the following relationships [80,81]: 𝑅= 𝑇· ∑ 𝑇 𝑡=1 𝑍(𝑡)·𝑋(𝑡)−( ∑
    𝑇 𝑡=1 𝑍(𝑡))·( ∑ 𝑇 𝑡=1 𝑋(𝑡)) 𝑇· ∑ 𝑇 𝑡=1 (𝑍(𝑡)) 2 − ( ∑ 𝑇 𝑡=1 𝑍(𝑡)) 2 − − − − −
    − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ · 𝑇· ∑ 𝑇 𝑡=1 (𝑋(𝑡)) 2 − ( ∑ 𝑇 𝑡=1 𝑋(𝑡))
    2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ , (1) 𝑀𝐴𝐸= 1 𝑇 · ∑ 𝑇 𝑡=1
    |𝑍(𝑡)−𝑋(𝑡)|, (2) 𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸= 1 𝑇 · ∑ 𝑇 𝑡=1 | 𝑍(𝑡)−𝑋(𝑡) 𝑍(𝑡) |, (3) 𝑀𝑆𝐸= 1 𝑇 · ∑ 𝑇 𝑡=1
    (𝑍(𝑡)−𝑋(𝑡)) 2 , (4) where 𝑋(𝑡) and 𝑍(𝑡) correspond to the predicted and real value,
    respectively, 𝑡 stands for the iteration at each point, while 𝑇 for the testing
    records number. Accordingly, low values of MAE, MAPE, and MSE values denote a
    small error and, hence, better performance. In contrast, 𝑅 2 near 1 is desired,
    which demonstrates better model performance and also that the regression curve
    efficiently fits the data. 4. Results 4.1. Preliminary Data Visualization Analysis
    Graphical representation of data related to the reviewed studies, by using maps,
    bar or pie charts, for example, can provide an efficient approach to demonstrate
    and interpret the patterns of data. The data visualization analysis, as it usually
    refers to, can be vital in the context of analyzing large amounts of data and
    has gained remarkable attention in the past few years, including review studies.
    Indicatively, significant results can be deduced in an effort to identify: (a)
    the most contributing authors and organizations, (b) the most contributing international
    journals (or equivalently which research fields are interested in this topic),
    and (c) the current trends in this field [82]. 4.1.1. Classification of the Studies
    in Terms of Application Domain As can be seen in the flowchart of the present
    methodology (Figure 3), the literature survey on ML in agriculture resulted in
    338 journal papers. Subsequently, these studies were classified into the four
    generic categories as well as into their sub-categories, as already mentioned
    above. Figure 5 depicts the aforementioned papers’ distribution. In particular,
    the majority of the studies were intended for crop management (68%), while soil
    management (10%), water management (10%), and livestock management (12% in total;
    animal welfare: 7% and livestock production: 5%) had almost equal contribution
    in the present bibliographic survey. Focusing on crop management, the most contributing
    sub-categories were yield prediction (20%) and disease detection (19%). The former
    research field arises as a consequence of the increasing interest of farmers in
    taking decisions based on efficient management that can lead to the desired yield.
    Disease detection, on the other hand, is also very important, as diseases constitute
    a primary menace for food security and quality assurance. Equal percentages (13%)
    were observed for weed detection and crop recognition, both of which are essential
    in crop management at farm and agricultural policy making level. Finally, examination
    of crop quality was relatively scarce corresponding to 3% of all studies. This
    can be attributed to the complexity of monitoring and modeling the quality-related
    parameters. Figure 5. The classification of the reviewed studies according to
    the field of application. In this fashion, it should be mentioned again that all
    the selected journal papers are summarized in Table A1, Table A2, Table A3, Table
    A4, Table A5, Table A6, Table A7, Table A8 and Table A9, depending on their field
    of application, and presented in the Appendix A. The columns of the tables correspond
    (from left to right) to the “Reference number” (Ref), “Input Data”, “Functionality”,
    “Models/Algorithms”, and “Best Output”. One additional column exists for the sub-categories
    belonging in crop management, namely “Crop”, whereas the corresponding column
    in the sub-categories pertaining to livestock management refers to “Animal”. The
    present systematic review deals with a plethora of different ML models and algorithms.
    For the sake of brevity, the commonly used abbreviations are used instead of the
    entire names, which are summarized in Table A10 and Table A11 (presented also
    in the Appendix A). The list of the aforementioned Tables, along with their content,
    is listed in Table 2. Table 2. List of the tables appearing in the Appendix A
    related to: (a) the categories and sub-categories of the machine learning applications
    in agriculture (Table A1, Table A2, Table A3, Table A4, Table A5, Table A6, Table
    A7, Table A8 and Table A9) and (b) the abbreviations of machine learning models
    and algorithms (Table A10 and Table A11, respectively). 4.1.2. Geographical Distribution
    of the Contributing Organizations The subject of this sub-section is to find out
    the geographical distribution of all the contributing organizations in ML applications
    in agriculture. To that end, the author’s affiliation was taken into account.
    In case a paper included more than one author, which was the most frequent scenario,
    each country could contribute only once in the final map chart (Figure 6), similarly
    to [83,84]. As can be gleaned from Figure 6, investigating ML in agriculture is
    distributed worldwide, including both developed and developing economies. Remarkably,
    out of the 55 contributing countries, the least contribution originated from African
    countries (3%), whereas the major contribution came from Asian countries (55%).
    The latter result is attributed mainly to the considerable contribution of Chinese
    (24.9%) as well as Indian organizations (10.1%). USA appeared to be the second
    most contributing country with 20.7% percentage, while Australia (9.5%), Spain
    (6.8%), Germany (5.9%), Brazil, UK, and Iran (5.62%) seem to be particularly interested
    in ML in agriculture. It should be stressed that livestock management, which is
    a relatively different sub-field comparing to crop, water, and soil management,
    was primary examined from studies coming from Australia, USA, China, and UK, while
    all the papers regarding Ireland were focused on animals. Finally, another noteworthy
    observation is that a large number of articles were a result of international
    collaboration, with the synergy of China and USA standing out. Figure 6. Geographical
    distribution of the contribution of each country to the research field focusing
    on machine learning in agriculture. 4.1.3. Distribution of the Most Contributing
    Journal Papers For the purpose of identifying the research areas that are mostly
    interested in ML in agriculture, the most frequently appeared international journal
    papers are depicted in Figure 7. In total, there were 129 relevant journals. However,
    in this bar chart, only the journals contributing with at least 4 papers are presented
    for brevity. As a general remark, remote sensing was of particular importance,
    since reliable data from satellites and UAV, for instance, constitute valuable
    input data for the ML algorithms. In addition, smart farming, environment, and
    agricultural sustainability were of central interest. Journals associated with
    computational techniques were also presented with considerable frequency. A typical
    example of such type of journals, which was presented in the majority of the studies
    with a percentage of 19.8%, was “Computers and Electronics in Agriculture”. This
    journal aims at providing the advances in relation to the application of computers
    and electronic systems for solving problems in plant and animal production. Figure
    7. Distribution of the most contributing international journals (published at
    least four articles) concerning applications of machine learning in agriculture.
    The “Remote Sensing” and “Sensors” journals followed with approximately 11.8%
    and 6.5% of the total number of publications, respectively. These are cross-sectoral
    journals that are concentrated on applications of science and sensing technologies
    in various fields, including agriculture. Other journals, covering this research
    field, were also “IEEE Access” and “International Journal of Remote Sensing” with
    approximately 2.1% and 1.2% contribution, respectively. Moreover, agriculture-oriented
    journals were also presented in Figure 7, including “Precision Agriculture”, “Frontiers
    in Plant Science”, “Agricultural and Forest Meteorology”, and “Agricultural Water
    Management” with 1–3% percentage. These journals deal with several aspects of
    agriculture ranging from management strategies (so as to incorporate spatial and
    temporal data as a means of optimizing productivity, resource use efficiency,
    sustainability and profitability of agricultural production) up to crop molecular
    genetics and plant pathogens. An interdisciplinary journal concentrating on soil
    functions and processes also appeared with 2.1%, namely “Geoderma”, plausibly
    covering the soil management generic category. Finally, several journals focusing
    on physics and applied natural sciences, such as “Applied Sciences” (2.7%), “Scientific
    Reports” (1.8%), “Biosystems Engineering” (1.5%), and “PLOS ONE” (1.5%), had a
    notable contribution to ML studies. As a consequence, ML in agriculture concerns
    several disciplines and constitutes a fundamental area for developing various
    techniques, which can be beneficial to other fields as well. 4.2. Synopsis of
    the Main Features Associated with the Relative Literature 4.2.1. Machine Learning
    Models Providing the Best Results A wide range of ML algorithms was implemented
    in the selected studies; their abbreviations are given in Table A11. The ML algorithms
    that were used by each study as well as those that provided the best output have
    been listed in the last two columns of Table A1, Table A2, Table A3, Table A4,
    Table A5, Table A6, Table A7, Table A8 and Table A9. These algorithms can be classified
    into the eight broad families of ML models, which are summarized in Table A10.
    Figure 8 focuses on the best performed ML models as a means of capturing a broad
    picture of the current situation and demonstrating advancement similarly to [12].
    Figure 8. Machine Learning models giving the best output. As can be demonstrated
    in Figure 8, the most frequent ML model providing the best output was, by far,
    Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which appeared in almost half of the reviewed
    studies (namely, 51.8%). More specifically, ANN models provided the best results
    in the majority of the studies concerning all sub-categories. ANNs have been inspired
    by the biological neural networks that comprise human brains [85], while they
    allow for learning via examples from representative data describing a physical
    phenomenon. A distinct characteristic of ANNs is that they can develop relationships
    between dependent and independent variables, and thus extract useful information
    from representative datasets. ANN models can offer several benefits, such as their
    ability to handle noisy data [86], a situation that is very common in agricultural
    measurements. Among the most popular ANNs are the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
    which utilize multiple hidden layers between input and output layers. DNNs can
    be unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised. A usual kind of DNNs are the
    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), whose layers, unlike common neural networks,
    can set up neurons in three dimensions [87]. In fact, CNNs were presented as the
    algorithms that provide the best output in all sub-categories, with an almost
    50% of the individual percentage of ANNs. As stressed in recent studies, such
    as that of Yang et al. [88], CNNs are receiving more and more attention because
    of their efficient results when it comes to detection through images’ processing.
    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) followed, representing approximately 10% of ANNs,
    with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) standing out. They are called “recurrent” as
    they carry out the same process for every element, with the previous computations
    determining the current output, while they have a “memory” that stores information
    pertaining to what has been calculated so far. RNNs can face problems concerning
    vanishing gradients and inability to “memorize” many sequential data. Towards
    addressing these issues, the cell structures of LSTM can control which part of
    information will be either stored in long memory or discarded, resulting in optimization
    of the memorizing process [51]. Moreover, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Fully
    Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) appeared
    to have the best performance in almost 3–5% of ANNs. Finally, ML algorithms, belonging
    to ANNs with low frequency, were Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNNs), Modular
    Artificial Neural Networks (MANNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Adaptive-Neuro
    Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Subtractive Clustering Fuzzy Inference System
    (SCFIS), Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Neural Networks (TS-FNN), and Feed Forward Neural
    Networks (FFNNs). The second most accurate ML model was Ensemble Learning (EL),
    contributing to the ML models used in agricultural systems with approximately
    22.2%. EL is a concise term for methods that integrate multiple inducers for the
    purpose of making a decision, normally in supervised ML tasks. An inducer is an
    algorithm, which gets as an input a number of labeled examples and creates a model
    that can generalize these examples. Thus, predictions can be made for a set of
    new unlabeled examples. The key feature of EL is that via combining various models,
    the errors coming from a single inducer is likely to be compensated from other
    inducers. Accordingly, the prediction of the overall performance would be superior
    comparing to a single inducer [89]. This type of ML model was presented in all
    sub-categories, apart from crop quality, perhaps owing to the small number of
    papers belonging in this subcategory. Support Vector Machine (SVM) followed, contributing
    in approximately 11.5% of the studies. The strength of the SVM stems from its
    capability to accurately learn data patterns while showing reproducibility. Despite
    the fact that it can also be applied for regression applications, SVM is a commonly
    used methodology for classification extending across numerous data science settings
    [90], including agricultural research. Decision Trees (DT) and Regression models
    came next with equal percentage, namely 4.7%. Both these ML models were presented
    in all generic categories. As far as DT are concerned, they are either regression
    or classification models structured in a tree-like architecture. Interestingly,
    handling missing data in DT is a well-established problem. By implementing DT,
    the dataset can be gradually organized into smaller subsets, whereas, in parallel,
    a tree graph is created. In particular, each tree’s node denotes a dissimilar
    pairwise comparison regarding a certain feature, while each branch corresponds
    to the result of this comparison. As regards leaf nodes, they stand for the final
    decision/prediction provided after following a certain rule [91,92]. As for Regression,
    it is used for supervised learning models intending to model a target value on
    the basis of independent predictors. In particular, the output can be any number
    based on what it predicts. Regression is typically applied for time series modeling,
    prediction, and defining the relationships between the variables. Finally, the
    ML models, leading to optimal performance (although with lower contribution to
    literature), were those of Instance Based Models (IBM) (2.7%), Dimensionality
    Reduction (DR) (1.5%), Bayesian Models (BM) (0.9%), and Clustering (0.3%). IBM
    appeared only in crop, water, and livestock management, whereas BM only in crop
    and soil management. On the other hand, DR and Clustering appeared as the best
    solution only in crop management. In brief, IBM are memory-based ML models that
    can learn through comparison of the new instances with examples within the training
    database. DR can be executed both in unsupervised and supervised learning types,
    while it is typically carried out in advance of classification/regression so as
    to prevent dimensionality effects. Concerning the case of BM, they are a family
    of probabilistic models whose analysis is performed within the Bayesian inference
    framework. BM can be implemented in both classification and regression problems
    and belong to the broad category of supervised learning. Finally, Clustering belongs
    to unsupervised ML models. It contains automatically discovering of natural grouping
    of data [12]. 4.2.2. Most Studied Crops and Animals In this sub-section, the most
    examined crops and animals that were used in the ML models are discussed as a
    result of our searching within the four sub-categories of crop management similarly
    to [12]. These sub-categories refer to yield prediction, disease detection, crop
    recognition, and crop quality. Overall, approximately 80 different crop species
    were investigated. The 10 most utilized crops are summarized in Figure 9. Specifically,
    the remarkable interest on maize (also known as corn) can be attributed to the
    fact that it is cultivated in many parts across the globe as well as its versatile
    usage (for example, direct consumption by humans, animal feed, producing ethanol,
    and other biofuels). Wheat and rice follow, which are two of the most widely consumed
    cereal grains. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [93],
    the trade in wheat worldwide is more than the summation of all other crops. Concerning
    rice, it is the cereal grain with the third-highest production and constitutes
    the most consumed staple food in Asia [94]. The large contribution of Asian countries
    presented in Figure 6, like China and India, justifies the interest in this crop.
    In the same vein, soybeans, which are broadly distributed in East Asia, USA, Africa,
    and Australia [95], were presented in many studies. Finally, tomato, grape, canola/rapeseed
    (cultivated primarily for its oil-rich seed), potato, cotton, and barley complete
    the top 10 examined crops. All these species are widely cultivated all over the
    world. Some other indicative species, which were investigated at least five times
    in the present reviewed studies, were also alfalfa, citrus, sunflower, pepper,
    pea, apple, squash, sugarcane, and rye. Figure 9. The 10 most investigated crops
    using machine learning models; the results refer to crop management. As far as
    livestock management is concerned, the examined animal species can be classified,
    in descending order of frequency, into the categories of cattle (58.5%), sheep
    and goats (26.8%), swine (14.6%), poultry (4.9%), and sheepdog (2.4%). As can
    be depicted in Figure 10, the last animal, which is historically utilized with
    regard to the raising of sheep, was investigated only in one study belonging to
    animal welfare, whereas all the other animals were examined in both categories
    of livestock management. In particular, the most investigated animal in both animal
    welfare and livestock production was cattle. Sheep and goats came next, which
    included nine studies for sheep and two studies for goats. Cattles are usually
    raised as livestock aimed at meat, milk, and hide used for leather. Similarly,
    sheep are raised for meat and milk as well as fleece. Finally, swine (often called
    domestic pigs) and poultry (for example, chicken, turkey, and duck), which are
    used mainly for their meat or eggs (poultry), had equal contribution from the
    two livestock sub-categories. Figure 10. Frequency of animal species in studies
    concerning livestock management by using machine learning models. 4.2.3. Most
    Studied Features and Technologies As mentioned in the beginning of this study,
    modern agriculture has to incorporate large amounts of heterogeneous data, which
    have originated from a variety of sensors over large areas at various spatial
    scale and resolution. Subsequently, such data are used as input into ML algorithms
    for their iterative learning up until modeling of the process in the most effective
    way possible. Figure 11 shows the features and technologies that were used in
    the reviewed studies, separately for each category, for the sake of better comprehending
    the results of the analysis. Figure 11. Distribution of the most usual features
    implemented as input data in the machine learning algorithms for each category/sub-category.
    Data coming from remote sensing were the most common in the yield prediction sub-category.
    Remote sensing, in turn, was primarily based on data derived from satellites (40.6%
    of the total studies published in this sub-category) and, secondarily, from UAVs
    (23.2% of the total studies published in this sub-category). A remarkable observation
    is the rapid increase of the usage of UAVs versus satellites from the year 2018
    towards 2020, as UAVs seem to be a reliable alternative that can give faster and
    cheaper results, usually in higher resolution and independent of the weather conditions.
    Therefore, UAVs allow for discriminating details of localized circumscribed regions
    that the satellites’ lowest resolution may miss, especially under cloudy conditions.
    This explosion in the use of UAV systems in agriculture is a result of the developing
    market of drones and sensing solutions attached to them, rendering them economically
    affordable. In addition, the establishment of formal regulations for UAV operations
    and the simplification and automatization of the operational and analysis processes
    had a significant contribution on the increasing popularity of these systems.
    Data pertaining to the weather conditions of the investigated area were also of
    great importance as well as soil parameters of the farm at hand. An additional
    way of getting the data was via in situ manual measurements, involving measurements
    such as crop height, plant growth, and crop maturity. Finally, data concerning
    topographic, irrigation, and fertilization aspects were presented with approximately
    equal frequency. As far as disease detection is concerned, Red-Green-Blue (RGB)
    images appear to be the most usual input data for the ML algorithms (in 62% of
    the publications). Normally, deep learning methods like CNNs are implemented with
    the intention of training a classifier to discriminate images depicting healthy
    leaves, for example, from infected ones. CNNs use some particular operations to
    transform the RGB images so that the desired features are enhanced. Subsequently,
    higher weights are given to the images having the most suitable features. This
    characteristic constitutes a significant advantage of CNNs as compared to other
    ML algorithms, when it comes to image classification [79]. The second most common
    input data came from either multispectral or hyperspectral measurements originated
    from spectroradiometers, UAVs, and satellites. Concerning the investigated diseases,
    fungal diseases were the most common ones with diseases from bacteria following,
    as is illustrated in Figure 12a. This kind of disease can cause major problems
    in agriculture with detrimental economic consequences [96]. Other examined origins
    of crop diseases were, in descending order of frequency, pests, viruses, toxicity,
    and deficiencies. Figure 12. Distribution of the most usual output features of
    the machine learning algorithms regarding: (a) Disease detection and (b) Crop
    quality. Images were also the most used input data for weed detection purposes.
    These images were RGB images that originated mainly from in situ measurements
    as well as from UGVs and UAVs and, secondarily, multispectral images from the
    aforementioned sources. Finally, other parameters that were observed, although
    with lower frequency, were satellite multispectral images, mainly due to the considerably
    low resolution they provide, video recordings, and hyperspectral and greyscale
    images. Concerning crop recognition, the majority of the studies used data coming
    mostly from satellites and, secondarily, from in situ manual measurements. This
    is attributed to the fact that most of the studies in this category concern crop
    classification, a sector where satellite imaging is the most widely used data
    source owing to its potential for analysis of time series of extremely large surfaces
    of cultivated land. Laboratory measurements followed, while RGB and greyscale
    images as well as hyperspectral and multispectral measurements from UAVs were
    observed with lower incidence. The input data pertaining to crop quality consisted
    mainly of RGB images, while X-ray images were also utilized (for seed germination
    monitoring). Additionally, quality parameters, such as color, mass, and flesh
    firmness, were used. There were also two studies using spectral data either from
    satellites or spectroradiometers. In general, the studies belonging in this sub-category
    dealt with either crop quality (80%) or seed germination potential (20%) (Figure
    12b). The latter refers to the seed quality assessment that is essential for the
    seed production industry. Two studies were found about germination that both combined
    X-ray images analysis and ML. Concerning soil management, various soil properties
    were taken into account in 65.7% of the studies. These properties included salinity,
    organic matter content, and electrical conductivity of soil and soil organic carbon.
    Usage of weather data was also very common (in 48.6% of the studies), while topographic
    and data pertaining to the soil moisture content (namely the ratio of the water
    mass over the dry soil) and crop properties were presented with lower frequency.
    Additionally, remote sensing, including satellite and UAV multispectral and hyperspectral
    data, as well as proximal sensing, to a lesser extent, were very frequent choices
    (in 40% of the studies). Finally, properties associated with soil temperature,
    land type, land cover, root microbial dynamics, and groundwater salinity make
    up the rest of data, which are labeled as “other” in the corresponding graph of
    Figure 11. In water management, weather data stood for the most common input data
    (appeared in the 75% of the studies), with ET being used in the vast majority
    of them. In many cases, accurate estimation of ET (the summation of the transpiration
    via the plant canopy and the evaporation from plant, soil, and open water surface)
    is among the most central elements of hydrologic cycle for optimal management
    of water resources [97]. Data from remote sensors and measurements of soil water
    content were also broadly used in this category. Soil water availability has a
    central impact on crops’ root growth by affecting soil aeration and nutrient availability
    [98]. Stem water potential, appearing in three studies, is actually a measure
    of water tension within the xylem of the plant, therefore functioning as an indicator
    of the crop’s water status. Furthermore, in situ measurements, soil, and other
    parameters related to cumulative water infiltration, soil and water quality, field
    topography, and crop yield were also used, as can be seen in Figure 11. Finally,
    in what concerns livestock management, motion capture sensors, including accelerometers,
    gyroscopes, and pedometers, were the most common devices giving information about
    the daily activities of animals. This kind of sensors was used solely in the studies
    investigating animal welfare. Images, audio, and video recordings came next, however,
    appearing in both animal welfare and livestock production sub-categories. Physical
    and growth characteristics followed, with slightly less incidence, by appearing
    mainly in livestock production sub-category. These characteristics included the
    animal’s weight, gender, age, metabolites, biometric traits, backfat and muscle
    thickness, and heat stress. The final characteristic may have detrimental consequences
    in livestock health and product quality [99], while through the measurement of
    backfat and muscle thickness, estimations of the carcass lean yield can be made
    [100]. 5. Discussion and Main Conclusions The present systematic review study
    deals with ML in agriculture, an ever-increasing topic worldwide. To that end,
    a comprehensive analysis of the present status was conducted concerning the four
    generic categories that had been identified in the previous review by Liakos et
    al. [12]. These categories pertain to crop, water, soil, and livestock management.
    Thus, by reviewing the relative literature of the last three years (2018–2020),
    several aspects were analyzed on the basis of an integrated approach. In summary,
    the following main conclusions can be drawn: The majority of the journal papers
    focused on crop management, whereas the other three generic categories contributed
    almost with equal percentage. Considering the review paper of [12] as a reference
    study, it can be deduced that the above picture remains, more or less, the same,
    with the only difference being the decrease of the percentage of the articles
    regarding livestock from 19% to 12% in favor of those referring to crop management.
    Nonetheless, this reveals just one side of the coin. Taking into account the tremendous
    increase in the number of relative papers published within the last three years
    (in particular, 40 articles were identified in [12] comparing to the 338 of the
    present literature survey), approximately 400% more publications were found on
    livestock management. Another important finding was the increasing research interest
    on crop recognition. Several ML algorithms have been developed for the purpose
    of handling the heterogeneous data coming from agricultural fields. These algorithms
    can be classified in families of ML models. Similar to [12], the most efficient
    ML models proved to be ANNs. Nevertheless, in contrast to [12], the interest also
    been shifted towards EL, which can combine the predictions that originated from
    more than one model. SVM completes the group with the three most accurate ML models
    in agriculture, due to some advantages, such as its high performance when it works
    with image data [101]. As far as the most investigated crops are concerned, mainly
    maize and, secondarily, wheat, rice, and soybean were widely studied by using
    ML. In livestock management, cattle along with sheep and goats stood out constituting
    almost 85% of the studies. Comparing to [12], more species have been included,
    while wheat and rice as well as cattle, remain important specimens for ML applications.
    A very important result of the present review study was the demonstration of the
    input data used in the ML algorithms and the corresponding sensors. RGB images
    constituted the most common choice, thus, justifying the broad usage of CNNs due
    to their ability to handle this type of data more efficiently. Moreover, a wide
    range of parameters pertaining to weather as well as soil, water, and crop quality
    was used. The most common means of acquiring measurements for ML applications
    was remote sensing, including imaging from satellites, UAVs and UGVs, while in
    situ and laboratory measurements were also used. As highlighted above, UAVs are
    constantly gaining ground against satellites mainly because of their flexibility
    and ability to provide images with high resolution under any weather conditions.
    Satellites, on the other hand, can supply time-series over large areas [102].
    Finally, animal welfare-related studies used mainly devices such as accelerometers
    for activity recognition, whereas those ones referring to livestock production
    utilized primary physical and growth characteristics of the animal. As can be
    inferred from the geographical distribution (illustrated in Figure 6) in tandem
    with the broad spectrum of research fields, ML applications for facilitating various
    aspects of management in the agricultural sector is an important issue on an international
    scale. As a matter of fact, its versatile nature favors convergence research.
    Convergence research is a relatively recently introduced approach that is based
    on shared knowledge between different research fields and can have a positive
    impact on the society. This can refer to several aspects, including improvement
    of the environmental footprint and assuring human’s health. Towards this direction,
    ML in agriculture has a considerable potential to create value. Another noteworthy
    finding of the present analysis is the capturing of the increasing interest on
    topics concerning ML analyses in agricultural applications. More specifically,
    as can be shown in Figure 13, an approximately 26% increase was presented in the
    total number of the relevant studies, if a comparison is made between 2018 and
    2019. The next year (i.e., 2020), the corresponding increase jumped to 109% against
    2019 findings; thus, resulting in an overall 164% rise comparing with 2018. The
    accelerating rate of the research interest on ML in agriculture is a consequence
    of various factors, following the considerable advancements of ICT systems in
    agriculture. Moreover, there exists a vital need for increasing the efficiency
    of agricultural practices while reducing the environmental burden. This calls
    for both reliable measurements and handling of large volumes of data as a means
    of providing a wide overview of the processes taking place in agriculture. The
    currently observed technological outbreak has a great potential to strengthen
    agriculture in the direction of enhancing food security and responding to the
    rising consumers’ demands. Figure 13. Temporal distribution of the reviewed studies
    focusing on machine learning in agriculture, which were published within 2018–2020.
    In a nutshell, ICT in combination with ML, seem to constitute one of our best
    hopes to meet the emerging challenges. Taking into account the rate of today’s
    data accumulation along with the advancement of various technologies, farms will
    certainly need to advance their management practices by adopting Decision Support
    Systems (DSSs) tailored to the needs of each cultivation system. These DSSs use
    algorithms, which have the ability to work on a wider set of cases by considering
    a vast amount of data and parameters that the farmers would be impossible to handle.
    However, the majority of ICT necessitates upfront costs to be paid, namely the
    high infrastructure investment costs that frequently prevent farmers from adopting
    these technologies. This is going to be a pressing issue, mainly in developing
    economies, where agriculture is an essential economic factor. Nevertheless, having
    a tangible impact is a long-haul game. A different mentality is required by all
    stakeholders so as to learn new skills, be aware of the potential profits of handling
    big data, and assert sufficient funding. Overall, considering the constantly increasing
    recognition of the value of artificial intelligence in agriculture, ML will definitely
    become a behind-the-scenes enabler for the establishment of a sustainable and
    more productive agriculture. It is anticipated that the present systematic effort
    is going to constitute a beneficial guide to researchers, manufacturers, engineers,
    ICT system developers, policymakers, and farmers and, consequently, contribute
    towards a more systematic research on ML in agriculture. Author Contributions

    Abstract Greenhouse farming is considered as one of the most scientific approaches
    in agriculture, which are suitable for all climatic conditions, especially in
    Middle East, North America, and Europe. Sustainable greenhouses are innovative
    farming facilities for healthy vegetables and fruits in a controlled, conditioned
    indoor space. This article presents a literature review on the upgradation of
    a conventional to a sustainable greenhouse using modern engineering concept. This
    includes maintaining fully controlled indoor conditions such as temperature, relative
    humidity, and air velocity for specific agronomical parameters. The influence
    and improvements in upgradation of various heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning
    (HVAC) with the associated control systems and covering materials to reduce the
    energy consumption have been reviewed. Financial viability of conventional as
    well as upgraded greenhouses is highlighted. In Middle East climatic conditions,
    the major challenge is to control the optimal range of temperature (18–21°C),
    relative humidity (55 to 75%), and air velocity (0–1.3 m/s). It is found that
    the upgraded HVAC systems with climate control modules can increase the crop yield
    by 30%. Scientifically selected polycarbonate sheet covering materials are also
    found to increase the crop yield by up to 15% more than the conventional commercial
    greenhouses. Keywords: greenhouse HVAC; covering material; greenhouse climate
    control; energy conservation 1 Introduction Open-field agriculture has a lot of
    constraints in maintaining consistent crop production, such as unfavourable topographical
    and environmental conditions like fluctuating temperature, humidity, etc. They
    typically provide secure environments for better growth of plants in the present
    controlled environment conditions with optimum temperature, humidity, ventilation,
    air velocity, and soil moisture content. Greenhouse farming started the revolution
    of mechanized farming automation with automatic climate as well as fertigation
    mechanisms (Baptista et al. 2000). Gerasimov and Lyzlova (2014) propose the implementation
    of a controller system based on these parameters to enable farmers to monitor
    their greenhouses online. The primary objective associated with this review is
    to summarize the various studies carried out in the field of mechanized greenhouse
    farming to develop a cost-effective sustainable commercial greenhouse using evaporative
    cooling technology in conjunction with automatic climate control and different
    covering material upgradations with a focus on Middle East climatic conditions.
    In the Middle East, half of the year the cultivation is not feasible to normal
    climate due to the high temperature. Major objective of this study is to optimize
    energy utilization to improve the crop yield throughout the year. To maintain
    the in-house temperature ranging 24–26°C during summer months and to maintain
    the in-house temperature not less than 18°C during winter months. To maintain
    the in-house humidity between 55 and 75% with an effective heating, ventilation,
    and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. To provide sensors/probes to measure and log
    readings of temperature, humidity, CO2 levels and daylight for 24 h/365 days and
    integrate the field devices to a climate control system (CMS) to manage all the
    cooling, heating, and humidifying systems to achieve ideal weather inside the
    greenhouse according to the “growth stages.” The upgraded greenhouse should be
    economically viable with a reduction in energy costs. The above-mentioned objectives
    can be achieved with upgradation on the existing greenhouse. Upgradation of commercial
    greenhouse into a sustainable platform can be achieved in four stages, namely,
    (i) major factors related to HVAC systems, (ii) associated factors influencing
    the HVAC systems and related controls, (iii) effect on control system upgradation,
    and (iv) optimization. The sustainable greenhouse has been given much more priority
    than the commercial form of agriculture through leading upgradation in HVAC system
    and related controls. Sustainable platform of greenhouse activities is helpful
    in reducing the need for precious natural resources like land and water and at
    the same time with a high yield of crops per unit area and enhanced productivity
    as compared to an open-field grown crops. A flow chart for the upgradation of
    the current greenhouse is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Flow chart of the commercial
    greenhouse upgradation plan. 1.1 Conventional greenhouse HVAC systems Existing
    greenhouse systems, i.e., conventional greenhouse systems, are considered as experiencing
    high heat loss rates due to the high energy demands of the materials used to construct
    the greenhouse envelopes. As Ganguly and Ghosh (2011) explained, greenhouses that
    have cooling and ventilation systems need constant supply of electricity. The
    use of fan-driven cooling pad system is basically made to take away the heat generated
    by the supplying components as the pad and fan systems which consist of basic
    exhaustive fans at one end of the greenhouse and a circulating water pump with
    cooling pad at the other end. In order to maintain the constant temperature level
    in the greenhouses all the vents'' opening and closing are being interfaced with
    automatic climate control module to trigger the same as per the requirement. Thus,
    this driven cooling pad system is helpful in removing energy from the air, which
    lowers the temperature of the air introduced into the controlled farming indoor
    space (Baptista et al. 2010). The cooling process was highly inefficient as it
    seemed to be not achieving its maximum productivity and also leading to a high
    amount of wastage of resources and failing to make the best use of limited time
    and resources. This high level of inefficiency is seen in the process of recirculation
    as it has been observed that the conditioned closed space in the conventional
    greenhouse is done without the use of air grills on the top or sides, which reduces
    its efficiency and leads to a poor and inefficient process that require much more
    time and resources. In many mechanical systems, the use of axial fans with metal
    blades reduces their efficiency of operation. Deployment of a large workforce
    to maintain and regulate the indoor variables like temperature, relative humidity
    etc., is also forms a vital factor gar is giving significant affect in the value
    of net realization which is mainly caused by range recurring of a cooling pad
    along with the recirculation system maintenance. Figures 2 and 3 represent the
    3D and sectional views of a conventional greenhouse. Figure 2 3D view of the exterior
    of the conventional greenhouse ventilation. Figure 3 Sectional view of the conventional
    greenhouse ventilation. In the recent years, a large number of researchers have
    dwelt on the control of factors affecting the indoor conditions of the greenhouses.
    Researchers investigated the efficiency of using specifically designed HVAC systems
    (Bot 1983) as well as the use of wet pads (Coelho et al. 2005) and spray cooling
    (Bot 1989a). Natural ventilation is taken as the most fundamental and vital technique
    that facilities education in the usage of energy while making buildings. This
    phenomenon is based on the fact that the rage of cooling power and capacity of
    an ambient air could be easily harnessed to increase theoverall level of indoor
    thermal comforts which is a vital factor to be analyzed while designing the air
    conditioning systems. In order to take advantage of either deriving force or combining
    both, the building need to be designed in a proper way (Beven and Binley 1992).
    Further, being an old technology, the natural ventilation still serves and leads
    to enhanced experience of recent resurgence of better meeting the interest mainly
    in Europe where a large number of major research initiatives are conducted to
    evaluate this vital concept of natural ventilation. 1.2 Sustainable greenhouse
    Greenhouse structures enhance developing situations of vegetable, fruits, and
    decorative vegetation. Commercial greenhouses protect flora from unfavourable
    atmospheric dealers and, collectively with appropriate gadget, impact, and in
    the end modify the crop micro-climate, consequently increasing the marketplace
    accessibility of products, enhancing their high satisfactory, and permitting high
    yield. Thus, the consistent global growth within the region protected by means
    of greenhouses has led to enhanced need for growing sustainable blanketed horticulture.
    Sustainable greenhouse horticulture may be achieved via means of various cultivation
    techniques good enough to control gadgets and also by progressive substances aimed
    at lessening the agro-chemical substances, electricity use, and water intake.
    2 Effect of upgradation of HVAC systems Sustainable greenhouse horticulture is
    mainly associated with the use of various cultivation techniques along with some
    better management and use of adequate upgraded equipment along with innovative
    materials. The basic aim of sustainable greenhouse is to reduce the agro-chemicals,
    other energy use, and water consumption along with reduction in waste generation
    to move toward a more sustainable and vital greenhouse which leads to enhancement
    in production with optimum use of resources. It has been analysed that the upgradation
    of heating ventilation and use of air-conditioning systems, which are associated
    with control systems, lead to a more adequate and upgraded form of tools and techniques
    to build and structure a more efficient and better sustainable greenhouse (Boaventura
    Cunha 2003). 2.1 Greenhouse ventilation For the successful growth of crops in
    agricultural greenhouses, there is a need to control and maintain the temperature
    and humidity at optimum levels. These optimum conditions are required for the
    successful survival and yield of the crops. Settles (2000) analysed a basic greenhouse
    model to identify the controlled parameters such as temperature, relative humidity,
    and air velocity for plant growth in early days. The control parameters mainly
    consist of the factors that can be controlled or managed as per the need. With
    respect to the current greenhouse ventilation, the various controllable factors
    comprise temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity for plant growth, which
    are taken into full control and can be managed as per the need and requirement.
    In a common way, the structure used as a ventilation vent that forms a part of
    the greenhouse would have a much significant impact on the level of the ventilation
    of the greenhouse. Greenhouse structure, design, and geometry are modelled to
    withstand the adversity of external factors such as the wind, rain, snow, etc.
    Along with the protection from environmental factors, internal factors which includes
    the dead and live loads for the entire greenhouse also shall be designed in an
    efficient way to maximize the optimal solar radiation for the crop growth. The
    structural components of the greenhouse and their geometry seem to directly affect
    or associate with the solar radiation transmission (Bot 1989b). The geometry of
    the greenhouse designs is basically reflected in terms of the ratio of the expected
    length and width, which is assumed to be 30 m and were around 10, 10, and 8, respectively,
    to maintain the proper geometry and design of greenhouse. Various studies have
    been carried out to understand the effect of the vent structure and orientation
    in commercial greenhouses (Albright et al. 2001). Generally, on the basis of greenhouse
    design and construction, the ventilation system comprises side, roof, and a combination
    of two in greenhouses. Commercial greenhouses that utilize conventional air-conditioning
    systems are not as effective as in terms of cooling; and with humidity controls,
    they ought to be operating at half of their microclimate control potential. The
    concept of the microclimate is mainly defined as a fundamental factor which is
    based on the temperature, humidity, and speed of moving air. Thus, the microclimate
    control potential system is mainly designed for having a climate control of a
    sustainable greenhouse for increasing or lowering the temperature and relative
    humidity. The use of natural ventilation is made but the forced ventilation is
    not taken into account as the number of additional equipment and tools required
    for forced ventilation results in increased cost of greenhouse. Thus, to maintain
    the cost efficiency and to ensure a greenhouse with a normal use of technique,
    only natural ventilation is implicated and forced ventilation is not used (Coelho
    et al. 2005). 2.1.1 Natural ventilation Natural ventilation is the best suitable
    mode of ventilation for commercial greenhouses, if the external weather conditions
    are moderate in nature. Several models have been developed for natural ventilation
    systems, which were verified using analytical methods as well as computational
    fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Kittas et al. (2005) developed a naturally ventilated
    greenhouse model, which was verified using experiments in Mediterranean climate
    conditions (De Zwart 1996). Natural ventilation is the best suitable mode of ventilation
    for commercial greenhouses, if the external weather conditions are moderate in
    nature. Thus, CFD is predicted according to the mode and is verified from the
    experimental data but not all are verified with experimental data as it could
    be a complex and time-consuming process. Therefore, implication and utilization
    of CFD models attempt more effective analysis of problems and facts through simulating
    the interaction among various forms of liquids and gases where the surfaces are
    defined by boundary conditions (De Zwart 1997). On the other hand, the analytical
    model basically represents a set of mathematical models and other statistical
    tools and techniques to have a close form of solution to support enhanced decision
    making and conclusion. The analytical model makes and applies the use of equation
    to describe the changes that are taking place in a system and can be expressed
    as a mathematical form of analytic function (Dincer and Cengel 2001). Hornero-Méndez
    et al. (2002) studied the greenhouse ventilation variance using 2D lattice. The
    various variables on which the indoor climatic conditions depend comprise humidity,
    temperature, and sterility; all these environmental conditions are maintained
    at constant by a greenhouse. Further the expected temperature kept under the indoor
    climatic conditions and air velocity ranges from 80 to 85°F (Effat et al. 2015).
    The American society of Agricultural Engineers recommend a ventilation rate of
    0.04 m3 s−1. The results discussed are obtained from the analysis of proper temperature
    (ranges from 80 to 85°F) and relative humidity for better growth and enhanced
    productivity of crops. In another study conducted by Baeza et al. (2009), ventilation
    rates between 0.36 and 1.65 kg s−1 for a greenhouse produced the maximum yield.
    Many of the studies about ventilation variance was validated using CFD techniques
    in order to compare the results with natural ventilation (El Ghoumari et al. 2005).
    2.1.2 Fan-induced ventilation A fan-induced ventilation system that makes use
    of mounted fans, blowers, motors, etc., for one or more zones is vital to achieve
    better control over management and inside conditions. Greenhouse ventilation forms
    a most important and crucial part of any sustainable or other form of greenhouse,
    which involves removing air from inside the greenhouse and replacing it with outside
    air. Further, an evaporative cooler which is also commonly known as swamp cooler,
    swamp box, desert cooler, and wet air cooler is basically a device that is used
    to cool air through the evaporation of water. Further studies were carried out
    for developing a simple model of fan-ventilated greenhouse with fan pad evaporative
    cooling system. This gained wide acceptability in the past due to reduced quantum
    of investment and improved yield. Kittas et al. 2005 developed a successful mathematical
    model to determine the cooling potential of a fan pad evaporative cooling system.
    Temperature and humidity gradient models were determined for a commercial greenhouse
    and the variance in temperature inside and outside the greenhouse was fixed at
    5–10°C. This work was provided by Kittas et al. (2005) who had also improved the
    model by including the shading factors (Haefner 2005). Table 1 Reviewed articles,

    motors, etc., are needed to maintain proper flow of air and ensure an effective

    Investigated on finned evaporative coolers and condensers On the basis of the
    above-stated table regarding the various innovation with respect to better ventilation
    and air flow in a greenhouse, it has been found that Settles (2000) provides a
    better innovation related with the airflow systems which emphasizes and focuses
    on the air flow visualization in a greenhouse. Further, the greenhouse vents basically
    comprise a vent opening which is utilized to regulate and control microclimate
    inside a greenhouse. Besides this, Zanas et al. (2004) also facilitate an understanding
    about the greenhouse ventilation which enhances windward ventilation by making
    use of a better model based on vent arrangement. At last, it has been found out
    that a novel approach for ventilation is provided by the Katsoulas et al. (2006)
    who proposed a vent opening innovation in order to improve the ventilation inside
    greenhouse by making use of fog evaporative cooling system. However, based on
    the previous studies, the vent opening time and orientations were not studied;
    upgradation with a proper number, orientation, and opening time of the vents can
    improve the microclimate inside the greenhouse through a proper effect on the
    relative humidity to maintain a proper temperature and ventilation inside the
    greenhouse. Therefore, implementation of sensor-interfaced air vents on top of
    the greenhouse structure can utilize the natural ventilation to control the temperature
    and relative humidity, remotely with the help of climate control stations. 2.2
    Greenhouse cooling using evaporative systems Various researchers have explored
    the utilization of evaporative systems in temperature management of greenhouses.
    An evaporative system mainly comprises an intake chamber along with various filter(s)
    with supply fan which acts as a heat exchanger in order to maintain the proper
    cooling and temperature inside a greenhouse. The use of exhaust fan, water sprays,
    recirculating water pump, and water sump are made to have a proper and efficient
    evaporative cooling systems which are mainly characterized by low energy use compared
    with a refrigeration cooling system. A typical evaporative cooling system components
    and the flow of operations have been shown in Figures 4 and 5. Joudi and Hasan
    (2013) studied the effectiveness of using absorption-type evaporative coolers
    in Baghdad. Besides this, it has also been observed that the use of evaporative
    cooler is also vital to ensure effective cooling along with air-condition as it
    has been understood that evaporative coolers are utilized to perform both functions.
    Thus, making efficient utilization of evaporative coolers is better and suitable
    while covering HVAC as it performs both the important and crucial functions of
    cooling and conditioning the air (Linker et al. 2011). Figure 4 Box-type evaporative
    cooling system. Figure 5 Working principle of an evaporative cooler. The annual
    total amount of coal required for maintaining and running an HVAC system basically
    ranged from 160.34 to 466.78 t/ha, while the total cost of the system is between
    37,412 and 108,916 $/ha. Apart from this, the total annual fixed cost on the basis
    of the cost per hectare was taken to be between 10,325 and 14,328 $/year whereas
    the total variable cost fluctuates and varies from 20.1 to 30.9 $/ha. Further,
    the total cost which was calculated as the total annual and hourly costs per hectare
    ranged from 65,891.5 to 151,220.6 $/year and from 23.8 to 34.2 $/ha, respectively
    (López-Cruz et al. 2012a). The upgradation, therefore, aims at minimizing this
    cost by using efficient evaporative coolers, where the cooling load itself is
    reduced by using a covering material appropriate for Middle East’s climatic condition.
    Figure 6 shows the structure of such an upgraded greenhouse. Figure 6 Single span
    greenhouse with individual box-type evaporative coolers and ventilation fans (V-flow
    fans) – sectional view and 3D view. An in-depth analysis of these factors are
    discussed as a part of qualitative analysis while concentrating and focusing on
    further evaluation of these factors to be used in the commercial greenhouse (López-Cruz
    et al. 2012b). Existing technologies implement the evaporative cooling technique
    to manage temperatures. One such technology system that reduces air temperature
    without altering the air moisture content is the indirect evaporative cooling
    system. In such systems, the process air stream does not make a direct connect
    with the cooling fluid stream although there is sensible heat transfer between
    them leading to the cooling of one stream. Thus, an analysis can be made that
    the indirect evaporative cooling system has an efficiency of 60–70% as compared
    with the direct evaporative coolers, as it costs nearly about one-half and also
    makes use of only about one-quarter of energy compared other cooling systems;
    thus, it is more efficient than other systems (López-Cruz et al. 2014). Thus,
    here the discussion about the thickness and width of cooling pad structure is
    made, based on that a requirement to select the proper packing material has been
    identified in order to meet the desired water flow (Luo et al. 2005). The improved
    technology using Maisotsenko cycle (M-cycle) can provide a better result in energy-friendly
    evaporative cooling operation. This cycle is mainly taken as an indirect evaporative
    cooling–based cycle that makes utilization of a much smarter geometrical configuration
    for leading and ensuring better air distribution. The energy source of this type
    of cooler is water in place of electricity; thus, the usage of M-cycle-based coolers
    ensures a more significant way for energy saving as it leads to more than 80%
    saving in terms of average consumption of electricity (Mashonjowa et al. 2013a).
    The M-cycle in greenhouse is used as an air-conditioning technology that offers
    better opportunities for energy conservation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,
    thus leading to better growth of crop. Kreid et al. (1978) had investigated the
    finned evaporative coolers along with the range of other condensers (Mashonjowa
    et al. 2013b). The above discussions have been summarized in Table 2. To sum up,
    based on the research available on upgradation of commercial greenhouses, evaporative
    cooling systems are suitable for high-temperature and low relative humidity ambient
    conditions. Because of such climatic conditions in the Middle East, we have used
    custom-designed box-type evaporative coolers for better performance in terms of
    yield management in commercial greenhouses. Effective results from the evaporative
    coolers require the cooling pads to be saturated at all times. The discharge between
    the fans and cooling pads also has to be negotiated effectively employing proper
    motor controls. This can be achieved with box-type individual evaporative cooling
    configurations, making this more energy saving, simple, environment friendly,
    and cost-effective air-conditioning strategy. 2.3 Greenhouse heating Different
    greenhouse heating systems have been adopted in the past, such as direct air heaters,
    central pipe surface heating systems, geothermal heating, etc. Ghosal and Towar
    developed a greenhouse model with geothermal energy suitable for freezing temperature
    conditions. In this study, the authors realize a remarkable temperature rise of
    14–23°C while it was freezing outside the greenhouse. Carlini et al. (2010), through
    their experimental study conducted in Viterbo, Italy, proved the feasibility of
    geothermal plant through a TRNSYS simulation and verified the results, thereby
    confirming the efficacy of using geothermal solutions. Table 3 summarizes the
    list of reviewed papers, with their major findings and conclusions. Table 3 Reviewed
    articles, approaches, and parameters studied Author Approach Aspects of study
    Burdick (2011) Load calculations Issued a strategy guideline for heating and cooling
    as well as the performance of load calculations Navas et al. (1998) Evaporative
    cooling Proposed the use of geothermal energy to implement the cooling mechanism
    in greenhouses Carlini et al. (2010) Geothermal energy utilization Developed a
    simulation model for exploiting geothermal energy Various options for greenhouse
    heating have been mentioned in the literature. One of the major drawbacks in many
    of the upgradation practices were the level of CO2 emission. Qerimi et al. (2020)
    carried out a solar thermal energy model for the upgradation of urban areas to
    avoid CO2 emission mainly from buildings and other sources. Upgradation using
    solar thermal energy system similar to other buildings in urban areas to reduce
    the CO2 emission is an innovative option where the controlled farming can convert
    into more sustainable way. In our upgraded greenhouse, HVAC control systems are
    capable of controlling the CO2 level without any additional CO2 generators which
    is a significant contribution towards sustainability. 3 Associated factors for
    greenhouse HVAC system upgradation To have a comprehensive upgradation of the
    HVAC and control systems by regulating the controlled variables with respect to
    the disturbances such as temperature and relative humidity, parameters such as
    greenhouse structure, orientation of the greenhouse, and the irrigation system
    management have to be studied. They are described individually in the following
    sections (Van Straten 2008). 3.1 Greenhouse covering materials The covering material
    for the greenhouse, which is integral to its design structure, is chosen based
    on the effective control of yield management. This is similar to the shading system
    associated with the structure. A study was conducted in United Arab Emirates to
    interpret the results from different combinations of covering materials which
    include Solexx twin-wall covering, poly film plastic greenhouse covering, single-walled
    polycarbonate, and twin-walled polycarbonate. Structures have been tested using
    two different combinations of polycarbonate covering materials with the conventional
    covering material using polyethylene (Udink ten Cate 1984). The experiments concluded
    that multilayer polycarbonate combinations of covering materials are providing
    a higher yield of up to 20% compared to the conventional polyethylene sheet. A
    vital parameter of greenhouse cultivation is light. Nageib et al. (2012) experimented
    with various shading options in cucumber farming, which is taken as the most high-yield
    vegetable during the course of greenhouse methodology. In the commercial greenhouses,
    cucumbers are grown, which tend to have lower percentages of defective growth
    and higher commercial yield than the ones which are grown in the open field. Abu-Zahra
    and Ateyyat (2016) chose shading materials with proper optical properties based
    on the photosynthetically active radiation of the crop. 3.1.1 Shading In conventional
    upgradation, the shading of greenhouses was quite common, which is achieved by
    various methods such as whitening the covering materials by wrapping with external
    shading cloths mounting plastic nets of variable covers, movable refractive screens,
    and spraying the covering material with aqueous sprays. Shading using whitening
    is inexpensive and one of the most efficient methods in preventing the heat load
    in deep summer in the early days. However, this can be damaged easily over time.
    Shading reduces the average transmittance due to direct solar radiations. In arid
    climatic conditions, shading can reduce the consumption of irrigation water. Shading
    could be either internal or external and this can affect/control the microclimate
    inside the greenhouse positively on many occasions. However, shading has a major
    disadvantage as internal/external shadings on covering materials can obstruct
    the incident solar radiations required for photosynthetic activities (Trigui 2000).
    3.1.2 Radiation filters for covering materials Regions of hot and sunny climate
    poses a major challenge in developing a covering material which can sustain the
    climatic conditions. In arid climatic regions major properties to be considered
    while designing the covering material are cooling effect, high mechanical properties,
    and durability with less maintenance. This technique is known as liquid radiation
    filters (LRFs). The advantages of the usage of LRFs have been verified using simulations,
    although complexity and high investment costs are the significant disadvantages
    of this system. In order to avoid the difficulties in implementation and maintenance
    of LRF, various researchers tested the near-infrared (NIR) reflecting film covers
    (Tap et al. 1996). This is considered as an improved arrangement. LRFs in polycarbonate
    sheet panels can reduce the temperature inside the greenhouse by 6–8°C (Kittas
    et al. 2005). Various combinations of fluid roof covers and NIR reflecting film
    coatings have also been tested in the past. 3.1.3 Covering material upgradation
    Behera et al. (2016), in their study, reviewed the properties of polyethylene
    sheets used for greenhouses and covering material upgradations. From this study,
    the major inference is that a polycarbonate sheet with two layers of 2 mm each
    in operation provides better result than a single layer of same thickness. Real-time
    cultivations were carried out for one complete cycle of cucumber growth in those
    three different greenhouses. Real-time cultivation results emphasized that the
    crops harvested from the polycarbonate sheet-mounted greenhouse yielded more with
    good quality, and this has also been verified by spectrometric analysis by making
    use of filed devises like the temperature sensors and PAR meters (Tap 2000). Test
    setup was in three different greenhouses with polyethylene as material 01 while
    the other two comprise polycarbonate of different thicknesses 2 mm and 4 mm as
    materials 02 and 03, respectively (Stanghellini and de Jong 1995). A general methodology
    of covering material selection has been shown in Figure 7. Hochmuth (1993), in
    his study, outlined the various properties of polyethylene sheets and their correlation
    to the agronomical gradients which are defined as different parameters for the
    plant growth. Teitel (2007) observed the effect of thickness of the covering materials
    on plant growth and concluded that polycarbonate sheets produce the best results
    in terms of temperature control and crop yield. Figure 7 Flow chart of the covering
    material selection methodology. Figures 8 and 9 show the experimental setup comprising
    greenhouses with polyethylene and polycarbonate as the covering materials (Wang
    and Liang 2006). The first greenhouse has a polyethylene covering while the second
    one has a polycarbonate covering of 4 mm thickness. The double-film-covered setup
    works well with heat storage–release systems; the covering materials coated both
    sides with thermal absorbent coatings that can manage the heat generated from
    the underground thermal systems and this has been verified in the study conducted
    by Wang and Liang (2006). Figure 8 Polyethylene sheet covering material. Figure
    9 Polycarbonate covering material. Hochmuth (1993) successfully carried out the
    spectrometric analysis of various combinations of the available shading options
    and recorded the optimal combinations. Results of a spectrometric analysis using
    the licor-LI190 R sensors are summarized in Table 4. Table 4 Spectral analysis
    of the covering materials as reported by Hochmuth (1993) and Subin et al. (2018)

    of the overall shading on indoor plant growth and analysed the U-value characteristics
    (the thermal transmittance of a material or an assembly is expressed as a U value).
    Nelson (1998) analysed the shade curtain components with detailed upgradation
    plans suitable for plant growth while Radojević et al. (2014) emphasized the effect
    of energy balance in HVAC systems upon shading upgrades. Rumsey recorded a detailed
    study about the high-density polycarbonate shade screens and the advantages of
    the same in terms of energy efficiency as well as the crop protection from the
    sunlight (Speetjens 2008). Sanford (2011) indicated how shade curtains are useful
    in reducing heating and cooling costs. Since the curtain thicknesses range from
    0.5 mm to 3 mm, which can be controlled using a manual arrangement of roller or
    sensor for automated climate control. Curtain influences the incoming transmission
    of light and heat retention within greenhouse, and both these factors highly influence
    the total energy usage of greenhouse (Figures 10 and 11). Figure 10 Micrograph
    of the upgraded covering material with HDPE-reinforced energy curtains. Figure
    11 Greenhouse using HDPE fibre-reinforced shade curtains. With the use of curtains,
    the total energy costs related to commercial greenhouse might decline by 25–40%.
    Apart from this, proper use of climate screens assists in optimizing the overall
    climate in greenhouse that will lessen the cost as well as the intensity of activities
    associated with crop management including spraying, watering, and pruning (Sethi
    and Sharma 2007a). A summary list of the reviewed articles along with their major
    findings and innovations is detailed in Table 5. Table 5 Reviewed articles, approaches,

    suitable materials for greenhouse covering and explored the best combination for
    the polycarbonate sheet Based on the available literature on upgradation of covering
    materials, the major challenge was the selection of covering materials and its
    thickness. However, based on the methodology shown in Figure 7, a polycarbonate
    sheet of 2 mm thickness provides good yield in the Middle East climatic conditions
    with a reasonable capital investment. Moreover, a specially designed shade curtain
    supplements the covering materials efficiently. The transparent energy screen
    and traditional shade curtains are meant for the retention of energy and enable
    increased level of light transmission. Proper installation of curtains and screens
    are important for maximizing cost saving. This also improves the yield by up to
    20% and maintains the temperature, ensuring proper growth of crops. 3.2 Greenhouse
    direction or orientation An all-year greenhouse model has been developed; and
    in 24° E–W direction, the results were successful. Thermal modelling of the successful
    model has been carried out in the previous studies by researchers and proved the
    abovementioned recommendations (Panwar et al. 2012). Selection of optimal shape
    of the greenhouse in conjunction with the orientation may provide an improved
    result in the arid climatic conditions especially in Middle East regions (El-Maghlany
    2015). E–W direction with arch-shaped combination can provide a good crop yield
    (Sengar et al. 2013). Greenhouse location selection is crop-specific and based
    on the required temperature requirement of the crops. 3.3 Greenhouse irrigation
    systems Irrigation is defined as the artificial application of water to soil by
    different systems of pumps, tubes, and sprays. Different types of irrigation systems
    uniformly supply water to the whole field. The water for irrigation comes from
    the ground through surface water, wells or springs, reservoirs, lakes, rivers,
    and other sources. Some common irrigation system types include surface irrigation
    in which the water is distributed across and over the land through gravity and
    no mechanical pump is included (Sethi and Sharma 2007b). Localized irrigation
    is another type of irrigation in which the water is distributed through piped
    network under low pressure and applied on each plant. Apart from this, sprinkler
    irrigation is also one of the types in which water is distributed through overhead
    high-pressure guns or sprinkler from a central location in the field. In addition
    to these types of irrigation, other types include drip irrigation, centre pivot
    irrigation, lateral move irrigation, manual irrigation, and sub-irrigation. 4
    Effect of upgradation of greenhouse using CMS The greenhouses must render controlled
    environment for the production of plant with sufficient humidity, temperature,
    and sunlight. Greenhouses require exposure to maximum light, specifically in the
    morning hours. The greenhouse quality has everything to do with control technology
    use in the greenhouse. The facilities designed and outfitted proper efficient
    systems of HVAC which will develop better environment to assist in continuous
    production of connoisseur grade products. Evaporative cooling was used to upgrade
    the HVAC in greenhouse and for climate control. The system involves cooling pad
    made of porous material with water that flowing through it, keeping it saturated
    on the end wall of greenhouse; and at opposite end wall is a large extraction
    fan which develops negative pressure in the structure, full exterior air by cooling
    pad, moves it along the length of facility as well as at the back of the other
    end. When warm air from outside passes through the cooling pad and the water evaporates,
    the air temperature and the greenhouse climate drop (Zaragoza et al. 2007). Kim
    et al. (2006) created a wireless sensor network irrigation system capable of collecting
    soil and weather information from sensors and then conveying it via a Bluetooth
    antenna to a base station. The programmable logic controller (PLC) processed feedback
    information from the base system to vary water irrigation in order to maintain
    the desired moisture level (Wallach et al. 2014). Crop water stress index (CWSI)
    helps a farmer to determine the best level of soil moisture to support optimum
    plant growth, crop production, and crop yield based on the estimated evaporation
    of moisture from the soil. The crop variety determines the calibration curves
    which involves the soil moisture content against the crop water index (it is agronomical).
    Indeed, temperature and soil moisture are the main factors of CWSI (Vadiee and
    Martin 2013a, b). A model which can integrate environmental sensors, drip irrigation
    system, PLC, and wireless devices to construct an intelligent wireless irrigation
    system (WIS) for use in greenhouses can control the indoor parameters in a systematic
    and most beneficial manner, resulting in maximum crop yield (Vadiee and Martin
    2012). 4.1 Climate control module Climate control module with a microcontroller
    in the sensing unit was tested in the field to evaluate their data transmission
    with PLCs in the beginning. A scientifically designed control system in a commercial
    greenhouse is becoming a necessity for high crop yield by controlling the field
    requirements of the crops with minimal human interference (Udink ten Cate 1985).
    Irrigation and the crop transpiration rates are controlled using the respective
    sensors mounted at various locations of the greenhouses and aided in accurate
    measurement monitoring necessary to trigger corrective measures in greenhouses
    (van Ooteghem 2005, 2007, 2010). Temperature and relative humidity sensors can
    log the variance between the set value for the crop and this can improve the crop
    quality as well as avoid typical phenomena like tip burn for the crops due to
    the sudden fluctuations in temperatures. Figure 12 illustrates a typical climate
    control module schematic in a commercial greenhouse. Figure 12 Climate control
    setup (Subin et al. 2020). Implementation of a nonlinear multivariable transfer
    function control system model of a greenhouse using thermodynamic laws in conjunction
    with the variables directly affecting temperature and relative humidity can maintain
    the greenhouse indoor conditions in an optimal manner. Mamdani model-based fuzzy
    proportional integral derivative (PID) has been developed (Subin et al. 2020)
    to compare the performance and productivity level of a PID and proportional integral
    (PI) in order to accomplish a smooth and better controllable action. A typical
    control system schematic using fuzzy logic controllers for commercial greenhouses
    is shown in Figure 13. A concise list of the reviewed articles and their major
    findings and conclusions are shown in Table 6. Figure 13 Schematic for an upgraded

    water stress index; PLC = programmable logic controller; PID = proportional integral
    derivative. Bluetooth technology has been used to control the indoor agriculture
    ambient conditions in our upgraded greenhouse. Based on the previous studies conducted,
    upgradation in control system using PID and PLCs maintained the required indoor
    ambient conditions. By implementing a Mamdani model-based fuzzy PID controller,
    the yield improved by up to 20% with properly selected HVAC systems. Further enhancement
    is possible using artificial intelligence and neural network systems which is
    beyond the scope of this study. 5 Dynamic modelling of greenhouse climate optimization
    The dynamic modelling for the greenhouse climate optimization comprises of the
    optimization of uncertain control variables and associated optimal setting parameter
    estimation for analysis for an improved greenhouse model in terms of yield and
    energy management. The main structural feature of this model is described using
    the system state approach. It comprises a physical process with many dynamic equations
    having sufficient emphasis on the greenhouse climate (Saltelli et al. 2000). Apart
    from this, the type and form of equation are based on either the concept of differential
    equation or the transfer function, which are also important during the evaluation
    of dynamic model. Besides, almost all the models had seemed to be calibrated and
    evaluated through a measured firm of data collected from the system; thus it ensures
    and leads to the lack of all possible uncertainties and also ensures sensitivity
    analysis for better development and creation of greenhouse model. A concise summary

    the cost of open-field farming and greenhouse farming in a stable climatic conditions,
    it is understood that the yield is high in open-field farming; and the actual
    cost–benefit ratio has been demonstrated in certain countries (Ozkan et al. 2007);
    however, the open-field farming has limitations of cultivating the crops in all
    weather conditions. Therefore, while comparing the net yield in all the cycles
    in a year, commercial farming will be economical, especially in arid climatic
    geographical regions like Middle East. Based on the literature, in a standard
    commercial greenhouse, the annual total coal requirement for maintaining and running
    an HVAC system basically ranged from 160.34 to 466.78 t/ha in addition to the
    total cost of the system, which is between 37,412 and 108,916 $/ha. Apart from
    this, the total annual fixed cost on the basis of the cost per hectare ranged
    between 10,325 and 14,328  $/year, whereas the total variable cost also fluctuates
    and varies from 20.1 to 30.9 $/h. Further, the total cost which was calculated
    as the total annual and hourly costs per hectare was 65,891.5–151,220.6 $/year
    and 23.8–34.2 $/h, respectively (López-Cruz et al. 2012a). However, for an electrically
    powered HVAC system in a controlled greenhouse, on average 15.12 GJ/h is required
    to operate the greenhouse per day. In order to forecast the greenhouse yield,
    the management decision support system is one of the important tools that can
    be used in agricultural prototypes while doing upgradations (Fenu and Malloci
    2019). Upgradation using solar-powered greenhouse can further decrease the energy
    cost and can keep the commercial greenhouse farming more sustainable. Based on
    the total power requirements, solar photovoltaic modules need to be selected based
    on the area available to mount and accordingly the battery design needs to be
    evaluated (Nazir et al. 2019) (Figure 14). Figure 14 Greenhouse energy analysis
    pie chart showing the relative costs of various heads. Comparisons of energy portfolios
    of the conventional and upgraded greenhouse are listed in Table 8 with operational
    expenditure reduction in the upgraded greenhouse. We observed an overall reduction
    of 30% in the operational recurring cost in the HVAC head with evaporative cooler
    equipped with upgraded covering material and 5% in the irrigation head due to
    the irrigation control system implementation in the climate control module, and
    around 10% in the associated labour component for the farm monitoring due to the
    installation of climate control module. A bar diagram representing both the scenarios
    with reduction in energy expenditure has been shown in Figure 15. Table 8 Energy

    23 21 10.43 Figure 15 Energy expenditure comparison before and after upgradation
    on major heads. This energy reduction resulted in an increase of more than 45%
    in the sales realization. In Middle East climatic conditions, the net half-yearly
    realization per hectare for the conventional greenhouse was AED 267,748.00 with
    HVAC energy operational expense of AED 159,888.00; however, in the upgraded sustainable
    greenhouse the net realization has been increased to AED 385,461.00 with HVAC
    energy operational expense reduced to AED 50,561.84 which is almost 50% less than
    the existing greenhouse consumption. Correspondingly the associated labour and
    irrigation components also reduced. The major cost reduction factor in the upgradation
    was the replacement of the conventional HVAC system with box-type evaporative
    coolers and running the same with half the numbers in full-load condition is enough
    to maintain the indoor conditions in the upgraded greenhouse with box-type evaporative
    cooler of 7 numbers, each with polycarbonate sheet roofing equipped with a remote
    monitoring CMS, which can remarkably reduce the energy operational expenditure;
    and the total energy spend in a day has been reduced from 15.12 to 10.24 GJ. 7
    Conclusion Conventional greenhouse systems endure challenges related to losses
    due to their energy efficiency especially in hot climatic regions such as the
    Middle East. Various conventional ventilation systems are aimed at improving the
    performance of such greenhouses including the use of axial fans and cooling pads – without
    roof ventilation. However, the best combination that ensures free air circulation
    is roof ventilation along with the usage of axial fans and cooling pads. Combined
    design with roof ventilation and automatic air vent systems can improve the performance
    of the greenhouses in terms of energy conservation and high yield of the crops.
    The HVAC systems which is older than 10 years can be replaced with products that
    are energy star certified. A feedback loop was linked with a system of linear
    sprinklers that is mainly controlled with the help of a PLC. Scientifically selected
    covering materials can influence greenhouse indoor cultivation in a very high
    level of efficiency, and this can increase the yield up to 20% than conventional
    practices. Different combinations of polycarbonate sheets with varying thickness
    in the range of 2–4 mm improved the greenhouse yield. Spectrometric analysis of
    combinations of covering materials provided continuous developments in the various
    combinations of the covering materials. However, the covering materials manufactured
    by adding some additives such as natural reinforced high-density polyethylene-reinforced
    fibre provided a better result while using the same on top of polycarbonate sheets.
    Upgraded greenhouse facilitated a constant temperature between 18 and 25°C, relative
    humidity (55–75%), and air velocity (0–1.3 m/s) for the optimal plant growth.
    Selection of covering materials can be verified with the help of comparison of
    micrographs of the improved specimens with the original ones before the implementation
    of the materials in the real scenario. On the other hand, upgradation of conventional
    commercial greenhouses to the soil-less irrigation system is quite challenging
    requiring high initial investment. However, combining the various upgradations
    of HVAC and control systems of commercial greenhouses can manage this challenge,
    which need to be studied further. Abbreviations ARX autoregressive with external

    Get rights and content Abstract Plant phenomics is a new avenue for linking plant
    genomics and environmental studies, thereby improving plant breeding and management.
    Remote sensing techniques have improved high-throughput plant phenotyping. However,
    the accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of three-dimensional (3D) phenotyping
    are still challenging, especially in field environments. Light detection and ranging
    (lidar) provides a powerful new tool for 3D phenotyping with the rapid development
    of facilities and algorithms. Numerous efforts have been devoted to studying static
    and dynamic changes of structural and functional phenotypes using lidar in agriculture.
    These progresses also improve 3D plant modeling across different spatial–temporal
    scales and disciplines, providing easier and less expensive association with genes
    and analysis of environmental practices and affords new insights into breeding
    and management. Beyond agriculture phenotyping, lidar shows great potential in
    forestry, horticultural, and grass phenotyping. Although lidar has resulted in
    remarkable improvements in plant phenotyping and modeling, the synthetization
    of lidar-based phenotyping for breeding and management has not been fully explored.
    We identify three main challenges in lidar-based phenotyping development: 1) developing
    low cost, high spatial–temporal, and hyperspectral lidar facilities, 2) moving

    1. Introduction Plant phenomics is the multidisciplinary study of monitoring,
    acquiring, modeling, and analyzing plant development and multi-dimensional characteristics
    as determined by the genetics under given environment and management practices
    on an organism-wide scale (Bilder et al., 2009, Dhondt et al., 2013, Johannsen,
    1911, Lobos et al., 2017, Ninomiya et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2020, Zhao et al.,
    2019). During the past several decades, plant phenomics has been widely recognized
    as a fast and cost-effective way to unravel the genetic basis of complicated plant
    traits, to improve genetic gain using gene association analysis technologies (e.g.,
    quantitative trait locus mapping and genome-wide association studies), and to
    shorten the breeding cycle for a greater number of breeding lines (Luis Araus
    et al., 2018, Montes et al., 2007, Pound et al., 2017, Rebetzke et al., 2019,
    Rincent et al., 2018, Tripodi et al., 2018, Watt et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2013a,
    Yang et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2017). Meanwhile, explosive
    interest in combining plant phenomics with modeling platforms has enabled researchers
    to simulate plant response to allelic variation and environmental stress (Tardieu,
    2003). Plant phenomics is increasingly crucial for breeding and management with
    increasing world population, degrading arable land, and continuing climate change
    (Lobos et al., 2017, Shafri et al., 2012, Skelton, 2019, Tagarakis et al., 2013,
    Westling et al., 2018, Yandun et al., 2017). Phenotyping, a key and fundamental
    task in plant phenomics (Houle et al., 2010, Lobos et al., 2017, Yang et al.,
    2020), has been greatly improved through the advancement of proximal and remote
    sensing technologies (Zhao et al., 2019). Optical imaging techniques are the most
    widely used methods for capturing phenotype states and dynamics (Li et al., 2014a),
    such as plant architecture (Mu et al., 2018), plant temperature (Ludovisi et al.,
    2017, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012), and plant physiology (Wang et al., 2018). These
    optical imaging techniques have boosted plant phenotyping. However, characterizing
    the three-dimensional (3D) plant structure information (Thapa et al., 2018) that
    is critical for capturing plant movement, quantifying growth, and understanding
    functional differences at multi-spatial and temporal scales (Dechant et al., 2020,
    Dornbusch et al., 2012) is still a very challenging issue. Recently, 3D imaging
    techniques have been developed to derive vegetation structure information from
    optical images (Huesca et al., 2016, Martínez Guanter et al., 2019, Paulus, 2019,
    Pound et al., 2014). These techniques include active structured light, active
    time of flight camera, passive stereo vision (e.g., binocular vision), and passive
    structure from motion (Holman et al., 2016). However, these reflection-based methods
    are easily affected by light conditions (Colaco et al., 2018, Li et al., 2014a),
    background reflectance (e.g., soil) (Eitel et al., 2014), and plant structure
    (Dechant et al., 2020, Gao et al., 2013, Li et al., 2015b, Wallace et al., 2013).
    In addition, although several medical imaging techniques such as computed tomography,
    positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance image have been used to derive
    depth images of plant characteristics (Pfeifer et al., 2015), they are mostly
    applied in controlled environment. The accuracy, efficiency, and applicability
    of 3D imaging-based phenotyping are still challenging in field environments. The
    advent of light detection and ranging (Lidar) has brought new hope for 3D plant
    phenotyping. Lidar is an active sensing technology that emits short-wavelength
    lasers (i.e., visible, ultraviolet, or near-infrared light) to measure the distance
    from the sensor to the target according to laser speed and flight time recorded
    by a timer (Lin, 2015, Shan and Toth, 2018). The distance is then transferred
    into 3D structure information based on the laser emitting angle collected by an
    angle encoder. Lidar has several advantages, including high spatial resolution,
    high throughput, high repeatability, and independency from illumination (Llorens
    et al., 2011, Madec et al., 2017), which make the technology well-suited to field
    environments. More importantly, the short-wavelength laser can penetrate the vegetation
    canopy to characterize vegetation inner structures, which compensates for the
    deficiencies of previously-mentioned optical image technologies (Berk et al.,
    2016). During the past three decades, lidar has been widely used to quantify plant
    structure (Coops et al., 2007, Davies and Asner, 2014, Dubayah and Drake, 2000,
    Hyyppä et al., 2020b, Lefsky et al., 2002, Liang et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2017b,
    Nelson et al., 1988, Omasa et al., 2006, Popescu and Zhao, 2008, Saarinen et al.,
    2017, Zhao et al., 2018) and has been actively studied to extract phenotypes for
    boosting plant breeding and improving plant management in the last decade (Asner
    et al., 2017, Calders et al., 2020, Cao et al., 2019, Hosoi and Omasa, 2012, Lim
    et al., 2003b, Popescu and Wynne, 2004, Simonson et al., 2012, Wulder et al.,
    2012). Over the past one decade, a few reviews have presented how to estimate
    crop traits using images for plant phenotyping (Bucksch et al., 2014, Jiang and
    Li, 2020, Jin et al., 2020d, Li et al., 2014a, Luis Araus et al., 2018, Perez-Sanz
    et al., 2017, Pound et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2020). However, the question of
    how lidar can boost plant phenotyping from 2D to 3D for plant breeding and management
    has not been answered directly (Lin, 2015). In this review, we first provide a
    comprehensive overview of the progress of lidar facilities (i.e., sensor and platform)
    and algorithms for high-throughput phenotyping in both indoor and field environments.
    These advancements have promoted agriculture breeding and management by improving
    the abilities of phenotype extraction and crop modeling. Second, compared with
    other recent reviews that center on agriculture phenotyping, we further discuss
    how lidar advances phenotyping in forestry, horticulture, and grass. Finally,
    we provide insights into current challenges and perspectives of lidar applications
    in plant phenomics from three main aspects, including the topic of phenotypic
    facility, algorithm and modeling, and big data. 2. The development of lidar in
    plant phenotyping The development of lidar in plant phenotyping includes both
    facilities and algorithms. The lidar facilities focus on both sensors and platforms.
    Lidar sensors have undergone advances from discrete lidar (i.e., single-return
    and multi-return lidar) to waveform lidar and from single-band to multi-band lidar.
    The platforms have experienced multi-scale development both indoors and outdoors
    and have increased the demand for dedicated algorithms for data processing across
    multiple scales. 2.1. The development of Lidar-based phenotyping facilities Lidar-based
    phenotyping facilities were developed later than image-based phenotyping facilities.
    Image-based plant phenotyping facilities are currently the most mature and widely
    used systems, such as the TraitMill (Reuzeau et al., 2010), Phenoscope (Tisne
    et al., 2013), and Phenovator (Flood et al., 2016) systems. These facilities are
    equipped with different optical image sensors that have promoted the rapid development
    of high-throughput phenotyping (Jin et al., 2020d, Luis Araus et al., 2018), especially
    in indoor environments. The advances of image-based plant phenotyping facilities
    also laid the foundation for developing lidar-based phenotyping facilities. 2.1.1.
    The history of Lidar sensors As an active remote sensing technology, lidar was
    initially designed to record only one return pulse. These data were used in aerospace,
    military, and topographic survey in the early 1960s (Hickman and Hogg, 1969, Hoge
    et al., 1980, Krabill et al., 1984). Single-return lidar cannot penetrate vegetation
    during terrain surveying, making vegetation a major source of noise (Nelson, 2013).
    During the filtering of vegetation for surveying, plant community scientists were
    interested in retrieving vegetation information, which laid the foundation for
    the use of lidar in plant phenotyping. Because single-return lidar had only a
    weak ability to characterize the sub-canopy structure of tall vegetation, a multi-return
    lidar sensor was designed to penetrate canopy and record its 3D structure using
    discrete points, also called a point cloud. This 3D point cloud was successfully
    used to estimate forest vertical structures (e.g., tree height) (Nelson et al.,
    1984). To further increase the penetration ability in dense and tall vegetation,
    consecutive waveform (also known as full-waveform) lidar was developed, and it
    records several hundred samples of backscattered signals for each laser pulse
    emitted (Mallet and Bretar, 2009). These advances, especially pulse/point density,
    have given Lidar unparalleled advantages in phenotyping plants in the 3D space.
    However, there is no explicit and systematic summary about how pulse/point density,
    a widely used indicator for laser spatial/angular resolution, affect plant trait
    extraction (Lin, 2015). This review summarized different lidar point densities
    used to most phenotypic traits/tasks, together with a comparative list of technological
    readiness level (TRL) among different fields (i.e., forestry, horticulture, agriculture,
    and grass) by referring to (Jin et al., 2020d, Luis Araus et al., 2018) (Table
    1). Note this relationship is more complicated in practice because point density
    is affected by much more complex factors, such as the plant attributes (e.g.,
    plant type, size, and density), platform types (e.g., ground, plane, and satellite),
    and sensor/working settings (e.g., scanning angle). Table 1. Summary of different
    lidar point densities used to most phenotypic traits/tasks, together with a comparative
    list of technological readiness level (TRL) among different fields (i.e., forestry,
    horticulture, agriculture, and grass) by referring to (Jin et al., 2020d, Luis
    Araus et al., 2018). (Arumäe and Lang, 2018, Bouvier et al., 2019, Boyd et al.,
    2013, Brede et al., 2019, Chen and Hay, 2011, Dalponte et al., 2012, Duncanson
    et al., 2015, Estornell et al., 2014, Fagua et al., 2019, Heiskanen et al., 2015,

    2020a, Khosravipour et al., 2014, Korhonen et al., 2011, Lei et al., 2019, Li
    et al., 2017b, Lim et al., 2003a, Lu et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2017, Mongus and
    Zalik, 2015, Nie et al., 2015, Panjvani et al., 2019, Salas et al., 2010, Seidel
    et al., 2015, Strîmbu and Strîmbu, 2015, ten Harkel et al., 2020, Valbuena Rabadan
    et al., 2016, Velumani et al., 2017, Vepakomma et al., 2008, Vepakomma et al.,
    2011, Wallace, 2013, Wallace et al., 2014a, Wallace et al., 2014b, Wang et al.,
    2019c, Wu et al., 2019, Xu et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2011).
    In addition to increasing lidar sensors’ return pulse resolution from single-return
    to waveform and increasing spatial resolution indicated by point density, recent
    efforts have been actively devoted to increasing their spectral resolution. The
    earliest lidar was designed to emit pulses at a monochromatic wavelength, which
    is currently the most mature and commonly used system. Intensity information recorded
    by the monochromatic wavelength lidar has shown the potential to separate different
    plant components, quantify plant biochemical information, and indicate growth
    and stress status (Magney et al., 2014). To improve our ability to capture more
    detailed spectral information, dual-channel lidar (Dabney et al., 2010), multispectral
    lidar (Buller et al., 2005, Wallace et al., 2013, Wei et al., 2012), and hyperspectral
    lidar (Wang et al., 2016) are increasingly being explored. These lidar systems
    can capture more spectral information along with structural information, which
    can then be used to detect the photosynthetic light use efficiency and physiological
    status of a plant in 3D space (Bi et al., 2020, Wallace et al., 2013). For example,
    these lidar systems can be used to distinguish small variations in leaf reflectance
    caused by leaf biochemical concentration, even when canopy structure is similar
    (Wei et al., 2012). However, dual-channel and multispectral lidar for plant phenotyping
    are not fully developed, and hyperspectral lidar is still being prototyped. Fusing
    the structure data from lidar and spectral data from spectral imager is still
    an alternative way to characterize finer plant bio-physical/chemical traits (Shen
    et al., 2020), but it is still challenging when fusing data from the active lidar
    and passive optical systems. 2.1.2. The development of Lidar-based platforms In
    addition to improved sensor development, lidar platforms have been rapidly developed
    to achieve high-throughput plant phenotyping. High-throughput (HTP) phenotyping
    platforms are the foundation of nondestructive phenotyping for screening plant
    varieties in multi-location trials (Montes et al., 2007, Zhao et al., 2019). Depending
    on the range of the lidar sensors, lidar platforms can be divided into proximal
    sensing and remote sensing (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (225KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. A summary of lidar facilities for
    plant phenotyping. The spatial resolution and spatial extent of proximal sensing
    (e.g., tripod, vehicle, gantry, handheld, backpack) and remote sensing (e.g.,
    unmanned aerial vehicle, airborne, and satellite) platforms are outlined. Sensors
    develop from single echo to waveform lidar and from single-band to hyperspectral
    lidar. Proximal sensing platforms can be further divided into indoor platforms
    and outdoor platforms, including gantry, vehicle, tripod, backpack, and handheld
    (Fig. 1). Most indoor lidar platforms are built on a gantry and work in “sensor-to-plant”
    mode because it is less affected by the environment in which measurements are
    made. “Sensor-to-plant” lidar platforms such as the Field Scanalyzer (Virlet et
    al., 2017) and Crop3D system (Guo et al., 2018a) can reduce the disturbance caused
    by plant transportation (Bai et al., 2019, Roitsch et al., 2019). These lidar
    platforms differ from most image-based systems (e.g., Phenoscope) that work in
    a “plant-to-sensor” mode. With the maturity of indoor systems, proximal sensing
    platforms are being gradually applied to outdoor environments to meet the requirement
    of field phenotyping. In outdoor environments, the most widely used proximal lidar
    system is terrestrial lidar, which is usually mounted on a tripod (Fig. 1). Terrestrial
    lidar is flexible since it can be manually carried from one position to another,
    but it is laborious and requires substantial registration efforts to acquire data
    over large areas with multi-station scanning. At the same time, the conical view
    angle and limited mounting height of terrestrial lidar make it more suitable for
    vertically developed objects (e.g., buildings) than for densely populated vegetated
    areas (e.g., crops) (Bareth et al., 2016), which are better observed from near
    nadir directions (Madec et al., 2017). Mobile lidar systems have been developed
    for a variety of environments with the advancements in mobile measurement technologies
    (Yuan et al., 2019), which have lifted observation angles and reduced labor costs
    along with high-throughput capability of outdoor lidar systems (Sun et al., 2018).
    Unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platforms are used primarily in simple working environments
    (Underwood et al., 2016), such as orchards, but have been also developed for phenotyping
    large collections of genotypes (Liu et al., 2017b). By contrast, manned ground
    vehicle systems, such as mounting on a sprayer (Llorens et al., 2011), are more
    flexible and have wider applications (Bai et al., 2016, Jimenez-Berni et al.,
    2018). In a more complicated environment (e.g., forest), handheld mobile lidar
    (Ma et al., 2019, Westling et al., 2018) and backpack mobile lidar platforms (Su
    et al., 2020a) that are integrated with simultaneous localization and mapping
    algorithms can acquire data efficiently and flexibly. In addition, to facilitate
    high-frequency temporal monitoring, gantry platforms moving along railway tracks
    have been developed (e.g., FieldScan, Field Scanalyzer, Crop 3D, and PhenoField)
    (Beauchêne et al., 2019, Guo et al., 2018b, Kirchgessner et al., 2017, Vadez et
    al., 2015, Virlet et al., 2017). At a remote distance, the primary platforms are
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), planes, and satellites. UAVs provide a low-cost
    and efficient way to link phenotyping from a plot to the landscape scale (Guo
    et al., 2017a, Zhou et al., 2020a). Due to the limitation of power supply time
    and payload capacity, airborne lidar is preferred for landscape to regional scale
    phenotyping (Li et al., 2015a, Li et al., 2015b). At regional and global scales,
    satellite-based lidar systems can record transects of data with large footprints.
    Examples of these systems include the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System onboard
    the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat/GLAS) (Tang et al., 2014),
    ICESat-2 (Smith et al., 2019), and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (Qi
    et al., 2019) systems. However, due to their coarse spatial resolution, satellite
    lidar systems are mainly used for mapping the distribution of forest phenotypes,
    which is rarely explored in genetics trials and plant breeding. 2.2. The development
    of lidar-based data processing algorithms for phenotyping With the development
    of multi-scale phenotyping platforms, waveform and discrete lidar data can be
    collected in a high-throughput way. Increasing data collection has created new
    requirements for algorithms to bridge the distance from data to knowledge. Discrete
    lidar data is still the most widely used data type. Waveform lidar data are usually
    decomposed into discrete points in vegetation applications (Wagner et al., 2006),
    although they can be used to extract phenotypes through data preprocessing (e.g.,
    de-noising, smoothing, and radiometric calibration), decomposition, deconvolution,
    and waveform variable extraction (Zhou and Popescu, 2019) (Fig. 2). In addition,
    lidar data acquired at large scale are often clipped into smaller tiles for processing.
    Therefore, data processing algorithms of discrete lidar data from field/plot level
    to individual (organ) levels are reviewed (Jin et al., 2018b, Jin et al., 2019,
    Jin et al., 2018c, Li et al., 2020, Mendez et al., 2013, Saarinen et al., 2017,
    Vicari et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2017, Xu et al., 2020). Download

    A survey of algorithms for lidar data phenotyping. Waveform lidar data are usually
    decomposed into discrete lidar data, and processed with a series of algorithms
    (e.g., registration, noise removal, sampling, filtering, and normalization) to
    extract phenotypes at field/plot, individual, and more precise levels. At the
    field/plot level, algorithms for processing discrete lidar data mainly include
    preprocessing and phenotype extraction. Preprocessing algorithms are used to improve
    data quality, including registration, noise removal, filtering, sampling, and
    normalization (Fig. 2). The registration is designed to align points collected
    by multi-platforms (Dai et al., 2019, Guan et al., 2019, Polewski et al., 2019)
    or a single platform along different flight strips or in different scanning locations
    (Cai et al., 2019, Cheng et al., 2018, Dong et al., 2020) to provide full coverage
    for study areas. Manual registration is implemented with the position and orientation
    information recorded by a global positioning system and inertial measurement unit,
    which is labor-intensive and inefficient. Automatic registration is more efficient
    and usually detects conjugate features (e.g., point, line, and surface) in advance,
    by adopting a coarse-to-fine registration strategy (Guan et al., 2020). In vegetated
    environments, conjugate features refer mainly to key points instead of line or
    surface because plants’ shapes are irregular. Point features for coarse registration
    are usually detected using methods such as Harris (Harris and Stephens, 1988),
    normal aligned radial feature (Steder et al., 2010), scale-invariant feature transform
    (Lowe, 1999). Recently, numerous efforts have been devoted to doing coarse registration
    with individual tree attributes (e.g., tree location) as features (Guan et al.,
    2019, Kelbe et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2017a, Tremblay and Béland, 2018). These
    coarse registration results are further used in fine registration methods such
    as iterative closest point (Arun et al., 1987, Cheng et al., 2018, Zhang, 1994).
    Registered points may contain some isolated points that should be removed using
    outlier removal methods, such as statistical outlier removal (Balta et al., 2018),
    radius outlier removal (Charron et al., 2018), and bilateral filtering (Moorfield
    et al., 2015). Due to overlapping and scanning angle effect, lidar point density
    may be unevenly distributed. Sampling methods are optionally selected to achieve
    even data distribution, such as random sampling, voxel grid sampling, farthest
    point sampling, and normal space sampling (Kwok, 2018). To remove terrain effect,
    filtering algorithms classify raw points into either vegetation or ground points.
    Current filtering methods are mainly used for airborne lidar data with small point
    density and thin ground points (Zhao et al., 2016), such as slope-based (Meng
    et al., 2009, Sithole and Vosselman, 2001, Susaki, 2012, Vosselman, 2000), morphology-based
    (Chen et al., 2007, Hui et al., 2016, Li et al., 2014b, Pingel et al., 2013, Zhang
    et al., 2003), interpolation-based (Chen et al., 2017, Kraus and Pfeifer, 1998,
    Mongus and Žalik, 2012, Shi et al., 2018, Zhao et al., 2016), and segmentation-based
    methods (Lin and Zhang, 2014, Sithole and Vosselman, 2005). For proximal lidar
    data with thick ground points, filtering is conducted by removing points with
    a threshold height above local minimum points. Specifically, a moving window is
    first used to find local minima in height. These local minimum points are used
    to generate a digital terrain model (DTM) using interpolation methods (e.g., kriging
    and inverse distance weight methods) (Guo et al., 2010). Points above the DTM
    within a customized height threshold are classified as ground points, while the
    remaining points are classified as vegetation points. The first return points
    are used to generate a digital surface model (DSM). The canopy height model (CHM)
    can be derived by subtracting the DTM from DSM (Jin et al., 2018a). The data normalization
    can be completed by either a DTM-based or a point cloud-based method. The DTM-based
    method subtracts the height of each point from the height of the DTM below that
    point. The point-based method subtracts the height of each point from the height
    of its nearest horizontal ground point. These normalized points can be used to
    extract phenotypes comparable at plot/field level, such as canopy cover and leaf
    area index (LAI) (Morsdorf et al., 2006). To acquire phenotypes at fine levels,
    the individual plant segmentation algorithm is the primary method and has achieved
    quick developments in large plants. Classical individual segmentation methods
    can be grouped into CHM-based methods and point-based methods (Jakubowski et al.,
    2013b, Yang et al., 2019). CHM-based methods, such as moving window maximum (Hyyppa
    et al., 2001), watershed (Duncanson et al., 2014, Khosravipour et al., 2014),
    and multi-scale segmentation methods (Jing et al., 2012), segment individual trees
    to get the canopy contour and treetop. The CHM-based methods have high efficiency
    but may have spatial errors caused by CHM generation (Guo et al., 2010), and they
    show weakness in overlapping and homogenous multilayered canopies (Koch et al.,
    2006). By contrast, point-based segmentation methods directly segment individual
    plants from points to get tree location and points of each tree, and are superior
    for segmenting overlapping canopy due to lidar’s penetration ability. Point-based
    segmentation methods include voxel space projection (Wang et al., 2008), adaptive
    multiscale filter (Lee et al., 2010), normalized cut (Yao et al., 2012), and regional
    growth methods (Li et al., 2012, Lu et al., 2014, Tao et al., 2015b). At the individual
    plant level, many algorithms have been proposed to extract phenotypes, including
    percentile ranking (Luo et al., 2018), voxelization, and skeleton-based methods.
    These algorithms have been applied successfully to extract phenotypes, such as
    plant height, crown size, and leaf area index. To characterize phenotypes at finer
    organ levels, stem (branch)-leaf segmentation (Ferrara et al., 2018, Jin et al.,
    2018c, Moorthy et al., 2019, Tao et al., 2015a, Vicari et al., 2019, Wang et al.,
    2020, Wu et al., 2020a), and other organ detection methods (Sun et al., 2020)
    have been investigated. These algorithms enable phenotype extraction at the organ
    level (e.g., flower number) (Sun et al., 2020), providing precise plant phenotyping
    (Elnashef et al., 2019, Jin et al., 2018c). Another algorithm development of increasing
    interest in response to the growing data volumes and demand for algorithm accuracy
    is from geometric methods to deep learning methods. Geometry-based methods typically
    require user-defined (manual) feature descriptions, which are difficult to define
    in the context of big data. This extraction of features from big data is precisely
    the advantage that deep learning provides (Guo et al., 2020, LeCun et al., 2015).
    For example, deep learning methods have been proposed for use with point registration
    (Elbaz et al., 2017), subsampling (Dovrat et al., 2019), completion (Huang et
    al., 2020), filtering (Jin et al., 2020c), normal estimation (Ben-Shabat et al.,
    2019, Eigen and Fergus, 2015), individual classification and segmentation (Guan
    et al., 2015, Hamraz et al., 2019, Jin et al., 2018b, Wang, 2020), and organ segmentation
    (Jin et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2020a). Guan et al., 2015, Hamraz et al., 2019 explored
    deep learning-based methods for tree classification using mobile and airborne
    lidar data, respectively; Wu et al. (2020a) developed an improved convolution
    neural network for classifying woody and foliage components using terrestrial
    lidar points. However, current applications of deep learning tools for plant phenotyping
    with 3D points are in early stages. These cutting-edge deep learning and lidar
    techniques will be very attractive to the plant community to boost phenotyping
    applications. 3. Lidar sheds new light on agriculture phenotyping 3.1. Lidar provides
    a powerful tool for characterizing 3D agriculture phenotypes The rapid development
    in lidar facilities and algorithms have provided more diverse forms and more convenient
    access to 3D data and trait information across multi-spatial and temporal scales
    (Guo et al., 2018b). Through data to knowledge transformation (e.g., association
    analysis with gene and environment), lidar provides great opportunities for multi-spatial
    and temporal agriculture phenotyping (Paulus et al., 2014b, Roitsch et al., 2019).
    Multi-spatial level phenotyping in agriculture has experienced a history of development
    from the canopy level to the organ level (Jin et al., 2020b) (Fig. 3a). Canopy
    level agricultural phenotyping characterizes information about the whole population
    at the canopy level with less consideration for individual differences; this method
    is commonly used in crops with dense canopies (Jimenez-Berni et al., 2018). Phenotypes
    at canopy level have been accurately extracted, including canopy cover (R2 = 0.92,
    Jimenez-Berni et al., 2018), height quantiles (R2 = 0.90, Madec et al., 2017),
    and plant volume (R2 = 0.98, Jin et al., 2020b, Sun et al., 2018). However, canopy
    level phenotyping is unable to meet the growing demand for phenotype acquisition
    and application at fine levels. Recently, computer vision methods, especially
    deep learning, have been devoted to detecting individual crop plants and separate
    different plant organs (Weiss and Biber, 2011). For example, Malambo et al. (2019)
    developed a density-based clustering method to detect individual sorghum panicles
    from terrestrial lidar data; the results can support sorghum breeding initiatives.
    Jin et al., 2018b, Jin et al., 2019) successfully demonstrated an individual maize
    segmentation algorithm and a stem-leaf separation algorithm using terrestrial
    lidar and deep learning. Based on the individual plant and organs detected, structural
    phenotypes can be further derived, such as individual plant height (R2 > 0.970),
    leaf area (R2 = 0.962), leaf inclination (R2 = 0.95), and stem diameter (R2 =
    0.64) (Jin et al., 2018c, Paulus et al., 2014b). Download : Download high-res

    in agricultural phenotyping: (a) Multi-spatial level agriculture phenotyping from
    group level to organ level; (b) Multi-temporal phenotyping including growth-period
    and diurnal changes; (c) Agriculture modeling, including statistical model, crop
    growth model, and functional structural plant model; (d) Phenotyping for agriculture
    breeding; and (e) Phenotyping for agriculture management. Although multi-spatial
    scale phenotyping is helpful for understanding crop growth status (Paulus et al.,
    2014b), multi-temporal lidar data are needed for monitoring crop growth dynamics
    (Fig. 3b) and dating specific development stages. Sun et al. (2018) found that
    maximum canopy height, projected canopy area, and plant volume at 67–109 days
    after sowing were highly correlated with final yield, which gives insight into
    monitoring and predicting crop yield during a critical time window. Similarly,
    Su et al. (2019) explored the dynamic change mechanisms of multiple maize varieties
    under drought stress using multi-temporal terrestrial lidar data, discovering
    that highly drought-tolerant varieties tend to maintain lower plant height and
    plant area index without reducing projected leaf area at the tasseling stage.
    These findings demonstrate that lidar can provide precise key phenotypes at critical
    growing stages to achieve variety discrimination and growth analysis. Further,
    Madec et al. (2017) demonstrated that the flowering stage was closely related
    to the time when the maximum height is reached for wheat crops, indicating that
    lidar could be used for phenological traits. 3.2. Lidar paves a new way for agriculture
    crop modeling A crop model describes the main growth and development processes
    as a function of weather conditions, soil conditions, and crop management. Crop
    models simulate the dynamics of the main canopy state variables including biomass,
    plant area index, as well as the radiation, water, carbon and nitrogen exchanges
    with the environment (Huang et al., 2019). Crop models have several obvious advantages:
    1) providing a low-cost, repeatable, and efficient means for conducting virtual
    phenotypic experiments, 2) predicting the spatial–temporal response of plant structure
    and function to modify genotypes and management practices under future environmental
    conditions, and 3) informing the agricultural community in the design, selection,
    and cultivation of an ideotype through breeding and management (Chenu et al.,
    2017). Crop models mainly include crop growth models and functional structural
    plant models (Fig. 3c). In crop growth models, phenotypes are important driving
    factors that are combined with genotypes, environmental observations (i.e., meteorology
    and soil), and management practices (He et al., 2017). Numerous models have been
    developed during the last several decades (Huang et al., 2019), such as WOFOST
    (Van Diepen et al., 1989), APSIM (Keating et al., 2003), and AquaCrop (Steduto
    et al., 2009). These process-based growth models are very mechanical and are applied
    mostly at large scales (e.g., regional) for monitoring dry mass production, metabolism,
    and crop growth (Jin et al., 2018d) by assimilating earth observation data. However,
    crop growth models have just a rough description of canopy architecture. They
    can exploit only a limited number of traits that can be derived from lidar data.
    Conversely, functional structural plant models (FSPMs) that incorporate a detailed
    3D description of the canopy can exploit much more information from the lidar
    data (Vos et al., 2010). FSPMs include L-Studio (Prusinkiewicz et al., 1999),
    GREENLAB (Hu et al., 2003), and OpenAlea (Pradal et al., 2008), etc. The 3D phenotypes
    under given meteorological conditions and crop management are used to generate
    3D virtual canopies, which can be further divided into static and dynamic models
    (Vos et al., 2010). These FSPMs can simulate a number of remote sensing observations
    (e.g., RGB image, spectral, lidar) and phenotyping observations (e.g., light distribution
    and gas exchange) (Dauzat et al., 2001, Liu et al., 2019a). In practice, due to
    the complexity of the canopy structure (crown shape, leaf shape, area, inclination
    and curvature, etc.), differences between varieties, and dynamic changes in the
    development process, describing canopy structure in FSPMs is extremely complicated.
    Lidar-based phenotyping can provide the detailed 3D structure information necessary
    to improve the efficiency of building new FSPMs and improve the modeling ability
    of existing FSPMs. Overall, crop models provide alternative ways to understand
    the dynamic change of both structure and functional phenotypes under given complex
    environments at different spatial–temporal scales. With the development of 3D
    phenotyping, lidar-based phenotypes will challenge the current crop models and
    improve their accuracy, robustness, and interpretability (Muller and Martre, 2019).
    3.3. Lidar plays an important role in agriculture breeding and management Phenotypes
    extracted by lidar are useful to indicate the growth status of crops and used
    to guide breeding and assist management (Fig. 3d-e). For example, Walter et al.
    (2019) calculated projected volume and canopy height of wheat using data collected
    by a tractor-mounted lidar system. They found that the heritability of lidar-derived
    projected volume and canopy height is comparable to and even better than the heritability
    of field-measurements, confirming the high repeatability and heritability of lidar-derived
    canopy level phenotypes for breeding (Furbank et al., 2019). In addition to breeding,
    lidar-based canopy level phenotyping provides efficient solutions for field management
    with less computation complexity and lower cost. For example, Saeys et al. (2009)
    developed a crop density and volume calculation method using harvester-mounted
    lidar data, which aims to automatically adjust the driving speed of harvester
    based on estimated incoming biomass. This study demonstrates the feasibility and
    potential of lidar-derived phenotypes in agricultural management. Moreover, the
    phenotyping of precise phenotype dynamics, such as leaf rolling and leaf wilting,
    is known to be able to identify biotic stress early and inform management methods
    (Baret et al., 2018, Kadioglu et al., 2012). Phenotypes simulated using crop models
    also have important implications for breeding and management. Liu et al. (2019a)
    proposed a digital plant phenotyping platform (D3P) that can be used to create
    a virtual wheat canopy and its dynamics given specified crop parameters, environmental
    conditions, and management practices. This kind of FSPM can be used to define
    the optimal observational configuration to simulate lidar data, image data, spectral
    data, and extract traits from measurements. These simulations provide a powerful
    tool for identifying structural and functional phenotypes to find optimal traits
    related to yield that are more closely dependent on genotype but are less influenced
    by environment (Skelton, 2019). In addition to finding high plastic phenotypes,
    plant modeling can also dissect the effects of biotic and abiotic stress, and
    separate the contributions of genotype, environment, and management to these effects
    (Chenu et al., 2017, Tardieu and Tuberosa, 2010, Zhao et al., 2019). In summary,
    lidar has promoted crop phenotyping by assessing additional traits derived from
    its 3D description of canopy, plant, and organ structure. Lidar has been widely
    used in multi-spatial and temporal phenotyping, including target detection, phenotype
    extraction, crop growth monitoring and modeling, ultimately supporting improved
    breeding and management. Nevertheless, using lidar in agricultural phenotyping
    faces substantial challenges. Lidar-based agricultural phenotyping platforms are
    expensive. Most applications use proximal lidar systems (e.g., terrestrial, vehicle,
    and gantry), while remote lidar systems (e.g., UAV and airborne) have rarely been
    considered since crops have low heights and a dense canopy. Meanwhile, fusing
    lidar with multisource remote sensing data and developing data-driven methods
    should provide valuable information in linking plant structural and functional
    phenotypes with genotype, environmental conditions, and management scenarios.
    4. Beyond agriculture phenotyping Lidar has been extensively explored and successfully
    applied to 3D agricultural phenotypes, while it also sheds new light in other
    research areas, including those in forestry, horticulture, and grass. Lidar has
    shown potential in improving breeding and management by phenotyping in these areas.
    4.1. Lidar sheds new light on forest phenotyping Accurate and quantitative forest
    phenotyping is crucial for tree breeding and forest management in selecting genetic
    material (e.g., tree volume) and managing forested environments (Furbank and Tester,
    2011a, Pretzsch, 2019). Unlike the application of high-throughput phenotyping
    to agricultural sciences, forest phenotyping at the same precision is extremely
    challenging because trees are long-lived with a large volume and variable shape
    (Araus and Cairns, 2014, Dungey et al., 2018, Furbank and Tester, 2011a). However,
    lidar provides efficient phenotype information for understanding forest states
    (e.g., canopy cover) and dynamics at stand and larger levels. Therefore, forest
    phenotyping centers around helping forest management with increasing interests
    in breeding. The advent of different lidar platforms for forest research has provided
    a new means for estimating numerous phenotypes and providing high-spatial-resolution
    site descriptions at multiple scales (Disney, 2019, Pearse et al., 2017, Van Leeuwen
    and Nieuwenhuis, 2010, Watt et al., 2019) (Fig. 4a). Spaceborne and airborne lidar
    provide unprecedented opportunities for mapping phenotypes at global, regional,
    and landscape scales, including the mapping of forest canopy height (Clark et
    al., 2004, Lefsky, 2010, Simard et al., 2011), leaf area index (LAI) (Tang et
    al., 2014, Tian et al., 2016), and biomass (Hu et al., 2016, Su et al., 2016,
    Tao et al., 2014). When large-scale phenotypes are associated with climate conditions,
    universal phenotype distribution patterns can be found for improved understanding
    and management of forest ecosystems (Tao et al., 2016). To increase management
    precision and maintain high efficiency at forest stand scale, airborne and UAV
    lidar systems are adept in extracting phenotypes at both canopy and individual
    levels. Several forest phenotypic traits have been retrieved, including tree height
    (coralation coefficient, R = 0.95, Huang et al., 2011), diameter at breast height
    (−1.6 cm < bias < 0.5 cm, Brolly and Kiraly, 2009), crown height (0.79 m < root
    mean suqare error < 1.65 m, Maltamo et al., 2009), crown base height (0.51 < R2
    < 0.72, Kato et al., 2009), basal area (R2 > 0.94, Means et al., 2000), stem density
    (55% < relative RMES < 90%, Latifi et al., 2012), stem volume (0.92 < R2 < 0.98,
    Hyyppä et al., 2020b), and aboveground biomass (0.74 < R2 < 0.79, Cao et al.,
    2016). However, the airborne and UAV lidar systems’ capability for acquiring information
    about understory vegetation is limited by its downward-looking scanning mode,
    and the precision of its point cloud (centimeter magnitude) (Paris et al., 2016).
    Therefore, mobile lidar systems (e.g., backpack lidar) and fixed lidar systems
    (e.g., terrestrial lidar) have been widely applied to retrieve more detailed phenotypic
    traits with the advance of branch-leaf separation algorithms (Moorthy et al.,
    2019, Vicari et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020), including leaf area density (Béland
    et al., 2014), leaf inclination and azimuthal angle (Li et al., 2018b), and branch
    architecture phenotypes (e.g. branch angle, diameter, length and volume) (Li et
    al., 2020, Su et al., 2020b). Mobile and fixed lidar systems can provide 3D information
    related to forest structure at a millimeter resolution, but its scanning mode
    may miss upper canopy information (Hilker et al., 2012). Increasingly, forest
    phenotyping studies are focusing on combining multi-platform lidar data (Dai et
    al., 2019, Dong et al., 2020, Guan et al., 2019, Polewski et al., 2019). Meanwhile,
    lidar has been widely used in the retrival of digital terrain models (DTM) (Fig.
    4b). Many environmental variables that influence phenotypic expression, such as
    slope, aspect, and stream boundaries, can be generated from lidar-derived DTM
    at high resolution (Schmidt et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019). Download : Download

    of lidar in forest phenotyping through structure phenotype extraction and model
    reconstruction, which is associatively analyzed with (b) forest environment conditions,
    genetic resources, and management practices. The modeling of virtual forests has
    become an intuitive and effective approach to better understand the mechanism
    of interaction between forest phenotype traits and environmental variables (e.g.
    nutrients, light, and water) (Calders et al., 2018, Cote et al., 2012). The 3D
    reconstruction of a tree is the basis, and the premise of a virtual forest can
    be seen as a collection of individual trees (Fig. 4a). However, traditional simple
    geometric models often neglect the vertical information and internal structure
    of vegetation or use simple geometric models to represent them (Chen et al., 2000,
    Widlowski et al., 2015). Lidar, especially terrestrial lidar, provides detailed
    3D information about forest architecture for tree reconstruction (Cote et al.,
    2011, Cote et al., 2009). Several studies have focused on 3D tree reconstruction
    using terrestrial lidar data. The process of reconstruction was generally divided
    into three main steps: (1) wood-leaf separation; (2) branching structure reconstruction;
    and (3) leaf addition (Akerblom et al., 2018, Calders et al., 2018). Existing
    wood-leaf separation algorithms mainly tend to fall into two categories: those
    based on geometric information and those based on laser echo characteristics (Cote
    et al., 2011, Cote et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2013b, Yao et al., 2011). The extraction
    of branch skeleton lines is a crucial prerequisite to branching structure reconstruction,
    and many skeletonization algorithms have been developed, including volumetric
    methods (Pfeifer et al., 2004), octree structure methods (Bucksch and Lindenbergh,
    2008), Voronoi diagrams methods (Dey and Sun, 2006), and Laplacian-based methods
    (Cao et al., 2010). Leaf addition is an important step for tree reconstruction,
    but the accurate addition of foliage remains challenging due to self-occlusion
    effects in terrestrial lidar data. Based on the realization of virtual forests,
    researchers are exploring the possibility of using 3D tree model information for
    issues such as monitoring tree growth dynamics (Zhao et al., 2018), quantifying
    disturbance factors (e.g. fire and wind) in forests (Toby et al., 2019), and modeling
    radiative transfer (Calders et al., 2018, Li et al., 2018a). In addition, lidar-derived
    plant phenotyping is widely used in large scale vegetation modeling, such as biodiversity
    and vegetation dynamic modeling (LaRue et al., 2020, Su et al., 2020b, Tao et
    al., 2016, Xue et al., 2017). In addition to using phenotyping and modeling for
    management, recent efforts have been devoted to linking lidar-derived tree phenotypes
    with genetic parameters (Dungey et al., 2018) (Fig. 4b). However, due to the long
    cycle of forest breeding, lidar-based modeling has been rarely investigated. A
    primary practice is estimating heritability and genetic gain for easily accessible
    phenotypes, such as height percentiles and canopy metrics (Bombrun et al., 2020).
    Complex phenotypes (e.g., tree volume and crown architecture) need to be explored.
    These phenotypes are critical for improved breeding by selecting the best progeny
    in provenance trials (Fig. 4b). It is important to note that lidar-derived phenotype
    heritability is influenced by both environmental factors and internal physiological
    properties. The integration of lidar with multi-source remote sensing technologies,
    global positioning system (GPS), and geographic information systems (GIS) should
    be further explored to phenotype forests for tracking their genetic performance
    (Dungey et al., 2018). In summary, forest phenotyping based on lidar data provides
    a versatile tool for forest management and breeding. Lidar techniques have led
    to new advances for in situ measurement of forest phenotypes. However, the capability
    of lidar for long-term monitoring in forest has not been fully explored. Integrating
    lidar platforms in existing ecosystem research networks can contribute to forest
    management by allowing researchers to study the relationship between forest structure
    biodiversity, functional diversity, and species diversity (Bohn and Huth, 2017,
    LaRue et al., 2020). Studying the transferability of lidar phenotypes across spatial
    scales and geolocations is needed to find universal patterns of phenotypes and
    to increase phenotype prediction ability (Jin et al., 2018a). Therefore, combining
    lidar data at a range of spatial and temporal scales with other remotely sensed
    data has considerable potential to provide more detailed and accurate phenotyping
    of trees. 4.2. Lidar sheds new light on horticulture phenotyping The major research
    areas of horticulture include breeding, cultivation, and management of fruits,
    vegetables, and flowers (Shry and Reiley, 2016). Horticultural phenotyping emphasizes
    the quantification of structure as well as functional phenotypes. Airborne (Shafri
    et al., 2012), UAV(Hadas et al., 2019), mobile (Colaço et al., 2017a), terrestrial
    (Guo et al., 2019), and handheld (Das et al., 2015, Jiang et al., 2019) lidar
    systems have been actively explored for high-throughput structural and functional
    analysis by providing actual 3D plant phenotypes with the aid of plant modeling.
    These lidar systems provide multi-source, multi-spatial, and multi-temporal lidar
    data (Coupel-Ledru et al., 2019, Herrero-Huerta et al., 2018, Underwood et al.,
    2016, Wu et al., 2020b), contributing to phenotyping studies in various horticultural
    plants (Tripodi et al., 2018), such as tomatoes (Hosoi et al., 2011, Llop Casamada
    et al., 2016), vineyards (Arnó et al., 2012), apples (Bargoti et al., 2015), avocados
    (Westling et al., 2018), orange (Colaço et al., 2017a, Colaço et al., 2017b),
    and olives (Llorens et al., 2016). Current progress in using lidar for horticultural
    structural phenotyping ranges from canopy to organ levels (Bargoti et al., 2015,
    Colaço et al., 2017a, Gené-Mola et al., 2019a, Hosoi et al., 2011, Underwood et
    al., 2016, Westling et al., 2018), and can be grouped into two types: geometric
    characterization (Chakraborty et al., 2019, Gené-Mola et al., 2019a, Guevara et
    al., 2020, Moorthy et al., 2011, Rosell et al., 2009, Sanz et al., 2018, Sanz
    et al., 2011) and organ detection (Bargoti et al., 2015, Gené-Mola et al., 2020,
    Gené-Mola et al., 2019b, Gené-Mola et al., 2019c, Hosoi et al., 2011) (Fig. 5).
    Geometric characterization (e.g., crown structures) under different growing stages,
    changing environments, and dynamic management practices are essential for finding
    optimal phenotypes controlled by potentially functional genotypes (DeJong, 2019,
    Mu et al., 2018). Meanwhile, geometric characteristics are highly correlated to
    the plant canopy microclimate, leading to better horticultural management (e.g.,
    weed suppression and disease incidence) (Yuan et al., 2019). Organ detection is
    the bridge from general structure characterization to precise horticulture. Numerous
    organs have been detected with lidar, including trunks (Bargoti et al., 2015)
    and fruits (Gené-Mola et al., 2019a, Gené-Mola et al., 2019b). A number of additional
    phenotypes have been further quantified (Sanz et al., 2018), including canopy
    height (R2 = 0.915, Yuan et al., 2019), wood volume (R2 = 0.73, Siebers et al.,
    2018), and fruit number (detection rate > 80%, Gené-Mola et al., 2019a) (Fig.
    5). These highly accurate and high-throughput phenotypes derived from lidar have
    been used for optimizing canopy management (e.g., spraying and pruning), achieving
    sustainable crop protection in fruit orchards, and improving the precision of
    horticultural processes (Gil et al., 2013, Llorens et al., 2011). Download : Download

    of lidar in horticultural phenotyping. The multiple hardware platforms collect
    data at multi-spatial and temporal scales and are integrated with multi-source
    data. These data are processed by object extraction and geometric characterization
    algorithms that extract 1D, 2D, and 3D phenotypes for horticultural breeding and
    management (e.g., spraying, pruning, and planting layout). Besides quantifying
    structure, lidar enables the functional study of horticulture in terms of light
    monitoring and yield prediction to support management goals (Gené-Mola et al.,
    2019a, Westling et al., 2018) (Fig. 5). Available total light and its distribution
    within the plant canopy can be well-quantified using simulation models with lidar-derived
    geometry (Westling et al., 2018), which provides critical management information
    for pruning to improve the quantity and quality (e.g., oil concentration) of horticultural
    plants (Connor et al., 2016, McFadyen et al., 2004, Westling et al., 2018). Yield
    prediction is achieved mainly through mapping canopy volume (Underwood et al.,
    2016) or counting fruits (Gené-Mola et al., 2019a, Stein et al., 2016). To better
    understand the complex relationships and dynamics of structure and functional
    phenotypes, computer simulation models are being developed (DeJong, 2019). Currently,
    horticultural modeling using lidar has not been widely explored (Colaco et al.,
    2018). Most applications center around using lidar-derived phenotypes for plant
    monitoring and management. For example, Pascual et al., 2009, Rinaldi et al.,
    2013 used lidar sensors to evaluate peach tree and grapevine growth at multiple
    phenological stages. In addition to growth monitoring, lidar plays a critical
    role in modeling canopy light distribution and guiding management practices (Westling
    et al., 2018). For example, Westling et al. (2018) used handheld mobile lidar
    data to estimate light interception in avocado orchards using a solar-geometric
    model, which is suitable for developing a decision support system for pruning.
    More advances are expected when functional and structural plant models are combined
    with accurate lidar data (Hanan and Prusinkiewicz, 2008), not only in orchards
    but also in vegetables and flowering trees. High-throughput structural and functional
    phenotyping and modeling using lidar has been rarely applied to breeding but has
    contributed much to the improved understanding of horticultural management (Coupel-Ledru
    et al., 2019). In horticultural breeding, Coupel-Ledru et al. (2019) found strong
    genotype effects and heritability of terrestrial lidar-derived phenotypes. Jiang
    et al. (2019) proposed a pipeline to extract shape descriptors from lidar data
    for differentiating various genotypes and identifying features desired for production.
    Because phenotypes are affected by genes and their environment as well as by extensive
    artificial management, the difficulty of using lidar data to improve breeding
    is being actively explored. In horticultural management, lidar sensors are usually
    attached to field robots and machines (e.g., fertilizer spreaders and sprayers)
    (Shamshiri et al., 2018). The sensors can then quantify tree size (e.g., canopy
    volume) to guide real-time variable rate fertilization and pesticide spraying
    (Colaco et al., 2018, Torrent et al., 2020). For example, Gregorio Lopez et al.
    (2014) used a lidar system to measure pesticide spray drift, finding a strong
    correlation with passive collector measurements. Walklate et al. (2006) discovered
    that lidar-derived area-density and height phenotypes were the best indicators
    for simplifying spraying schemes. In spraying activities, lidar can provide canopy
    density and spraying deposition information to enable coordinate-based variable
    rate dosing, which has proven both more economical and efficient. Besides spraying,
    lidar can derive accurate 3D terrain maps for plantation management and provide
    structure to guide rapid and accurate pruning. For example, Shafri et al. (2012)
    combined lidar and multispectral imagery to plan the development of a plantation
    road and seedling positions in an oil palm plantation Tagarakis et al. (2013)
    investigated the use of lidar to map pruning in a vineyard. By providing accurate
    structural information, lidar helps managers find optimal phenotypes for breeding
    and regulate field management. Overall, although the benefit of lidar applications
    in horticulture has been well-documented, most applications relate to management
    at canopy level or in an orchard. Once we will be able to characterize detailed
    architecture in a high-throughput way, additional applications in phenotyping
    vegetables and flowers can be also developed. With the increasing capabilities
    of long-term repeatable monitoring, multisource data integration, and virtual
    plant modeling, we believe that improved breeding practices and better management
    will be achieved (Colaco et al., 2018). 4.3. Lidar sheds new light on grass phenotyping
    Grass phenotyping is essential for evaluating grassland quality, accelerating
    breeding, and improving management. The emergence of lidar provides detailed 3D
    structure information of grass and has no obvious saturation effect that optical
    remote sensing methods have suffered (Chen et al., 2009, Xu et al., 2008). Because
    grass vegetation is generally short and clustered, phenotyping of individual grass
    is impossible (Table 1). Current grassland phenotyping is focused on the community
    level. Structural phenotype extraction at the community level (e.g. canopy cover,
    canopy height, and canopy volume) is the major phenotyping issue of lidar data
    in grass fields, providing basic data for breeding and management (Anderson et
    al., 2018, Li et al., 2017a, Xu et al., 2020) (Fig. 6a). At the small scale (e.g.,
    plot and sub-plot), terrestrial lidar is the most widely used platform to accurately
    describe grassland phenotypes. Many studies have compared and analyzed different
    methods for structural phenotype extraction. Pulse echo-based methods and CHM-based
    methods are commonly used for canopy cover (0.36 < R2 < 0.77, Anderson et al.,
    2018) and canopy height (R2 = 0.70, Wijesingha et al., 2018, Xu et al., 2020)
    extraction. Canopy volume, a complex 3D phenotype, can be derived using volume
    surface differencing approaches (Cooper et al., 2017), voxel counting approaches
    (Greaves et al., 2015), and convex-hull approaches (Schulze-Brüninghoff et al.,
    2019). At the larger scale (e.g., pasture), UAV and airborne lidar are preferred
    due to their efficiency and flexibility (Fisher et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2017,
    Wang et al., 2019b), but their potential for phenotyping needs to be further validated
    due to large laser beam divergence (Wang et al., 2017). Phenotypes extracted from
    lidar data can reflect the growth states of grassland and detect its response
    to stress and its post-stress recovery. It is therefore conducive to the rapid
    and accurate screening of high-quality grassland varieties (e.g., those that are
    water-efficient and climate-ready) (Walter et al., 2012). In management, lidar-derived
    terrain information can be used to distinguish native grasslands from cultivated
    grasslands, assisting with the understanding and management of grassland degradation
    (Fisher et al., 2018). In addition, metrics for lidar-based profile area change
    and height may be used to quantify grassland dynamics resulting from natural disasters,
    such as wildfires (Hu et al., 2019, Kelly et al., 2018). It is hoped that more
    complex phenotype dynamics can be assessed across multiple scales with the advancement
    of temporal lidar monitoring (Fig. 6b), which will contribute greatly to the study
    and understanding of grassland function. Download : Download high-res image (948KB)

    (a) Structure phenotype extraction; (b) spatial temporal monitoring; (c) Function
    phenotype modeling; and (d) breeding and management. Lidar can indirectly estimate
    functional phenotypes of grasslands from structural phenotypes, providing a basis
    for grassland breeding and management (Fig. 6c-d). Aboveground biomass (AGB) is
    one of the most significant indicators for increasing potential genetic gain (Wiering
    et al., 2019), and measuring both grassland function and carrying capacity (Piao
    et al., 2004, Psomas et al., 2011, Scurlock et al., 2002). Previous studies have
    shown that lidar-derived structural phenotypes provide more accurate estimates
    of biomass than image sensors (Cooper et al., 2017, Wijesingha et al., 2018),
    especially at higher plant densities (Wiering et al., 2019). Xu et al. (2020)
    found that a stepwise regression model is more suitable for AGB estimation (R2
    = 0.84) of degraded grasslands in an agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China,
    providing a method for functional monitoring and management of degraded grasslands.
    Li et al. (2017a) used vegetation indicators extracted from lidar and machine
    learning methods to map biomass in a shrub-steppe landscape for better monitoring
    and management of a threatened ecosystem. Coupling lidar with image data is feasible
    and achieves better estimates of grassland biomass than either lidar data or image
    data alone (Schaefer and Lamb, 2016, Wiering et al., 2019). Lidar-derived grassland
    biomass mapping would improve management decisions and can be used to quantify
    grass growth, measure fuel loads, evaluate erosion processes, and assess wildlife
    habitat (Anderson et al., 2018). With the exception of grass phenotyping, lidar
    use in grass modeling is still exploratory. Compared to agricultural crops and
    trees, grass has an extremely low height and dense composition. Therefore, systematic
    evaluations of the accuracy in phenotypes derived from various lidar systems are
    needed. Modeling the grass structure, physiology and interactions with their environment
    using lidar data is challenging. For example, modeling the digital terrain of
    grassland is difficult because of the misclassification between ground points
    and short vegetation, which further reduces the accuracy of phenotype (e.g., grass
    height) measurements (Fan et al., 2014). Additionally, environmental factors (e.g.,
    light resources and precipitation) profoundly influence herbaceous phenotype plasticity
    (Zhou et al., 2014), yet are needed for combination with lidar-derived phenotypes
    in the radiative transfer models. These models are expected to better quantify
    grassland functional diversity and ecosystem heterogeneity and provide new methods
    for grassland breeding and management (Rossi et al., 2020). Overall, lidar has
    enabled considerable progress in extracting grass phenotypes, but it is still
    in its infancy and faces distinct challenges. Current structural phenotyping focuses
    primarily on extracting simple phenotypes (e.g., height and canopy cover), and
    structural differences between grass species are difficult to identify from lidar
    data, especially in an extensively managed heterogeneous grassland (Schulze-Brüninghoff
    et al., 2019). Therefore, lidar-derived structural phenotypes should be integrated
    with spectral information from other sensors (Schulze-Brüninghoff et al., 2019,
    Tilly et al., 2015) to obtain more ecologically meaningful structural indicators
    (e.g., specific leaf area). These indicators can support grass phenotype monitoring
    and quickly screen for high-quality breeding resources (Rossi et al., 2020). Multi-source
    data integration will also benefit grassland management by upscaling phenotypes
    from local to regional scales (Zhang et al., 2018). 5. Outlook and future developments
    The rapid development of lidar facilities and algorithms have advanced the interactive
    study of plant phenomics, genomics, environment, and management. The throughput
    of 3D phenotypic traits obtained using Lidar data can be thousands of times that
    of using images and manual methods at the plot level (Sun et al., 2018), but we
    have to mention that the throughput ability is closely related to the used facilities
    (spatial resolution) and compared plot sizes (spatial extent). The high-throughput
    phenotypic traits provided by lidar has not only been used to find for and design
    ideotypes for breeding (Madec et al., 2017), but also to monitor and simulate
    plant dynamics to promote quantitative and accurate plant management under changing
    climate and environment. Despite these great developments, lidar application in
    plant phenotyping still has a long way to go towards informing better breeding
    and management applications. 5.1. Low cost, high spatial resolution, and hyperspectral
    lidar facility Although substantial advances have been made in plant phenomics,
    the high costs associated with phenotyping and throughput are still bottlenecks
    to breeding progress (Dai et al., 2018, Danson et al., 2014, Douglas et al., 2012,
    Paulus et al., 2014a, Wallace et al., 2013, Wei et al., 2012). As manufacturing
    matures, sensors are becoming smaller and lighter, point density and quality are
    increasing, and costs are decreasing, especially for solid-state lidar (Poulton
    et al., 2017) and single-photo lidar (Mandlburger et al., 2019). Solid-state lidar
    sensors are based on a silicon chip containing no mechanically moving parts, which
    makes the sensor more compact and more robust to vibration. Compared to traditional
    lidar, solid-state lidar has smaller dimensions, lower cost, higher spatial resolution,
    and increased efficiency, all of which can be integrated into a portable device,
    such as an Apple Inc. iPad Pro. A single-photon lidar only needs one photo detected
    per ranging measurement. It provides a more efficient approach to make rapid,
    high-spatial- resolution, large-swath measurements. High-quality data from solid-state
    lidar and single-photon lidar may contribute to better phenotyping in dense canopies
    (e.g., grass), and provides affordable and timely information about long-range
    and large-scale phenotypes that previous lidar platforms, such as UAV, airborne,
    and satellite, have been unable to provide. Besides the lowering cost and the
    increasing spatial resolution, there is a growing interest in fusing spectral
    information with lidar data that can offer unique and synergistic capabilities
    for characterizing plant bio-physical/chemical traits (Buddenbaum et al., 2013,
    Shen et al., 2020, Thomas et al., 2008). There are indirect methods for fusing
    lidar data and spectral data (Shalal et al., 2015, Underwood et al., 2016). Although
    the combination can result in improvements in both structural and physiological
    estimates, these combinations have low efficiency (Wang et al., 2016) and are
    difficult to interpret because it is hard to accurately synchronize multi-source
    data in time and space (Wallace et al., 2013). By contrast, direct sensor integration
    is preferred, but it is much more challenging. Several studies have described
    the design of a multispectral lidar sensor (Buller et al., 2005, Wallace et al.,
    2013, Wei et al., 2012), and a more novel sensor, hyperspectral lidar, is under
    active development (Lin, 2015). Although some prototype applications have been
    made using hyperspectral lidar (Du et al., 2016), the spectral resolution, ranging
    accuracy, and ranging distance are unsatisfactory due to limited pulse energy,
    beam quality, spectrum stability, and a low signal–noise-ratio (Wang et al., 2016).
    When hyperspectral lidar and even fluorescence lidar sensors mature, plant phenotyping
    will be promoted from structure to physiology and will facilitate advanced management,
    such as disease assessment (Shakoor et al., 2017). In addition to the above mentioned
    developing trends of lidar sensors, phenotypic platforms are also becoming low-cost
    and flexible to increase data quality with the integration of sensors, robotic
    technology, and computer devices (Hyyppä et al., 2020a, Watt et al., 2020). These
    lidar systems can be built onto existing phenotype or ecosystem monitoring networks
    (Baldocchi et al., 2001), and coupled with multisource monitoring data for analysis
    with the help of Internet of Things technology (Reynolds et al., 2019, Zhou et
    al., 2017). Distributed plant phenotyping systems that adopt distributed storage,
    computation, and organization technologies are also emerging (Liao et al., 2019,
    Villarrubia et al., 2017), which can improve the acquisition of multi-spatial
    and temporal lidar data. 5.2. Multi-dimensional phenotyping with algorithm and
    modeling endeavor Lidar has transformed phenotyping into the 3D era, evolving
    from a 1D ruler and 2D image measurements. To further advance breeding and management,
    lidar-based phenotyping is expected to move toward a multi-dimensional era (Eitel
    et al., 2016), including multi-spatial scales (Jin et al., 2020b), multi-temporal
    scales (Calders et al., 2015, Coupel-Ledru et al., 2019, Hart et al., 2017, Su
    et al., 2019), multi-species studies, and multi-omics studies (Coupel-Ledru et
    al., 2019, Peng et al., 2020). Multi-spatial scale phenotyping requires efforts
    to expand over larger scales and at finer levels than current phenotyping allows
    (Dhondt et al., 2013). Meanwhile, consideration should be given to eliminating
    scaling effects in cross-scale modeling processes (Wu and Li, 2009). Most lidar-based
    phenotyping studies for breeding are conducted at individual plant to canopy levels,
    but an in-depth study of organ-level phenotyping is becoming more feasible, leading
    to the discovery of a variety of phenotypes for breeding. However, varieties cultivated
    in one location may not be suitable in others. Learning to combine large-scale
    climate, environment, and phenotype information for fine level breeding is conducive
    to breeding more adaptable varieties. Meanwhile, large-scale plant phenotyping
    can provide background information for plant management, which is helpful for
    macro-control. Extending plant management using fine levels’ phenotypes and providing
    precise and effective plant management is critical. In these processes, multiscale
    data fusion will be challenging as a result of the different data resolutions
    among products measured at different scales. Multi-temporal scale phenotyping
    allows for plant growth monitoring (Tilly et al., 2014), which can be used to
    evaluate plant stress, select ideotypes, and guide management. Calders et al.,
    2015, Hart et al., 2017 used terrestrial lidar to monitor spring phenology and
    spatial–temporal patterns of flowering. Su et al. (2019) demonstrated the feasibility
    of using temporal lidar data to identify key phenotypes and growth stages that
    can distinguish between different drought-tolerant maize varieties under drought
    stress. Current studies occur mainly during several specific growth periods with
    few explorations at a daily time interval. To detect phenotypic changes earlier,
    it is critical to monitor phenotypes at a finer time scale. Current difficulties
    include: 1) phenotype changes that occur during a short period of time are very
    subtle, requiring high-precision data acquisition and processing; 2) High-precision
    data acquisition is typically inefficient when carried out at a large scale. It
    is difficult to balance time, space, and accuracy to acquire multi-temporal point
    cloud data with sufficiently representative samples. Multi-species phenotyping
    is key for achieving more comprehensive, intelligent, and applicable plant breeding
    and management. Different species may have similar structures, while a single
    species may have different structures. The heterogeneous environment and divergent
    management practices further increase the diversity and complexity of phenotypes
    between different species. This diversity and complexity among species make the
    differences between species difficult to distinguish, which impairs breeding selection
    and cultivation management. This problem can be partly solved by using multi-functional
    and multi-temporal lidar data, such as exploring synthetic phenotypes (Bailey-Serres
    et al., 2019), which have the potential to reveal the subtle differences at a
    certain location (e.g., leaf node) and during specified growth stages. Another
    problem is that there are no universal data processing algorithms for multiple
    species. Current phenotyping algorithms from lidar data are static and usually
    developed for an individual species. Research into transferability among multiple
    species should focus on methods such as semi/unsupervised learning (Hodapp, 2016),
    active learning (Chandra et al., 2020a), and transfer learning (Ghazi et al.,
    2017). Nevertheless, development of universal phenotypic algorithms and quantitative
    phenotypes for multi-species plants is both urgent and challenging to reveal unknown
    Genotype Environment Management interactions (Watt et al., 2020). Multi-omics
    phenotyping includes mainly phenomics, genomics, environment, and management and
    aims to increase genetic gain through high-throughput phenotyping and genetic
    variability under specific background scenarios (Gui et al., 2020). Researchers
    should seek to integrate lidar data with multisource remote sensing data, climate
    and soil conditions, and management information (e.g., pest and disease occurrence,
    and historical yield) (Colaco et al., 2018, Tilly et al., 2015). Coupel-Ledru
    et al. (2019) combined terrestrial lidar and multiple sensor information to acquire
    multi-scale structural and functional phenotypes to explore genetic variability
    under different watering conditions. In addition to field phenotyping, plant modeling
    provides an alternative method for assessing phenotype adaptations to gene diversity
    and climate change at organ-to- canopy and regional-to-global scales (Peng et
    al., 2020, Room et al., 1996). An advanced multiscale crop modeling framework
    will enable a gene-to-farm design of high tolerance varieties leading to highly
    productive systems (Peng et al., 2020). The multi-scale modeling and multi-omics
    paradigms are challenged by a lack of interdisciplinary cooperation and integration
    of research between agronomists, breeders, and modelers (Peng et al., 2020, Tardieu,
    2003). Assimilating models and data is a vital step towards future multi-dimensional
    studies. 5.3. Embracing open source and big data Lidar-based phenotyping in multiple
    dimensions is moving into the era of big data (Singh et al., 2016). Dealing with
    multi-dimensional plant phenomics requires theories and methods from data management
    and utilization, with the final goal of making data findable, accessible, interoperable,
    and reusable (Watt et al., 2020). Open-source databases, software, and integrative
    platforms need to be developed (Coppens et al., 2017, Gui et al., 2020, Lobet
    et al., 2013, Mungall et al., 2017, Tsaftaris and Scharr, 2020). Some image-based
    databases, models, and software have already been developed (Guo et al., 2017b,
    Lobet et al., 2013, Symonova et al., 2015), and they have been successfully used
    to quantify phenotype dynamics and dissect genetic and environmental effects (Chen
    et al., 2019, Ubbens and Stavness, 2017, Walter et al., 2007). However, lidar-related
    open source projects are rarely reported. A pivotal requisite is to build standards
    for both data collection and storage (Watt et al., 2020) to retain data value
    over time (Roitsch et al., 2019). Neveu et al. (2018) developed an ontology-driven
    system for integrating and sharing phenomics data from various platforms and experiments.
    To link multi-omics studies, integrative data and analytic platforms have also
    been developed (Mungall et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2019). These developments can
    reduce the cost and difficulty associated with transdisciplinary phenotyping (Rebetzke
    et al., 2019). The integration of multi-omics data creates a new and emerging
    demand on data analysis tools. Deep learning and cloud-based processing are promising
    approaches for efficient data analysis (Chandra et al., 2020b, Jiang and Li, 2020,
    Liu et al., 2019b, Singh et al., 2016). Data fusion is a pivotal foundation needed
    before data analysis and includes fusing data from multiple temporal, spatial,
    and source (e.g., lidar, image, environment, gene, and field measurement) datasets.
    Lidar data contain information about the fine structure of the plant, spectral/thermal/fluorescence
    data reflect physiological information about the plant, true color imagery characterizes
    texture information of the plant, and computed tomography reflects internal structural
    information of the plant. Researches are needed into how to fuse lidar data with
    other remote sensing data with different spatial–temporal information. This is
    an important step towards fully exploring plant structure and functional phenotypes.
    Deep learning has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in data fusion at
    the data (Elbaz et al., 2017), feature (Chen and Li, 2017, Zhou et al., 2020b),
    and decision levels (Ayrey et al., 2019). Deep learning methods have also emerged
    for phenotype extraction (Hamraz et al., 2019, Jin et al., 2018b, Jin et al.,
    2019, Wang et al., 2019a) and have been used to unravel biotic and abiotic stress-related
    questions (Shakoor et al., 2017, Singh et al., 2016). This research opens up new
    opportunities for breeding and plant management with global information system
    support (Shakoor et al., 2017). Because deep learning has high computational requirements,
    cloud computing provides the best advantages of low-cost, high performance, and
    flexible operation. 6. Conclusions Phenotyping is a key and fundamental task in
    plant phenomics, and it is important for plant breeding and management. Currently,
    the ability to provide 3D phenotypes at multi-spatial, temporal, and species limits
    our ability to identify phenotypes linked with genetic and environment selections.
    The emerging development of lidar is providing effective tools for both indoor
    and field phenotyping. This review first introduces recent progress in lidar facilities
    and algorithms. Second, it highlights how the progress have advanced the study
    of the status and dynamic changes of structural and functional phenotypes, and
    how lidar-derived phenotypes have improved 3D plant modeling across different
    spatial–temporal scales and disciplines in agriculture. It examines how these
    phenotyping and modeling practices have contributed to better breeding and management
    practices. Third, compared with other recent reviews that center on agriculture
    phenotyping, it further highlights the potential of lidar for phenotyping, modeling,
    and applications in forest, horticultural, and grass. Finally, it acknowledges
    that the above-mentioned phenotyping advances have solved some breeding and management
    issues, yet challenges remain. It presents upcoming advances in low-cost, high-spatial-resolution,
    and multi-functional facilities, multi-dimensional applications with algorithm
    endeavor, and open source and big data that will change our understanding of plant
    phenotyping, modeling, and improve breeding and management. Declaration of Competing

  description: Irrigation is very important for ensuring food security and reducing
    crop production vulnerability caused by the lack of rain. Sustainable irrigation
    is the rational practice of all the activities related to water application on
    the crops. In irrigation, the rationality of intelligent agents can be used to
    reach soil water content near the field capacity to increase yields and reduce
    waste of water. Rationality in artificial intelligence is the capability of the

    Irrigation is very important for ensuring food security and reducing crop production
    vulnerability caused by the lack of rain. Sustainable irrigation is the rational
    practice of all the activities related to water application on the crops. In irrigation,
    the rationality of intelligent agents can be used to reach soil water content
    near the field capacity to increase yields and reduce waste of water. Rationality
    in artificial intelligence is the capability of the intelligent agents to decide
    their actions. This paper discusses how incorporating intelligent agents on irrigation
    systems allows significant advances in respect of current irrigation approaches.

    is the process to apply water to the soil in order to improve the crop growing,
    maintain landscapes and revegetate degraded soils in dry regions and periods of
    insufficient rainfall (Mrinmayi et al., 2016). Economical, water management and
    ecological criteria are used in the definition of decision-making on irrigation
    systems (Zhemukhov and Zhemukhova, 2016). Irrigation decisions in agriculture
    depend on how much water the crop of a particular species requires and how much
    water is available from local sources (Riediger et al., 2016). Soil moisture ensures
    the healthy growth of the roots and the overall development of the plant (Kumar
    et al., 2017). Its deficits can arise in times when evapotranspiration is higher
    than precipitation and soil water storage is not sufficient to maintain plants
    provision (Zhao et al., 2017). The lack of water in the soil impairs the correct
    plant development and its excess can reduce root respiration, affect the root
    growth and produce soil degradation problems such as surface runoff, soil erosion
    and nutrient leaching (Grashey-Jansen, 2014). Besides, inappropriate irrigation
    practices produce significant soil salinization and the climate change in many
    regions threatens to exacerbate this behavior (Tal, 2016). Soil textures and their
    corresponding soil water retention functions should be considered in the irrigation
    strategies (Grashey-Jansen, 2014). The Total AvailableWater (TAW) is the volume
    of water that can be stored in the soil and used by plants (Barradas et al., 2012).
    It is characterized by the permanent wilting point (PWP) and the field capacity
    (FC). The PWP is the minimum soil moisture under which a plant cannot extract
    water from the soil. At this point, the vegetation cannot recover from the water
    loss, although water is applied again. On the other hand, FC is the amount of
    water that a soil can retain after saturation and free drainage, without losses
    by evaporation, until the soil moisture stabilizes, that is, between two and three
    days after raining or the irrigation application (Ghorbani et al., 2017). The
    water content available for a plant between (PWP) and (FC) is influenced by the
    soil composition and can be perceived as the most important component for high
    irrigation efficiency (Grashey-Jansen, 2014). Water content in an effective root
    zone is estimated using the water balance approach (Eq. (1)). This equation is
    often used in irrigation modelling and simulation, with permanent re-calibration
    requirements (Andales et al., 2011). (1) where, is the change in the soil water
    content; is the irrigation amount; is the rain; is the crop evapotranspiration
    and is the deep percolation. The effects of climate change on rain patterns and
    the amount of water available have decreased the accessibility to this important
    resource for agriculture. To face the challenges in production for food security
    and sustainable development, the need for generation of adaptive management strategies
    in agriculture is evident. Adaptation refers to include actions to adjust practices,
    processes, structures, and capital, in response to the field management and the
    reality or the threat of climate change (Howden et al., 2007). In crop irrigation,
    adaptive systems must be developed to manage water efficiently, maintaining the
    water content in the effective root zone near to the FC (Riediger et al., 2016).
    Additionally, irrigation systems must include soil-crop-environment responses
    to define the irrigation prescriptions and use these responses to improve the
    next irrigation activities (Smith et al., 2011). These considerations lead directly
    to the conceptualization of irrigation systems that determine the timing, magnitude
    and spatial pattern of irrigation applications. To solve the problems caused by
    inadequate irrigation, intelligent irrigation systems have been proposed as an
    alternative to conventional timed controllers (Divya et al., 2014). Precision
    irrigation (PI) technologies are useful strategies in adaptive systems, allowing
    the precise evaluation of crop water needs and the variable or uniform application
    of water in the right place at the right time, using electronic systems and hydraulic
    elements with high volumetric efficiency (Morillo et al., 2015). Additionally,
    artificial intelligence is a promising strategy for information management and
    generation of models for precision agriculture applications. Artificial intelligence
    studies how to make computers and robots to behave or think in the same way as
    humans. The fundamental concept of several AI systems is the rational behavior.
    This concept means that computers or robots can perform actions considered as
    the best possible option to achieve the objectives for which they were programmed.
    Systems, named intelligent agents, use rational behavior to determine actions
    in the surrounding environment (Jimenez et al., 2018). An intelligent agent is
    an autonomous entity that uses sensors to obtain information from the environment,
    takes decisions using reasoning and learning strategies, and carries out actions
    to modify the environment using actuators (Russell and Norvig, 2016). A multi-agent
    system (MAS) consists in the interaction of several intelligent agents (Gonzalez,
    2012). Agents in a multi-agent system can use sociable abilities to transmit and
    receive information from other agents. The behavior of agents together with other
    entities produces an intelligent group result (Hernández et al., 2018). This paper
    aims to provide a review of the considerations and technical analysis for the
    development of intelligent systems for precision irrigation. The motivation of
    this review is to collect relevant and promising information about the development
    trends in technologies used for the specification, design and implementation of
    the PEAS (performance measurement, environment, actuation and sensing) in an intelligent
    agent with applications in precision irrigation. This review explains the principal
    sensing technologies for estimating irrigation rates and times in agriculture
    and identifying control and actuation techniques used to regulate water flow in
    crops irrigation. Additionally, the methodologies and platforms are described
    for the implementation of Decision Support Systems (DSS), inference strategies
    and prediction mechanisms for irrigation management using artificial intelligence.
    With the use of these technologies, the early detection of plant water stress
    in crops is possible, before irreversible damage and yield losses are caused,
    as well as increase in water savings, optimally management of the water resource
    and enhancement of agricultural sustainability. This review highlights the interaction
    of multiple agents for the management of water resources in agriculture. The bibliographic
    review also aims to describe the technological advances in the specification of
    the AEIO (Agent, Environment, Interaction and Organisation) for the implementation
    of a Multi-Agent system for irrigation management in an irrigation district. This
    review is organized into two sections: intelligent agents in crop irrigation and
    multi-agent systems applied to water resource management. The first section is
    split into the following subsections: conceptualization, sensors systems in irrigation
    intelligent agents, decision support systems for irrigation management and artificial
    intelligence applied to irrigation. 2. Methodology In this review, the Search,

    and Spanish, by title, abstract and keywords, using the scientific databases:
    SCOPUS, Web of Science, Science Direct, IEEE Explore, Springer Journal, Springer
    Books and Dialnet. The documents were ordered from the highest to the lowest according
    to the number of references found and classified in the following knowledge areas:

    and electronic engineering, and social and economic sciences. A total of 280 documents
    were selected, where 105 of these were published from the years 2014 to 2019,
    which evidences the relevance of the proposed research topic. Based on this analysis,
    a classification was established into the following thematic groups: • Sensors
    systems for irrigation management. This thematic group contains the documents
    that reported developments and applications of climatic, soil or plant sensors
    for the definition of crop water requirements. • Support systems for decisions
    in irrigation management: It includes some SSDs used for water resource management
    in land irrigation, irrigation districts and irrigation systems design. • Artificial
    intelligence systems applied to irrigation. This contains works associated with
    the development of rational agents for irrigation management or systems that have
    some of the characteristics of an AI system. • Multi-agent systems applied to
    the management of the water resource. In which the works associated with the use
    of multiagent systems for the irrigation management in a field, as in large-scale
    production systems are established. Thanks to this review, the synthesis was carried
    out in the following sections, taking into account the concepts, advances, methodologies
    and procedures used in water resource management systems for irrigation, with
    thematic areas associated with engineering, especially where artificial intelligence
    techniques are applied. 3. Intelligent agents in crop irrigation The words intelligent
    and smart are commonly used to represent similar things, but they are actually
    different. Smart refers to technological aspects and the ability to apply previously
    acquired knowledge in practical situations (Yurish, 2010). Intelligent refers
    to the functional behavior and the ability to acquire and apply new knowledge
    and skills (Augusto et al., 2010). The development of truly intelligent systems
    implies that they can learn habits, preferences and correctly diagnose situations;
    know where and when events of interest occur and provide a structured way of analyzing,
    deciding and reacting in their environments (Taymanov and Sapozhnikova, 2009).
    Smart irrigation systems are technologies that estimate or measure the TAW depletion
    in order to control the irrigation for replenishing the water needs of the crop
    and minimizing the waste of resource (Nautiyal et al., 2010). Generally, these
    systems are programmed using initial site-specific set-up, executing schedule
    adjustments and including scheduling and required cycles, without human intervention
    (Rodriguez-Ortega et al., 2017). Intelligent irrigation systems use AI techniques
    to optimize water application on the crops, which make decisions using past experiences,
    analyzing real-time data and learning, according to the environment behavior (Shekhar
    et al., 2017). Intelligent irrigation systems can be studied as intelligent agents,
    which are systems that possess intelligent properties similar to human ones. According
    to Fougères and Ostrosi (2018), an intelligent agent is a physical entity composed
    of hardware and software, or a virtual entity developed only by software, which
    seeks to fulfill assigned tasks. Intelligent agents are autonomous entities that
    demonstrate reactive, proactive and social skills, with the ability to infer,
    reason, learn and update (Esmaeili et al., 2017). An agent is rational if its
    actions executed on the environment in which it is located are appropriated according
    to the response caused, using a performance measurement (Russell and Norvig, 2016).
    According to Fig. 1, an intelligent agent is composed of sensors for acquiring
    information from the environment, actuators to influence on the environment and
    an interpretation and decision support system (with or without AI). Additionally,
    an agent could have communication components for exchanging information with other
    agents and attributes–functions capabilities such as learning, evolution, coordination
    and planning (Parker et al., 2002). Download : Download high-res image (115KB)

    different kind of sensors. These sensors are installed and grouped into nodes
    or motes (Fig. 2a), which measure physical variables in plants, soil or the environment
    (e.g., relative humidity, temperature and radiation). Additionally, data can be
    acquired using non-invasive sensing technologies for obtaining images from the
    field using different electromagnetic wavelengths (thermal, multispectral, night
    vision or photometric cameras). The images can be captured by cameras installed
    in unmanned autonomous vehicles - UAV (Fig. 2b), terrestrial systems (ground robot
    or other ground vehicles), or from satellital systems (Fig. 2c) such as radars
    (e.g., Sentinel1 or RadarSat) or multispectral (e.g., Sentinel2, LandSat or MODIS)

    or other actuators for supplying the irrigation. The provided information by the
    sensor nodes or cameras must be georeferenced to establish with precision the
    geographical spatial location of the measurements. The data acquired can be obtained
    in real time or at previously established sampling times. The sensors data must
    be proportional to the measured physical variables and are delivered in a format
    of analog or digital electrical signals, which are sent to the data acquisition
    systems - DAQS (Fig. 2d). The DAQS receive, transform, scale and condition the
    electrical signals from the sensors to give digital data stored in a numerical
    format to be processed or integrated. The digitized data that provide crop information
    are transmitted wirelessly through DTUs using wireless communication protocols
    (ZigBee, WiFi or Bluetooth). The DTUs are composed of modems and antennas (Fig.
    2e), which conform a network of wireless sensor nodes that transfer remotely the
    crop data by a router linked to an information collection center or central master
    control system. The central master control system (Fig. 2f) is integrated by a
    high-performance computer or server with a specialized built-in software (Fig.
    2g) that manipulates and processes the data and images collected from the crops
    using artificial intelligent processing techniques. The algorithms programmed
    in the central master control system allow displaying real-time information about
    the crop, interpreting and analyzing the data to give support and manage the irrigation
    applications, making decisions to generate control signals for the actuators that
    dose water in the field and predicting future behaviors of the crop. The crop
    information can be transferred and stored through internet (Cloud Computing) (Fig.
    2h) or can be sent to mobile devices, laptops, tablets or other devices to track,
    manage or control remotely the irrigation applications (Internet of Things) (Fig.
    2i). Additionally, irrigation control algorithms use several feedback control
    strategies to generate control actions that regulate the precise supply of water
    flow in each crop node. These control signals are transferred from the master
    control center and conditioned by an electronic system or driver (Fig. 2j) that
    automatically delivers the appropriate activation energy to the pumps, motor pumps
    or actuators for supply precision irrigation (Fig. 2k). A review about intelligent
    agents and their components, applied to irrigation management, will be described
    in the next subsections. 3.1. Sensors in irrigation intelligent agents Intelligent
    irrigation systems need to define the amount and time of water application by
    means of simulation, direct or indirect measurements or using historical data.
    Soil-crop responses to these applications are included, in order to improve the
    irrigation plans (Hashem et al., 2016). For the measurement of parameters associated
    with irrigation systems, a wide variety of technologies have been developed to
    program irrigation using data acquisition and instrumentation methods based on
    climatic data, soil or plant measurements. 3.1.1. Data acquisition methods for
    irrigation based on climate data In recent years, the number of researches related
    to the development of electronic and software technologies has increased to determine
    the parameters useful for programming irrigation based on soil water balance and
    climatic data. This approximation uses the crop evapotranspiration ), calculated
    with the crop coefficient and the reference evapotranspiration , where (Nautiyal
    et al., 2010). Researches in this topic are explained below from two perspectives:
    using field sensors and using remote sensors. For calculating , the United Nations
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) adopted the Penman-Monteith method, which
    uses meteorological stations as principal sources of data (Córdova et al., 2015).
    An Eddy Covariance system (CE) is used for the measurement of the turbulent flow
    calculation in an atmospheric layer. It generally consists of an omnidirectional
    sonic anemometer and gas analyzers , but can integrate other sensors such as radiometer,
    heat flow in the soil, soil temperature, soil moisture, precipitation or inclinometer.
    In Clulow et al. (2015), the use of CE in southern Africa is reported to determine
    evapotranspiration in a forest cover. The study highlights the difficulties of
    using this system in remote areas, due to the frequent need of equipment maintenance.
    Another system used to determine the value of evapotranspiration is the Bowen
    station, as in the research reported in Brazil by Bezerra et al. (2015). The equipment
    is based on the measurement of the energy balance according to Bowen’s reason.
    In principle, it is a weather station with additional temperature and humidity
    sensors, which is much more economical than a CE. A lysimeter is a measuring device
    used to measure the amount of actual evapotranspiration released by plants. In
    Jiménez-Carvajal et al. (2017), the results obtained in the implementation of
    a low-cost automated weighing lysimeter in potted plants are presented, to determine
    the water balance in irrigation periods, through the direct crop evapotranspiration
    determination, after calibration and validation of the equipment. According to
    their results, there is evidence of the need to study their response in several
    types of plants and the implementation of signal processing techniques to determine
    and filter atypical values. Another type of lysimeter is shown in Proulx-McInnis
    et al. (2012), which is considered as a volume lysimeter. The principle of this
    lysimeter is to isolate a volume of impermeable geotextile material, measuring
    the necessary inputs and outputs of water to maintain the system at the same level
    of water as the surrounding environment. This system is governed by a data logger,
    which sends signals to water suction pumps. The water levels in two containers
    of water inlet and outlet were measured by means of pressure sensors. In Moorhead
    et al. (2017) they report a scintillometer (SLS) for the determination of evapotranspiration.
    This instrument is used in atmospheric studies, but its application in irrigation
    management is still under research, where there is no abundant scientific literature.
    The scintillometer measures contributions to flows in a fixed direction. Moorhead
    and his team used the SLS based on the energy balance equation (Zhemukhov and
    Zhemukhova, 2016). (2) where is the net radiation absorbed, is the latent heat
    flow (evaporated water), is the sensible heat flow (air) and is the heat flow
    in the soil (all measured in ). An SLS consists of a transmitter and a receiver,
    separated by a distance ( ) and uses specific apertures and wavelenght . A wave
    with large aperture SLS ( ) or microwave aperture SLS is transmitted, so that
    the intensity of the beam fluctuates due to the phenomena of absorption and diffraction.
    These fluctuations are useful for determining the structural parameters of the
    medium, such as temperature, humidity and H. With error rates as low as 14%, the
    SLS exhibits good results in irrigation systems, in the determination of crop
    coefficients or irrigation schedule (Moorhead et al., 2017). There are also studies
    on the use of digital image processing to find the , determining the coverage
    that the plant has on the ground and other allometric measures, such as root depth
    and average plant height, where segmentation techniques play a fundamental role
    in the processing (Sabzi et al., 2017). Through these techniques, plants information
    is collected remotely and used for the crop evapotranspiration determination.
    In Carrasco-Benavides et al. (2016), a methodology is specified to determine the
    Leaf Area Index (LAI), which is a dimensionless variable defined as the leaf tissue
    area per soil area, related to the (Kirk et al., 2009, Cerekovic et al., 2010).
    The procedure consisted in comparing the LAI obtained from the processing of images
    acquired from a conventional camera (RGB, Red, Green and Blue) and the data obtained
    by defoliation in cherry trees. Their results show the robustness of the method
    to determine the LAI, indicating the calibration needs for each crop type. Another
    parameter used is the percentage of plant cover (PGC, Percent Green Cover). Daniel
    Fernández et al. (2014) developed a method based on image treatment to estimate
    the crop coefficient using the PGC and the measurement of crop height. First,
    they used a weather station and a Bowen station to obtain the real , then they
    estimated a function between PGC and h, and finally they found another function
    that relates . They also determined the relationship between root depth and .
    Additionally, they obtained quadratic correlation coefficient values of 0.993
    and 0.979 by estimating the height h from PGC and from PGC/h, respectively, which
    demonstrated the validity of the method. The method needs calibration procedures
    according to the crop and soil types (Fernández-Pacheco et al., 2014). In González-Esquiva
    et al. (2017), the development of a new model is explained for estimating the
    water balance of lettuce cultivation from the plant effective diameter (PED),
    which is calculated using the PGC value. It is based on the ratio of plant diameter
    (D) - biomass (B), using the allometric parameter that relates . To determine
    the effective diameter, they used the calculation of the average square diameter,
    taking into account a reference frame in the soil and the number of plants that
    are within this frame, finding polynomial equations. They obtained economic and
    precise estimates, with errors of 2.1% with respect to the crop coefficient and
    less than 9% for root depth. The model needs to be calibrated with the crop and
    soil types and climatic conditions (González-Esquiva et al., 2017a). For image
    processing, they used a low-cost image acquisition device (González-Esquiva et
    al., 2017b) or a smartphone app (Hernández-Hernández et al., 2017), also allowing
    information processing through the Web (González-Esquiva et al., 2017c). Remote
    sensing tools have also been used for irrigation scheduling with different spatial
    resolutions acquired from satellites, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and ground
    equipment (Alvino and Marino, 2017). In their research Jarchow et al. (2017) used
    the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), product MOD13Q1, of the Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), highlighting the robustness of this index with respect
    to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). They determined the crop
    coefficient as a function of the vegetation index (VI), so that , where is determined
    using meteorological data and calibration using lysimeters or hydric balance studies.
    They obtained results that allow defining a directly proportional relationship
    between the LAI and the VI (Jarchow et al., 2017). Additionally, in 2017, Li and
    colleagues, used the spatial–temporal fusion technique with MODIS and ASTER (Advanced
    Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) images, obtaining daily
    evapotranspiration with of spatial resolution (Li et al., 2017). They installed
    a weather station, soil moisture and temperature sensors, with measurements of
    the LAI and the vegetation cover fraction at each site. It is worth mentioning
    that there were difficulties in obtaining evapotranspiration due to the temporary
    resolution of data acquired from the satellites. This can be solved using multiple
    sources of spectral information, especially data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2
    satellites. In Marshall et al. (2016), a study was reported with different narrow
    and wide band indices, with the purpose of dividing evapotranspiration between
    soil evaporation and crop transpiration. They found that to determine the crop
    transpiration, can be used to estimate the total in addition to the Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, they proposed two derived
    indices from the infrared (743 and 953 nm), blue (428 nm) and short-wave infrared
    (1518 nm) bands. Finally, in Malamos et al. (2015) an application was developed
    in a GIS (Geographic Information System) with Python in ESRI’s ArcMAp software,
    for the determination of monthly evapotranspiration, using the Penman-Monteith
    equation and data acquired from a weather station. The information was displayed
    on vector color maps, using crop coefficient data. Table 2 summarizes the main
    methods and variables measured to estimate or calculate parameters based on the
    weather conditions and useful for prescribing water amounts in irrigation systems.

    based on soil data Soil moisture sensors (SMS) are used to determine the amount
    of water that is available for the plants and its temporal dynamics (Mrinmayi
    et al., 2016). Methods to measure the soil moisture content are direct and indirect
    (Li et al., 2012a, Li et al., 2012b). Gravimetric and volumetric methods are directly
    obtained in the laboratory. The gravimetric method uses the mass as principal
    component, as shown in Eq. (3). (3) Volumetric water content (VWC) uses volumes
    as principal component, as in Eq. (4). (4) Gravimetric and volumetric water contents
    are related using Eq. (5). (5) where is the water density and is the dry soil
    bulk density. Indirect methods use physical variables that are related with the
    volumetric water content (VWC) or the soil moisture tension (SMT). Strategies
    using VWC are dielectric methods and the neutron moderation method. The soil dielectric
    constant constituents (water, air and solid particles), changes dramatically with
    the increment of water content. The dielectric constant of soil particles varies
    between two and seven, while those of air and water are of one and 80, respectively.
    The volumetric water content (VWC) can be associated with the soil dielectric
    permittivity in a frequency range between and (Sample et al., 2016). Some examples
    of VWC methods are capacitance (Harris and Stonard, 2018), timed domain reflectometry
    (TDR) (Chandler et al., 2004), frequency domain reflectometry (Xu et al., 2012),
    amplitude domain reflectometry (Moroizumi and Sasaki, 2008), time domain transmission
    (Masbruch and Ferré, 2003), microwave methods (Liu et al., 2012), ground penetrating
    radar (Gerhards et al., 2008), X-ray tomography (Weller et al., 2018) and nuclear
    magnetic resonance (Pohlmeier et al., 2008). Examples of SMT techniques are the
    tensiometer (Bhatt et al., 2016), resistance block (Keyhani, 2001), granular matrix
    (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2010), heat dissipation (Flint et al., 2002) and
    the psychrometer (Mullins et al., 2000). VWC methods are fast in response concerning
    SMT methods and its measurements are almost instantaneous. In mineral soils, the
    accuracy of the VWC, especially the TDR, is good and can be improved by the calibration
    of each soil. Calibration is essential for soils with a lot of organic content.
    In saline soils, significant energy losses limit the usefulness of the VWC methods.
    VWC methods use soil dielectric properties that are associated with the water
    available in the soil, however, SMT systems measure the tension related to the
    stress experienced by plant tissues (Shock and Wang, 2011). When there are water
    needs in the aboveground plant parts, a tension is transmitted to the roots for
    extracting more water from the soil. For this reason, irrigation scheduling based
    on SMT can be associated with the crop performance. A granular matrix sensor provides
    an indirect measurement of SMT, using the resistive value between two electrodes
    placed into a granular matrix container (Larson, 1985). Granular matrix sensors
    have advantages of low cost in comparison with the VWC sensors, no maintenance,
    and adaptability to widely variable wiring lengths. They can use manual or automatic
    systems to obtain the measurements, especially with the use of data loggers. Granular
    matrix sensors are useful on most of soil types and site-specific calibration
    is usually not required unlike the VWC that requires calibration according to
    the soil type. Sensor responsiveness is fairly rapid from 10 to 80 kPa, with a
    useful range extend to 200 kPa with appropriate calibration (Shock and Wang, 2011).
    These sensors are not repairable and temperature compensation is used in the calibration
    equations in meters and data loggers to improve the accuracy of SWT estimations
    (Shock et al., 2003). According to Adeyemi et al. (2017), electrical conductivity,
    soil texture, bulk density and temperature influence the accuracy of the measurements.
    For this reason, it is important to consider the specific conditions of the site
    where the technology will be implemented, in order to perform the respective calibrations.
    In resistance blocks techniques, the ground temperature, the probes length, among
    other factors, affect the measurement. To correct the temperature problem, compensation
    strategies have been developed (Oates et al., 2015). The measurements of soil
    moisture in the field is quick and easy with sensors, but they are very sensitive
    to installation procedures, because the influence of the sourronding material
    and air spaces between sensors and the soil can affect the measurement. Calibration
    must be carried out very carefully for each probe and each soil, in order to obtain
    accurate water content data. Microwaves, in a wavelength range between 50 and
    500 mm, are particularly effective for measuring the soil moisture of a surface.
    This occurs because they have minimal atmospheric attenuation and there is a large
    difference between the dielectric constants of water and dry soil, which results
    in a high sensitivity and accuracy in the lecture of the soil water content. In
    microwave methods, the principal parameter to estimate is the backscatter coefficient
    , which is the difference between the emitted and the reflected energy of the
    microwave radiation measured in dB, which depends on the dielectric constant of
    the soil. The spectral bands considered as the most sensitive to soil moisture
    are L , C and X (Karthikeyan et al., 2017). In the active microwave (radar) technique,
    an artificial radiation source or emitter is used, and the intensity of the radiation
    reflected by the ground is measured. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a technology
    used to determine soil moisture using microwave wavelengths. Sensors of the projects
    RADARSAT, ENVISAT, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 satellite systems can be used for
    soil moisture measurement. The models to determine the soil moisture content using
    microwave data on satellite platforms can be theoretical, semiempirical and empirical.
    Theoretical models include the Kirchhoff approach, small disturbance model, small
    slope model, microwave dispersion in the canopy, integral equation method, and
    the advanced integral equation model. These models are useful only in certain
    conditions. Semi-empirical models can be applied at any location where the site
    conditions are within the prescribed limits of the models. The most important
    ones are the Oh and the Dubois models. In empirical models, field data is used
    to correlate with the data of , therefore, excellent quality is required in field
    measurements, with calibration for each site (Karthikeyan et al., 2017). Water-Cloud
    is a semi-empirical model for determining soil moisture using microwave wavelengths
    on zones with vegetation. In this model, vegetation and soil contributions are
    taken into account in the backscatter coefficient according to the Eq. (6). (6)
    In addition to soil moisture measurements using microwaves, the soil roughness
    and the vegetation are two important factors that influence the emissivity and
    reflectivity of the soil. Although these factors can be taken into account in
    relatively simple linear regression models, which incorporate an empirical roughness
    parameter and the moisture content of the vegetation, they reduce the sensitivity
    of the method as they increase the emissivity related to background noise. 3.1.3.
    Data acquisition methods for irrigation based on the plant measurements There
    are sensors that measure parameters associated with the definition of water requirements
    that are in direct contact with the plants. Examples of these technologies are
    the dendrometer (Van der Maaten et al., 2016), the xylem cavitation sensor (Nolf
    et al., 2015), the sap flow sensors (Poblete-Echeverría and Ortega-Farias, 2013),
    tissue condition sensors (Jones, 2004) and stomatal conductance sensors (Grashey-Jansen,
    2014). Additionally, there are data acquisition systems that use remote sensors,
    specially crop canopy temperature systems (CCT). The use of indices and threshold
    calculations are the most used methods to define irrigation requirements using
    CCT. The indices are operations between measurements of parameters in the environment
    and in the crop canopy temperature. The fundamental principle of these systems
    is based on the changes of the radiation emission in the spectral band of the
    long-wave infrared (LWIR), when the plants show wilting symptoms, which is manifested
    in the canopy temperature. For the use of these indices, it is important to take
    into account the variations in canopy temperature measurements due to fluctuations
    or changes in meteorological conditions at the moment of the acquisition. Due
    to this behavior, the indices cannot be considered as an absolute indicator of
    water stress. Several researches have been developed to find operations or indexes
    that can describe the relationships of water stress and thermal behavior of plants
    (Alvino and Marino, 2017). One of the most studied indices is the Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI) (Jackson et al., 1981). According to the conditions of relative humidity
    and air temperature, this index uses the quantification of the crop behavior when
    it is and when it is not transpiring. There are several equations used in the
    literature to determine the CWSI index. In López-López et al. (2011), it is defined
    as the Eq. (7). (7) where is the evapotranspiration of the real crop and is the
    reference evapotranspiration. Alpaydin (2012) defines CWSI according to Eq. (8),
    where they use infrared thermometers or thermal images to determine the crop canopy
    temperature, using other environmental parameters, such as solar radiation, speed
    of wind, air humidity and air temperature. The canopy and air temperature difference
    is normalized to the lower and upper limits of the same difference; where means
    measured data, is a lower baseline (unstressed crop) and indicates an upper limit
    (completely stressed crop). (8) In King and Shellie (2016), the CWSI index is
    defined as the Eq. (9). (9) where , and , are the current canopy temperature,
    when the crop is not stressed (well watered) and when the crop is severely stressed
    due to the low availability of water in the soil, respectively. To normalize CWSI
    values according to the effects of environmental conditions (radiation, air temperature,
    wind speed, relative humidity, etc.), the temperatures and are used as the lower
    and upper baselines. The CWSI index and its modifications have been used in grape
    crops (Agam et al., 2013), almond (Rojo et al., 2016), cotton (Colaizzi et al.,
    2003), watermelon (Orta et al., 2003), peach (Bellvert et al., 2016), pepper (Sezen
    et al., 2014), olive (Agam et al., 2013), apple (Osroosh et al., 2016a, Osroosh
    et al., 2016b) and corn (Mangus et al., 2016). In investigations reported in Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2013, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2015, remotely piloted aircrafts were used
    to derive the CWSI, with high-resolution thermal images. Through this procedure
    they assessed the spatial variability of the crop water status, achieving the
    change of irrigation management from conventional to a variable rate application
    system. In these researches, the potentiality of this index for the irrigation
    management in agricultural crops is evidenced. In Kullberg et al. (2017), a comparison
    and evaluation of water stress coefficients is made for the determination of crop
    evapotranspiration. They studied some indices that only use crop canopy temperature
    measurements, such as the Canopy temperature index (Tc), Degrees Above Non-Stressed
    index (DANS) and Degrees Above the Canopy Threshold index (DACT). These indices
    have the same potential to be used in irrigation scheduling, compared to those
    that use more information like the (CWSI). The second method used estimates the
    temperature and time threshold (TTT) (Peters and Evett, 2007). It uses the so-called
    Biologically Identified Optimal Temperature Interactive Console (BIOTIC). The
    activation of an irrigation signal occurs when the accumulated time, in which
    the canopy temperature exceeds a specific temperature threshold, also exceeds
    a time threshold that has been calibrated locally. The temperature threshold for
    a crop is based on physiological parameters. The time threshold is defined using
    an energy balance model based on local climatic data (Wanjura et al., 2004). In
    Evett et al. (2006), the application of the TTT method in agricultural irrigation
    is described, highlighting its potential as an automatic control response method
    that does not require additional temperature data for irrigation activation. In
    their study, they established the TTT method as a useful methodology to regulate
    the efficiency of water use. In O’Shaughnessy et al. (2006), they studied the
    use of soil moisture measurements, two thermal indexes and irrigation programming.
    The TTT algorithm obtained a reduction in the volumes of water applied, without
    affecting the crop yield negatively. In O’Shaughnessy et al. (2012) an integration
    is made between the CWSI index and the TTT procedure, with a threshold in CWSI
    and a threshold in time, called CWSI-TT. However, in this study they highlight
    the existence of possible false positives in some periods and results similar
    to irrigation programming using a neutron probe. DeJonge et al. (2015) recommend
    the specification of the DACT parameter as an appropriate index to quantify water
    stress in corn, since it requires a single measurement of canopy temperature.
    Kullberg et al. (2017) compared four protocol methods in thermal remote sensing
    indices to estimate the evapotranspiration coefficients of the crops: CWSI, DANS,
    DACT and Tc ratio. They observed that the DANS and DACT thermal indices responded
    to the plant water stress, which is comparable to more data intensive methods
    such as CWSI. Table 3 summarizes the main methods and variables associated with
    the definition of water requirements that are in direct contact with the plants.
    Table 4 shows the remote sensing methods for defining irrigation scheduling using
    remote sensing technologies (Ihuoma and Madramootoo, 2017). Table 3. Summary of
    acquisition methods used in irrigation systems based on plant-based approaches.

    systems for crop irrigation management In general, plant, soil and atmosphere
    monitoring approaches for defining irrigation prescriptions have been studied
    in the bibliography. Usually, these methods are used independently, but an analysis
    of the data obtained with each technology could suggest the use of mixing sensing
    strategies. For example, plant monitoring strategies are very useful for defining
    when the plant is stressed, but useless to define the irrigation rate and times.
    For this reason, it is important the use of plant strategies with another method
    for determining irrigation prescriptions. Weather measurements are useful to define
    the reference evapotranspiration, but if this value is not used in a soil water
    balance equation, there are troubles in the definition of the quantity of water
    to apply. Measuring automatically the amount of inputs and outputs of water in
    the crop using weather parameters has some challenges that are supplied with the
    use of soil moisture sensors for defining soil water depletion, rain gauges for
    defining water amounts that are supplied by precipitations, and other technologies
    for determining crop coefficients and the root depth in the plants. An important
    aspect of atmosphere monitoring approaches is that the heterogeneity in the irrigation
    system or the crop are not accounted (Jones, 2006). Soil moisture sensors are
    useful to measure irrigation times and rates, obtaining the depletion percentage
    with respect to the total available water in the soil (FC-PWP), and when to stop
    the irrigation activity with the use of soil sensors at different depths. Soil
    sensors take no account of evaporative demand, so they cannot indicate plant stress.
    Additionally, soil sensors have the disadvantage that they are punctual measurements
    that in some cases are not representative for a full field. Mixing irrigation
    sensing strategies could improve the automatic definition and control of irrigation
    scheduling in an intelligent agent. An intelligent agent could use the plant sensors
    for defining when the plants are stressed (start irrigation time), or atmosphere
    and soil monitoring approaches to define the amount of water to apply based on
    the water balance equation (rate and time), and the soil sensors could also be
    used to define the time to finish irrigation applications (stop irrigation time).
    In addition, the definition of several irrigation prescriptions using different
    sensor strategies could be used in the reasoning system for determining the prescription
    performance in the future for each strategy and evaluating the water use efficiency,
    using some crop model software. The agent could select the best option according
    to the future predictions and apply the irrigation amounts using this information.
    In Osroosh et al., (2016), several irrigation scheduling algorithms were studied:
    TTT, CWSI, soil moisture sensors, evapotranspiration, soil water balance, a combination
    of soil sensors and water balance and conventional management, using a neutron
    probe as a reference point. This research highlights the successful functioning
    of climate and plant methods to supply enough water to plants and avoid water
    stress. The prescriptions using only soil moisture measurements failed in the
    water supply, presenting water stress and non-uniform plant growth. In addition,
    they explain that the feedback of measures in the plant presents excellent results
    in irrigation scheduling. In Alexakis et al. (2017), a research reported the data
    fusion of passive sensors (Landsat 8, NDVI and Temperature), active sensors (Sentinel
    1, Vertical (VV), C band) and field sensors, for the determination of the state
    of soil water. For the model determination, they used artificial neural networks,
    where the selected parameters were the backscatter coefficient , NDVI (vegetation
    and roughness), incidence angle (topography) and thermal infrared temperature
    (TIR) (water content). They found that the incidence angle is the least sensitive
    parameter, while the NDVI is the most sensitive to the precise estimation of soil
    moisture content. Fig. 3 shows some sensors used to determine irrigation needs
    in agricultural crops. The classification of sensors for scheduling irrigation
    using parameters based on the environment, soil and plants is highlighted. It
    also highlights the use of remote sensors in the definition of irrigation and
    the use of the visible, infrared and microwave electromagnetic spectrum. Download

    Selection of some sensors used for irrigation programming. 3.2. Decision support
    systems for irrigation management The use of Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICTs) in agriculture requires the acquisition and analysis of data from sensors
    using specialized software. Additionally, this software has to make decisions
    and in some cases control input applications on the field. In water resource management,
    this means that the software has to decide when to irrigate and how much water
    to apply. These systems should consider the water quality, crop type, plants phenology,
    irrigation system, soil electrical conductivity (EC), drainage, nutrients required
    by the plants, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, rain, soil moisture, evapotranspiration,
    relative humidity and temperature, among others (Rodriguez-Ortega et al., 2017).
    A useful tool to obtain better performance in irrigation activities is a Decision
    Support System (DSS), that estimates if some process (irrigation) is required
    or not, and the water amount that is needed (Isern et al., 2012). A DSS is a computer
    system that help decision makers choose between alternatives, through the application
    of knowledge about the decision domain (Kukar et al., 2019). It incorporates an
    explicit decision procedure based on a set of theoretical principles that represents
    its rationality (Aulinas et al., 2009). It can be used for structured and unstructured
    decisions and cannot replace the decision maker itself because DSSs do not possess
    the human decision-making abilities as imagination, creativity or intuition. The
    DSSs can be classified in data-centric (information) or model-centric (simulations
    and optimization modeling) (Kozisek and Hanzlík, 2014). Data-centric DSS or data-oriented
    DSS refer to an architecture where data is the primary and permanent asset, emphasizing
    on the access to and manipulation of current and historical data (time-series)
    to support decision tasks (Power, 2008). Centric or driven DSS emphasize on access
    to and manipulation of algebraic, decision analytic and financial, simulation
    and optimization models to provide decision support. Models in a model-driven
    DSS should provide a simplified representation of a situation that is understandable
    to a decision maker. Additionally, model-driven DSS uses data and parameters provided
    by users to support decision makers in analyzing a situation, but they are not
    necessarily data-intensive (Power and Sharda, 2007). Environmental systems tend
    to comprise complex interactions among biological, ecological, climatic, social,
    physical and chemical processes. These systems may be difficult to represent,
    model and understand, causing considerable uncertainty (Heslinga et al., 2017).
    The effort to integrate new tools to deal with more complex systems has led to
    the development of the Environmental Decision Support Systems (EDSSs) (Papathanasiou
    and Kenward, 2014). Additionally, Intelligent Environmental Decision Support Systems
    (IEDSSs) are systems that use a combination of models, analytical techniques and
    information retrieval to help develop and evaluate alternatives, based on traditional
    AI approaches (Sànchez-Marrè, 2014). The classification of some DSSs used in irrigation
    is presented in Table 5. The group in the first column uses plant, soil and climate
    data to determine water requirements. Some of them use crop models to estimate
    plant phenology, quantify Water Use Efficiency (WUE) and yield, evaluate and compare
    irrigation application models, compare simulated and real data and save time in
    determining plants responses without real crops in the field. In the second group
    are useful systems for water management in irrigation districts. Finally, the
    DSSs in the third group are used to decide how to install irrigation infrastructure
    on the field. Table 5. Decision Support Systems applied to irrigation. Irrigation

    Regarding the use of AquaCrop, in Xiang et al. (2013) they simulated wheat yield
    under conditions of different irrigation scenarios, comparing the model with experimental
    data. The model in this study accurately estimated the soil water content of the
    radical zone, as well as biomass and wheat grain yields. In Xiang et al. (2013),
    they used AquaCrop to predict responses in cotton under drip irrigation. They
    determined the irrigation prescription taking into account parameters related
    with water in the soil and salinity. They compared data obtained in simulation
    of the canopy cover, root water storage and aerial biomass with field data, obtaining
    coefficients of determination and indices of agreement , with underestimation
    of yield. They concluded that AquaCrop can be used as a reliable tool to predict
    cotton growth response with respect to irrigation application. The authors in
    Ran et al. (2018) perform the parameterization of AquaPro for the corn cultivation
    according to the conditions of the northwest region of China. The model variables
    used in parameterization were canopy coverage, aerial biomass, yield and water
    content in the soil. The default AquaCrop model, the new parameterized model and
    field data were compared, obtaining better results with the parameterized model.
    According to these results, the need to calibrate the model to conditions of the
    application site is established. In Jiang et al. (2016), they used the Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnological Transfer (DSSAT) in an irrigation district
    located in northwestern China, to explore irrigation strategies that would reduce
    water consumption and maintain yields, under different climatic conditions. The
    model was first calibrated based on crop yield, phenological phases and soil water
    content data. Subsequently they used the calibrated model to simulate the effects
    of planting dates and different irrigation treatments on corn yield, calculating
    the amount of potentially reduced water. The work reported by Ovando et al. (2018)
    highlights the use of DSSAT to simulate the development and yield in soybean cultivation.
    They used the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the Tropical
    Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), providing spatial and temporal information
    on solar radiation and precipitation, respectively. This study evaluated and quantified
    the uncertainty in the estimation of soybean yield using a DSSAT model, when the
    recorded meteorological data is replaced by CERES and TRMM, finding that this
    satellite information can be used for the estimation of soybean yield. Finally,
    in Winter et al. (2017) the development of a model based on the Water Evaluation
    and Planning System (WEAP) and the DSSAT, to link water supplies and Regional
    management with the demand for water at the field level and the growth of crops.
    WEAP-DSSAT was deployed and evaluated in Yolo County in California for corn, rice
    and wheat crops. WEAP-DSSAT was able to reproduce the results of DSSAT under conditions
    of good irrigation and reasonably simulate the average yields observed. The system
    is useful for determining future yields under limited water availability, irrigation
    optimization and strategies to increase drought resilience. 3.3. Artificial intelligence
    in agents: data interpretation and attributes–functions capabilities The implementation
    of AI in DSSs is used in the study on rational use of water resources to interpret
    and analyze information acquired from sensors in field, and making water resources
    planning more scientific and accurate (Chen and Liu, 2010). AI was born in 1950s,
    which aims were how to use a machine to simulate the intelligent behaviors of
    human beings (Chen and Liu, 2010). For a machine to exhibit intelligence, it has
    to interpret and analyze the input and result data in a problem, instead to simply
    following the instructions of a software algorithm. Artificial intelligence according
    to Adeyemi et al. (2017), has the potential to solve complex and nonlinear problems,
    such as precision irrigation. These techniques applied in irrigation are based
    on the determination of parameters related with crop evapotranspiration, crop
    water stress or soil water content. The algorithms of AI, allow to emulate the
    human process of decision making for the management of different problems and
    has been used in the support of adaptive irrigation decisions. Some techniques
    and fields of AI used in irrigation are machine learning (Bustos and Ricardo,
    2005, Kaur, 2016), knowledge engineering (Rafea et al., 2003), fuzzy logic (Gao
    et al., 2013, Zhang and Guo, 2018), artificial neural networks (Adamala, 2018,
    Shabani et al., 2017), case-based reasoning (Li and Yeh, 2004), expert systems
    (Fedra, 1994), bayesian networks or probabilistic networks (Castelletti and Soncini-Sessa,
    2007), artificial life (Dessalegne and Nicklow, 2012), evolutionary computing
    (Ranjithan, 2005), genetic algorithms (Wardlaw and Bhaktikul, 2004), evolutionary
    strategies (Reddy and Kumar, 2008), evolutionary programming (Pant et al., 2010),
    artificial neurogenetic networks (Perea et al., 2015), support vector machines
    (Gill et al., 2006), data mining or Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) (Li
    et al., 2012a, Khan et al., 2012), optimization algorithms (Alsukni et al., 2019,
    Nguyen et al., 2017) and Agent Based Modeling (ABM) - distributed artificial intelligence
    (Le Bars et al., 2002, Wanyama and Far, 2017). Among all of these, the most widely
    used and constantly applied method for irrigation research purposes are the Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN), based on the inter linked neural networks in the human
    brain and its electric signals. ANN can identify and learn about the relationships
    between data acquired by sensors and the corresponding outputs, useful in modeling
    when the underlying data relationship is not well defined. The models for irrigation
    scheduling are generally developed and trained using a large historical database
    that would influence the amount of water required by crops. Once built, the models
    are used on real time data, to define the irrigation prescription necessary to
    sustain the crop’s healthy growth (Krupakar et al., 2016). The ANNs are useful
    in supporting decisions in irrigation management, due to the complexity of the
    water application to crops, their adaptive nature and learning capacity. In Karasekreter
    et al. (2013), the development of an ANN for irrigation scheduling in a strawberry
    crop is presented using soil moisture and its physical properties. As shown in
    their results, water savings of 20.5% and energy savings of 23.9% were achieved.
    They emphasized that the ANNs require large amounts of data for training, whichmakes
    them limiting in their use for real-time decision support. In Feng et al., 2017a,
    Feng et al., 2017b, two models of ANN were developed for the estimation with only
    temperature values, with results of relative average quadratic error lower than
    0.198 and average absolute error lower than . The results show the excellent models
    capabilities to estimate . In Abdullah and Malek (2016), they analyzed the application
    of ANNs for the determination using weather stations, showing its greater efficiency
    with respect to traditional methods that use the Penman-Monteith equation. Common
    ANN models, do not have the ability to predict in time series forecasting (Jimenez
    et al., 2019). A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is a deep learning technique
    useful in dynamic modelling tasks (Kumar, 2018). Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    network is an extension of RNN with successful application in nonlinear dynamic
    systems (Gonzalez and Yu, 2018). The LSTM have been used in modelling sequential
    data of VWC using remote sensing (Lu et al., 2015), prediction of water table
    depth (Zhang et al., 2018) and VWC based on the past soil moisture, precipitation,
    and climate measurements (Adeyemi et al., 2018). Fuzzy logic (FL) is an AI algorithm
    useful for modeling processes and supporting decisions, based in human experience.
    The FL uses membership sets and rules formulated by an expert (Mousa et al., 2014).
    This tool is used in the modeling of nonlinear systems and their fundamental axis
    is the common sense of language. In Patil and Desai, 2013, they used a FL system
    with moisture, weather and soil moisture data, as model inputs, to implement irrigation
    programming decisions. The system maintained soil moisture in the specified range
    of the algorithm. Additionally, in Mousa et al. (2014), they successfully applied
    a FL model in irrigation scheduling for sprinkler and drip systems, with crop
    phenology, soil moisture and evapotranspiration data. In Giusti and Marsili-Libelli
    (2015), the authors describe the development of an adaptive irrigation DSS, implemented
    with FL. The system used an inference system and a predictive model to keep soil
    moisture in an acceptable range. The system reacts to rain activity, achieving
    water savings of 13.55% in simulation. Several AI strategies can be used together.
    For example, in Tsang and Jim (2016), they developed an artificial intelligence
    model for irrigation application based on ANN and FL. Their results showed that
    the model developed reduced water consumption in the crop by 20%. Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSN) and FL have been used for irrigation management (Gao et al., 2013,
    Hamouda, 2017, Viani et al., 2017). They used input parameters as soil type, temperature,
    water depletion in the soil and crop growth. FL rules and linguistic values for
    inputs and outputs were selected with the help of agricultural experts, including
    farmers. These studies seek to reduce water waste and maximize crop yield according
    to the weather conditions and real water needs. In Viani et al. (2017), they obtained
    savings of up to 59.6% in simulation and 29.5% experimentally. According to Table
    6, there are artificial intelligence applications in irrigation scheduling that
    use algorithms based on data or models. Depending on the study, ANNs have to use
    a large amount of data or manage the number of categorical attributes to reduce
    time processing and avoiding overfitting or underfitting. Fuzzy Logic strategies
    use the experience of farmers, agronomists and scientists for defining the membership
    functions and intervals useful in the scheduling of irrigation prescriptions.
    Several researches were developed for simulating artificial intelligence strategies
    in water management. But at the implementation stage, there are failures related
    to the lack of parameters or aspects that could improve its performance. Examples
    of those parameters can be soil characteristics such as infiltration, percolation,
    soil moisture, hydraulic conductivity, water retention curves, soil water balance
    equation, FC or PWP; plant characteristics such as rooth depth, crop coefficient
    or crop water stress; and environmental characteristics such as rain, energy balance
    equations and evapotranspiration. The use of more information allows the definition
    of irrigation rates and times with agronomic criteria instead of the simple aperture
    and closure of valves. Finally, in the implementation of artificial intelligence
    systems for the irrigation prescription, one of the crucial issues is the sensors
    calibration and the model calibration according to site specific criteria. Table

    3.4. Actuators and control in irrigation intelligent agents An automatic irrigation
    system can refill the water used by the plants in a specific time interval with
    an open-loop controller (OLC). In this type of control, no field measurements
    are used to modify the application and the decisions are taken based on heuristics,
    expert knowledge or a system model (Romero et al., 2012). The OLC presents some
    limitations that can be overcome by the use of feedback or closed-loop controllers
    (CLC). The CLCs use mathematical models and additional information such as (feed-forward
    control), changes in the VWC or plant-based measurements (feedback control) (Touati
    et al., 2012). The aim of irrigation controllers is to open and close the solenoid-valves
    (actuators) in order to apply water to every sector of the crop. Examples of irrigation
    controllers are explained in the following lines. • On-Off control. It consists
    on switching the controller output between a maximum and a minimum output according
    to a signal error. Applications of this controller in irrigation are using VWC
    (Boutraa et al., 2011), canopy temperature (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010), soil
    matric potential (Romero et al., 2008) and sap flow sensor (Fernández et al.,
    2008). • Proportional-Integral-Derivative control (PID). The control signal depends
    on the weighted sum of three terms: the error between the variable and the set-point,
    the integral of recent errors, and the rate by which the error has been changing.
    The PID control uses the measurements of a single variable (temperature, relative
    humidity, soil moisture or meteorological conditions) to compute the control action
    needed to be executed by an actuator. The output variable can be regulated at
    a desired set-point value. The application of a PID strategy has not yet been
    extensively considered in commercial irrigation controllers. An example using
    VWC is shown in (Romero, 2011). • Fuzzy logic control. Fuzzy logic interprets
    real uncertainties and becomes ideal for nonlinear, time-varying and heuristic
    knowledge to control a system. Examples using soil water content, air temperature
    and light intensity can be found in (Xiang, 2010), or using soil measurements
    (moisture and temperature) and solar radiation in (Touati et al., 2013), and with
    multi-agent architecture in (Salazar et al., 2013). • MPC (Model predictive control).
    There are few agricultural applications (mainly for regulating weather conditions
    in controlled environments, such as greenhouses) because it is difficult to obtain
    precise models that are appropriate for control purposes; however, it is a promising
    methodology for the design of irrigation controllers. An example using VWC is
    described in Romero (2011). • Non linear control. Nonlinear control theory focuses
    on systems that do not obey the superposition principle (linearity). These systems
    are often governed by non-linear differential equations. An example is in control
    for irrigation canals (Benayache et al., 2008). • Artificial neural networks.
    ANN are not really a class of controllers, but a modeling framework that can be
    used in advanced model-based controllers. Examples using soil water content are
    explained in (Capraro et al., 2008), Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) in
    (Hendrawan and Murase, 2011) and using ANN and FL in (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli,
    2015). • Commercial automatic controllers. These controllers apply irrigation
    when sensors detect that the measurements are below a certain predefined threshold
    until another predefined threshold is overcome (on–off control). Examples using
    soil water content are Acclima (Acclima, 2019), Watermark (Spectrum Technologies
    – Watermark, 2019), Rain bird (Rain Bird – ClimateMinder, 2019), Water Sense (Water
    Sense - Irrigation Controllers, 2019) and Irrinet (Irrinet Series Controllers,
    2019). In general, the actuators used to automatically dose irrigation in crops
    correspond to electromechanical systems (solenoid valves) that are controlled
    by electrical on–off signals or proportional continuous current signals. To ensure
    accuracy in the supply of water for irrigation, feedback control that provides
    proportional control signals is recommended. The control techniques reviewed can
    be used without complex problems in the implementation, since the response times
    of the crops are not critical. Additionally, the current digital systems such
    as microcontrollers or control cards support the peripherals and speed requirements
    that enables to implement any control action from on-off control, PID control
    and also more complex intelligent control algorithms such as diffuse or artifitial
    neural networks controllers. The simpler the controller, the better it is. In
    this sense, the PID or PI controller characteristics make it quite complete, such
    as simplicity, ease of implementation, excellent transient response in stable
    state, efficiency in performance, and finally the support, as it is the most popular
    controller used. 4. Multi-agent systems applied to water resource management Multi-Agent
    Systems (MAS) are groups of agents that cooperate and solve problems, while exchanging
    information between them (Byrski et al., 2015). In MAS, the role is the combination
    of responsibilities, functions and behaviors in each agent. A group of agents
    has different nature, interfaces and behaviors defined with the roles (Ye-ping
    and Sheng-ping, 2011). In MAS, agents can act asynchronously and in parallel,
    resulting in an overall increase in speed-up, efficiency, robustness, reliability,
    flexibility and re-usability (Leppanen et al., 2013). In addition, as explained
    by Coelho et al. (2017), the MAS are useful to improve the systems reliability
    through procedures of fault tolerance, autonomy, responsiveness, scalability and
    profitability in the detection, communication and control processes. As shown
    in Fig. 4, in MAS, there is no centralized control of the whole system, but information
    is distributed. Each agent is independent, with different roles and capabilities
    and have no ability to solve the main problem alone (Shamshirband and Zafari,
    2012). Additionally, MAS allow the coordination, cooperation and conflict resolution
    through negotiation, competition or consulting strategies (Jiang-Ping et al.,
    2013). Download : Download high-res image (176KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. General structure of a multiagent system for natural resources management.
    Researches on MAS, can be classified into Agent Based Modeling (ABM), Distributed
    Control (DC-MAS) and Intervention (I-MAS). In ABM, given the rules of the local
    agents, the aim is to find the collective behavior of the system, using analysis,
    modeling and simulation. In DC-MAS, given the desired collective behavior, the
    purpose is to design the rules of the agent that allow to find that desired behavior.
    In I-MAS, given the desired behavior, the aim is to control or intervene in the
    system without destroying the local system rules (Harmouch et al., 2016). The
    ABM can model the explicit connection between the micro and the macro levels of
    a phenomenon or system (Grashey-Jansen, 2014), infer and make-decisions based
    on expert knowledge, perform statistical and predictive analysis, and make decisions
    through cooperation in agent networks (Ye-ping and Sheng-ping, 2011). In this
    approach, systems are represented as collections of autonomous decision-making
    entities or agents (Li et al., 2013). Emergence is the unexpected behavior of
    agents in the execution time, which were not observed in their requirement and
    design specification. The ABM captures emergent phenomena and provides a natural
    description of the system. The ability of ABM to deal with emergent phenomena
    is the main driving force behind its success as a modelling tool of complex adaptive
    systems. The ABM has introduced a group of technologies in the field of IEDSS,
    giving support to the management of environmental problems, mainly of those concerning
    the management of renewable resources (Jiang et al., 2013). Multi-agent distributed
    control systems are spatially distributed systems consisting of a number of interacting
    agents. In DC-MAS, each agent can be considered as a control system and the control
    law of each agent can be designed using local information (Jiang et al., 2013).
    These networked MAS allow a high-level of abstraction of the system resources
    (Leppanen et al., 2013). Some applications of DC-MAS are dynamic tasks distribution
    between spacecrafts (Skobelev et al., 2016), adaptive planning of communication
    with nano-satellites (Belokonov et al., 2015), dynamic triage of victims in emergency
    scenarios (Mercadal et al., 2011) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) cooperative
    control (Han et al., 2013). Soft control is a novel method in I-MAS, whose central
    idea is to add one (or some) special agent(s) (called shill) into the original
    systems to guide it to the desired behavior, but without changing the local rules
    of the existing agents. The property of local interactions between agents makes
    that the influence of the shill spread out, thus adding shill agent(s) may control
    the behavior of the whole system (Harmouch et al., 2016). 4.1. MAS design methodologies
    and software The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) is a standard
    organization of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) computer
    society that promotes agent-based technology and the interoperability of its standards
    with other technologies. According to FIPA, the agent platform is the environment
    where an agent can live and perform its tasks. Each platform has four default
    agents: Agent Management System (AMS), Agent Directory Facilitator (DF), Agent
    Communication Channel (ACC) and an Agent Resource Broker (ARB). The AMS contains
    the identifier and states of all the agents that exist in the platform. The DF
    is the agent that provides the default yellow page service in the platform and
    the ARB is used to interface with non-agent software (Fig. 5). The message transport
    system (MTS) controls message exchanges between different agents (Harmouch et
    al., 2016). Coordination, Organization, Institutions and Norms (COIN), is an internationally
    well-known community in multi-agent systems that focuses on the research about
    organizational structures in MAS and their coordination patterns (Esmaeili et
    al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (122KB) Download : Download full-size

    novel abstractions and programming structures, where, classical methodologies
    are non suited. Thus, from the point of view of software engineering, novel and
    specific agent-oriented approaches and agent platforms have been developed (Harmouch
    et al., 2016). Some examples of methodologies used in MAS are: CoMoMas (Glaser,
    1996), Cassiopeia (Collinot et al., 1996), MASB (Moulin and Brassard, 1995), AOMEM
    (Kendall et al., 1995), CommonKADS (Iglesias et al., 1997), MaSE DeLoach (DeLoach,

    Agent Modeling Language (AML) is a semiformal visual modeling language for specifying,
    modeling and documenting systems that incorporate MAS. The AML language allows
    modeling roles and defining the behavioral aspect for the individual agents description
    and interactions between them (Belaqziz et al., 2011). AML incorporates and unifies
    the most significant concepts from the broadest set of existing multi-agent theories
    and abstract models such as Belief–Desire–Intentions (BDI) (Georgeff et al., 1998)
    and Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) (Montes and Goertzel, 2019)). It
    also includes modeling and specification languages, such as Unified Modeling Language
    (UML), Agent UML (AUML), Taming Agents and Objects (TAO), Agent-Object-Relationship
    (AOR), Object Constraint Language (OCL), OntologyWeb Language (OWL) and UML-Based
    ontology modelling for software agents. Finally, it integrates some methodologies,
    agent platforms and multi-agent driven applications (Trencansky and Cervenka,
    2005). 4.2. Multi-agent systems in irrigation and water management In the MAS-based
    collaborative decision systems for crop production management, the external participants
    of the system include user, expert and administrator. Two major types of agents
    participate in agricultural systems. The first type are resource agents, including
    data management agents and knowledge management agents. The second type are the
    decision-making support agents, including knowledge model agents, agents of growth
    simulation models, management agents and control agents (Ye-ping and Sheng-ping,
    2011). In (Farolfi et al., 2010), the authors describe some of the MAS applications
    in the field of intelligent DSSs for the management of environmental problems.
    The ABM has been used in the management of renewable resources, biodiversity,
    foresty, erosion and soil (Li et al., 2013). In agriculture and forestry, MAS
    have been applied to integrated pest management (Grovermann et al., 2017), agricultural
    robots simulation (Arguenon et al., 2006, Zhang and Noguchi, 2017), coordination
    and control system for harvesters (Ali et al., 2010), simulations to explore collaboration
    scenarios for plantations (Purnomo and Guizol, 2006), and research agricultural
    credit impacts on the farmer (Tolk et al., 2014) and sensor networks. Likewise,
    MAS applications have been developed in crop irrigation management such as crop
    modeling irrigation management (Bonté et al., 2005, Matthews, 2006), water management
    policies in irrigation systems (Farolfi et al., 2010, Perugini et al., 2008, Rege
    et al., 2015), resource negotiation processes (Thoyer et al., 2001, Janssen and
    Baggio, 2016), groundwater use modeling (Barthel et al., 2005, Al-Amin et al.,
    2015), simulation of large-scale irrigation models, watersheds, distribution,
    primarily by flood irrigation (Grashey-Jansen, 2014, Belaqziz et al., 2011, Belaqziz
    et al., 2013a, Belaqziz et al., 2013b, Guyennon et al., 2016), model of a garden-level
    sprinkler system (Isern et al., 2012), irrigation control simulation (Holloway-Phillips
    et al., 2008, Smith and Peng, 2009), emulation of irrigation water resource monitoring
    (Zhao et al., 2011) and MAS implementation for irrigation systems (Wanyama and
    Far, 2017, Salazar et al., 2013, De la Cruz et al., 2015, Villarrubia et al.,
    2017). Examples of developments in multi-agent systems applied to irrigation management
    are explained in the following lines. • Agent Based Modeling (ABM). It consists
    in a specialized software for deploying agents on a virtual environment. In some
    studies, agents are developed with roles, capabilities and proactive behaviour,
    while in others, agents are defined using some simple rules, with reactive behaviour,
    which can result in different sorts of complex and interesting group behavior
    when interacting with other agents. Belaqziz et al. (2011) presents the development
    of an ABM for decision management in gravity irrigation systems. Humans were represented
    using reactive agents. Agents used in the simulation were center of manager, stakeholder,
    operators and farmers. With this ABM, the number of irrigation rotation and quantities
    assigned for the irrigation was established, considering particularities of each
    field, including crop, soil and water needs. As sensing variables, they used the
    SAtelliteMonitoring of IRrigation model (SAMIR), based on the FAO-56 method for
    obtaining crop evapotranspiration. For the SAMIR model, they used water balance,
    land use, phenology, pedology, water stress coefficients, reference evapotranspiration,
    rain and irrigation parameters. The data was collected on-field by weather stations
    and satellite images, especially NDVI images. Later, Belaqziz, Khabba et al. (2013)
    explained the Irrigation Priority Index (IPR) model, calculated for each field
    studied and based on the water stress coefficient (adjustment parameter of ) and
    irrigation times. Then, Belaqziz, El Fazziki et al. (2013) integrated the IPR
    model with the ABM. Finally, Belaqziz et al. (2016) present the results of a simulation
    for water negotiation in irrigation with limited availability of water resources.
    In this ABM simulation, they employed reactive and cognitive agents for the definition
    of flood irrigation strategies. The resource negotiation process used the Contract-Net
    protocol, which employs the auction between manager and contractors in business.
    At the beginning of the agricultural season, the irrigation managers agents negotiate
    with the farmers the irrigation season planning. In Holloway-Phillips et al.,
    2008, Smith and Peng, 2009, the development of a machine learning strategy for
    soil texture classification, based on the soil water retention curve is explained.
    The system was used in a MAS, where agents were systems that sense SMT at three
    depths, relative humidity and ambient temperature, in a network of seventy nodes.
    The system also measured data from a weather station, to collectively determine
    irrigation requirements. With the MAS implemented in Netlogo, each sector in the
    field was represented by three buckets or soil agents. • Distributed Control (DC-MAS)
    - Simulation. The control signals in the simulations depend on the interaction
    of multiple agents. These systems use data of some variables (temperature, relative
    humidity, soil moisture or meteorological conditions) and decide the irrigation
    application on the field. For example, Isern et al., (2012) present results about
    the development of a MAS simulation for a sprinkler irrigation system in a garden
    using some real entities involved in the irrigation of a field. In this approach,
    a controller agent monitors the simulation and returns the result to the user.
    A zone agent represents a field region and its sprinklers, which are also represented
    as sprinkler agents. An irrigation controller (irrigation agent) acts as facilitator
    between the sprinklers and the fertilization agents. Finally, the current soil
    moisture, the initial humidity and the irrigation applied are defined as the plant
    agent. The system was useful for evaluating different irrigation applications,
    using plant type, plant humidity, soil moisture, fertilization and water pressure
    parameters. However, the simulation of this DC-MAS system, as in other studies
    for irrigation management, has some weakness due to the use of assumptions that
    need tuning with agronomic concepts. • Distributed Control (DC-MAS) - Implementation.
    Implementing DC-MAS in irrigation applications has several challenges associated
    with the non-linearities and complexity of the variables associated with this
    application. Calibration of sensors and models with site-specific aspects have
    some difficulties that can be solved using protocols and methodologies identified
    in the research bibliography. For example, Salazar et al. (2013) describe the
    development of a MAS prototype consisting of a master agent, a control agent and
    a field agent for irrigation management. Field data was sent through an embedded
    system to a computer with serial communication. After receiving the data, it was
    processed by the intelligent agents installed in the MAS architecture implemented
    in JADE, based on FIPA standards. To determine the activation of solenoid valves,
    the MAS used reasoning mechanisms based on FL. In addition, the authors highlight
    the importance of using site-specific information, such as crop type and soil
    characteristics to determine irrigation requirements, but they specify neither
    calibration nor validation protocols. Additionally, in De la Cruz et al., (2015a)
    and De la Cruz et al. (2015b), the authors present a drip irrigation system based
    on distributed control, developed to obtain water application accuracy and water
    savings. The technique used was based on the replicator dynamics for soil moisture
    control in multiple zones. They used precipitation, ambient temperature and soil
    moisture data, in addition to an actuator node and a controller, for four fields
    located consecutively. They got water savings of 51.70% compared to manual control
    and 32.20% versus ON-OFF control. In this research, they used calibration protocols
    for sensors and agronomic criteria for defining the amount and time of irrigation
    in the field. • Internet of Things and Multiagent Systems (IoT-MAS). Internet
    of things is a revolutionary area of research in the last years and it is included
    in MAS applications. Villarrubia et al. (2017) show the development of a system
    that combines MAS and WSN to monitor crop irrigation. They used the Platform for
    Automatic co-Construction of orGanizations of intElligent Agents (PANGEA) and
    fuzzy logic. The acquisition hardware consisted in the open hardware platform
    Open Garden (OG), for the collection of useful data for agricultural management.
    Their work highlights the use of agent models in devices with reduced computing
    capabilities and monitoring-controlling irrigation applications through a monitor
    or display. These developments are of critical importance, especially in the implementation
    of IoT-MAS applications in irrigation management, using the virtualization of
    farm entities. This application is specified for a single field and there are
    no calibration and validation procedures. The other constraint in this approach
    is that they use single entities as agents, such as light-agent, temp-agent, humidity-agent,
    electrovalves-agent, oxygen-agent, moisture-agent, water-agent and organization-agent.
    In that research, this system is considered as a MAS with the interaction of multiple
    agents, but in terms of the definition of an agent, there is only one agent that
    acquires information from the environment and acts using a solenoid valve as the
    actuator. For the scalability of this system for hundreds of fields, there would
    be a problem with the number of agents that will be incorporated in the MAS. 5.
    MAS in irrigation scheduling. Considerations and opportunities The principal findings
    of this research are described in the following paragraphs: • In precision irrigation,
    the accuracy in the measurement of soil, crop and environment parameters is very
    important to improve irrigation prescriptions on the field. A careful design of
    these sensing systems and their corresponding calibration are crucial for the
    sustainable management of water resources, which involves the application of water
    to the crop at the right time, with the right amount, on the right place and in
    the right manner, to meet specific plant water demands, while avoiding excessive
    or insufficient irrigation. • The variability management is the principal justification
    for applying precision irrigation. For the management of that variability, it
    is important to define irrigation management zones and place at least one soil
    moisture or plant sensor per zone, which could be limited by cost. • The combination
    of multiple sensors deployed on the field that capture the spatial variability
    of the soil, weather and plant irrigation parameters is therefore likely to yield
    the most robust and accurate solution for precision irrigation (Adeyemi et al.,
    2017). • Artificial intelligence, especially the intelligent agent concept, appears
    as a strategy to improve sustainability in precision irrigation. The conception
    of agents for irrigation tasks are useful to integrate input variables, decision
    support systems and actuation devices on the environment, that is, the agricultural
    field. Decision strategies could be implemented in the agent using reactive behaviors,
    models, goals, utilities or learning, as reasoning mechanisms. • The variety of
    agents implemented in the researches studied in this review evidence the potentiality
    of the agents and the MAS in irrigation applications, with high abstraction level.
    According to the roles and characteristics of the agents in these studies, we
    propose the classification of functional agents, object agents, human agents and
    institutional agents. Functional agents are those that perform specific functions
    such as data-mining, database, constraint, predictor, heuristic, policy, monitoring,
    actuator, interface, treatment, planning, distribution, meteorologist, monitor,
    control, reasoning, information, communication or diagnostic. Object agents represent
    real entities such as pump station, water allocation, crop, plant disease, landscape,
    soil, plant, river, node, branch, robot, sensors, environment, sprinkler, species,
    field or dripping units. Human agents correspond to human representations like
    farmers, water managers, producers, water suppliers, consumers, policy makers,
    citizens, operators, advisors, supervisors, schedulers, coordinators or householders.
    Finally, some examples of agents that represent institutions are local government,
    geographical information service, associations of users from an irrigation district,
    companies, municipalities, water supply companies or villages. • Agent-based modeling
    using the perception sequence from the agricultural field could be used for obtaining
    optimal water applications. The integration of multiples agents with different
    capabilities allows water resource management in regions such as irrigation districts.
    • Researches in irrigation-MAS could be developed for the interoperability among
    the existent MAS platforms, methodologies and software, to obtain flexibility
    and fault tolerance (Daneshfar and Bevrani, 2009). • The integration of irrigation
    systems, intelligent environmental decision support systems, multi-agents and
    geomatics technologies, such as remote sensing, global navigation satellite systems
    and geographical information systems, can improve the performance of irrigation
    scheduling for multiple users who share the same water source. The research opportunities
    in multi-agent systems with applications in irrigation scheduling are described
    below: • Scalability strategies, scheduling time for data transmission sessions
    (Skobelev et al., 2014), water distribution estimation, soft control, informed
    agent intervention, nonlinear interaction dynamics, constrained communication,
    optimal consensus control, competition, cooperation and negotiation are potential
    topics for scientific research (Jiang-Ping et al., 2013). Additionally, security
    is a key problem in the communication between agents in irrigation systems, because
    it is open to attacks or message modification, particularly in situations of water
    negotiation. • In MAS, the emergence leads to the challenging issue of how to
    prevent undesired emergent behaviors from undermining the reliability of the system
    (Jiang-Ping et al., 2013). An emergent behavior at the component level (considering
    the behavior of agents individually) and the implied scenario at the system level
    (considering the multi-agent system behavior) may cause critical damage (Fard
    and Far, 2014). • Holonic Multi-Agent Systems (HMAS). Holon is a word derived
    from the Greek holos, meaning whole, and the suffix on, meaning part. This word
    is associated to a biology and sociology concept introduced to describe the recursive
    and self-similar structures in biological and sociological entities (Koestler,
    1968). Holonic organizations are among the successful organizational models that
    have been introduced in multi-agent systems recently. Its introduction resulted
    in the concept of HMAS, which is a multi-level structure composed of holons (Esmaeili
    et al., 2017). A holonic model brings several significant attributes to multi-agent
    systems, such as self-similarity, reliability, stability, and dynamism. In other
    words, there is no central unit for building and controlling the system, and the
    whole process is controlled by the agents, according to their local information
    and their neighbors in the MAS. • Cooperative coevolution (CCEA) is a valuable
    approach for the evolution of heterogeneous MAS. The key advantage of CCEAs is
    that, as populations are isolated, it is possible for different populations to
    evolve, with genomes of different lengths or using evolutionary algorithms. A
    key element in the evolution of cooperative behaviors is synchronized learning,
    where agent populations should exhibit the development of mutual skills, in order
    to avoid the loss of fitness gradients and convergence to mediocre stable states
    (Gomes et al., 2015). • Networked MAS (NMAS). The most important NMAS application
    is the Internet of Things (IoT), which is one of the most growing sectors in the
    global economy. One of the main contributions to NMAS is the development of distributed
    estimation techniques for sensor networks, where irrigation technologies have
    a high applicability. In NMAS, there are multiple controllers rather than a single
    controller and there also exist interactions among the agents that the individual
    agent controllers must consider. In NMAS, as the scale of the system increases,
    the captured real-time data and the required real-time computing will dramatically
    grow in size (Liu, 2017). This review establishes the conception of an intelligent
    agent model for irrigation management. The intelligent agent uses soil, weather
    and plant sensing methods, historical and predictive information, artificial intelligence
    capabilities and social abilities, as illustrated in Fig. 6. This intelligent
    system is currently being developed by the authors. Download : Download high-res

    to the DSS model presented by Adeyemi et al. (2017). Finally, with this research,
    the development of a MAS model for irrigation management was generated according
    to Fig. 7. The MAS system consists of multiple irrigation intelligent agents with
    some capabilities showed in Fig. 6. These agents obtain data from their fields
    and define irrigation prescriptions individually. In this model, there is an image
    processing agent in charge of estimating the irrigation prescriptions for several
    crop fields using remote sensing and weather data. The manager-agent is responsible
    for distributing the water to the fields, using pump station agents and water
    supply monitoring agents. There are two irrigation prescriptions, the global and
    field located. If one or several irrigation intelligent agents define a prescription
    with more amount of water than the defined using the global prescription for the
    corresponding field, negotiation protocols will begin for distributing the available
    resource efficiently. This model is being implemented in an irrigation district
    of Boyacá, Colombia. Download : Download high-res image (293KB) Download : Download

    and multi-agent systems for irrigation scheduling, together with the advances
    in sensor and actuator technologies, has the capability of managing the non-deterministic
    nature of the agricultural fields, while considering the operational limitations
    of irrigation infrastructures. Agent-based approaches and intelligent environmental
    decision support systems can extract the principal soil–plant-atmosphere relationships
    for determining the water depletion in the soil, the crop evapotranspiration and
    the crop stress, using artificial intelligence strategies. For this reason, the
    robustness and adaptability of the irrigation-MAS can be improved using the proper
    combination of soil, crop and environmental sensors. In the irrigation-MAS, each
    agent has information about its environment (its field), but has incomplete information
    or capabilities for solving problems of negotiation, coordination and cooperation
    with other agents located in other fields. Thus, the importance of multi-agent
    systems is related to the behavior of multiple agents designed to solve a given
    problem together. In irrigation-MAS, data are decentralized, computation is asynchronous
    and there exists heterogeneity of agents. The design and implementation of multi-agent
    systems with the objective of modeling the simulation and control of irrigation
    systems still require research to face many challenges. Some of the most important
    challenges are related to platforms and methodologies standardization; negotiation,
    coordination, planning, cooperation, co-evolution, security and communication
    among agents; and architectures, networks, integration with crop models and with
    other technologies, such as remote sensing, global navigation satellite systems
    and geographical information systems. The development of user-friendly and cost-effective
    systems has the potentiality of enhancing the adoption of intelligent systems
    for irrigation management by farmers. These systems have to capture, storage,
    visualize, share, transfer, search and analyze data, with the coordination of
    multiple computing tasks in real time. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. Acknowledgements

  description: Dynamic irrigation scheduling for Variable-rate irrigation systems
    is essential to accurately estimate the spatiotemporal pattern of irrigation water
    requirement. Real-time, sensor-based and soil-water balance scheduling methods
    were compared on a trial under a Variable-rate center pivot irrigation system.
    The soil-water balance scheduling used the FAO56-ET model to calculate daily soil-water
    deficits and to determine crop water requirements using climate data from a local
    climate station. The sensor-based scheduling system used a wireless soil moisture
    sensing network to trigger irrigation when soil water deficit reached a critical
    value in a web-based user interface. The scheduling was conducted on pea and French
    bean crop trials under one center pivot, with two delineated irrigation management
    zones at Massey University's No.1 Farm, Palmerston North, New Zealand. The results
    showed variation between the two scheduling methods where the soil water balance
    assumed that the soil is well drained. The sensor-based scheduling technique delivered
    27–45% less water. As there were no significant crop growth and yield differences
    between the two approaches, irrigation-water-use efficiency was greater under
    the sensor-based scheduling regime. Further research is planned to assess the
    feasibility of including this monitoring system in a precision irrigation control
    system.

    water use efficiencyWater productivity 1. Introduction Variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) systems make it possible to spatially vary water application depths across
    a field in a manner that addresses specific soil, crop, and/or other conditions
    (e.g. topography; sequential row crop sowing). By optimizing water application
    rates, VRI can meet the site-specific watering needs of plants while improving
    the environmental outcomes of irrigated cropland (Evans et al., 2013). Some VRI
    systems use customized irrigation zones defined on dedicated software. The Variable
    rate program is then loaded into the precision VRI controller that directs individual
    sprinklers through valve nodes (wireless or cable control system). For center
    pivots, VRI is currently complemented by two techniques: (i) Speed control varies
    the– fraction of time that the outermost tower is moving, so application depth
    can be different in each sector of the field (VRI Speed Control - One slice is
    one sector). (ii) Nozzle control varies the fraction of time each sprinkler or
    bank of sprinklers is turned on, so application depth can be different angularly
    and radially. Both mechanisms may be integrated for zone control VRI (VRI Zone
    Control -One block is one management zone) (Evans et al., 2013). VRI management
    zones have been delineated using soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) maps
    (Corwin & Lesch, 2003). This method is considered to be a rapid, non-destructive,
    inexpensive, and very reliable way to map soil variability at high spatial resolution
    (Corwin & Lesch, 2003). The ECa primarily relates to soil texture and moisture
    content (MC) in non-saline soils, and as these two soil properties relate to the
    soil water-holding capacity, ECa surveys can be used to identify irrigation management
    zones (Hedley & Yule, 2009; Sudduth et al., 2005) In arid regions where irrigation
    supplies nearly all the crop’s water needs, irrigation scheduling is relatively
    straightforward because crop water demand can be estimated without having to take
    into account the effects of daily Variable precipitation patterns and consequent
    changes in MC of different soil horizons with varying drainage characteristics
    (Fant et al., 2012). In humid regions such as New Zealand, irrigation is needed
    as a supplemental source of water for those times when rainfall is insufficient
    to meet crop water needs. In these situations, scheduling irrigation can be a
    greater challenge because it aims to reduce or eliminate crop stress due to drought,
    as well as avoid excessive watering with the negative environmental impacts of
    increased drainage and nutrient leaching. Careful scheduling of VRI can maximize
    irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) by determining the exact timing and amount
    of water needed to replenish the MC to a desired level in order to meet crop water
    demands. Three categories of scheduling techniques exist: (i) soil water balance
    (SWB) model calculated using meteorological data (Allen et al., 1998); (ii) soil
    sensor measurements of MC (Smith, 2000); and (iii) crop sensor measurements of
    plant water status (Jones, 2004). With the SWB-based approach, the soil water
    deficit (SWD) is tracked by accounting for all water additions (inputs) and losses
    (outputs) from the soil root zone. Major inputs are precipitation and irrigation.
    Water might also be transported upward by capillary rise from a shallow water
    table towards the root zone (Allen et al., 1998). Outputs include crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc), drainage, and runoff. Irrigation is required when ETc exceeds the supply
    of water from both soil water and precipitation or in other words when a critical
    SWD level (in millimeters) has been reached. ETc is often determined as the product
    of the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and the crop coefficient (Kc) with the
    ETo calculated from climatic parameters (Allen et al., 1998). Accurate estimates
    of Kc and soil hydraulic properties values are essential because inaccuracies
    in Kc and field capacity values can potentially result in large errors in the
    estimated SWD (Allen et al., 1998). A standardized version of the Penman and Monteith
    (PM) equation (FAO56, Allen et al., 1998) is the recommended procedure for calculating
    ETo and subsequently plant water requirements. Several water balance models refer
    to this approach, for example, the FAO AquaCrop model (Steduto et al., 2009) and
    CropWat (Smith, 1992), and it is also included in many farm-system models, e.g.
    Overseer (Wheeler & Rutherford, 2014) and APSIM (Keating et al., 2003; Probert
    et al., 1998). Another major potential source of error in the widely used FAO56
    SWB method is the uncertainty of drainage characteristics (especially for poorly
    drained soils): the method assumes that the soil is well drained and that moisture
    cannot exceed field capacity, with free movement of soil water and other undetected
    fluxes in and out of the control volume (Fant et al., 2012; Nolz, 2016). Other
    models exist that may be more accurate in estimating drainage (Miller & Aarstad,
    1972), but these were not evaluated in this study. The Kc derived from remotely
    sensed vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    makes it possible to account for variations in plant growth due to specific growing
    and weather conditions, and also improved SWB irrigation scheduling due to better
    estimation of water use and more appropriate timing of irrigations (Kullberg et
    al., 2017). Several studies have tested the potential use of NDVI to predict Kc
    and transpiration at the field scale (Duchemin et al., 2006; Er-Raki et al., 2007;
    González-Dugo & Mateos, 2008; Hunsaker et al., 2005). These studies concluded
    that Kc generated from NDVI determine ETc better than a tabulated Kc in terms
    of representing the actual crop growth conditions and capturing the spatial variability
    among different fields. Soil moisture can be directly measured via gravimetric
    sampling or estimated using a range of instruments (Charlesworth, 2005). The gravimetric
    method involves collecting a soil sample, weighing the sample before and after
    oven drying (for 24 hours), and calculating its MC. This MC is usually expressed
    as the ratio of the mass of water present in the soil sample to the dry weight
    of the soil sample (Hillel, 1982). This method, which involves sampling, transporting,
    and repeated weighing, is laborious and time-consuming. Instruments based on the
    neutron-probe technique and dielectric methods (time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    and capacitance techniques) estimate the volumetric MC (Smith, 2000). These sensors
    are easy to use and provide highly reproducible data (van Iersel et al., 2009).
    The neutron-probe and TDR methods have been widely employed and are sometimes
    used as reference methods (Gardner, 1986; Vicente et al., 2003). Recent innovations
    in wireless radio frequency technologies and sensors (such as those mentioned
    above), along with advances in internet technologies, offer excellent opportunities
    for real-time monitoring of the field soil, crop and environmental conditions.
    A number of wireless sensor network (WSN) with various topologies (e.g. star,
    mesh-network) have been developed and investigated under irrigation by different
    researchers in the past decade (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009), including center-pivot
    irrigation (O’Shaughnessy & Evett, 2008), linear-move irrigation systems (Kim
    et al., 2008) and VRI center-pivot (Barker et al., 2018; Hedley et al., 2013;
    Liang et al., 2016). Research is required to refine decisions support tools for
    VRI systems. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: (i) investigate and compare
    the impact of two VRI scheduling methods – SWB model-based and sensor-based –
    on the quantity of water applied, crop growth, final yield, and IWUE for a pea
    crop and a French bean crop over one season under a VRI center pivot; and (ii)
    discuss the potential improvement in the model scheduling method by using the
    NDVI derived from ground-based data, because to our knowledge, this is new work
    that is critically required to support efficient irrigation scheduling. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study site The study was conducted at a research site (1.2 ha)
    0n Massey University’s No.1 Dairy Farm, near Palmerston North, New Zealand, during
    the 2017/2018 growing season. The farm is located at 40.22 °South latitude and
    175.36 °East longitude, at an elevation of 37 m above sea level. The field is
    currently irrigated with an 86-m VRI center-pivot system (i.e. 1 span) containing
    31 sprinklers, each with a spray radius of 5 m and a flow rate of 26.3 m3 h−1.
    The water is sourced from groundwater in a nearby well. According to the New Zealand
    Soil Classification (Hewitt, 2010), the soils are Fluvial Recent soils formed
    in greywacke alluvium, which correspond to Fluvents in the USDA Soil Taxonomy
    (USDA, 1975). 2.2. Irrigation management zones The soil map for this field (Pollok
    and Nelson, 2003) shows the presence of two soil types: a Manawatū fine sandy
    loam and a Manawatū silt loam. ECa maps were used to delineate the field precisely
    into irrigation management zones. The electromagnetic (EM) survey was carried
    out at 6-m swath widths using a Dualem-1S. ECa at an exploration depth of 0.5 m
    was mapped at a 5-m spatial resolution from the EM survey using ordinary kriging
    in R version 3.4 (R Core Team, 2016) in the gstat package (Pebesma, 2004). 2.3.
    Experimental setup Field peas (cultivar Massey, 260 kg h−1a) and French beans
    (cultivar Contender, 75 kg h−1a) were sown on 15 November 2017 and 9 February
    2018, respectively. The experiment comprised four plots (20 x 10 m) in each soil
    zone plus two plots in a non-irrigated corner of the field. The crop management
    details for the peas and beans are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Management operations

    12 April 2018 Harvest: Beans 2.4. Scheduling treatments The experiment consisted
    of two scheduling treatments in each zone, and a non-irrigated area. Each zone
    had two replicate plots per scheduling treatment. The two irrigation scheduling
    methods were (i) the SWB method and (ii) the sensor-based method. The non-irrigated
    treatment was in the non-irrigated corner. For the SWB method, a daily time-step
    water balance model was developed. This model used daily weather data derived
    from a local climate station (http://cliflo-niwa.niwa.co.nz/), located 50 m from
    the trial site, to calculate the daily ETo, ETc and SWD values. The daily ETo
    was calculated from the PM equation (Allen et al., 1998) as in Equation (1): (1)
    Here, is reference evapotranspiration (mm/d), is net radiation at the crop surface
    (MJ m−12/d), G is soil heat flux density (taken as zero for daily calculations)
    (MJ m−12/d), is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height (ºC), is wind speed at
    2 m height (m s−1), is saturation vapour pressure (kPa), is actual vapour pressure
    (kPa), is saturation vapour deficit (kPa), Δ is slope vapour pressure curve (kPa/ºC),
    γ is psychrometric constant (kPa/ºC). The FAO56 ETo model and a dual crop coefficient
    method which accounts for variations in soil water availability, inducing either
    stress and soil evaporation, were used to estimate ETc, Equation (2) (Allen et
    al., 1998): (2) where, is the crop evapotranspiration (mm/d) is the basal crop
    coefficient, is water stress coefficient, and is soil evaporation coefficient.
    and are calculated based on daily water balance computation in the surface soil
    evaporation layer of measured effective depth ( ) and in the root zone ( ), respectively,
    according to Allen et al. (1998). Crop coefficients ( and ) vary according to
    the crop growth stage and are also affected by the climate conditions. The standard
    tabulated coefficient values (Allen et al., 1998) were modified to reflect local
    conditions at that time using Equation (3). Also, actual readings of crop height
    and root depth ( ) were taken during the growing season to adjust the predictions.
    In soil data settings, maximum measured rooting depth of 0.4 and 0.3 m for pea
    and bean, respectively, were used to match up with the sensor-estimated SWD. (3)
    is the standard value for basal crop coefficient according to the FAO56 approach
    plant height (m) for each growth stage (0.1 m < h <10 m); is the value for daily
    wind speed at 2 m height over grass during the growth stage (m s−1); is the value
    for daily minimum relative humidity during the growth stage (%); is the mean plant
    height during that crop stage (m), and is crop coefficient. For the sensor-based
    method, the MC was monitored using frequency domain reflectometry probes (SM300-
    DeltaT, Burwell, UK) and calibrated, for each soil type, against weekly measurements
    of MC made gravimetrically and with a neutron probe (calibration equation was
    updated weekly). The SM300 probes were installed horizontally for each plot at
    4 depths i.e. 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40 m (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The neutron probes,
    which were 1 m long, were installed permanently in a vertical position, close
    to the SM300 sensors (about 1 m distance), and MC readings were taken to a depth
    of 0.80 m in 0.10 m depth increments. To calibrate the SM300 probes: (i) there
    were four replicate neutron access tubes in each of the four replicate plots in
    each soil zone for each crop, and (ii) three undisturbed soil sample replicates
    of known volume (intact Cores) were taken close to the access tubes (about 1–3 m
    distance) at depths of 0.1, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 m. The soil volumetric moisture
    content was determined by multiplying the gravimetric moisture content by the
    measured bulk density. The SM300 is connected with a WSN developed by Ekanayake
    and Hedley (2019), which provides a direct continuous measurement of the MC in
    near real-time (at one-hour interval) and displays it on a web page (http://lcrmbei.com/Index.php/massey/soil-moisture-zoom/).

    The system provides a direct continuous measurement of the soil moisture status
    in a real-time where the data are collected by the sensor node and then relayed
    to a gateway that collects and transmits the data to a cloud-based database which
    then extracts, processes and displays it on web pages (http://lcrmbei.com/Index.php/massey/soil-moisture-zoom/).
    The red cap of the neutron probe access tube is shown in the lower left-hand corner
    of the photo (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
    the reader is referred to the web version of this article). 2.5. Scheduling process
    Irrigation of the plots was scheduled as follows: (i) For the SWB treatment, daily
    weather was used to calculate the SWD using equation (4): (4) where, SWD1 and
    SWD2 is beginning and ending total SWD (mm), respectively, IRR is irrigation (mm),
    P is precipitation (mm) CR is capillary rise from the groundwater (mm), RO is
    runoff from the soil surface (mm), ETc is calculated crop water use, or evapotranspiration
    (mm/d), and DP is deep percolation or drainage out of the root zone (mm). The
    initial SWD was derived from measured soil moisture content using portable TDR
    sensor “The MiniTrase (6050 × 3)” by Equation 5. Any excess water in the root
    zone (0.4 m for pea and 0.3 m for bean) was assumed to be lost through DP. CR
    was assumed to be zero because the water table was more than about 1 m below the
    bottom of the root zone (Allen et al., 1998). RO was assumed to be zero. (ii)
    For sensor treatments, data from the calibrated MC sensors were used to monitor
    daily MC and calculate SWD for each zone, through the entire cropping season.
    Based on the crop stage, average daily cumulative SWD at depths of 0.20, 0.30,
    and 0.40 m for pea and bean crops were calculated: (5) where, is daily soil water
    deficit (mm), is soil moisture content at field capacity (expressed in mm/100 mm),
    is soil moisture content (expressed in mm/100 mm) at the given layer and is the
    rooting depth (mm). i is crop stage of 0.20 (initial stage), 0.30 (mid stage)
    and 0.40 (late stage). The MC sensors were installed 11 and 12 d after planting
    of pea and French bean crops, respectively, so the first irrigation event before
    installation of the sensors was based on the SWB method for all treatments. Critical
    SWD values for triggering irrigation and applied irrigation depths (IRR) are expressed
    as proportions of the total available water (TAW) (Equation 6). For each treatment,
    when allowable deficit (AD) level was reached, an irrigation event was scheduled.
    AD levels were determined for both scheduling methods as 0.45 TAW, and IRR was
    set at 0.75 AD. This aims to avoid drainage from irrigation and provide a buffer
    (25% deficit) in the soil for any rain event. TAW is defined as: (6) where, is
    the total available soil water in the root zone (mm), moisture content at field
    capacity (m3 m−13), moisture content at wilting point (m3 m−13), is the rooting
    depth (m) (Table 3). The average measured TAW in each soil zone was used for irrigation
    scheduling. A destructive method was used for measuring the maximum effective
    rooting depth directly at different growth stages. The growth stage days were
    determined based on days after planting, and linear interpolation for crop parameters
    ( , crop height and ) were used between stages. For peas, = 0.2 (initial stage),
    0.3 (mid stage) and 0.4 (late stage); beans = 0.2 (initial stage) and 0.3 (mid
    and late stages). 2.6. Assessment of scheduling treatments Crop assessments (i.e.
    height, length, number of nodes, flowers, and pods) were conducted manually on
    a weekly basis until harvest. Three replicates of 25–30 plants were monitored
    at each time for each plot, to distinguish the impact of irrigation scheduling
    treatments on crop growth. To investigate the impact of irrigation treatment on
    the final harvest yield, the following process was undertaken: • Cut three 1-m2
    replicates of the aboveground plant material in each plot • Record number of plants,
    total biomass weight (fresh biomass) • Separate pods from vine, count number of
    pods, record weight (bean’s fresh yield) • Separate seeds from subsample pods
    and record their weight (pea’s fresh yield) • Dry biomass and yield were calculated
    on an oven dry-weight basis (70⁰C). To compare the effect of scheduling technique
    on crop water productivity, the IWUE (Howell, 2002) and water productivity (WP)
    were calculated: (7) (8) where IWUE is the irrigation water use efficiency (kg m−13),
    WP is the water productivity (kg m−13), Yg is the irrigated grain yield (g m−12),
    Ygd is the non-irrigated (rainfed) yield (g m−12), IRR is the irrigation water
    applied (mm), and ETc is the total cumulative crop evapotranspiration (mm). 2.7.
    Recalibrating crop coefficient in FAO56 water balance As derived from NDVI measurements
    reflects the local conditions, the feasibility of directly estimating the Kc and
    predicting ETc from sensor readings of NDVI was investigated and compared against
    the calculated values using the FAO56 approach. A RapidSCAN CS-45 Handheld Crop
    Sensor (Holland Scientific, Lincoln, NE) was used to measure the NDVI at 1-m intervals
    along transects 1 m apart in each plot on a weekly basis. The system is equipped
    with a GPS, so the data were collected and stored for analysing the NDVI differences
    between the plots. Markers were installed in each plot to allow the observations
    to be made at the same place from one date to another. The average and the standard
    deviation of NDVI were computed, from these measurements. Collected NDVI data
    were regressed against FAO56 estimated Kcb values to predict a Kcb curve for the
    whole season (Taherparvar & Pirmoradian, 2018). The curve was then used to predict
    daily Kcb values (Taherparvar & Pirmoradian, 2018). Furthermore, cross validation
    was applied to the model. 2.8. Soil sampling Soil samples were collected before
    the growing season, on 15 August 2016, to compare laboratory measurements of available
    water-holding capacity (AWHC) between the two soil zones (Zone 1 and Zone 2).
    Soil Cores were taken from 18 locations (9 for each soil zone) at 0.2-m intervals
    to a depth of 1 m. To compare levels of soil nitrate and ammonium between treatments
    and their impact on crop growth, three replicates of soil samples were taken at
    0.15-m intervals to a depth of 0.45 m from each plot at pre-planting and harvest.
    2.9. Laboratory analysis Laboratory analysis included measurements of (i) AWHC
    by draining a proportion of soil volume between pressure potentials of –10 and
    −1500 kPa (Gardner, 1986; McQueen, 1993), (ii) Mineral nitrogen, ammonium and
    nitrate (NH4-N and NO3-N) were extracted with 2 M KCl using a 1:10 soil: extractant
    ratio and a 1 -h end-over-end shake followed by filtration (Blackmore et al.,
    1987). All soil preparation and laboratory analyses were undertaken at the Manaaki
    Whenua Environmental Chemistry Laboratory, Palmerston North, New Zealand (http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/resources/laboratories/environmental-chemistry-laboratory).
    2.10. Statistical analysis The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality (KS) was carried
    out at 5% significance. Analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) at P = 0.05, Tukey’s HSD
    (data normally distributed) and Bonferroni (Dunn) (data non-normal distributed)
    were conducted to investigate significant differences in measured soil properties
    and crop measurements. All the data visualizations and analyses performed in this
    study were carried out using R (R Core Team, 2016), and SAS, Version 9.4 (SAS
    Institute Inc., 2002). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Delineating the field into
    irrigation management zones The Dualem-1S sensor data were kriged into an ECa
    map and classified into two irrigation management zones (Zone 1 and 2, see Fig.

    at 0.50 m using a Dualem-1S. SWB treatments were in plots 1, 3, 6, and 8, and
    (ii) Sensor treatments were in plots 2, 4, 5 and 7. The non-irrigated treatment
    was at non-irrigated corner (plots 9 and 10). Table 2. Soil apparent electrical

    silt The relationships between ECa values and soil properties (MC and cation exchange
    capacity (CEC)) were established for this field site by El-Naggar et al. (2017),
    who measured linear relationships of ECa with MC and CEC (R2 = 0.66 for MC and
    R2 = 0.63 for CEC). The form of linear regression was: (i) MC = 0.08 + 0.03 ECa
    and (ii) CEC = 2.86 + 1.09 ECa. 3.2. Comparison of soil data for the two soil
    zones The significance of differences in these properties between the two soil
    zones was evaluated by both parametric and non-parametric statistical methods.
    The KS test only demonstrated non-normality in the AWHC of samples at 0.8–1 m.
    There was no significant difference in mean AWHC in the top 0.2 m. At deeper depths
    (0.2–0.4, 0.4– 0.6, 0.6–0.8, and 0.8–1 m), the mean values of AWHC were larger
    in Zone 2 than in Zone 1, with p values < 0.05 (Fig. 3). Zone 1 was a coarser
    textured sandy soil and had a relatively low AWHC compared with Zone 2. Table
    2 illustrates the textural distribution and classification of the 18 samples along
    with the ECa classes for the 0–0.4 m soil layer. For Zone 1, the sand percentage
    was always greater than 45%, the clay percentages were always lower than 14%,
    and the silt percentages ranged between 7 and 38%. For Zone 2, the sand percentage
    was always less than 42%; the clay percentages were lower than 23%, and the silt
    percentages ranged between 41 and 65%. These analyses gave weight to the claim
    that the soil differences between the two soil zones were practically and statistically
    significant. Download : Download high-res image (126KB) Download : Download full-size

    for the two scheduling treatments in each zone The details of the AD and IRR values
    for the two scheduling criteria are given in Table 3. Table 3. Scheduling criteria

    from neutron probe readings. Fig. 4 shows an example of the calibration curves
    for the sensors over the rooting depth of the crop (0 to 0.4 m) against neutron
    measured volumetric data on 24 January 2018 and 3 April 2018 for pea and bean
    crops, respectively. Separate calibrations were needed for each soil type. The
    relationship between the two regression lines for Zone 1 and 2 was significantly
    different (p = 0.0312). The results showed good agreement for SWD in the top 0.40 m.
    An R2 value of 0.87 and 0.89 with Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 1.8 and 1.95
    (mm/400 mm) were obtained for Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively. The relationship
    for MC of the top 0.20 m varied with the subsoil below 0.20 – 0.40 m for Zone

    soil texture and TAW below 0.20 m at Zone 1 compared with Zone 2 as observed by

    in Zone 1 (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.24 (mm/10 mm)) was due to heterogeneity of the

    for the 0 – 0.40 m depth during the crop season in each soil zone is given in
    Fig. 5. The associated standard error of the mean was less for the neutron-probe
    for both soil zones, due to its ability to integrate over a larger volume of soil
    and its higher tolerance of the heterogeneity of the soil (not shown). The MSE
    was higher in Zone 2, especially in the control plots for the bean. The error
    was, in general, less in the Zone 1 plots during the pea trial for both sensors,
    probably because greater water demand (summer season) helped homogenize soil moisture
    in the root zones. The soils under this condition retained water over a longer
    period after each irrigation event, leading to more stable moisture profiles by
    decreasing the rates of soil moisture loss. Similar findings by Heng et al. (2002)
    reported that the errors of a capacitance probe and neutron-probe were less under
    a higher fertility irrigation treatment, because of higher root water extraction
    giving more homogenized soil moisture. However, the corresponding error at each
    depth showed rather low MSE values especially at 0.10 – 0.20 m depths for both
    soil zones (not shown). Based on this, to obtain the same level of precision in
    Zone 2 as observed in Zone 1 more sensors are needed. Download : Download high-res

    measured by the sensors (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
    figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). During
    the pea trial, the SWB method scheduled 6 and 5 irrigation events to Zone 1 and
    Zone 2, respectively, with a total amount of 110 and 97 mm for Zone 1 and Zone
    2, respectively. The sensor method scheduled 5 and 3 for irrigation events to
    Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively, with a total amount of 85 and 53 mm for Zone
    1 and Zone 2, respectively. Most irrigation occurred in the first part of the
    season when rainfall was insufficient to meet the crop water demand. Compared
    with the water balance method, the sensor-based technique reduced withdrawal by
    27% of the irrigation water in Zone 1 and 45% in Zone 2. We attributed these observed
    variations between the two methods to varying features of the soil profiles. Zone
    2, with restricted drainage, stayed wetter than predicted by the SWB model (Fig.
    6, Fig. 8), which is likely due to the fact that the SWB model did not take into
    account the impact of the layering and ‘capillary break’ due to the coarse gravels
    below the subsoil, as described by Clothier et al. (1977) for this soil type.
    This leads to an increase in MC in the finer layer above the coarse gravel surface
    that the sensors were able to measure but the SWB was unable to account for. Download

    each soil zone. The error bars represent the standard errors of the reported soil
    moisture content (MC) measured by the SM300 sensors (For interpretation of the
    references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
    version of this article). During the bean trial, the rainfall was greater, so
    less irrigation was required. The SWB method scheduled only 2 and 1 irrigation
    events for Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively, with a total amount of 35 and 20 mm
    for Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively. The sensor method scheduled the same number
    of irrigation events and the same application depths as the SWB method. Following
    the bean trial, the sensors identified that the MC was above field capacity due
    to a heavy rainfall event of 75 mm that fell over 3 days. However, if daily rainfall
    wets the soil above field capacity then the SWB model assumes that the total amount
    of water surplus to field capacity is lost the same day by deep percolation, allowing
    the soil to return to field capacity (Fant et al., 2012). In reality, the soils
    at this site did not drain this rapidly. This could also be related to the limitations
    of laboratory estimates of soil-water limits (i.e. FC and AWHC) used in SWB. Ratliff
    et al. (1983) suggested that laboratory-estimated MC limits should be used with
    caution in SWB calculations, and field-measured limits are preferred. Gebregiorgis
    and Savage (2006); Lukangu et al. (1999) concluded that for approximate estimation
    of MC limits, the laboratory method using undisturbed soil Cores yields satisfactory
    results, but for more critical work, the use of the direct measurement is essential
    using MC or soil-water potential sensors. Ekanayake and Hedley (2019); Salter
    and Haworth (1961) also found that the sensors and/or field method for estimating
    MC are practical and give more accurate measurements for timing and amount of
    irrigation. In general, these results indicate that the timing of the irrigation
    events varied under the two methods and that the SWB method resulted in more water
    being applied to the pea crop. 3.4. Crop assessment for the two scheduling treatments
    in each zone For the pea crop, there was no significant difference in mean crop
    height, number of pods (see Fig. 9), length, number of nodes, and number of flowers
    (results not included) between the two scheduling treatments. During the pea crop
    trial, the non-irrigated crop’s height and number of pods were significantly less
    than those observed for the two scheduling treatments. Unsurprisingly, the greater
    rainfall experienced during the growing of the bean crop resulted in no significant
    differences in crop height and number of pods between the two scheduling treatments
    and the non-irrigated treatment. Download : Download high-res image (387KB) Download

    values The results of the regression analysis between FAO56 estimated values and
    NDVI values are provided in Table 7. These equations were used to predict more
    accurate pea and bean and ETc estimates. The analysis shows that for NDVI, the
    estimated Kcb and predicted had the same trend through the growing season (Table
    7 and Fig. 11). The ETc was calculated by multiplying the values by the value
    of the ETo (see Equation 2). The estimation of and ETc using NDVI sensing data
    was essentially significant. The results show high R2 and adjusted R2 for the
    predicted values of for pea and bean 0.87 and 0.92, respectively. Table 7. The

    (NDVI) values measured at the study site. The Kcb–NDVI and ETc–NDVI values have
    been obtained from the linear relationships versus Kcb–FAO56 and ETc–FAO56 values
    for pea and bean. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). The NDVI minimum
    value was measured at the beginning of the growing season over the dry bare soil
    and was about 0.16 and 0.14 for the pea and bean crops, respectively. NDVI maximum
    values were 0.80 and 0.72 for the pea and bean crops, respectively. The NDVI increased
    from crop emergence until maximum values were attained about 50 d after planting
    and then they began to decrease slightly through to the end of the season (Fig.
    11). The NDVI curves flatten out at mid-season where the NDVI saturates with high
    values of leaf area Index when the soil was almost totally covered by the canopy
    (Duchemin et al., 2006). The NDVI values were slightly higher for the pea irrigation
    treatments than the bean irrigation treatments, especially during the mid-season,
    and this is likely due to the dense canopy of the pea crop compared with the bean
    crop. At times, the heterogeneity of NDVI data in crops with low values was visible
    at high spatial scale resolution imagery, particularly for the non-irrigated treatment
    (not shown). –NDVI values were interpolated at a daily time step in order to compare
    them with the continuous series of –FAO56 values for the entire growing season.
    The result of the comparison is displayed in Fig. 11. The –FAO56 average values
    obtained at three stages (initial, mid-season, and late-season) were 0.15, 1.17,
    and 1.05, respectively. These values are only slightly different from those given
    by –NDVI ( ,ini = 0.14, ,mid = 1.10, ,end = 1.03), which reflect the local conditions.
    Overall, the estimated ETc by NDVI did not significantly improve the FAO56 approach.
    The FAO56 model has mainly been designed to plan irrigation schedules in arid
    to semi-arid regions. Thus, the model requires a limited set of soil inputs, does
    not account for any vertical differences in soil moisture, and assumes that the
    soil moisture cannot exceed field capacity. In order to improve the utility of
    the model in the widest range of soil types, the model should include a multi-layer
    soil feature that accounts for slower drainage rates and the associated water
    storage, especially in temperate regions, when rainfall often occurs during the
    irrigation season. In some cases, the model should consist of detailed soil, crop,
    weather and management modules (e.g. APSIM (Keating et al., 2003) and DSSAT (Jones
    et al., 2003)) that require very accurate and numerous inputs, all of which tend
    to vary dramatically from one field to another. 4. Conclusions Dynamic irrigation
    scheduling is required to help farmers meet the site-specific water requirements
    of plants and reduce the negative environmental impacts of irrigation. SWB-based
    and Sensor-based techniques were used to schedule irrigations to pea and bean
    crops in two delineated irrigation management zones of contrasting soil texture,
    under a VRI system. In addition, a potential improvement of the FAO56 scheduling
    approach was evaluated by using Kcb derived from sensor readings of NDVI. Daily
    SWD was monitored using two contrasting techniques – SWB-based modelling and sensors
    – and irrigation was triggered when a prescribed AD was reached. The SWB-based
    model relied on soil TAW and weather data. The sensor-based method, which used
    a wireless soil moisture sensor network, provided measurements of the actual soil
    water conditions in the field. The two scheduling methods showed a variation in
    timing and the quantity of irrigation applied to the pea crop: the SWB-based method
    resulted in more water being applied. The sensor-based technique saved about 27–45%
    of the irrigation water and produced the same pea yields as the SWB-based model.
    This difference can be attributed to some of the inherent limitations of a simple
    SWB. In the period following a rain event that wet the soils above field capacity,
    the SWB models predicted a faster drying rate than was actually measured with
    the soil moisture sensors. This is because the SWB model does not account for
    the restricted drainage that occurs in the Manawatū silt loam soil profile (Zone
    2). This restricted drainage is due to the compact nature of the silt loam subsoil
    as well as the impact of the textural break that occurs between the base of the
    subsoil and the underlying coarser gravels. The estimated ETc by Kcb–NDVI did
    not significantly improve the FAO56 approach. Crop growth was not significantly
    different between the two scheduling treatments. Therefore, the IWUE for the pea
    crop was significantly more efficient for the sensor-based technique compared
    with the SWB technique for scheduling irrigation. Future research could be undertaken
    to extend the comparison of these two scheduling systems to different crops and
    for different climatic conditions. In addition, future research is required to
    investigate the value of including WSN monitoring systems into precision irrigation
    software control systems to increase options for automated adaptive irrigation
    scheduling. Conflict of interest and authorship confirmation form AGWAT_2019_696_R1|

  description: The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of deficit
    irrigation (DI) on wheat grain yield under different sowing methods. The field
    experiment was layout using randomized complete block design (RCBD) with split
    plot arrangements by keeping four DI regimes (I1, I2, I3, I4 as 0%, 20%, 35% and
    50% deficit respectively) and two sowing methods (bed sowing and drill sowing)
    in sub plots and main plots respectively with three repeats. Research also evaluated
    the ability of AquaCrop model to simulate wheat gain yield and biological yield
    under full and deficit water conditions in a semi-arid environment. The model
    was calibrated for the full irrigation treatments under both sowing method and
    remaining six treatments were used for validation purpose. The results showed
    that the maximum grain yield was recorded 5.724 tons/ha for 0% DI treatment under
    drill sowing method. The DI (I1, I2, I3, and I4) levels under drill sowing method
    gave 13.12%, 14.28%, 16.38%, and 19.59% more grain yield than the corresponding
    DI levels (I1, I2, I3, and I4) under bed sowing method respectively, whereas the
    average crop water use efficiency for I1, I2, I3, and I4 treatments under bed
    sowing was found higher than the corresponding treatments under drill sowing method
    by 17.94%, 14.34%, 9.96%, and 5.36% respectively. AquaCrop model simulated gain
    yields and biological yield showed a good agreement with measured values of both
    gain yield (RMSE = 0.25ton ha-1, NRMSE= 5.41, d=0.96 and NSE = 0.79) and biological
    yield (RMSE = 0.59 ton ha-1, NRMSE= 5.36, d=0.94 and NSE = 0.74). The high values
    of the statistical indicators confirmed that the AquaCrop model (v3.0) can simulate
    wheat yield under no to mild water stress conditions which makes it very useful
    for evaluating the deficit irrigation strategies under different cultural and
    management practices with minimal input data requirements and ease of use.

  description: World population growth currently brings unequal access to food, whereas
    crop yields are not increasing at a similar rate, so that future food demand could
    be unmet. Many recent research works address the use of optimization techniques
    and technological resources on precision agriculture, especially in large demand
    crops, including climatic variables monitoring using wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs). However, few studies have focused on analyzing the dynamics of the environmental
    measurement properties in greenhouses. In the two companion papers, we describe
    the design and implementation of three WSNs with different technologies and topologies
    further scrutinizing their comparative performance, and a detailed analysis of
    their energy consumption dynamics is also presented, both considering tomato greenhouses
    in the Andean region of Ecuador. The three WSNs use ZigBee with star topology,
    ZigBee with mesh topology (referred to here as DigiMesh), and WiFi with access
    point topology. The present study provides a systematic and detailed analysis
    of the environmental measurement dynamics from multiparametric monitoring in Ecuadorian
    tomato greenhouses. A set of monitored variables (including CO2, air temperature,
    and wind direction, among others) are first analyzed in terms of their intrinsic
    variability and their short-term (circadian) rhythmometric behavior. Then, their
    cross-information is scrutinized in terms of scatter representations and mutual
    information analysis. Based on Bland–Altman diagrams, good quality rhythmometric
    models were obtained at high-rate sampling signals during four days when using
    moderate regularization and preprocessing filtering with 100-coefficient order.
    Accordingly, and especially for the adjustment of fast transition variables, it
    is appropriate to use high sampling rates and then to filter the signal to discriminate
    against false peaks and noise. In addition, for variables with similar behavior,
    a longer period of data acquisition is required for the adequate processing, which
    makes more precise the long-term modeling of the environmental signals.

    Notes Abstract World population growth currently brings unequal access to food,
    whereas crop yields are not increasing at a similar rate, so that future food
    demand could be unmet. Many recent research works address the use of optimization
    techniques and technological resources on precision agriculture, especially in
    large demand crops, including climatic variables monitoring using wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs). However, few studies have focused on analyzing the dynamics of
    the environmental measurement properties in greenhouses. In the two companion
    papers, we describe the design and implementation of three WSNs with different
    technologies and topologies further scrutinizing their comparative performance,
    and a detailed analysis of their energy consumption dynamics is also presented,
    both considering tomato greenhouses in the Andean region of Ecuador. The three
    WSNs use ZigBee with star topology, ZigBee with mesh topology (referred to here
    as DigiMesh), and WiFi with access point topology. The present study provides
    a systematic and detailed analysis of the environmental measurement dynamics from
    multiparametric monitoring in Ecuadorian tomato greenhouses. A set of monitored
    variables (including CO 2 , air temperature, and wind direction, among others)
    are first analyzed in terms of their intrinsic variability and their short-term
    (circadian) rhythmometric behavior. Then, their cross-information is scrutinized
    in terms of scatter representations and mutual information analysis. Based on
    Bland–Altman diagrams, good quality rhythmometric models were obtained at high-rate
    sampling signals during four days when using moderate regularization and preprocessing
    filtering with 100-coefficient order. Accordingly, and especially for the adjustment
    of fast transition variables, it is appropriate to use high sampling rates and
    then to filter the signal to discriminate against false peaks and noise. In addition,
    for variables with similar behavior, a longer period of data acquisition is required
    for the adequate processing, which makes more precise the long-term modeling of
    the environmental signals. Keywords: greenhouses; rhythmometric; parametric modeling;
    residuals; mutual information 1. Introduction In 2017, the population on Earth
    was 7.7 billion [1]; whereas, in the last decade, the growth rate of the population
    has slowed, the trend is to continuously increase, and the least developed countries
    still exhibit rapid growth. It is expected that, by 2050, the world population
    will reach 9 billion people [2,3]. Currently, the growth of the world population
    brings unequal access to food as an effect; crop yields are not increasing as
    fast as population, and a result is that food demand will not be satisfied in
    the future [4,5]. The challenge is to be able to focus on the use of food crops
    and to minimize crops oriented to bio-fuels, hence increasing crop yields. For
    this reason, many research centers are focused nowadays on applying optimization
    and analysis techniques to the agricultural sector [6,7], specifically in crops
    with greater demand, such as potatoes, corn, rice, or tomatoes, among others [8,9,10,11].
    In this study, we focus on tomato crops because it is one of the most consumed
    and appreciated vegetables in the world, due to its high content in carotene,
    a natural antioxidant. In 2017, the world production was approximately 177 million
    tons [1], which emphasizes the relevance of optimizing tomato crops by applying
    precision agriculture. One of the key technological aspects in this setting is
    the current possibility of monitoring climatic variables with sensor networks,
    which is receiving increasing attention. In the first companion paper [12], we
    described the analysis of the WSN topologies and their configuration, in terms
    of the design and implementation of hardware and software for the nodes with different
    communication technologies. For this purposes, three WSNs were designed and implemented:
    ZigBee technology with star topology, ZigBee with mesh topology (referred to here
    as DigiMesh); and WiFi technology (access point topology). In the second companion
    paper [13], we presented a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the energy consumption
    in those three WSNs for tomato greenhouse monitoring in Ecuador. To this aim,
    the statistical patterns of energy consumption were studied with detail in DigiMesh,
    WiFi, and ZigBee WSNs. Surprisingly, and to our best knowledge, few studies have
    focused on the analysis of all the data that are currently obtained from the environment
    variables in greenhouse scenarios and applications. Some of them have applied
    predictive techniques for energy saving in greenhouses, using neural networks
    such as the multilayer perceptron [14], or they have aimed to reduce the large
    number of duplicated and redundant data transmission [15]. Systems such as the
    Modified Extended Linearized Predictive Controller have been proposed, which use
    non-linear modeling techniques to control the greenhouse air temperature of usual
    parameters, namely, heating and natural ventilation [16]. Other approaches have
    developed energy-saving techniques in WSN by analyzing the energy consumption
    changes with the frequency of the transmitted measurements by the sensors and
    to characterize the send/receive configuration of the radio-frequency modules.
    Effort has also been devoted to choosing communication protocols with lower communication
    rates [17] and to controlling facilities in greenhouses by remotely using short
    message services [18], which could also influence positively the sensor battery
    lifetime. Nevertheless, little work is available on the dynamics of a variety
    of environmental variables in greenhouses, on the convenient sampling rate to
    adequately scrutinize these dynamics, and on the information that is either specific
    or shared in some sense for each environmental variable compared with others.
    Therefore, the present study aimed to provide a detailed and basic analysis of
    the environmental measurement dynamics in multiparametric monitoring performed
    at Ecuadorian tomato greenhouses. We used suitable statistical analysis tools
    to better scrutinize and study the dynamics of a variety of simultaneously recorded
    environmental variables. From a time-process analysis viewpoint, we used tools
    for scrutinizing the statistical nature of the recorded signals in terms of their
    cyclo-stationarity, namely, rhythmometric analysis and residual analysis (in terms
    of scatterplots, Bland–Altman plots, and time evolution of the residuals) [19].
    In addition, the cross-information among simultaneously measured variables is
    analyzed, both in terms of simple representations, such as scatterplots and Bland–Altman
    plots, as well as using mutual information descriptions. For this purpose, an
    experimental setup was established considering a variety of monitored variables,
    all of them recorded at high-rate sampling conditions. The scheme of the rest
    of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents existing research works on the
    environmental measurement dynamics of tomato greenhouse monitoring based on WSNs.
    Section 3 presents a short summary of the system proposed in the companion papers.
    Section 4 presents the details on the statistical tools used to analyze these
    variables. Section 5 shows the detailed results of the analysis, starting from
    a description of the practical methodology, and then focusing on the rhythmometric
    model adjustment considerations to every variable. The cross-variable information
    is also scrutinized in terms of the spacial diversity, network diversity, and
    other relevant factors. Finally, in Section 6, discussion is presented and conclusions
    are established. 2. Related Work Data analysis tools have been widely applied
    in diverse fields, such as health [20], industry [21], or agriculture [22]. In
    agriculture, working with monitoring data allows optimizing water usage using
    genetic algorithms [23], analyzing crops status using images [24,25], detecting
    weather related risks [26], studying greenhouse indoor air quality [27], or minimizing
    plague impact in crops [28], among many others. There is not so much research
    on the dynamics of environmental variables in greenhouses. Some existing studies
    use neural networks, genetic algorithms, and artificial intelligence techniques
    [29,30]. Predictive analytics help producers to make decision for pests or lack
    of nutrients in crops [31,32], to reduce energy consumption by analyzing communication
    protocols [33], or to better choose the data type to be transmitted. Other studies
    have focused on dynamic crop models, specifically evaluation, analysis, parameterization,
    and applications [34]. In [35], the impact of the number of crop state variables
    and their measurement errors on the prediction skills is analyzed with statistical
    models. Table 1 shows a compilation of research work on the dynamics of environmental
    variables in greenhouses. The analyzed articles focus on evaluating several relevant
    environmental variables in greenhouses, such as air temperature, air relative
    humidity, soil temperature, soil moisture, illumination, conductivity, water-level,
    pH value, or CO 2 . In summary, the proposed solutions for the analysis of the
    dynamics of environmental variables in greenhouses often apply neural networks,
    genetic algorithms, predictive models, statistical analysis, estimation methods,
    Bayesian networks, machine learning, and data mining techniques. Researchers indicate
    that traditional experimental and statistical methods do not have good results
    when applied on agricultural big data, while machine learning exhibit interesting
    options for the analysis of big data [36]. However, whereas this conclusion in
    the literature is interesting, there is a lack of basic analysis of the environmental
    variable dynamics with time-process analysis tools, providing basic information
    about the variables and their cross-relationship. To our best understanding, this
    kind of analysis should be addressed with detail before moving towards more advanced
    prediction techniques to have a solid description of the time-processes nature
    at hand. Our work is an opportunity to analyze the trends and time-series dynamics
    in agricultural data acquisition and processing from the unreported statistical
    description in the literature. Table 1. State of the art of relevant works in
    the WSN literature related to environmental variable data analysis. 3. Summary
    of the Proposed System for Tomato Greenhouse Monitoring In the first of the companion
    papers [12], a system is proposed to characterize the performance of the ZigBee
    (star and mesh topology), and WiFi standards for monitoring greenhouses. We summarize
    here the fundamental elements to understand the present work. Figure 1 shows a
    general scheme of the system for the three WSNs, which consists of a set of sensor
    nodes, a Coordinator Node, a personal computer, and a mobile device. The sensor
    nodes installed inside the tomato greenhouse allow the data acquisition from the
    sensors of several variables, such as air relative humidity, luminosity, air temperature,
    solar radiation, ultraviolet radiation (UV), wind speed, wind direction, and CO
    2 . Figure 1. General description of the elements, processes, and communication
    protocols for the WSN systems in this work. The acquired data were conditioned
    and used for the creation of the data packages or frames, and then, these frames
    were transferred from the Waspmote card to the communication module, where they
    were wirelessly transmitted to the Coordinator Node. This last one transmitted
    the environmental data of each sensor to the personal computer containing the
    Human–Machine Interface (HMI) designed in LabVIEW TM , and the mobile device allowed
    the user to visualize the data for each variable and for each WSN node. Sensors
    were selected according to the environmental variables that most affect the tomato
    growth. They were low consumption and compatible with processing cards. The data
    acquisition used the PRO 2.0 agriculture card (air temperature, solar radiation,
    luminosity, air relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and UV radiation)
    and the gas card PRO 2.0 (CO 2 ). These cards have very low power consumption.
    The Waspmote card with low energy consumption processed the data. The internal
    memory of the Waspmote stored the data after being processed, and data packets
    were transferred to the communication module by UART serial controller (for DigiMesh
    and ZigBee) or by HTTP protocol (for WiFi). The reception and transmission of
    the Coordinator Node packets used the communication modules XBEE ZB S2 PRO and
    XBEE ZB S1 PRO (for ZigBee and DigiMesh, respectively), with low energy consumption.
    The transmission speeds (9600, 19200 and 57600 bauds) were configured according
    to the operation rates of the Waspmote modules. The tree topology of the ZigBee
    network has the disadvantage that, if one of the nodes loses communication with
    the Coordinator Node, then it will be permanently out of service. The mesh topology
    of the DigiMesh network was implemented using redundancy, where each sensor node
    can communicate directly with the Coordinator Node or through another sensor node.
    The WiFi network receives and transmits the packets through the RN-XV wireless
    communication module, which has low power consumption. The ZigBee and DigiMesh
    networks transmit the data packets to the PC using the RS-232 interface, and the
    WiFi network uses the TCP/IP protocol. The packages received in the personal computer
    were routed to LabVIEW TM . The database was read and stored in LabVIEW TM through
    toolkits for creating, opening, and closing the communication channel, as well
    as for calling and storing data. The monitoring of the variables was made with
    the graphic interface developed in LabView according to the design stages, such
    as data separation, error detection, alarm generation, or variable monitoring.
    The interface was similar for the three networks and the user was able to know
    the real-time and precise values of each variable of the tomato greenhouses. The
    transmission of the data hosted in the MySQL acquisition station was controlled
    by the interaction with the web server. The Apache web server connected to the
    MySQL database to access the smartphone mobile application by means of a webpage.
    This application was developed with the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment
    (IDE) and it used the Android development environment software development kit
    (SDK). The user had access to the interfaces for the data generated in the greenhouse
    by three WSNs, from any geographical location with the availability of the mobile
    device. The experimental environment consists of two tomato greenhouses, which
    are located in the area of Salcedo, at coordinates −1.018373, −78.583888. The
    first one (Greenhouse A) had an area of 4000 m 2 (80 m length, 50 m width), was
    sawtooth type, with plants in flowering stage, and was installed with the DigiMesh
    network, while the second one (Greenhouse B) had an area of 3500 m 2 (70 m length,
    50 m width), was curve type, with plants in harvest stage, and was installed with
    the ZigBee and WiFi networks. Figure 2a shows the distribution of the nodes in
    both greenhouses, Nodes 1–3 were installed at the contour of the greenhouses,
    and Node 4 was installed in the center. Figure 2b shows a Sensor Node; Figure
    2c shows the laboratory configuration: the ZigBee Coordinator Node (1); the DigiMesh
    Coordinator Node (2); the WiFi router (3); and the monitoring and control station
    (4). Figure 2. Description of the experimental set-up: (a) map of the location

    Environmental Measurement Dynamics In this section, we describe the data analysis
    tools that we used to study the environmental variable dynamics. From a time-process
    analysis viewpoint, we use dtools for parametric modeling of every variable in
    terms of their cyclo-seaonality (rhythmometry analysis and bootstrap method for
    its order selection) and residual analysis for these models (Bland–Altman graphs,
    temporal evolution of the residuals, and residual histograms). We also scrutinized
    the dependence between measurement pairs (either the same variable in different
    sensors or networks, or different variables), yielding a simple statistical description
    in terms of scatterplots and Bland–Altman plots, and an advanced analysis in terms
    of their mutual information (MI). The mathematical notation described in [13]
    for the bootstrap estimation method and histograms can also be used in this study,
    and, in this paper, we extend it and describe the theoretical framework for the
    statistical analysis tools set specific for this work. Rhythmometric analysis
    is a statistical framework that can be applied to the automatic extraction of
    circadian, infradian, and ultradian seasonal components of a time series, based
    on a hypothesis test generated by the bootstrap resampling technique [49]. Ultradian
    rhythms are repetitive cycles that occur during and within a day, while infradians
    correspond to events whose period is longer than 24 h, which can be interpreted
    as they occur less than once a day [50]. In this study, we used this tool to adjust
    each environmental variables signal acquired during four days to a rhythmometric
    model. For this purpose, we applied the Cosinor temporal regression model, which
    is defined as a statistical technique for estimating cosenoidal models adjusted
    to different types of temporal data whose sampling may be unequally distributed,
    and which is widely used in the representation of the chronobiological oscillation
    of a variable with rhythmic behavior [51]. For the analysis of environmental variables,
    we used this analysis tool, since its behavior is very similar to those described
    in the revised scientific literature. Note that, after finishing the model adjustment
    process, the residual time series can be estimated, which are extremely useful
    for model diagnosis. For instance, it is possible to scrutinize their time distribution,
    so that time-biased structures can be observed, or their statistical distribution,
    by means of the histograms to provide us with a view of the model suitability.
    The detailed equations of the statistical method followed here are compiled in
    Appendix A. The scatterplot is a type of statistical graph designed to illustrate
    the relationship between two data signals. The construction of a scatterplot consists
    of the graphical representation of a reference signal (X-axis), and a dependent
    signal (Y-axis) [52]. In the case of sample observations given by pairs of simultaneously
    observed time series, ( 𝑦 𝑡𝑟 , 𝑦 ̂ 𝑡𝑟 ) ( 𝑟=1,2,3,…,𝑅 ), these pairs are plotted
    in the rectangular coordinate system to obtain the scatterplot, which helps the
    investigator to visualize the form of mathematical relationships, trends or structures
    that follow the signals jointly. For example, if the points approximate a straight
    line, then there is a linear relationship between the two signals [53]. An additional
    comparison tool is the Bland–Altman plot, which is a graphical technique for comparing
    two different sets of signals. This plot can be used in two ways. On the one hand,
    it allows comparing two measurement instruments, given in this case by pairs 𝑦
    1 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟), 𝑦 2 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟) referring to a same magnitude as measured by two different
    sensors. If none of those sensors can be considered as a gold standard, then the
    X-axis is given by their average, 0.5( 𝑦 1 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟)+ 𝑦 2 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟)) , and the Y-axis
    is given by their difference, ( 𝑦 1 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟)− 𝑦 2 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟)) . The resulting transformed
    signals are represented as their scatterplot. In addition, Bland–Altman plot is
    a visual check that the magnitudes of the differences are constant over the entire
    measurement range [54,55]. On the other hand, Bland–Altman plots can also be used
    as a tool for model diagnosis, which are complementary to residual distribution
    analysis and temporal analysis. In this case, the X-axis represents the actually
    measured magnitude 𝑦 𝑛 , while the Y-axis represents the associated residuals
    𝑒 𝑛 . The presence of model nonlinearity, model bias, heteroscedasticity, and
    others, can often be readily identified in these cases. Appendix A includes an
    extended notation for scatterplots and Bland–Altman plots. The MI is a measurement
    of the dependence between two random variables, in the sense that it specifies
    the amount of information that can be obtained from one random variable from knowing
    the other [56]. This concept is closely related to the entropy concept defined
    in Information Theory for a single random variable, which defines the amount of
    information that is explained by that variable. Whereas the correlation coefficient
    is limited to linear relationships between two real-valued variables, the MI gives
    a more general description in terms of the measurement of the similarity between
    the joint distribution of two general random variables and the product of their
    factored marginal distributions. The reader can see Appendix A for a more detailed
    explanation and notation on the MI methods used in this work. MI has been used
    in a number of practical applications, for instance, to evaluate how the environmental
    variables independently influence the ecosystem service interaction [57], or to
    investigate the relationship between land surface temperatures and the spatial
    pattern of green space [58]. In our scenario, we propose to perform a similar
    interaction analysis between the environmental variables of a tomato greenhouse
    using MI in different situations and conditions, for instance, sensors in similar
    locations but different networks, different sensor locations in the same greenhouse,
    or different variables. Note that the scatterplot provides us with a simple statistical
    description of the relationship among pairs of variables, which is comparable
    to an empirical estimation of the joint distribution of two environmental variables,
    whereas the MI can provide us with an information-theory based quantification
    of the possibly non-linear relationships between them, while retaining a similar
    theoretical basis for their comparison. 5. Experiments and Results 5.1. Methodology
    Description The statistical methods described in the previous section were applied
    to study the acquired environmental measures given by air temperature, air relative
    humidity, CO 2 , luminosity, wind speed, solar radiation, UV radiation, and wind
    direction. All of these variables were monitored in a tomato greenhouse during
    four days using three WSNs, two with ZigBee technology (star and mesh topology),
    and one with WiFi technology (access point topology). The obtained monitored signals
    were modeled by using the described LS rhythmometric method with fundamental period
    𝑇 𝑜 = 24 h. For every model we included some ultradian spectral components, and
    only one infradian component (approximate occurrence period of 40 h), because
    these frequencies are relevant in studies where the observed samples correspond
    to occurrence periods of several days or weeks. Moreover, fluctuations were considered
    as possible in each ultradian frequency component. The significant components
    of the model were automatically selected, according to the described procedure
    of their inclusion in decreasing amplitude order until the bootstrap test identified
    them as non-significant. Ad-hoc software was developed in Matlab TM , and the
    analysis tool included two parameters that need to be set by the user to improve
    the accuracy of the models. The first parameter to scrutinize is the regulation
    factor (𝑅𝑒𝑔) that compensates for the presence of ill-conditioning of the inverted
    matrix used in the LS adjustment model. This 𝑅𝑒𝑔 parameter was considered appropriate
    when the signal provided by the rhythmometric analysis accurately followed the
    measured samples, making sure that it was not an overfitted model also learning
    the noise, and if the general trend of the estimation compared to the original
    signal was not lost. Accordingly, the model adjustment was considered acceptable
    when the resulting estimated signal was generally situated in the midway of measured
    samples, and hence the residuals were symmetrically distributed around zero (solutions
    with reduced bias). The second parameter to scrutinize is the order of a mean
    filter (𝑂𝑟𝑑) , which was used to attenuate the noise in those variables whose
    amplitude rapidly changed, as high volatility was especially observed when working
    at reduced sampling rates. This was especially noticeable in variables such as
    wind speed, luminosity, and CO 2 . Parameter 𝑂𝑟𝑑 was set on the basis that the
    filtering did not distort the visually significant trends in the signal, and that
    the modeled signal did not deviate from the visually observed sample patterns.
    For the model validation, we used the Bland–Altman plots, the residual histograms,
    and the residual temporal evolution. By using the Bland–Altman graphs, it was
    possible to determine the noise distribution or precision between the acquired
    samples in each variable and the estimated model. For this purpose, concordance
    limits were established as usual in this methodology, and the model was considered
    as adequate if the majority of the compared samples fell inside them, they were
    near to zero, and they showed no heteroscedasticity pattern. The model statistical
    mismatch was also scrutinized by means of the histograms, accounting for the relative
    frequency distribution of the systematic error and considering the model as successful
    when the residual distribution trended to be Gaussian (or at least unimodal),
    and its standard deviation was narrow enough compared to the order of magnitude
    of the environmental signal fluctuation, whereas the model was considered out
    of adjustment otherwise. The residual time distribution complemented the validation
    by identifying temporal regions in those cases where bias could be observed for
    some time periods in the signal and in the adjusted model. The joint distribution
    between pairs of variables was scrutinized in terms of their scatter diagrams.
    Specifically, we compared two signals of a particular environmental variable,
    acquired by nodes of the same or different network. To complement the comparative
    analysis of variables, we finally included MI calculations among all the variables
    to identify the dependence between pairs of environmental signals, according to
    the nodes spatial location in the greenhouses, the communication technology type
    of each network, and the filtering incidence. 5.2. Rhythmometric Model Adjustment
    The rhythmometric model was adjusted for the environmental variables in terms
    of the model order and the regularization parameter. The interested reader can
    find a detailed description of the model tuning process in Appendix B for the
    case of CO 2 time measurements. The acquisition time of several samples of the
    WiFi network nodes was increased from 8 s to approximately 8 min to analyze the
    incidence of the sampling rate decrease on the modeling. As an example, we considered
    again the volatile CO 2 signal from Node 4, and the results obtained are shown
    in Figure 3. The selected filter order was considerably lower ( 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 4) in relation
    to the Node 4 of DigiMesh network, because it was observed that, for low sample
    rates, and significantly increases of 𝑂𝑟𝑑 , the original signal trend was lost.
    The sampling rate was lower for Sections A and C in the figure, the model was
    not well adjusted therein, and less accuracy was obtained for 𝑅𝑒𝑔 values above
    13, as evidenced through the amplitude mismatch between the observed and the estimated
    samples. In contrast, the adjustment was acceptable for Section B, where the sampling
    rate was higher, and in this context the residual magnitude was reduced and residuals
    remained symmetric throughout time, except for the bias resulting from the two
    distinctive peaks depicted in the graph. Accordingly, we conclude that, especially
    for the adjustment of fast transition variables, it is recommendable to use sampling
    rates in the order of some minutes, and then filtering the signal to discriminate
    against false peaks and noise. Figure 3. Modeling of CO 2 signal in Sensor Node
    4 of WiFi network, with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 15 and for different sampling rates. From top to
    bottom: the original signal (left); the filtered signal with 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 100 (right);
    the rhythmometric analysis; and the residual time evolution with 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 4. Based
    on the model adjustment process of CO 2 signal explained in Appendix B, we present
    the relevant results of the rhythmometric analysis the rest of environmental variables.
    In all cases, we applied filters to improve the signal quality, and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 was defined
    according to the signal nature and its sampling rate. Considering the total length
    of the observed samples, the tool calculated 18 rhythms including 𝑓 𝑜 , where
    1 corresponded to 𝑓 𝑖 , and 17 were in 𝑓 𝑢 . The number of significant spectral
    components 𝑓 𝑢−𝑠𝑖𝑔 , and 𝑓 𝑖−𝑠𝑖𝑔 of the model were conditioned by the quality
    parameter 𝑅𝑒𝑔 . Table 2 summarizes for each measured variables by the Sensor Nodes
    of the three WSNs the selected 𝑂𝑟𝑑 , the recommended 𝑅𝑒𝑔 , the number of significant
    frequencies, the sampling type, the histogram particular features such as distribution
    mode, the significant error range, and the relative frequency average of the two
    adjacent boxes to the error around ±1 , as well as the matching limits defined
    by the tool for the Bland–Altman diagrams. The criteria for categorizing a model
    as acceptable were the following: temporal evolution of residuals with minimum
    and symmetric amplitude, statistical distribution of systematic error mostly close
    to Gaussian shape higher data concentration around zero, and concordance limits
    between observed and estimated samples symmetric and close to zero. The rhythmometric
    models were analyzed for different 𝑅𝑒𝑔 values, and we concluded that the modeling
    was acceptable for a range where the results were reasonably close to the expected
    adjustment quality criteria. Table 2. Relevant parameters for model adjustment.
    For each network, node and sensor, the filtering order ( 𝑂𝑟𝑑 ), the regularization
    parameter ( 𝑅𝑒𝑔 ), and the number of significant infradian and ultradian components
    ( 𝑓 𝑖 _𝑠𝑖𝑔 and 𝑓 𝑢 _𝑠𝑖𝑔 ) are indicated. Error range, average relative frequency
    and mode of the residual histograms are indicated to summarize the residual analysis.
    The matching limits for the data and the model are also provided, as well as the
    qualitative description of the relevant features of the residual histograms. Figure
    4 shows three significant models of air relative humidity analysis, where in all
    cases the measurements tended to increase from approximately 18:00 to around 10:00
    the next day. After that, the values decreased with high persistence until close
    to 18:00, when the variability pattern was repeated. The fluctuating behavior
    on measurements necessitated complicated model adjustment; the systematic errors
    were great in these sections; and the increase of 𝑅𝑒𝑔 did not significantly improve
    the result quality. The mismatch was more pronounced during the signal final segment
    of Node 2 in the DigiMesh network. For the WiFi network, the error was lower for
    signal sections with low 𝑓 𝑠 . The modeling was more accurate for Node 2 of the
    ZigBee network, as shown by the narrow histogram error margins, and the reduced
    concordance limits of the scatter diagrams. Figure 4. Representative modeled signals
    of air relative humidity. From top to bottom: Node 1 of DigiMesh network with
    𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 4, Node 2 of ZigBee network with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 1, and Node 2 of WiFi network with
    𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 34. Luminosity was a very noisy variable, therefore we applied a high order
    filter, except on the WiFi network because the sampling rate therein was different.
    Overall, the effective daily light hours were in the approximate range of 06:00.
    to 18:00 with maximum values between 10:00 and 15:00. As shown in Figure 5, the
    random variability, and the high amplitude of the peaks present in the signal
    affected the estimation quality, as evidenced by the pronounced biases of several
    time evolution sections of the residuals, and by the values over 2000 of the concordance
    limits in the Bland–Altman diagrams. The mismatch was evident, especially in the
    signal-end sections of Nodes 1 and 3 of the DigiMesh network, as well as in Node
    2 of the ZigBee network, whereas, for Node 2 of the DigiMesh network, this was
    less noticeable. In Node 3 of the ZigBee network, the model was remarkably refined
    in the low luminosity sections with 𝑅𝑒𝑔>55 , however this caused the mismatch
    of the remaining samples. In general terms, the quality parameters were affected
    negatively, so that a lower value was chosen. For the WiFi network, the negative
    impact of switching 𝑓 𝑠 in Node 1 was noticeable, since the adjustment was not
    improved in signal sections with low rates, even for high 𝑅𝑒𝑔 values. In contrast,
    the adjustments for Nodes 2 and 3 of this network were acceptable at both sample
    rates only for 𝑅𝑒𝑔∈(2,12) , and outside this range the trend was lost, particularly
    in sections with low 𝑓 𝑠 . The models were more successful for Nodes 1 and 2 of
    the ZigBee and WiFi network, respectively, because most of the errors were distributed
    close to zero, and the concordance limits were significantly reduced in comparison
    with other nodes. Figure 5. Representative modeled signals of luminosity. From
    top to bottom: Node 1 of DigiMesh network with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 4, Node 2 of ZigBee network
    with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 100, and Node 1 of WiFi network with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 50. The solar radiation
    variations in time were similar to the luminosity, although the fluctuations were
    slowed-down in some signal intervals, and for this reason we selected a lower
    𝑂𝑟𝑑 filter to not modify the original signal trends. The adjustment features of
    each node are shown in Figure 6. In the initial measurements for Node 1 of the
    DigiMesh network, a considerable amplitude peak was recorded close to midday,
    which gradually affected the adjustment, causing a strong bias in the final section
    of the residual time evolution. During the experiment, 𝑅𝑒𝑔 was increased from
    1 to 400, and the results did not substantially improve. The progressive mismatch
    was lower in Node 2 of the ZigBee network. We concluded that, although the results
    show significant error range and the concordance limits were somewhat higher compared
    to the DigiMesh network node, the model quality was the best for this node, because
    the model adjustment was better, and the error frequency near zero increased dramatically.
    The modeling was less accurate for Node 2 of the WiFi network, since the adjustment
    tests were executed only for 𝑅𝑒𝑔=1 , due to the 𝑓 𝑠 change, whereas for other
    values the trend was lost, especially at low 𝑓 𝑠 . To more efficiently adjust
    the model of this variable, we suggest that the samples are acquired during major
    time intervals, considering that its behavior is similar to CO 2 , and the data
    trend differs greatly from one day to another. Figure 6. Representative modeled
    signals of solar radiation. From top to bottom: Node 1 of DigiMesh network with
    𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 1, Node 2 of ZigBee network with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 300, and Node 2 of WiFi network with
    𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 2. The UV radiation was measured by specific nodes in each network. Figure
    7 shows the relevant modeling results. The time behavior was very similar as explained
    for solar radiation, and we used the same order in the filters. However, the differences
    shown in the figure were that the progressive mismatch of the estimated samples
    were barely visible in the DigiMesh and ZigBee networks, and consequently the
    time variation ranges of the residuals decreased significantly. In the particular
    case of the WiFi network, the signal modeling at the low sampling rate was deficient,
    regardless of the 𝑅𝑒𝑔 value, and also an accentuated radiation peak occurred for
    acquired samples at low 𝑓 𝑠 , producing a distinct positive bias in the residuals.
    Although 𝑅𝑒𝑔 did not improve the model quality of this node, we included a shuffled
    value in Table 2. For this scenario, the significant error ranges of the histogram,
    as well as the Bland–Altman matching intervals, increased compared to the other
    two networks. It is relevant to note that the high frequency of near-zero errors
    on the histogram was not strictly related to a successful adjustment, because
    the residuals were very low for the signal sections with the largest samples.
    On this basis, we deduced that, for this variable, the model was more precise
    in Node 3 of the ZigBee network. Figure 7. Representative modeled signals of UV
    radiation: (Top) Node 3 ZigBee network with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 110; and (Bottom) Node 3 of
    WiFi network with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 20. Among all the studied environmental variables, the
    air temperature was one of the least volatile, and its fluctuations between samples
    were slow and with reduced amplitude, so we chose the same filter applied to the
    air relative humidity. The data variability trend was very similar in all nodes,
    and for all test days. The amplitude increased from about 08:00, and decreased
    from 17:00 approximately, and the air temperatures were the lowest in the dawn
    around 02:00–05:00. Figure 8 summarizes the representative models for this variable.
    For the DigiMesh network, the estimated signal of Node 1 allowed the original
    signal trend in almost the entire range, but with a slight amplitude offset with
    respect to the acquired samples. This mismatch was more noticeable in the final
    section. Considering that the errors and the concordance limits did not exceed
    6 ∘ C and 2 ∘ C, respectively, we considered the model as acceptable. In Node
    2, these offset particularities were also generated, although to a minor degree,
    and in general the model quality improved especially in the end-of-signal segment.
    In the particular case of Node 3, the initial measurements were persistent and
    unstable, therefore the residuals were greater, and this affected gradually the
    estimation of the other samples, and the mismatch was more evident in the last
    section, where the resulting modeling was inverse in comparison to the original
    signal. For the ZigBee network, the results for Node 1 were similar to those described
    for Node 1 of the DigiMesh network, although with a slight decrease in errors.
    The adjustment quality was very satisfactory throughout the signal even with minimums
    𝑅𝑒𝑔 values, and the model was more precise for Node 2. The measurements adjustment
    at the lowest sampling rate of the WiFi network nodes was very poor, being more
    evident in the initial lags. After experimentation in each node, we deduced that
    the regularization in several cases differed drastically even with minimal changes
    of 𝑅𝑒𝑔 . After various experiments, we selected some values that improved the
    model, although poorly, and the results were as follows: Node 1 with 𝑅𝑒𝑔∈(4,62)
    , Node 2 with 𝑅𝑒𝑔∈(4,8) , and Node 3 with 𝑅𝑒𝑔∈(4,20) . In all cases, the model
    trend was similar to the original signal; however, the time delay between the
    observed and the acquired samples was noticeable, and this mismatch was more evident
    for Nodes 1 and 2, as under these circumstances the resulting models were not
    capturing the true behavior of this variable. According to the explanation of
    previous paragraphs, we clarify that the apparently adequate quality parameters
    shown in Table 2 for these nodes were due to the adjustment errors being minor—several
    were nearly zero—for the signal sections whose samples volume were considerably
    superior, and not because the models were appropriate. Figure 8. Representative
    modeled signals of air temperature. From top to bottom: Node 3 of DigiMesh network
    with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 1, Node 2 of ZigBee network with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 3, and Node 2 of WiFi network
    with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 5. Figure 9 summarizes some relevant results of wind speed signal modeling.
    The measurements were acquired by Node 1 of the ZigBee network, and they were
    highly noisy. For this reason, we used a filter with 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 100. The signal trend
    was unchanged over time, however the amplitudes differed daily. Overall, the intensity
    increased from around 08:00, and peaked between 13:00 and 15:00, while the lowest
    values were registered from 24:00 to 08:00. The estimated samples were null for
    𝑅𝑒𝑔 values less than 5, due to the analysis tool discriminated all rhythmometric
    components. The modeled signal was perceptible from 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 5, however the results
    were quite poor as the analysis included only 𝑓 𝑜 . The model quality was greatly
    improved for 𝑅𝑒𝑔 values above 11, except in specific signal segments where the
    mismatch was more prominent because of the daily amplitude variability of the
    original signal; this drawback was not solved, even with the increment of 𝑅𝑒𝑔
    . Based on these results, we concluded that model optimization for this variable
    requires more time stored data. Figure 9. Representative modeled signals of wind
    speed. From top to bottom: 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 4, 5, and 12. The wind direction sensor was mounted
    on Node 1 of the ZigBee network. The acquired samples corresponded to positions
    in a circle, represented by integers between 1 and 16. Hence, an additional programming
    routine was developed for the data visualization and processing. Each position
    was transformed to cardinal points, and all of them were represented in a three-dimensional
    graph. During the experiment days, the wind was oriented to the northeast at different
    angles. In the analysis of this variable, two relevant particularities were presented
    that motivated the study both with and without filtering. First, the data type
    supplied by the sensor conditioned the modeling quality to residuals lower than
    one position, since a major error would mean an erroneous estimated direction.
    Secondly, the highly unpredictable and volatile behavior of the signal forced
    the signal filtering with an 𝑂𝑟𝑑 value higher than the rest of the variables.
    Figure 10 shows the significant results of modeling with and without filtering.
    The unfiltered signal adjustment was quite poor, and the residuals over time exceeded
    the two positions, even with high 𝑅𝑒𝑔 values. Even though the matching intervals
    of the Bland–Altman diagrams were less than one position, the dispersion was very
    strong and distant from these limits. The filtered signal model was substantially
    improved for 𝑅𝑒𝑔 values above about 1700. The residuals were reduced to peaks
    lower than one position, and the Bland–Altman concordance limits were similar
    to the previous case. However, the dispersion inside them was robust and points
    out of the confidence intervals were considerably reduced, and not very distant
    from the expected values. The strong mismatch in the final segment of the filter-modeled
    signal was a consequence of the unpredictable behavior of this variable, and it
    was not corrected during the experimentation. To ensure a more accurate model,
    the sampling period should be much longer than the selected for this work. Figure

    modeled signal ( 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 2000), filtered modeled signal ( 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 1700), residual

    describes the systematic inter-variable comparisons developed for the environmental
    monitoring of two tomato greenhouses. Several representative comparisons between
    pairs of signals of the same environmental time-series variable were carried out
    to scrutinize the dependence of the variables with the phenological stages of
    the tomato plants [59]. The comparisons of two different variables was tackled
    by time series representations together with scatterplots, and this was used to
    determine the relationship between the variables of greatest influence on the
    growth of the tomato crop. The comparisons of two series of the same variable
    was tackled by using Bland–Altman from two nearby nodes and two distant nodes,
    and they were carried out to establish the reliability of the measurement instruments.
    The comparisons between two nodes of the same network, as well as between similar
    nodes of different networks, were both made by means of scatters. As a general-view
    complement, the MI was scrutinized among all of them to analyze the incidence
    of measurements and their similarity depending on their location as well as the
    communication technology. This analysis was performed in the three WSNs implemented
    in two greenhouses. The first one, Greenhouse A, consisted of the DigiMesh network,
    while the second one, Greenhouse B, consisted of the ZigBee and WiFi networks.
    Nodes 1–3 were installed at the contour of the greenhouses, and Node 4 was installed
    in the center, as shown in Figure 2. The distribution table presented in Figure
    11 specifies the environmental variables of each sensor node. Figure 11. Distribution
    of the environmental variables for the sensor nodes of the three WSNs. The first
    comparison was made with the application of the filter 𝑂𝑟𝑑 recommended in Table
    2, so that this filtering eliminated the unwanted components improving the quality
    of the signals. Reduced CO 2 is one of the primary factors affecting the quality
    of greenhouse tomatoes [60], and air temperature and air relative humidity are
    also considered as very important variables in the growth of these plants [61].
    The luminosity can affect the tomato content of organic acids (citric and malic
    acids), sugar (glucose, fructose, and sucrose), solids that are insoluble in alcohol
    (proteins, celluloses, pectin, and polysaccharides), carotenes, and lipids, among
    others [62]. Figure 12 shows the changes in air temperature, air relative humidity,
    luminosity, and CO 2 in different zones of the greenhouses. We verified that the
    differences among the measures of the variables were due to the phenology state
    of the tomato plants. Figure 12. Temporal signals of the WSNs in different greenhouses.
    For the analysis of the second comparison, the original signals were not filtered.
    This consideration was applied to observe the behavior of environmental variables
    over time. Figure 13 shows the temporal signals and the scatterplots to determine
    the changes and the relationship between the variables. Air relative humidity
    and air temperature are closely linked in the greenhouse [63]; a rapid variation
    occurs in the afternoon and slowly in the early morning, one variable increases
    while the other decreases slowly at night, and in the morning this change happens
    inversely. The plants grow under the influence of radiation (diurnal conditions)
    by performing the photosynthesis process [64]. The air temperature and UV radiation
    increase in the day and decrease in the night. There is another direct relationship
    between wind speed and UV radiation. In addition, Figure 14 presents the inverse
    correlation of air temperature and air relative humidity as well as the direct
    relation of UV radiation and air temperature. The continuous monitoring of environmental
    variables allows the analysis of climatic changes and hence to determine the optimal
    limits to prevent unwanted effects on growing tomatoes [12]. The analysis of the
    direct and inverse relationship of environmental variables allows the farmer to
    understand how greenhouse conditions influence crop growth, and to react to changes
    that are outside the permitted ranges to maximize productivity. Figure 13. Temporal
    signals of the variables with direct and inverse relationship of the ZigBee network,
    from top to bottom. Figure 14. Scatter diagrams of the variables with direct and
    inverse relationship of the ZigBee network, from top to bottom. The third comparison
    was developed with the use of the filter to eliminate scattered values, and, with
    this stage, the width of the confidence interval was slightly reduced. The Bland–Altman
    plots for the air temperature data are shown in Figure 15. The X-axis shows the
    average of the two signals. The red lines represent the 95% confidence limits
    of the differences between the two networks. A regression line is shown that indicates
    that the mean differences between the networks are nearly zero. The difference
    of means between the signals of air temperature of Node 2 of the WiFi and ZigBee
    networks is 4.753, with agreement limits of −1.303 and 3.45. The agreement limits
    are narrow due to the strong correlation and the nearby location of the sensor
    nodes. The difference of means between the air temperature signals of Node 1 and
    3 of the DigiMesh network is 21.44, with limits of agreement −8.744 and 12.5.
    The agreement limits are wide due to the weak correlation and the distant location
    of the sensor nodes. Accordingly, the reproducibility of the measurements is strongly
    related to the location of the sensor nodes. Figure 15. Bland–Altman plots of
    air temperature: (left) nearby sensor nodes; and (right) distant sensor nodes.
    This representation shows that the first case corresponds to measurements from
    very similar phenomena, whereas the second one corresponds to measurements from
    a complex-dynamics system which nevertheless are intrinsically related. In the
    fourth comparison, the original signals were filtered so that scattered values
    were excluded. The filter order was selected for a better correlation among the
    sensor nodes. Figure 16 shows the scatter plots of relative air relative humidity
    and luminosity of Node 1 and 2 for the DigiMesh network, respectively. We observed
    that there is a moderate positive linear correlation between Nodes 1 and 2 of
    air relative humidity. In addition, Nodes 1 and 2 of luminosity had a positive
    linear correlation in the initial values. However, these correlations were not
    strong between the variables, because the sensor nodes were located in the right
    corners of Greenhouse A. Figure 17 shows the scatterplots between two different
    network sensor nodes for the air relative humidity and luminosity signals. Sensor
    Nodes 2 in DigiMesh and 3 in ZigBee for air relative humidity exhibited a positive
    linear correlation in the final values. Sensor Nodes 1 in DigiMesh and 3 in ZigBee
    for luminosity exhibited a positive linear correlation in the initial values.
    The WSNs were implemented in two different greenhouses, which explains the weak
    linear correlation between these variables. Figure 16. Scatterplots between two
    sensor nodes in the DigiMesh network: (top) air relative humidity, showing that
    the moderate noise does not mask the existence of two kinds of states, one for
    similar measurements, and another for different inter-node measurements; (bottom)
    luminosity; (left) not filtered; and (right) filtered, showing, in this case,
    the strong structuring effect of filtering on both signals, and the differences
    in their measurements, which are not evident in the unfiltered version. Figure
    17. Scatterplots between two Sensor Nodes in the DigiMesh and ZigBee networks:
    (top) air relative humidity, showing the strong similarity and the patent bias
    in both cases; (bottom) luminosity; (left) not filtered; and (right) filtered.
    The correlation analysis is strongly limited by its linear nature. Therefore,
    the variables can be related in an arbitrary way, so that it is necessary to use
    more general techniques to analyze their degree of dependence [65]. As a complement
    to the correlation, comparative analysis was made with the scatterplots. The MI
    was calculated among the variables of all the sensor nodes, so that we can easily
    appreciate which variables are more associated. The MI matrix shows the similarities
    between variables. MI was not estimated for the variables with themselves, so
    that the diagonal of the matrix was depicted as zero. The upper triangular submatrix
    has been preserved to facilitate its visualization. The lower triangular and the
    diagonal was plotted as zero, and also the last row (Node 3 of the WiFi network)
    was all zero; nevertheless, all the comparisons of the WiFi nodes were shown as
    an example in Figure 18. The filter 𝑂𝑟𝑑 caused a higher incidence in the MI values
    for volatile variables such as luminosity, so with 𝑂𝑟𝑑 of 5 it was 1.892 bits
    and with 𝑂𝑟𝑑 of 120 it was 2.411 bits. Meanwhile, in slow variables such as relative
    humidity, the values of MI change slightly, so with 𝑂𝑟𝑑 of 4 it was 2.945 bits
    and with 𝑂𝑟𝑑 of 60 it was 3.088 bits. For the MI analysis, we recorded the values
    of MI with and without filtering, as shown in Table 3 and Table 4. The application
    of the filter caused a minimum change in the MI values. A decrease occurred in
    the comparison between two sensor nodes of the same WSN for the variables of air
    relative humidity and air temperature of the WiFi network. In addition, when comparing
    the sensor nodes of different WSNs, the MI values decreased for the CO 2 and UV
    radiation of the pairs between DigiMesh-ZigBee and ZigBee-WiFi. Figure 18. MI
    comparison with change of 𝑂𝑟𝑑 between all different sensor nodes of the three
    WSNs for luminosity and air relative humidity. from top to bottom. Table 3. MI
    results compared between two sensor nodes of the same WSN. Table 4. MI results
    compared between two sensor nodes of different WSNs. Table 3 shows the MI values
    compared between two sensor nodes for air relative humidity, luminosity and the
    air temperature of the same WSN. The value of MI was significantly high in the
    DigiMesh network, when Nodes 1 and 2 were considered for air relative humidity,
    confirming the highest correlation as shown in Figure 16. MI values were high
    in the ZigBee network between Nodes 1 and 3 for luminosity, and Nodes 2 and 3
    for air temperature. The value of MI was lower in the WiFi network, when Nodes
    2 and 3 were compared for the air temperature. The MI values were low in WiFi
    network between Nodes 1 and 2 for air relative humidity, and Nodes 2 and 3 for
    luminosity. Therefore, the location of sensor nodes did not affect the degree
    of similarity of the signals for the DigiMesh and ZigBee networks. Table 4 shows
    the MI values compared between two sensor nodes of different WSNs. The MI value
    was high for the air relative humidity (2.807 bits), luminosity (2.550 bits),
    air temperature (2.761 bits), and solar radiation (4.458 bits) between the sensor
    nodes of the DigiMesh and ZigBee network. The value of MI was low for air relative
    humidity (2.016 bits), luminosity (1.571 bits), air temperature (1.534 bits),
    and solar radiation (3.462 bits) between the sensor nodes of the DigiMesh and
    WiFi network. Therefore, the type of communication technology affected the degree
    of similarity for the comparison between DigiMesh and WiFi networks. There was
    a significantly lower MI value in the CO 2 variable, because it is a faster variable
    than the other ones. 6. Discussion and Conclusions We studied the signal dynamics
    of environmental variables CO 2 , air relative humidity, luminosity, solar radiation,
    UV radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and wind direction, in two tomato greenhouses
    located in the Ecuadorian region of the Andes. The measurements were acquired
    during four days through several Sensor Nodes of three WSNs; two networks used
    ZigBee technology (star topology, and mesh denoted as DigiMesh), and a WiFi technology
    (access point topology). The sampling rate was constant for the ZigBee and DigiMesh
    networks at approximately 0.333 samples per second, and variable for the WiFi
    network at around 0.125 and 2.083 × 10 −3 samples per second. The data were stored
    in databases compatible with Matlab TM . The dynamics were analyzed from two viewpoints.
    In the first one, we adjusted the parametric model of each variable considering
    its cyclo-seasonality by means of rhythmometric analysis, and supported by the
    bootstrap method for the selection of significant spectral components. The models
    were validated by the residual time evolution and statistical representation (Bland–Altman
    diagrams and histograms). In the second instance, we scrutinized the dependence
    between measurement pairs by considering three systematic comparisons. We initially
    analyzed the correlation between the most influential variables in greenhouse
    crop growth through time series and scatterplots. Next, we compared the measurements
    of the same variable in different nodes to evaluate the accuracy of the measurement
    instruments by means of Bland–Altman graphs. Finally, we compared the measurements
    between nodes of the same network and of different networks with MI to define
    the incidence of the nodes location, and of the communication technology type
    with respect to the variable association. The filtering incidence in the results
    was analyzed in all test scenarios. For the ZigBee and DigiMesh networks, the
    𝑂𝑟𝑑 parameter was tuned based on the noise, speed changes of each signal, and
    the permanence of the original trend. The wind direction was the most volatile
    signal, so we used a filtering with larger 𝑂𝑟𝑑 . The change rate was slightly
    reduced in the luminosity, CO 2 , and wind speed, therefore a filtering with slightly
    lower 𝑂𝑟𝑑 was required. The air relative humidity, air temperature, solar radiation,
    and UV radiation signals were less noisy and slow, and for this reason an 𝑂𝑟𝑑
    value was assigned being considerably lower with respect to the other variables.
    Regardless of the nature of the signals of the WiFi network, the variable sampling
    rate limited the filtering at 𝑂𝑟𝑑 values below 6, to prevent the distortion of
    the original signal trend, especially in segments with low 𝑓 𝑠 . To adjust the
    models of each environmental variable, we developed a selection process for the
    quality parameters 𝑅𝑒𝑔 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 , to ensure that the estimated samples kept the
    original trend, and if possible were situated in the middle of the samples and
    have reduced bias. The models were considered acceptable when the amplitudes of
    the temporal evolution of the residuals were low and symmetric, if the statistical
    distribution of the systematic error was approximately Gaussian with a high concentration
    of data around zero, and if the limits of agreement between the observed and estimated
    samples were small and nearly symmetrical. We verified that the filtering inclusion
    in all variables improved the model quality, this becoming more noticeable in
    the volatile variables, especially in the wind direction. Through the experimentation
    phase, we identified two factors that significantly affected the accuracy of the
    model adjustment. The first was the instability or persistence in some signal
    sections, particularly in the air relative humidity of Node 1 of the DigiMesh
    network. A further aspect was the high variability of the samples amplitudes between
    days, combined with the presence of significant peaks or drops in the signal,
    this being the most common cause of mismatch, and it was present in the CO 2 ,
    solar radiation, UV radiation, wind speed, and wind direction measurements. Based
    on this experience, we concluded that the data acquisition period for these variables
    should be longer than the one used in this work, to optimize the learning of the
    analysis tool, and to increase the modeling accuracy on a long-term basis. In
    addition, we deduced that these factors mostly affected the DigiMesh network nodes,
    and that the models were more accurate for the signals acquired by the ZigBee
    network nodes, particularly in Node 1 for brightness; Node 2 for air relative
    humidity, air temperature, and solar radiation; and Node 3 for UV radiation. The
    wind speed was measured only on Node 1 of the ZigBee network, and its modeling
    cannot be compared with the other technologies; however, the estimation was acceptable,
    except in some specific signal sections where the mismatch was more pronounced
    because of its varying behavior over days. The slowest signal was the air temperature,
    and the daily measurements were very similar for the nodes of the three networks,
    so we concluded that the modeling of this variable was the most accurate, regardless
    of the nodes location and of the communication technology (ZigBee or DigiMesh).
    The adjustment of the WiFi network models was very deficient for the signal segments
    with low sampling rate, especially in the noisy and fast transition variables,
    therefore we recommend the measurements acquisition at high sample rates to improve
    the quality of the models. The modeling analysis and the filtering effects in
    the wind direction were individualized, because, in contrast with the other variables,
    the data acquired were integer numbers that oscillated between 1 and 16 that correspond
    to positions (cardinal points). Therefore, we considered a suitable model only
    if the residuals were not above one position, otherwise the estimated samples
    were completely deviated with respect to the actual direction. The signal adjustment
    without filter was very deficient, because the residuals time evolution exceeded
    two positions even for high values of 𝑅𝑒𝑔 . The model was markedly improved for
    the filter signal using 𝑅𝑒𝑔 values higher than about 1700; however, a strong mismatch
    occurred in the final segment of the estimated signal as a consequence of the
    non-periodic behavior of this variable. The results of the comparison between
    different variables revealed that air relative humidity was inversely correlated
    to air temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed, whereas UV radiation was
    directly associated with respect to air temperature and wind speed. Regarding
    the comparisons of two temporal series of the same variable, the correlations
    were strong for the nearby nodes and weak for the distant nodes, therefore, the
    reproducibility of the measurements was related to the location of the sensor
    nodes. According to the statistical cross-references of the variables among the
    sensor nodes of the same network, the air temperature data for the WiFi network
    nodes were the least correlated. The bits resulting from MI also evidenced less
    dependence; hence, the nodes location affected the degree of similarity of the
    signals for the WiFi network. Moreover, the cross-information study of variables
    between nodes of different networks revealed that the luminosity, air temperature,
    and CO 2 measurements of the nodes of the DigiMesh and WiFi networks were scarcely
    correlated. The MI values also indicated less dependence between the sensor nodes
    for these variables, thus we concluded that the communication technology type
    affected the analogously to the acquired signals of the DigiMesh and WiFi networks.
    The addition of the filter to the benchmarking development reinforced the data
    correlation of the scatterplots, partially narrowed the Bland–Altman confidence
    intervals, and improved the association between the variables in most comparisons
    as evidenced in the values showed in the MI tables. Much more information could
    be retrieved for describing the environmental variable dynamics that have been
    addressed here. Nevertheless, in the present study, we constrained ourselves to
    analyze their short-term and middle-term dynamics, as, in doing so, we were able,
    for instance, to analyze with detail the impact of sampling rate starting from
    high rates. The extension of the analysis to longer periods and to different climate
    conditions is strongly desirable, especially in terms of frost conditions, which
    is the main problem for the tomato cultivation in Ecuador. This research can also
    be complemented through the design and implementation of a frost early warning
    system, described as a climatic phenomenon that causes serious crop losses, principally
    in the Ecuadorian Andes. The data will be acquired at a steady sampling rate for
    a time span not shorter than one year, through a wireless network of high-precision
    weather stations located in strategic areas. Based on the modeling and statistical
    analysis tools described in this paper, we propose the development of an algorithm
    to predict the behavior of the most influential variables when frost occurs. The
    early diffusion of possible frost through social networks and mobile phones could
    contribute to the timely execution of corrective actions to avoid crop damage
    and economic losses. Author Contributions M.E.-R. designed and implemented sensor

    Appendix A. Mathematical Notation and Detailed Equations Here, the mathematical
    notation is detailed and the statistical methods are explained in more detail
    for the interested reader. Rhythmometric Analysis and Bootstrap Order Selection.
    The single Cosinor model signal is denoted by 𝑦 𝑛 , and it is determined by the
    following equation, 𝑦 𝑛 =𝑀+ 𝐴 𝑜 cos(2𝜋 𝑓 𝑜 𝑡 𝑛 + 𝜙 0 )+ 𝑒 𝑛 (A1) where the data
    samples are defined for 𝑛=1,…,𝑁 , where N is the signal length; M (for MESOR,
    from Midline Statistic of Rhythm) is the rhythm estimated average; 𝐴 𝑜 is the
    adjusted cosine amplitude, and indicates the half of the extent of the predictable
    variation in a cycle; 𝑓 𝑜 is the fundamental frequency, often chosen to be the
    circadian component; 𝜙 0 (also called acrophase) is the time interval from the
    starting point to the maximum of the cosine curve adjusted to the data; and 𝑒
    𝑛 is a random variable that represents the error calculated for each time instant
    and measured by the model residuals. To analyze the model error, it is often assumed
    that they are independently and normally distributed. The model residuals are
    calculated by the difference between the observed sample 𝑦 𝑛 and the value provided
    by an estimated regression model, denoted by 𝑦 ̂ 𝑛 . The regression parameters
    are determined by using the well-known least squares (LS) method [66]. The multiple
    Cosinor regression model can include the modeling of additional components to
    the circadian ones. In chronobiology problems, where the seasonalities are often
    among the strongest temporal driving effects, several ultradian ( 𝑓 𝑢 ) and infradian
    ( 𝑓 𝑖 ) components are often included in the model. Considering the moderate time
    length of the acquired samples in this work (up to four days), we included several
    infradian frequencies ( 𝑓 𝑖 < 𝑓 0 ) to possibly account for slow time-changing
    trends. Several ultradian components ( 𝑓 𝑢 > 𝑓 𝑜 ) were also included in the model
    for 𝑦 𝑛 samples. For instance, in the case of ultradian components, we added cosine
    terms denoted by 𝐴 𝑢 cos(2𝜋 𝑓 𝑢 𝑡 𝑛 + 𝜙 𝑢 ) , being 𝑓 𝑢 the central frequency
    harmonics, symbolized by 𝑓 𝑢 =𝑢 𝑓 0 . The total of included infradian components
    in the model is denoted by 𝑈 𝑛 = ∑ 𝑢 𝐴 𝑢 cos(2𝜋 𝑓 𝑢 𝑡 𝑛 + 𝜙 𝑢 ) (A2) Given that
    the model proposed in this research considers ultradian components, the analysis
    needs to incorporate possible narrow-band fluctuations, denoted as 𝐹 𝑗− 𝑛 , and
    𝐹 𝑗+ 𝑛 [49]. For this purpose, additional cosine terms are included, whose frequencies
    differ from those associated with each component in a magnitude according to the
    maximum spectral resolution defined by Δ𝑓= 𝑓 𝑠 /𝑁 , where 𝑓 𝑠 is the sampling
    frequency, so that these fluctuations are determined as 𝐹 𝑗− 𝑛 = 𝐴 − 𝑗 𝑐𝑜𝑠(2𝜋(
    𝑓 𝑗 −Δ𝑓) 𝑡 𝑛 + 𝜙 − 𝑗 ) (A3) 𝐹 𝑗+ 𝑛 = 𝐴 + 𝑗 𝑐𝑜𝑠(2𝜋( 𝑓 𝑗 +Δ𝑓) 𝑡 𝑛 + 𝜙 + 𝑗 ) (A4)
    where 𝑗=1,2,…𝑢 𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑓 𝑗 is the pivotal component with 𝑘=1 , 𝑓 𝑘 is the ultradian
    component, and 𝑢 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum number of harmonics considered in the model.
    For infradian components, we also incorporate cosine terms denoted by 𝐴 𝑖 cos(2𝜋
    𝑓 𝑖 𝑡 𝑛 + 𝜙 𝑖 ) , where 𝑓 𝑖 =𝑖Δ𝑓 , and 𝑖=1,2,…𝑖 𝑚𝑎𝑥 . To distinguish between moderate
    𝑓 𝑜 fluctuations (low-frequency trends) and the infradian rhythms, we limited
    the last component to the highest integer multiple of the spectral resolution
    that is less than or equal to 𝑓 𝑜 −2Δ𝑓 , therefore 𝑖 𝑚𝑎𝑥 =[ 𝑓 𝑜 /Δ𝑓]−2 , and the
    complete set of possible infradian components are described by 𝐼 𝑛 = ∑ 𝑖 𝐴 𝑖 cos(2𝜋
    𝑓 𝑖 𝑡 𝑛 + 𝜙 𝑖 ) (A5) Finally, based on all these considerations, the complete
    expression of the used rhythmic model is as follows: 𝑦 𝑛 =𝑀+ 𝐴 0 cos(2𝜋 𝑓 0 𝑡
    𝑛 + 𝜙 0 )+ 𝑈 𝑛 + 𝐼 𝑛 + ∑ 𝑓 𝑗 ( 𝐹 𝑗− 𝑛 + 𝐹 𝑗+ 𝑛 )+ 𝑒 𝑛 (A6) The non-significant
    spectral components are eliminated to reduce the uncertainty of the model, which
    is possible from the consecutive comparison of pairs of models, symbolized as
    𝑋 𝐴−1 and 𝑋 𝐴 . Regression model 𝑋 𝐴 is obtained by adding the cosine component
    of Equation (A6) with its highest mean power with some criterion (for instance,
    in the Fourier Transform of the time series) to model 𝑋 𝐴−1 . A paired bootstrap
    hypothesis test is applied for the comparison, from the calculation of the mean
    square errors (MSE) of both models, represented as 𝑒 𝐴−1 , and 𝑒 𝐴 . The interested
    reader can consult Goya-Esteban et al. [66] for details and references therein.
    In brief, the relevance of the addition of each cosine component is determined
    by resampling with replacement of the differences between the errors, calculated
    by Δ 𝐸 ∗ (𝑏)= 𝐸 ∗ 𝐴−1 (𝑏)− 𝐸 ∗ 𝐴 (𝑏) (A7) for each resampling, with 𝑏=1,2,3,…,𝐵
    . In our experiments, we used 𝐵=2500 . The asterisk symbol ( ∗ ) is commonly used
    in bootstrap literature to represent the quantities obtained from or referred
    to the resampling process [67]. In the hypothesis test, we considered that the
    addition of cosine components to the model 𝑋 𝐴 was relevant if at least 95% of
    the Δ 𝐸 ∗ values were located on the right side of zero in the estimated probability
    density function. Therefore, the generation of components stopped if the hypothesis
    test confirmed that model 𝑋 𝐴 was not statistically and significantly better than
    model 𝑋 𝐴−1 . Scatters and Bland–Altman Plots. If we have a time-sampling represented
    by a delta train, 𝑚(𝑡)= ∑ 𝑟=1 𝑀 𝛿(𝑡−𝑡𝑟) (A8) and two signals 𝑦 𝑛 (𝑡) and 𝑦 ̂ 𝑛
    (𝑡) , then 𝑦 𝑡 𝑖 (𝑡)=𝑚(𝑡) 𝑦 𝑛 (𝑡)= ∑ 𝑟=1 𝑀 𝑦 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟)𝛿(𝑡−𝑡𝑟) (A9) 𝑦 ̂ 𝑡 𝑖 (𝑡)=𝑚(𝑡)
    𝑦 ̂ 𝑛 (𝑡)= ∑ 𝑟=1 𝑀 𝑦 ̂ 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟)𝛿(𝑡−𝑡𝑟) (A10) and therefore the scatterplot is the
    representation of the pairs 𝑆( 𝑦 𝑡𝑟 , 𝑦 ̂ 𝑡𝑟 )≡{( 𝑦 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟), 𝑦 ̂ 𝑛 (𝑡𝑟)),𝑟=1,⋯,𝑅}
    (A11) MI Between Two Variables. Whereas MI can be defined for continuous and discrete
    random variables, we work here with the discrete version, assuming that we can
    define discrete states by quantifying the range of the environmental variables
    under our analysis. In this case, if 𝑌 1 and 𝑌 2 denote two random variables corresponding
    to two measured environment signals 𝑦 1 𝑛 (𝑡) and 𝑦 2 𝑛 (𝑡) , which can be divided
    into N and M states, denoted as 𝑦 1 𝑛 (𝑖) and 𝑦 2 𝑛 (𝑗) , respectively, then the
    MI of these random variables is given by 𝑀𝐼( 𝑌 1 , 𝑌 2 )= ∑ 𝑖 𝑁 ∑ 𝑗 𝑀 𝑝( 𝑦 1 𝑛
    (𝑖), 𝑦 2 𝑛 (𝑗))𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑝( 𝑦 1 𝑛 (𝑖), 𝑦 2 𝑛 (𝑗)) 𝑝( 𝑦 1 𝑛 (𝑖))𝑝( 𝑦 2 𝑛 (𝑗)) (A12) where
    𝑌 1 ={ 𝑦 1 𝑛 (𝑖),𝑖=1,2,…,𝑁} and 𝑌 2 ={ 𝑦 2 𝑛 (𝑗),𝑗=1,2,…,𝑀} are the said states
    of the observed time signals. It can be seen that this expression is symmetric
    in 𝑌 1 and 𝑌 2 and always positive, and is equal to zero if and only if 𝑌 1 and
    𝑌 2 are independent [68]. Its units are Shannons, although they are more commonly
    known as bits. Note that, if 𝑌 1 and 𝑌 2 are independent, then the knowledge about
    𝑌 1 does not provide any information about 𝑌 2 , and hence 𝑀𝐼( 𝑌 1 , 𝑌 2 )=0 .
    On the other hand, if 𝑌 1 is a deterministic function of 𝑌 2 , and 𝑌 2 is a deterministic
    function of 𝑌 1 then all the information conveyed by 𝑌 1 is provided by 𝑌 2 ,
    and vice versa, in this case, the MI will equal to the entropy of 𝑌 1 , hence
    equal to the entropy of 𝑌 2 . Appendix B. Detailed Rhythmometric Model Adjustment
    for CO2 Measurements For the description of the adjustment and validation procedure
    of the environmental signals modeling, we present next the CO 2 variable as an
    illustrative example, because it is a noisy signal in which the adjustment is
    a complex procedure. Specifically, we selected the acquired samples for Node 4
    of the DigiMesh network, and in this case the rhythmometry analysis gave 18 significant
    spectral components, 1 corresponding to the infradian rhythms ( 𝑓 𝑖 ) , and 17
    to the ultradian ones ( 𝑓 𝑢 ) . The number of significant components included
    in the model was strongly affected by the 𝑅𝑒𝑔 quality factor. In the first test,
    the original signal was not filtered ( 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 0), and the regularization factor
    was null ( 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 0). With these considerations, the rhythmometric analysis assigned
    one significant infradian frequency ( 𝑓 𝑖−𝑠𝑖𝑔 ) and only two significant ultradian
    frequencies ( 𝑓 𝑢−𝑠𝑖𝑔 ) . Figure A1 shows the results of the rhythmometric analysis,
    and the model was clearly deficient, since the adjusted signal 𝑦 𝑛 ^ was often
    not located about the middle of the observed samples. This mismatch was mostly
    evident during the final section of the signal, where it was relatively constant
    and without trends. In the time evolution of the residuals, we observed a biased
    systematic error with positive values, most of them distant from zero. The Bland–Altman
    diagram showed here a very strong residual structure, and the X-axis points that
    represent the acquired measurements with respect to Y-axis that correspond to
    the residuals often deviated from the coincidence limits. The systematic errors
    represented in the histogram confirmed the loose adjustment, since the distribution
    was far from Gaussian and strongly asymmetrical, and even the residual range was
    large in comparison with the signal fluctuation range. Figure A2 shows the relevant
    results from the second experiment, where the filter stage was still omitted,
    and we increased 𝑅𝑒𝑔 to 10, and later to 1000. In both cases, the results were
    very similar. The number of significant components increased to 15 and the model
    adjustment was slightly improved, especially in the final sections of 𝑦 𝑛 ^ ,
    where in the first test was observed a loose adjustment. In addition, the residuals
    on the histogram were distributed in a slightly shorter interval, and the relative
    frequency increased considerably for errors close to zero. The Bland–Altman structures
    were similar to the ones shown in the previous scenario, since the limited concordance
    between the measured and estimated samples persisted. To improve this modeling,
    𝑅𝑒𝑔 was increased to a much higher value ( 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 10,000), and although the number
    of significant components increased to 16, the results obtained were very similar
    to those shown in Figure A1, as the model quality again decreased. Based on these
    results, we concluded that the increment of 𝑅𝑒𝑔 by itself not necessarily improved
    the adjustment in such a noisy conditions, and that an efficient modeling requires
    also to include a mean filter, most notably in extremely noisy signals. Figure

    Rhythmometric analysis with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 15 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 30; 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 15 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 100; 𝑅𝑒𝑔

    15 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 30; 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 15 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 100; 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 40 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 30; and 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 40 and
    𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 100; Histograms with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 15 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 30 (left); and 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 15 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑
    = 100 (right); and Histograms with 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 40 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 30 (left); and 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 40
    and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 100 (right). Finally, we applied a digital zero-phase filter to the
    original signal, whose maximum order was dependent on the sampling rate, noting
    that, for the DigiMesh and ZigBee networks, one sample was acquired approximately
    every 3 s, whereas, in the case of the WiFi network, one sample was acquired every
    8 s. Moreover, the filter order was selected to efficiently remove undesired components
    without distorting the measured data trend over time. In this experiment we analyzed
    two cases of filtering ( 𝑂𝑟𝑑=30 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑=100 ) to compare the results and select
    the most appropriate option. For both scenarios, we modified 𝑅𝑒𝑔 , aiming to ensure
    that 𝑦 𝑛 ^ was more persistently close to the middle of the acquired samples.
    After several tries, this parameter was found to be working well with values between
    5 and 35. Figure A3 depicts the rhythmometric analysis results for three 𝑅𝑒𝑔 values,
    one of which is outside the suggested range ( 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 40). In this case, the signal
    model lost the trend with respect to the original samples in several time sections,
    because few significant components were assigned, the residual range of the histogram
    was much greater, and the negative asymmetry was mostly noticeable for the filter
    with 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 100. The adjustment was improved for the other two values ( 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 15
    and 𝑅𝑒𝑔 = 33), and the graphic representations in both cases were similar. The
    residual time evolution improved considerably compared to the previous results
    and it was symmetrical except from the midday of Tuesday, where the CO 2 concentration
    greatly increased but the model was not adjusted to follow this raise even under
    optimal conditions of 𝑅𝑒𝑔 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 , and also the asymmetry of statistical error
    distribution was pronounced herein. Nevertheless, the best option was considered
    to filter with 𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 100, as the relative frequencies of the histogram increased
    for errors closer to zero. With this background, we see that, for variables with
    similar behavior, a longer period of data acquisition is required for an adequate
    signal processing, and then the long-term modeling can be more precise, especially
    if the measured signal presents spikes or decreases with considerable amplitudes.
    For all trial scenarios, the Bland–Altman graphs shown in Figure A4 were very
    similar; the concordance limits were substantially reduced in comparison with
    the first experiment ( 𝑅𝑒𝑔 and 𝑂𝑟𝑑 quality parameters null); and the dispersion
    was symmetric and very near the limits, except in the large amplitude section,
    in which some few points were scattered with positive bias, due to the abrupt
    CO 2 increase described before. Overall, the filter inclusion was shown to remarkably
    improve the modeled signal accuracy with respect to the measured data, despite
    the 𝑅𝑒𝑔 factor not always was the most suitable. Based on the Bland–Altman diagrams,
    we confirmed that the most accurate modeling was obtained with 𝑅𝑒𝑔∈(15,33) and
    𝑂𝑟𝑑 = 100 because most of the points were scattered inside the concordance limits,
    the symmetry improved even in cases of major CO 2 concentration, and the most
    distant points of the confidence band were minimal compared to the total scatter.

  description: This article provides a focused survey of progress in crop evapotranspiration
    (ET) measurement and modeling, with particular emphasis on the aspects of interest
    to the irrigation profession. The significant advances in understanding and quantifying
    crop ET during the past few decades are largely due to our increased ability to
    measure, near-surface climate variables and surface, energy and momentum exchanges,
    complemented by progress in soil and plant sensor technology. However, ET measurement
    is not commonly practiced, and modeling is mostly preferred. Much theoretical
    progress in ET modeling originated with the 1948 work of Penman and the subsequent
    modification to the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation and to multi-layer and sparse
    canopy models. These advances strengthened confidence in using the combination
    equation and encouraged a significant step forward through the adaptation of the
    P-M equation to provide a standard estimate of reference crop ET for use in the
    long-established, two-step, crop coefficient (K c) methodology. Recently, there
    has been a continued progress in this field via the one-step application of the
    P-M equation to estimate crop ET directly using effective stomatal resistance
    rather than K c. This article concludes by drawing attention to a general need
    to improve crop water productivity by reducing non-beneficial soil evaporation
    and, in this context, the potential value of using improved methods and models
    to partition ET and to aid scheduling limited irrigation.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Potential of tree-based ensemble models for
    daily ET0 estimation with limited climatic data is explored. • Proposed ensemble
    models are compared with their corresponding SVM and ELM models. • ELM and SVM
    models offered the best combination of prediction accuracy and stability. • XGBoost
    and GBDT models have comparable accuracy and stability to those of ELM and SVM
    models. • XGBoost and GBDT models have less computational costs than the other
    models. Abstract Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is
    of great importance for the regional water resources planning and irrigation scheduling
    design. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model is recommended as the reference model
    to predict ET0, but its application is commonly restricted by lack of complete
    meteorological data at many worldwide locations. This study evaluated the potential
    of machine learning models, particularly four relatively simple tree-based assemble
    algorithms (i.e. random forest (RF), M5 model tree (M5Tree), gradient boosting
    decision tree (GBDT) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)), for estimating
    daily ET0 with limited meteorological data using a K-fold cross-validation method.
    For assessment of the tree-based models in terms of prediction accuracy, stability
    and computational costs, these models were further compared with their corresponding
    support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. Four input
    combinations of daily maximum and maximum temperature (Tmax and Tmin), relative
    humidity (Hr), wind speed (U2), global and extra-terrestrial solar radiation (Rs
    and Ra) with Tmax, Tmin and Ra as the base dataset were considered using meteorological
    data during 1961–2010 from eight representative weather stations in different
    climates of China. The results showed that, when lack of complete meteorological
    data, the machine learning models using Tmax, Tmin, Hr, U2 and Ra obtained satisfactory
    ET0 estimates in the temperate continental, mountain plateau and temperate monsoon
    zones of China (RMSE < 0.5 mm d−1). However, models with three input parameters
    of Tmax, Tmin and Rs were superior for daily ET0 prediction in the tropical and
    subtropical zones. The ELM and SVM models offered the best combination of prediction
    accuracy and stability. The simple tree-based XGBoost and GBDT models showed comparable
    accuracy and stability to the SVM and ELM models, but exhibited much less computational
    costs. Considering the complexity level, prediction accuracy, stability and computational
    costs of the studied models, the XGBoost and GBDT models have been recommended
    for daily ET0 estimation in different climatic zones of China and maybe elsewhere
    with similar climates around the world. Previous article in issue Next article

    (ET), the water loss to the atmosphere from soil evaporation and plant transpiration,
    is a significant factor in the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions and is an essential
    component of surface water budget and energy balance (Torres et al., 2011; Liu
    et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2017c; Fan et al., 2018a). Accurate
    estimation of crop water requirements (i.e. actual evapotranspiration, ETa) is
    a prerequisite for irrigation scheduling design and planning (Perera et al., 2014;
    Kisi, 2016). Although ETa can be directly measured using water vapor transfer
    methods (e.g. eddy covariance and Bowen ratio) or water budget measurements (e.g.
    weighting lysimeters) (Ding et al., 2010), their applications are largely restricted
    due to the high costs and technical complexities, particularly for developing
    countries. ETa can be alternatively estimated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) with the crop coefﬁcient (Kc) (Jensen, 1968). The FAO-56 Penman–Monteith
    (FAO-56 PM) model which incorporates the thermodynamic and aerodynamic effects
    has proved to be more accurate than the other existing empirical models. Thus,
    it has been highly recommended by FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the
    United Nations) as the reference model for ET0 calculation around the world (Allen
    et al., 1998). Nevertheless, the FAO-56 PM model requires a large number of input
    meteorological variables for its utilization, e.g., maximum/minimum air temperature,
    wind speed, relative humidity and solar radiation (Feng et al., 2017c; Fan et
    al., 2018c, Fan et al., 2018d), which is a major drawback of this model. Application
    of ET0 models with fewer meteorological variable inputs is thus required where
    lack of incomplete meteorological data (Wen et al., 2015). Over the past few decades,
    many efforts have been made to predict ET0 from simple empirical models with limited
    data inputs (Mehdizadeh et al., 2017), e.g. temperature-based models (Hargreaves
    and Samani, 1985; Oudin et al., 2005), mass transfer-based models (Trabert, 1896;
    Romanenko, 1961) and radiation-based models (Priestley and Taylor, 1972; Xu et
    al., 2000; Tabari et al., 2013). However, these simplified empirical models are
    considered to be most suited to estimate ET0 on a weekly or monthly basis but
    less suitable for daily ET0 estimation (Torres et al., 2011). The calculation
    of ET0 can be considered as a complex and non-linear regression process depending
    on a large number of meteorological variables. It is hard to develop accurate
    empirical models to represent all the complex processes. Therefore, researchers
    have put forward to machine learning algorithms for ET0 estimation because they
    require no knowledge of internal variables and offer simple solutions for non-linear
    and multi-variable functions (Kisi, 2015; Wang et al., 2017). The prediction accuracy
    of ET0 in data scarce regions can be significantly improved by the machine learning
    models due to their excellent capability of tackling non-linear relationships
    between the dependent and independent variables. Various machine learning techniques
    have been proposed to predict ET0, including (1) artificial neural networks (ANNs),
    e.g. multi-layer perceptron (MLP) (Torres et al., 2011; Ladlani et al., 2014;
    Traore et al., 2016), generalized regression neural networks (Kisi, 2006; Ladlani
    et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2017a, c), radial basis function neural networks (RBF)
    (Trajkovic, 2005; Ladlani et al., 2012; Petković et al., 2016) and extreme learning
    machine (ELM) (Abdullah et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2016; Gocic et al., 2016);
    (2) kernel-based algorithms, e.g. supportvector machine (SVM) (Eslamian et al.,
    2009; Torres et al., 2011; Tabari et al., 2012; Shiri et al., 2014; Wen et al.,
    2015; Shrestha and Shukla, 2015) and least-squares support vector machine (Guo
    et al., 2011; Kisi, 2013a, 2016); (3) tree-based assemble models, e.g., M5 model
    tree (M5Tree) (Pal and Deswal, 2009; Rahimikhoob, 2014; Kisi and Kilic, 2016)
    and random forest (RF) (Feng et al., 2017a); and (4) other machine learning models,
    e.g. adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) (Dogan, 2009; Cobaner, 2011;
    Baba et al., 2013; Shiri et al., 2014; Petković et al., 2015), multivariate adaptive
    regression spline (MARS) (Kisi and Parmar, 2016; Deo et al., 2016), genetic programming
    (GP) (Shiri et al., 2012; Gocić et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2016) and fuzzy genetic
    models (Kisi and Cengiz, 2013; Kisi, 2013b). Among these machine learning models,
    the SVM and ELM models exhibited generally better prediction accuracy than the
    other models (Abdullah et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2016; Gocic
    et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2017c; Yin et al., 2017a). Tabari et al. (2012) evaluated
    the performances of SVM, ANFIS, multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple non-linear
    regression (MNLR) and empirical models for ET0 estimation in a semi-arid environment
    of Iran. It was found that the SVM and ANFIS models were superior to those of
    the regression and empirical models. Wen et al. (2015) estimated daily ET0 using
    the SVM model with limited meteorological data in the extreme arid regions of
    China. The results indicated that the SVM model produced more accurate ET0 estimates
    than the ANN and empirical models. Kisi (2016) compared the accuracies of LSSVM,
    MARS and M5Tree for predicting ET0 in the Mediterranean Region of Turkey. It was
    concluded that the LSSVM model outperformed the MARS and M5Tree models. Abdullah
    et al. (2015) firstly identified the good efficiency and generalization performance
    of the ELM models for ET0 estimation in Iraq. Feng et al. (2017c) also predicted
    ET0 using the ELM and GRNN models with only temperature data in southwest China.
    The results showed that the ELM model performed better than the GRNN and Hargreaves
    models. The SVM and ELM models have also been hybridized with other algorithms,
    e.g. genetic algorithm (GA) (Yin et al., 2017b), wavelet transform (WT) (Gocić
    et al., 2015) and firefly algorithm (FFA) (Gocić et al., 2015) to optimize the
    calibration process and improve the prediction accuracy. Most of the well-established
    machine learning models, however, are complex and require high computational costs
    during training phase (Hassan et al., 2017). The tree-based ensemble models, e.g.
    M5Tree and RF models, have recently begun to attract people’s attention, because
    they are relatively simple but still powerful algorithms for classification and
    regression problems (Alipour et al., 2014; Hassan et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2017b).
    Pal and Deswal (2009) investigated the potential of the M5Tree model to estimate
    daily ET0 in California, USA. The results suggested that the M5Tree model could
    be successfully applied in modeling ET0. Rahimikhoob (2014) compared the M5Tree
    and feed-forward ANN to estimate ET0 in an arid climate. They found the estimated
    ET0 values by the M5Tree and ANN models were in good agreement with those obtained
    by the FAO-56 PM model. Kisi and Kilic (2016) also explored the generalization
    performance of the M5Tree and ANN models for estimating ET0 in two different areas
    of the USA. It was concluded that the M5Tree and ANN models outperformed the empirical
    models and the M5Tree model was a better choice than ANN for ET0 prediction when
    lack of local input and output data. Feng et al. (2017a) have recently applied
    the RF model and compared it with the GRNN model for daily ET0 estimation in southwest
    China. The results indicated that both the RF and GRNN models performed satisfactorily
    for estimating daily ET0, and the RF model performed slightly better than the
    GRNN model. Shiri (2018) also employed the RF model coupled with the wavelet algorithm
    to estimate daily ET0 at five weather stations in Southern Iran. It was found
    that the novel coupled RF models greatly improved the performance of the conventional
    RF model and the empirical models. Recently, two improved versions of gradient
    boosting models named gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) (Friedman, 2002)
    and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) (Chen et al., 2015) have been widely used
    in many other fields (Son et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Sheridan et al., 2016;
    Babajide Mustapha and Saeed, 2016; Song et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2018b) because
    they showed higher computational efficiency and better ability to deal with over-fitting
    problems. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, these two models have
    not yet been applied in ET0 studies. It is apparent from the related reviews that
    the ANNs, SVM and ELM models have been frequently used for modeling ET0, while
    the tree-based ensemble models, especially the GBDT and XGBoost models have been
    very minimal. Additionally, the comparison of these simple tree-based models with
    the commonly used SVM and ELM models has not been comprehensively conducted yet,
    particularly their applicability for estimating ET0 with various input combinations
    of meteorological data under different climatic conditions. Although the high
    prediction accuracy is primarily considered when employing the machine learning
    models, the good stability and less computational effort are also essential to
    consider (Hassan et al., 2017). Some models are inherently unstable and may yield
    less accurate estimates when new dataset is used for prediction. The machine learning
    models are also highly time-consuming compared with the empirical models, especially
    when long-term series meteorological data from multiple sites were used for model
    development. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to: (1) to determine
    the effects of different input combination of meteorological data on the accuracy
    of daily ET0 prediction in different climates of China, (2) to develop four tree-based
    ensemble models, i.e. RF, M5Tree, GBDT and XGBoost, for modeling daily ET0 using
    limited meteorological data, and (3) to compare the prediction accuracy, stability
    as well as computational costs of these tree-based models with their corresponding
    SVM and ELM models for estimating daily ET0. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study
    area description Based on temperature, precipitation and altitude, China can be
    divided into five climatic zones (Fig. 1), i.e. the temperate continental zone
    (TCZ), temperate monsoon zone (TMZ), mountain plateau zone (MPZ), subtropical
    monsoon zone (SMZ) and tropical monsoon zone (TPMZ) (Fan et al., 2016). The TCZ
    is defined as an arid region, characterized by a mean annual precipitation of
    269 mm and a mean annual evaporation of 2148 mm. The mean annual precipitation
    are 585 mm for TMZ, 382 mm for MPZ, 1320 mm for SMZ and 1683 mm for TPMZ, while
    the corresponding mean annual pan evaporation are 1475 mm, 1883 mm, 1545 mm and
    1175 mm. Based on those, the MPZ, TMZ, SMZ and TPMZ can be defined as the semi-arid,
    semi-humid, humid and humid zone, respectively. The mean altitudes are 912 m above
    sea level for TCZ, 288 m for TMZ, 4236 m for MPZ, 611 m for SMZ and 576 m for
    TPMZ (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (648KB) Download : Download

    analysis Continuous and long-time series of observed daily maximum/minimum air
    temperature (Tmax/Tmin), relative humidity (Hr), wind speed at 10 m height (U10)
    and global solar radiation (Rs) during 1961–2010 were collected from eight typical
    weather stations in different climatic zones of China (Fig. 1). A detailed description
    of the studied weather stations can be found in Table 1. The weather data were
    provided and quality examined by the National Meteorological Information Center
    (NMIC) of China Meteorological Administration (CMA). The daily extra-terrestrial
    solar radiation (Ra, MJ m−2 d−1) was also determined as per the procedures described
    by Allen et al. (1998) as a function of site latitude, solar declination angle
    and Julian day of the year. Data were excluded if any of the above meteorological
    data was missing or the ratio between Rs and Ra was greater than 1. Overall, deleted
    and missing data accounted for approximately 2.1% of the database, ranging from
    0.1% to 7.9% at various weather stations (Table 1). Table 1. The geographical

    of reference evapotranspiration using FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation The Penman–Monteith
    equation recommended by the FAO (Allen et al., 1998) was employed to estimate
    daily ET0 (mm day−1) in the present study, which is the most universally accepted
    model for predicting ET0 in different climates (Dinpashoh et al., 2011; Tabari
    et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Piticar et al., 2015; Kisi, 2015). (1) where Rn
    is the surface net solar radiation (MJ m−2 day-1); G is the soil heat flux density
    (MJ m−2 day-1); T is the mean air temperature (°C), i.e., T=(Tmax+Tmin)/2; U2
    is the wind speed at 2 m height (m s-1), converted from the wind speed measurement
    at 10 m height(U10) using a logarithmic wind speed profile (Allen et al., 1998);
    es is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa); ea is the actual vapor pressure (kPa);
    Δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve (kPa °C-1), and γ is the psychrometric
    constant (kPa °C-1). The detailed procedures for ET0 calculation can be found
    in the FAO 56 paper (Allen et al., 1998). 2.4. Machine learning algorithms for
    estimating reference evapotranspiration 2.4.1. Support vector machine (SVM) The
    SVM algorithm developed by Vapnik (2013) is a supervised machine learning model
    for pattern recognition and data analysis, and it has been widely employed for
    regression and forecasting in the fields of agriculture, hydrology, meteorology
    and environmental studies (Shrestha and Shukla, 2015; Ghorbani et al., 2017; Fan
    et al., 2018e). The SVM model estimates the regression based on a series of kernel
    functions, which are able to convert the original, lower-dimensional input data
    to a higher-dimensional feature space implicitly. The SVM model has obtained importance
    in predicting ET0 (Wen et al., 2015; Mehdizadeh et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2017b).
    The commonly used RBF non-linear kernel function was used in this study due to
    its better performance in ET0 estimations compared with other kernel functions
    (Kisi, 2015). The detailed information and computation procedure of the SVM model
    can be found in Vapnik (2013). 2.4.2. Extreme learning machine (ELM) The ELM model
    was first proposed by Huang et al. (2006), who argued that its learning speed
    was much faster than the feed-forward neural network (FFNN) models with better
    generalization capability. The ELM model consists of three layers: an input layer
    (input metrological variables), a hidden layers (neurons) and an output layers
    (ET0). All the model parameters have to be tuned in the traditional FFNN models,
    whilst the hidden layer does not need to be tuned in the ELM model. More details
    about the ELM model can be found in Huang et al. (2006). 2.4.3. Random forest
    (RF) The RF model was proposed by Breiman (2001) and used Breiman’s “bagging”
    idea to ensemble a collection of decision trees with controlled variance. The
    RF model has been widely applied for regression and forecasting problems. The
    RF model deals with random binary trees which employs a subset of the observations
    through the bootstrapping technique, where a random subset of the training dataset
    is sampled from the raw dataset and used to develop the model. The dataset not
    included in the model development are referred to “out-of-bag” (OOB) and are applied
    to evaluate the general problems. Further details about the RF model can be found
    in Breiman (2001). 2.4.4. M5 model tree (M5Tree) The M5Tree model was initially
    proposed by Quinlan et al. (1992), and then the idea was reconstructed and improved
    by Wang and Witten (1997). The M5Tree model has linear regression functions at
    the terminal nodes, which establishes a correlation between the input and output
    parameters. The M5Tree model generally requires two different stages. Firstly,
    the raw data are divided into subsets to create a decision tree, based on treating
    the standard deviation of the class values and calculating the expected reduction
    in errors. The M5Tree model chooses the one that maximizes the expected error
    reduction after scanning all the possible splits. The over-grown tree is pruned
    and these sub-trees are taken over by the linear regression functions in the second
    stage. More details of the M5Tree model can be found from Quinlan et al. (1992)
    and Wang and Witten (1997). 2.4.5. Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) The
    GBDT model is a widely used method for classiﬁcation and regression problems proposed
    by Friedman (2002), which used decision stumps or regression tress as weak classifiers.
    In the GBDT model, the weak learners measure the error observed in each node and
    split the node using a test function. The GBDT model is a similar method to the
    RF model which combines a set of weak learners, but the major difference between
    the GBDT and RF models lies on that the tree in the GBDT is ﬁt on the residual
    of the former trees, so that the GBDT model can reduce the biases, while the RF
    model reduces the variances. Therefore, the RF model can be trained in parallel,
    whereas the GBDT cannot. The GBDT model is thus superior to the RF model in terms
    of over-fitting and computational costs. The detailed information and computation
    procedure of the GBDT model can be found in Friedman (2002). 2.4.6. Extreme gradient
    boosting (XGBoost) The XGBoost algorithm proposed by Chen and Guestrin (2016)
    is a novel implementation method for Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) and in
    particular K Classification and Regression Trees (CART). The algorithm is originated
    from the idea of "boost", which combines all the predictions of a set of “weak”
    learners for developing a “strong” learner through the additive training strategies.
    The XGBoost model is aimed to prevent over-fitting but also minimize the computational
    costs. This is obtained by simplifying the objective functions that allow combining
    the predictive and regularization terms, but maintaining an optimal computational
    efficiency. Also, parallel calculations are automatically executed for the functions
    in the XGBoost model during the training phrase. The detailed information of the
    XGBoost model can be found in Chen et al. (2015). 2.5. Input combinations and
    K-fold cross-validation As shown in Table 2, four input combinations were considered
    in this study to evaluate the effects of different meteorological variables on
    daily ET0 estimation: (1) complete Tmax, Tmin, U2, Hr and Rs; (2) Tmax, Tmin,
    U2, Hr and Ra; (3) Tmax, Tmin and Rs and (4) only Tmax, Tmin and Ra were used
    for models. In the present study, the K-fold cross-validation method was used
    and the measured meteorological data during 1961–2010 were equally divided into
    five stages. Four stages were employed to train the machine learning models and
    the remaining one for testing the models. The testing stage was changed in every
    application and thus the machine learning models were tested at five different
    stages. Table 3 presents the various cross-validation stages involved in the present
    study. Program codes were written in the R software (version 3.2.3; R Project
    for Statistical Computing) to develop the selected machine learning models. The
    model parameters were optimized by using a grid search method. All the simulations
    were performed in a computer with 2×Intel Xeon CPU E5 2670 @ 2.6–3.3 GHz and 16
    GB of RAM memory. Table 2. The input combinations of meteorological variables

    The accuracy and performance of the studied models for daily ET0 estimation were
    evaluated and compared using three commonly used statistical indicators (Despotovic
    et al., 2015), which were coefficient of determination (R2, Eq. (2)), root mean
    square error (RMSE, Eq. (3)) and mean absolute error (MAE, Eq. (4)). The mathematical
    equations of the statistical indicators are described below. (2) (3) (4) where
    Yi,m, Yi,e, and n are the measured, estimated and the mean of measured global
    solar radiation and the number of observations, respectively. Higher values of
    R2 are preferred, i.e. closer to 1 means better model performance and regression
    line fits the data well. On the contrary, the lower the RMSE and MAE values are,
    the better the model performs. In view of the requirements of the SVM and ELM
    models, the raw meteorological data were normalized ranging from 0 to 1 before
    putting in the machine learning models using the following formula: (5) where
    xn and xi represent the moralized and raw training and testing data; xmax and
    xmin are the minimum and maximum of the training and testing data. 3. Results
    3.1. Comparison of model accuracy under various input combinations The statistical
    results of the six machine learning models for predicting daily ET0 at Urumqi,
    Yinchuan, Geermu, Lase, Harbin, Beijing, Wuhan and Guangzhou are provided in Table

    and XGBoost models under four input combinations in both training and testing
    stages. Similar results have been observed for the eight studied weather stations

    differed significantly depending on model types and input combinations. Taking
    China’s capital city of Beijing for example (Table 9), the RF models showed the
    highest R2 and lowest RMSE and MAE in the training stage for all input combinations,
    as compared to the SVM, ELM and the other three ensemble models. The ranks of
    the studied models in terms of prediction accuracy in the training stage were:
    RF, M5Tree, XGBoost, GBDT, ELM and SVM. In the testing stage, the SVM and ELM
    models had identical performance (difference in RMSE < 2%) in estimating daily
    ET0 for all input combinations, both of which performed superior to the four tree-based
    ensemble models in predicting daily ET0. However, the GBDT and XGBoost models
    showed comparable estimates of daily ET0 to the SVM and ELM models, with an increase
    in RMSE by 9%–10% for the complete dataset (Tmax, Tmin, U2, Hr and Rs) and only
    by 1%–2% for the combinations of three input parameters. As seen from Table 9,
    the models employing complete meteorological data had the best prediction accuracy,
    as compared with the incomplete data inputs. The average RMSE values ranged from
    0.13 mm d−1 in complete input combination up to 0.74 mm d−1 in the input combination
    of only Tmax, Tmin and Ra in the training stage, and the corresponding values
    varied from 0.17 mm d−1 up to 0.89 mm d−1 in the testing stage. The complete input
    dataset without Rs produced satisfactory daily ET0 estimates with an average RMSE
    value of 0.31 mm d-1 and 0.42 mm d−1 in the training and testing stage, respectively.
    However, models with three input parameters of Tmax, Tmin and Rs were also capable
    of predicting daily ET0 with acceptable accuracy, having an average RMSE value
    of 0.49 mm d-1 and 0.60 mm d−1 in the training and testing stage, respectively.
    The scatter plots of ET0 values calculated by the FAO-56 PM model and the values
    predicted by the six machine learning models during five cross-validation stages
    using the complete dataset in the testing stage are shown in Fig. 2. From the
    figure, it is clear that the studied models provided different prediction accuracies
    during different stages. Generally, higher errors were obtained for the S1 testing
    dataset (1961–1970), and the S4 and S5 testing datasets (1991–2000 and 2001–2010,
    respectively) produced higher prediction accuracy. However, the performance of
    all the models followed the same trend under different input datasets, where the
    ET0 values estimated by the SVM, ELM, XGBoost and GBDT models were more close
    to those computed by the FAO-56 PM equation. There were favorable correlations
    between the predicted values by the XGBoost, GBDT, ELM and SVM models and the
    FAO56-PM values. The dispersion degree of the data points in the scatter plots
    of these models was substantially lower than that in the plots of the RF and M5Tree
    models. Download : Download high-res image (878KB) Download : Download full-size

    in the testing stage. Fig. 3 shows the scatter plots of predicted ET0 values by
    the six machine learning models (for China’s capital city of Beijing) against
    their corresponding FAO56-PM values in the testing stage. As seen from Fig. 3,
    the RF and M5Tree models produced more scattered estimates than the other machine
    learning models. The ET0 values estimated by the SVM, ELM, XGBoost and GBDT models
    were more close to the calculated ET0 values by the FAO-56 PM equation and generally
    followed the same trend. This consistence indicated that these four models exhibited
    better prediction accuracy of daily ET0 (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows the time-series
    plots of FAO56-PM ET0 values and estimated daily ET0 by various machine learning
    models throughout the year 2010 for Beijing under different input combinations.
    The figures illustrated the satisfactory prediction accuracy of the proposed tree-based
    models although they were relatively simple and required small number of input
    parameters. Especially, the GBDT and XGBoost models had comparable good performance
    in estimating ET0 to the SVM and ELM models. This proved the high potential of
    the tree-based XGBoost and GBDT models for the prediction of daily ET0. Download

    From Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11,
    all the employed models provided different accuracies under different input combinations
    at various weather stations. Similar to Beijing, the models employing full meteorological
    variables provided the best prediction accuracy in both training and testing stages
    at all the other stations. Based on the statistical indicators provided in the
    Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11, both
    the SVM and ELM models showed very close estimates in the testing stage, while
    the RF and M5Tree’s estimates were generally less accurate. The SVM and ELM models
    outperformed the tree-based models in predicting ET0 at all stations, but the
    GBDT and XGBoost models obtained comparable estimates to the SVM and ELM models.
    The ranks of the studied models in terms of prediction accuracy in the testing
    stage were: ELM, SVM, XGBoost, GBDT, RF and M5Tree. The ensemble models developed
    for Geermu (0.381 mm d−1), Lasa (0.346 mm d−1), Wuhan (0.378 mm d−1) and Guangzhou
    (0.382 mm d−1) generally outperform their corresponding models for Urumqi (0.459 mm
    d−1), Yinchuan (0.424 mm d−1), Harbin (0.437 mm d−1) and Beijing (0.469 mm d−1)
    in terms of average RMSE. When lack of complete dataset, ET0 values estimated
    by the machine learning models with Tmax, Tmin, Hr, U2 and Ra were in good agreement
    with the corresponding FAO-56 PM values at Urumqi, Yinchuan, Geermu, Lasa, Harbin
    and Beijing (RMSE < 0.5 mm d−1). However, the models with Tmax, Tmin and Rs were
    more preferred at Wuhan and Guangzhou compared with the models with the input
    combination of Tmax, Tmin, Hr, U2 and Ra. 3.2. Comparison of stability of various
    machine learning models In general, the RF model outperformed the corresponding
    M5Tree, GBDT, XGBoost, SVM and ELM models in the training stage (marked in bold
    in Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11).
    However, the ELM and SVM models outperformed the tree-based models in the testing
    stage, but the XGBoost and GBDT models showed comparable performances to the ELM
    and SVM models. The average training and testing RMSE of the eight weather stations
    are shown in Fig. 5 for all the studied machine learning models. The figure showed
    that the ELM and SVM algorithms provided the best prediction in the testing stage
    for all input combinations, where the M5Tree and RF models had higher RMSE values.
    The percentage increase in testing RMSE over training RMSE (average for all weather
    stations) is also presented in Fig. 5. This figure indicated that the RF and M5Tree
    models consistently exhibited the largest percentage increase in testing RMSE
    for all the machine learning models (from 72% up to 130%). On the contrary, the
    SVM and ELM models were the most stable models with smallest increases in testing
    RMSE (from 1.6% up to 10.1%). However, the GBDT and XGBoost models had satisfactory
    percentage increase in testing RMSE, ranging from 9% up to 15% in combinations
    of five input parameters, but less than 6% in combinations of three input parameters.

    costs of various machine learning models Fig. 6 presents the averaged computational
    costs (time used for computation) for all weather stations of all machine learning
    models. Here, a single sample (with five folds) was considered for model comparison.
    The figure indicated that the average time consumed by the SVM and ELM algorithm
    was much higher than those of the corresponding tree-based algorithms. The computational
    costs of the SVM algorithm were approximately 1.4 times the computational costs
    of the ELM, RF and GBDT models, and approximately 2.0 times the computational
    costs of the M5Tree model, and approximately 2.4 times the computational costs
    of the XGBoost model. Among the studied machine learning models, the XGBoost model
    showed considerably less computational costs, especially for the input combination
    of Tmax, Tmin and Ra. Download : Download high-res image (172KB) Download : Download

    U2, Hr and Rs). 4. Discussion 4.1. Input combination strategy of meteorological
    data The type of the input parameters played a significant role in the prediction
    accuracy of the machine learning models for estimating daily ET0. The models employing
    complete meteorological data showed the best prediction accuracy compared with
    the incomplete data inputs in the present study. The results indicated that, when
    lack of global solar radiation measurement, the ET0 values estimated by machine
    learning models were in good agreement with the corresponding FAO-56 PM values
    in the temperate continental, mountain plateau and temperate monsoon climatic
    zones. However, at Wuhan and Guangzhou located in the tropical and subtropical
    monsoon zones, the machine leaning models with maximum/maximum temperature and
    global solar radiation were more preferred. Feng et al. (2017a) also revealed
    that the machine leaning models with maximum/maximum temperature and sunshine
    duration obtained satisfactory ET0 estimation in the humid region of Southwest
    China. These results indicated that the global solar radiation or sunshine duration
    was more important than the relative humidity and wind speed for daily ET0 estimation
    upon air temperatures in the tropical and subtropical monsoon zones of China (and
    vice versa in the other climatic zones). The models based on only air temperatures
    and extra-terrestrial solar radiation can also produce acceptable ET0 estimates
    in regions where measurements of the other meteorological variables like wind
    speed, relative humidity and global solar radiation are not readily available.
    The results are generally in accordance with the previous studies (Torres et al.,
    2011; Tabari et al., 2012; Antonopoulos and Antonopoulos, 2017), which concluded
    that more input parameters generally improve the model prediction accuracy, but
    the contribution of meteorological variables to the ET0 estimation differed in
    various climates. 4.2. Prediction accuracy of machine learning models The SVM
    and ELM models generally exhibited identical performance in estimating daily ET0
    for all input combinations, both of which outperformed the four tree-based ensemble
    models at all weather stations during the testing stage. Wen et al. (2015) have
    found the SVM model produced more accurate ET0 estimates than the ANN model for
    estimating daily ET0 in the extreme arid regions of China. Feng et al., 2016,
    Feng et al., 2017c also revealed the superiority of the ELM model to the GRNN,
    GANN and WNN models for ET0 estimation in southwest China. Guo et al. (2011) argued
    that the LSSVM model could be successfully used for ET0 estimation in Changwu
    of China. However, the XGBoost and GBDT models obtained comparable estimates of
    ET0 to the SVM and ELM models, with an small difference in RMSE less than 10%
    for the complete data input combination (Tmax, Tmin, U2, Hr and Rs). In addition,
    differences in the prediction accuracy between these models using the combinations
    of three input parameters were small (increase in RMSE < 2%). Feng et al. (2017a)
    have found that the RF model performed slightly better than the GRNN model for
    predicting daily ET0 in southwest China. The results also indicated that all the
    machine learning models obtained better prediction accuracy in the mountain plateau
    and temperate monsoon climates compared with the temperate continental and (sub)tropical
    monsoon climates. Various statistical errors were obtained during the five cross-validation
    stages, which was largely due to the temporal variability in meteorological variables
    among the stages. This further confirmed the necessity of the application of the
    K-fold cross-validation method for reliable estimation of daily ET0 in different
    climates (Kisi, 2016). 4.3. Stability of machine learning models The stability
    of machine learning models is also a critical factor to consider when estimating
    reliable ET0. The present study showed that the RF and M5Tree models consistently
    exhibited the largest percentage increase in testing RMSE for all machine learning
    models. This increase revealed the instability of the RF and M5Tree models as
    they produced significant decrease in prediction accuracy when new meteorological
    data was utilized. Hassan et al. (2017) have also indicated that the RF and bagging
    models generally exhibited larger increase in testing RMSE than the support vector
    regression (SVR) and gradient models for estimating global solar radiation. The
    RF and M5Tree models generally perform well for classification problems, but they
    are inferior for regression problems because they are not able to provide continuous
    outputs. In this case, these two models can not make a prediction beyond the range
    of the training dataset, thereby leading to over-fitting when noisy testing data
    are used for prediction. However, the GBDT and XGBoost models exhibited better
    stability with acceptable percentage increase, where the successive trees give
    extra weight to the points incorrectly predicted by the earlier predictors and
    a weighted vote is finally taken for prediction (Liaw and Wiener, 2002). This
    strategy can largely avoid the over-fitting problem. On the contrary, the SVM
    and ELM models were the most stable models with smallest increases in testing
    RMSE. In addition, the GBDT and XGBoost models have a large number of hyperparameters,
    which need to be carefully tuned for model application. Thus, a K-fold cross-validation
    method is further required to select the optimal parameters and ensure the good
    stability of the machine learning models. 4.4. Computational costs of machine
    learning models The results indicated that the average time consumed by the SVM
    and ELM algorithms was much higher than those of the corresponding tree-based
    algorithms. Specifically, the computational costs of the SVM model were approximately
    1.4 times the computational costs of the ELM, RF and GBDT models, and approximately
    2.0 times the computational costs of the M5Tree model with a single tree and approximately
    2.4 times the computational costs of the XGBoost model. Among all the studied
    models, the XGBoost model showed the least computational costs. However, it was
    found that the computational costs of most machine learning models would increase
    with the increase in the value and number of the employed model parameters. Hassan
    et al. (2017) have also indicated that the computational costs of the traditional
    SVR model were up to 39 times the computational costs of the tree-based ensemble
    methods (bagging, RF, boosting and decision tree) for estimating global solar
    radiation. The good computational efficiency of the RF and XGBoost models are
    largely due to the fact that they can be trained in parallel, whereas the other
    studied models can not. The time differences among the models are supposed to
    be much larger on a smaller time scale (e.g. hourly) or when long-term series
    meteorological data multiple sites were employed for general model development.
    4.5. Comprehensive evaluation of machine learning models Based on the above results,
    the six machine learning models can be ranked from best to worst as follows in
    terms of prediction accuracy: ELM, SVM, XGBoost, GBDT, RF and M5Tree. Considering
    their stability, these models can be further ordered as follows: SVM, ELM, GBDT,
    XGBoost, RF and M5Tree. Also, these models can be ordered based on their computational
    costs as follows: XGBoost, M5Tree, GBDT, RF, ELM and SVM. Machine learning models
    are often utilized to predict ET0 as they are more accurate than the empirical
    models. However, unstable machine-learning models can produce much lower prediction
    accuracy when new data is introduced, while empirical models are generally stable
    by nature (Hassan et al., 2017). For the studied models, the ELM and SVM models
    offered the best combination of prediction accuracy and stability, followed by
    the XGBoost and GBDT algorithms. Considering the complexity level of the selected
    models, their prediction accuracy, stability as well as computational costs, the
    relatively simple tree-based XGBoost and GBDT models can be recommended for predicting
    daily ET0. These two tree-based algorithms showed comparable prediction accuracy
    and stability to the SVM and ELM models, but exhibited much less computational
    costs. This suggested that they would be promising machine learning models in
    terms of accuracy, stability and computational efficiency for predicting daily
    ET0 using limited meteorological data in different climates of China and maybe
    elsewhere with similar climates. 5. Conclusions This paper presented an application
    of four tree-based machine learning algorithms, including the RF, M5Tree, GBDT
    and XGBoost models, for accurately estimating daily ET0 with complete and incomplete
    meteorological data in different climates of China. The tree-based models were
    also compared with the commonly used SVM and ELM models using meteorological data
    from eight weather stations in China during 1961–2010. The results indicated that
    the global solar radiation was more important than the relative humidity and wind
    speed for daily ET0 estimation upon air temperatures in the tropical and subtropical
    monsoon zones of China, but vice versa in the other climatic zones. When lack
    of complete meteorological data, the machine learning models using Tmax, Tmin,
    Hr, U2 and Ra obtained satisfactory daily ET0 estimates in the temperate continental,
    mountain plateau and temperate monsoon zones of China. However, models with the
    three input parameters of Tmax, Tmin and Rs were superior for daily ET0 prediction
    in the tropical and subtropical zones. The ELM and SVM models offered the best
    combination of prediction accuracy and stability than the tree-based assemble
    models. However, the developed XGBoost and GBDT models showed comparable performances
    to the corresponding SVM and ELM models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability,
    with much less computational costs. In addition, they were more stable and accurate
    than the corresponding RF and M5Tree models. Thus, the relatively simple tree-based
    XGBoost and GBDT models are highly recommended as promising alternative techniques
    for predicting daily ET0 with limited climatic data in various climates of China.
    However, further study is required to evaluate the performance of proposed tree-based
    ensemble models at different time scales (hourly or monthly) or in different climates
    around the world. Acknowledgements This study was jointly supported by the National

    Get rights and content Highlights • Estimation of the reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) of Punjab. • Different H2O-based machine learning models are compared in
    predicting daily ETo. • The performance of DL model is compared to Penman–Monteith,
    RF, GLM and GBM models. • DL model performed better than the considered models
    for training, validation and testing sets. Abstract Over the last decade, the
    combination of both big data and machine learning research area’s receiving considerable
    attention and expedite the prospect of the agricultural industry. This research
    aims to gain insights into a state-of-the-art big data application in smart farming.
    An essential issue for agriculture planning is to estimate evapotranspiration
    accurately because it plays a pivotal role in irrigation water scheduling for
    using water efficiently. This article presents H2O model framework to determine
    the daily for Hoshiarpur and Patiala districts of Punjab. The effects of four
    supervised learning algorithms: Deep Learning-Multilayer Perceptrons (DL), Generalized
    Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient-Boosting Machine (GBM) and
    also evaluate the overall ability to predict future . Analysis of these four models,
    perform in H2O framework. This framework presents a new criterion to train, validate,
    test and improve the classification efficiency using machine learning algorithms.
    The performance of the DL model is compared with other state-of-art of models
    such as RF, GLM and GBM. In this respect, our analysis depicts that models presents
    high performance for modeling daily (e.g. NSE = 0.95–0.98, r2 = 0.95–0.99, ACC = 85–95,
    MSE = 0.0369–0.1215, RMSE = 0.1921–0.2691). Previous article in issue Next article

    Introduction Over the last three decades, India’s agriculture sector has been
    transformed from the traditional to modern practice through the effective deployment
    of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Central Indian Punjab is
    well-known for its agricultural activities and has occupied a high percentage
    of land area in all over India and its agricultural production mainly depends
    on irrigation. Punjab has the highest percentage of 97.95% of the gross irrigated
    area of the total cropped area (Singh et al., 2012). Recently, the achievement
    of Green Revolution is endangered by a significant decline in water resources.
    As a result, water conservation and precision agriculture are becoming a vital
    issue in the tropical climate areas. Brahmanand et al., 2013, Sidhu et al., 2011,
    supported increasing in population and changing climate demand more water resources
    to increase the food production for achieving food security. Evapotranspiration
    ( ) is an imperative aspect of the hydrological cycle that is stirring water availability
    on the earth surface. It is one of the significant criteria of accurate quantification
    of crop water requirement that influence various hydrological processes, water
    resources planning and management in arid regions (Laaboudi et al., 2012, Wen
    et al., 2015, Tabari et al., 2012), determination of water budget (Baba et al.,
    2013), and irrigation water requirements (Yassin et al., 2016). Over the recent
    decades, a few works have been archived the basic significance of for agricultural
    irrigation scheduling (Porter et al., 2012, Senay et al., 2013), availability
    of water resource (Oki and Kanae, 2006), meteorological and hydrological forecasts
    (Findell et al., 2011) and environmental change scenarios identified related to
    drought indexes (Gao et al., 2011). In fact, the concept of reference evapotranspiration
    has been widely applied in determining the water demand for a particular crop.
    Thus, is a vital component of crop modeling (Allen et al., 1998) which required
    accomplish and precise weather information for its estimation. Commonly, FAO-56
    Penman-Monteith is used as the standard method to estimate the . The United Nations
    Food and Agriculture Organization proposed Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) method
    to calculate (Allen et al., 1998). However, with planning and management of crop
    water resources, it can be effective if the appropriate strategy is used to measure
    . The literature survey depicts that previously, several studies have been focused
    on trend based investigation by various researchers (Gao et al., 2011, Gocić et
    al., 2015, Feng et al., 2017). However, the applications of soft computing and
    big data analytic techniques for evapotranspiration modeling are limited in the
    literature. Various soft computing methods have been widely used to achieve the
    robustness, tractability, and provide a low-cost solution with a tolerance of
    imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and an approximation (Mehdizadeh et al.,
    2017, Gocić et al., 2015). In the domain of agriculture, big data analytic technologies
    have offered newly predictive models for estimation, for e.g. generalized neuro-fuzzy
    models (Kisi et al., 2011), artificial neural network (ANN), (Kumar et al., 2011),
    adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (Tabari et al., 2012), multi-layer perceptron
    neural network (MLPNN), (Zaji and Bonakdari, 2014, Malik et al., 2017, Malik et
    al., 2017), extreme learning machine (ELM) (Abdullah et al., 2015, Patil and Deka,
    2016), M5 Model Tree (Kisi, 2016), least square-support vector regression (LS-SVM),
    multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) (Kisi, 2016), GRNN (2016), ELM,
    WNN and GANN (Feng et al., 2016). In the traditional computational intelligence
    models, feature selection is required from variables according to some fundamental
    assumptions. The correctness of these assumptions may crucially affect the prediction
    accuracy. However, the era of big data analytics brings the new opportunities
    to improve the forecasting and predicting the accuracy of phenomena. Kaur Saggi
    and Jain (2018) explored the framework of the seven V’s and six main components
    of BDA, typical tools and technology over various domain application such as (smart
    agriculture, smart healthcare, cybersecurity and smart city) (Saggi and Jain,
    2018). H2O package has concentrated on scalable machine learning as the API for
    big data applications. It is an open source platform which mainly focuses on scalable
    machine learning and interactive data science. Palmer et al. (2005) suggested
    that the multi-model ensemble technique is progressively being utilized to enhance
    model estimations (Palmer et al., 2005). In recent years, Gradient boosting machine
    (GBM) has become a very popular and powerful machine-learning technique that accomplishes
    state-of-the-art results in a variety of practical tasks. Furthermore, it is a
    widely used for regression and classification dilemmas, which can generate a prediction
    model and present as an ensemble of weak prediction models, and typically decision
    trees (Hastie et al., 2009). Many researchers reported that generalized linear
    model (GLM) has been widely applied in rainfall modeling and forecasting (Chandler
    and Wheater, 2002, Kenabatho et al., 2012). The most important thing to know about
    deep learning is that new features are learned and transformed through these deep
    architectures in order to improve the overall learning accuracy. Wang et al. (2018)
    investigated that the both DL and traditional ML models are similar as a data-driven
    artificial intelligence technique that can be used to model the complex relationship
    between input and output. However, DL has an advantage over traditional machine
    learning, because of its high hierarchical structure model feature learning, construction,
    and training (Wang et al., 2018). Random Forests (RF) technique is a well-known
    method for forecasting hourly global solar radiation. Nonetheless, the model has
    been found to perform especially very fast and efficiently handled big datasets
    and to avoid overfitting as a predictor. The objective of this present study is
    to find accurate quantification for of Hoshiarpur and Patiala Districts of Punjab
    (India). To evaluate the applicability and validity of different evapotranspiration
    methods such as DL, RF, GLM, and GBM have been used. The model of daily calculation
    is proposed for two meteorological stations located in Northern Punjab (India),
    using 31 and 38 years of historical dataset. The main objectives of this paper
    are as follows: (i) To investigate the daily characteristics of the Hoshiarpur
    and Patiala stations. (ii) To develop and investigate the ability of DL, RF, GLM
    and GBM models for modeling the daily values. (iii) To compare newly proposed
    different modeling approaches with a Penman-Montieth method for quantification
    of daily . 2. Material and study area The climatic data of the district Hoshiarpur

    The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM56) (Allen et al., 1998) has been broadly used
    to analyze from meteorological factors and it is suggested as the standard technique
    by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Ladlani
    et al., 2012). In this paper, the estimation of is done by the PM method through
    software CROPWAT 8.0, which is developed by the Land and Water Development Division
    of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. In this study,
    the FAO-56 PM equation for estimating reference evapotranspiration is given by
    Allen et al. (1998): (1) where ET0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration (mm/day−1);
    = slope of saturation vapor pressure function (kPa C−1); = net radiation (MJ );
    G = soil heat flux density (MJ ); = psychometric constant (kPa C−1); T = mean
    air temperature ( C); u2 = average 24-h wind speed at 2 m height (ms−1); = saturation
    vapour pressure(kPa); = actual vapour pressure(kPa) and ( ) = vapour pressure
    deficit (kPa). 3.2. MissForest algorithm Missing data treatment (MDT) has been
    generally mentioned in the data-driven studies of psychology, social science,
    transportation, biology, and behavioral science (Sahri et al., 2014). However,
    the missing values in datasets have negative impacts on the estimation of accurate
    predictive accuracy and therefore, could lead to inconsistent results. MissForest
    is a random forest-based method to impute phenomic data (Stekhoven and Bühlmann,
    2011). In this examination, MissForest calculation is utilized to investigate
    the effect of missing information shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res
    image (299KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Missing data treatment.
    MissForest used an iterative imputation scheme by training a RF on observed values
    for each variable, followed by predicting the missing values and then proceeding
    iteratively until the stopping criteria is met. Besides, it can be run parallel
    to save computation time and the OOB (out-of-bag) imputation error to evaluate
    for the continuous and categorical parts of the imputed datasets. OOB is a method
    for calculating prediction error in random forest approach. The performance of
    this evaluation is observed by comparing the absolute difference between true
    imputation error ( ) and OOB imputation error ( ) in all simulation iterations.
    The method is repeated until the imputed values reach convergence. The difference
    for the set of continuous variables N in the data set is computed by: (2) ∊ ∊
    The normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) is determined as: (3) where is
    the total data matrix, the imputed data matrix. mean and var empirical mean and
    variance computed over the continuous missing values. In this section, the algorithm
    demonstrated that how missing data imputed in the dataset. The process of MissForest
    to impute the missing values: 1. X n p matrix, divide X sample into chunks . 2.

    Where, is observed values denoted by and missing values denoted by and denote
    new and previously imputed data matrix using predicted . During simulation, it
    is observed that MissForest performed the best in each chunk of dataset. The imputation
    procedure is repeated until a stopping criterion is required. In this study, we
    have considered the weather dataset of IMD, that consists of missing values (Missing
    at random). In First Round: The first process of iteration, the imputation of
    missing values have been divided by the data into three chunks, i.e. , , ,…, .
    For each Sample X dataset missing values are imputed by first fitting a random
    forest with response obs and predictors obs; then, predicting the missing values
    mis by applying the trained random forest to mis. Error results obtained by MissForest
    for Hoshiarpur and Patiala is shown in Table 5 and code iterations of rounds are
    described in Table 4. Table 5. Estimated error results of Hoshiarpur and Patiala

    multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965
    (Ivakhnenko, 1965). In this article, a technique for predicting daily using deep
    learning presented. A multi-layer DL model has been implemented by considering
    a number of multiple hidden layers and rectified linear active function. Thus,
    our model is trained with stochastic gradient descent using back-propagation.

    of deep learning. Deep learning has advanced features such as adaptive learning
    rate, rate annealing, momentum training, dropout, or regularization (Candel et
    al., 2016). In MLP, the weighted combination of input signals is aggregated, and
    then an output signal is transmitted by the connected neuron. The function f represents
    the non-linear activation function used throughout the network, and the bias b
    accounts for the neurons activation threshold. (4) The rectified linear (ReLU)
    function has demonstrated high performance on image recognition tasks. It is more
    biologically accurate and computationally cheaper. The rectified linear unit (ReLU)
    and is given by: (5) The derivative of ReLU is: The multinomial classification
    for calculating loss function is defined as Cross Entropy (6) ∊ In this paper,
    the DL model consists of 3 hidden layers and a varied number of hidden units is
    implemented. The six parameters are considered to set the model: the activation
    function: Rectifier, sparse as true, regularization, hidden layers: three layers
    using (40, 60, 40) hidden neurons, epochs: 100 etc and distribution as multinomial.
    Furthermore, the other potential tuning parameters at their H2O default values
    are defined in H2O book (2017). (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16)

    second hidden layer , the third hidden layer and final output layer. Here, Eqs.
    (12), (13) show that stochastic gradient descent has been applied to update the
    weights and bias via back-propagation for minimizing the prediction error. Standard
    SGD can be summarized as follows, with the gradient computed via back-propagation.
    3.4. Random forest Random Forest (RF) technique, presented by Breiman (2001),
    is created from the decision tree that aggregates the predictions from many decision
    trees on different subsets of data. RF is an ensemble learning technique, in which
    the performance of several weak learners is boosted via a voting scheme. Fig.
    4 shows the Random Forest. Further, a detailed methodological insights to set
    up model and validate the underlying machine learning approach with the RF method
    is presented. The construction of the random forest is described in the following
    steps: The random forest algorithm: Step 1: Bootstrap sampling: Generate ntree
    bootstrap sample sets from the original training dataset. Step 2: Random-forest
    tree growing: Grow a tree for each bootstrap for the dataset, at each node, select
    the best split among a randomly selected subset of input variables (mtry), which
    is the tuning parameter of random forest algorithm. (a) Randomly select sample
    “k” variables from all the input variables “m”. (b) Pick the best split predictor
    from those k features, where k m, and m is a number of all input variables. Step
    3: Ensemble averaging: Predict new output by averaging the outputs of n classification
    trees when new inputs are fed into RF. Assemble information from the ntree for
    new dataset prediction such as majority voting for classification. Step 4: Out-of-bag
    error estimation: Compute an out-of-bag (OOB) error rate by using the data, not
    in the bootstrap sample. Download : Download high-res image (110KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 4. Structure of random forest. The number of trees
    is referred to as ntree. For each split in a tree, mtry randomly drawn predictors
    are assessed as candidates for splitting and the predictor that yields the best
    split is chosen. The default values for mtry are p for classification and p/3
    for regression. For regression models, the prediction error is returned as a mean
    squared error (MSE). The four tuning parameters are used, i.e., the number of
    trees , their maximum depth, the number of mtree = 5, and distribution = multinomial.
    3.5. Generalized linear models The theory of generalized linear model (GLM’s)
    was reviewed thoroughly by McCullagh (1984). GLM can be applied in hydrology and
    meteorology stated by Chandler and Wheater (2002) and formulated by Nelder and
    Baker (1972). Generalized linear model is an extension of the classical linear
    regression models. GLM model can be fitted by solving the maximum likelihood optimization
    problem. In this paper, GLM is implemented and fitted with elastic-net penalties
    (Nykodym et al., 2018). The elastic net penalty is used for parameter regularization.
    The model fitting computation is distributed, extremely fast and scaled well for
    models with a limited number ( low thousands) of predictors with a non-zero coefficient.
    GLM is the model for solving the following likelihood optimization with parameter
    regularization: (GLM Log-likelihood– Regularization Penalty). This model presents
    the algorithm for the elastic-net, which include the lasso and ridge regression
    functionalities. GLM model penalties have been used to avoid overfitting, deal
    with corrected predictors and reduced the variance of the prediction error. The
    ridge regression and lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) are
    the popular penalized models that provide a feasibility and an elastic-net which
    combines both penalties for predicting the model. These penalized parameters are
    known as L1 and L2 penalties and it parametrized by the and arguments presented
    by Friedman (2001). Elastic net regularization penalty is the weighted sum of
    the L1 and L2 norms of the coefficients vector. By using this approach, handles
    the elastic net penalty distribution between the L1 and L2 norms. However, it
    can have any value in the [0; 1] range or a vector of values (which triggers grid
    search). If = 0, it determines the GLM model using ridge regression. If = 1, the
    lasso penalty is used. In case of , it handles the penalty strength in which the
    range is computed as a positive value or a vector of values. However, it models
    the likelihood of an observation belonging to an output category from given data
    (for instance Pr(y = c x)). The likelihoods are demonstrated as (17) The probabilities
    are defined as: (18) where is a vector of coefficients for class c and is the
    element of the binary vector developed by extending the response variable using
    one-hot encoding (i.e. == 1 if the response at the observation is k; otherwise
    is it 0.) The regularization parameters and are tune in order to find the optimal
    one and it provides a grid search over and a certain form of grid search called
    “lambda search” over . However, the value of parameter = 0.5, = 1.0E−5 is considered.
    Lambda search enables efficient and automatic search for the optimal value of
    the lambda parameter. When lambda search is enabled, GLM will first fit a model
    with maximum regularization and then keep decreasing it until over fitting occurs.
    The resulting model is based on the best lambda value. 3.6. Gradient boosting
    machine In order to minimize the loss function, a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)-optimization
    applied gradient computations by using the training dataset. This specific GBM
    model is well-known for its high prediction accuracy and also often outperforms
    many competing methods, such as linear regression/classification, bagging (Breiman,
    2001). It can be used in multiple predictive fashions such as regression or tree-based
    classification introduced by Friedman (2001). The idea of gradient boosting originated
    in the observation by Breiman (1999) and stated boosting can be interpreted as
    an optimization algorithm on a suitable cost function. In GBM Malohlava and Candel
    (2018), the learning process constantly fits new models to yield a more accurate
    estimate of the response variable. The main perception behind this algorithm is
    to develop the new base-learners to be maximally correlated with the negative
    gradient of the loss function and combine with the whole ensemble. GBM for classification
    is defined as: Step 1. Initialization: Initialize = 0, k = 1, 2, 3, …., K Step
    2. Calculate Error loss For m  = 1 to M a. b. i. Compute ii. Fit a regression
    tree to the targets , giving terminal regions iii. Compute ∊ ∊ , iv. Update ∊
    End Step 3. Output End We have set five parameters: the number of trees, the depth
    of the tree, the learning rate, the sample rate, and distribution. Moreover, other
    tuning parameters are defined at their given default values by H2O (2017). 4.
    Model Development In this work, data preprocessing, its management and development
    are performed in R software, a programming language for statistical computing
    (Core, 2015). Deep learning (DL), generalized linear model (GLM), gradient-boosted
    trees (GBM), and random forests (RF), models are executed by using big data H2O
    model. H2O provide a Java-based platform for more scalable, fast and open source
    machine learning, recently applied in more than 2000 corporations (Candel et al.,
    2016, Nykodym et al., 2018, Malohlava and Candel, 2018). For the implementation
    of these models, we have deployed R and H2O software in Windows 7. Four data-driven
    methods (DL, RF, GLM, and GBM) have been developed in this study to simulate and
    predict the daily for Hoshiarpur and Patiala stations using H2O package in R.
    H2O used in-memory Map-Reduce paradigm to distribute work. One of its advantages
    is the clever distribution of data chunks. When H2O imports a file, it does so
    in distributed fashion, i.e., each node tries to load it in parallel. When the
    data file is parsed, it gets split into several data chunks. H2O tries to have
    more data chunks than CPU cores. Since it uses Map-Reduce paradigm, it is often
    useful to look in different chunks in map phase than the one map worker is given.
    H2O assumes that such lookups are more likely to data chunks that are nearer to
    the given chunk. Due to this reason, H2O tries to keep these chunks in the same
    node. Another benefit of using H2O is the simplicity of deployment. Our methodology
    consists of four steps. Firstly, a collection of the weather datasets from IMD,
    Pune for Hoshiarpur and Patiala stations. Secondly, these both datasets is divided
    into three chunks and impute the missing value using the “missForest” (random
    forest) package. Further, the dataset is split into three subsets (Training, Validation,
    and Testing) datasets. The training set consists of 55%, validation set consists
    of 30% and testing set consists of 15% of the original dataset. In the third stage,
    the DLs, GLMs, GBMs, and RFs models are trained by using training dataset until
    satisfied with accuracy. After receiving the best accuracy from the training dataset,
    validation dataset is applied to evaluate the model accuracy. After achieving
    best accuracy from training and validation datasets, then the model is applied
    to the testing dataset. In the fourth step, the prediction values are evaluated.

    nodes of the optimal DL models are 40, 60, 40 and epochs = 100, l1 = 1e−5, activation = Rectifier
    for Hoshiarpur and Patiala site. The GLM model parameter tuning with lambda = TRUE,
    solver = IRLSM, and nlambdas = 100. The GBM model parameters tuning with ntree
    = 200, max_depth = 30, sample_rate = 0.2 and learning_rate = 0.1. Similarly, the
    RF model tuning parameter with ntree = 100, max_depth = 50, mtries = 5 and score_each_interval = TRUE
    and other tuning parameters are at there default values are considered from GBM
    H2O (2017). 6.1. Estimation of using heuristic models at Hoshiarpur The estimation
    of daily using DL, RF, GLM, and GBM models is done on the basis of RMSE, MSE,
    LL, ACC, MCE during the training, validation and testing periods. The values of
    RMSE, MSE, LL, ACC, MCE, RMSLE, r, r2, NRMSE, NSE, and RAE during the training,
    validation and testing datasets for DL, RF, GLM and GBM models are summarized
    in Table 6, Table 8 for Hoshiarpur site. As evident from Table 8, the Deep learning
    (DL) provided the best accuracy results (MSE = 0.0369, RMSE = 0.1921, LL = 0.126,
    ACC = 0.95, MCE = 0.04187). Although, Table 6 presents global average performance
    of heuristic models DL, RF, GLM, and GBM during the testing period. It can be
    seen from the Table 6 that DL model provided the most accurate results among the
    considered models with average (RMSLE = 0.0693, r = 0.98, r2 = 0.99, NSE = 0.98,
    NRMSE = 13.90%, RAE = 0.0346) for Hoshiarpur station. GBM model is a slightly
    better than GLM model with average (MSE = 0.0522, RMSE = 0.2285, LL = 0.218, ACC = 0.932,
    MCE = 0.0842 and RMSLE = 0.0894, r = 0.98, r2= 0.97, NSE = 0.97, NRMSE = 16.80%,
    RAE = 0.0508), but GBM gives overfitting in case of training dataset. Generally,
    GLM had slightly better accuracy than RF with (MSE = 0.0641, RMSE = 0.253, LL = 0.235,
    ACC = 0.93, MCE = 0.0848) and (r = 0.96, r2= 0.97, NSE = 0.97, NRMSE = 17.80%
    and RAE = 0.0567). 6.2. Estimation of using heuristic models at Patiala The DL,
    RF, GLM and GBM models have been evaluated using training, validation and testing
    datasets (0.55%, 0.30%, and 0.15% splitting). The performance of the DL is found
    to be better than the other models in estimating for Patiala station as shown
    in Table 7, Table 9. The values of RMSE, MSE, LL, ACC, MCE results during the
    testing period for the applied models are given in Table 9. The values of (MSE = 0.0442,
    RMSE = 0.210, LL = 0.162, ACC = 0.94, MCE = 0.0594) and (r = 0.98, r2= 0.97, NSE = 0.97,
    NRMSE = 16.20%, RAE = 0.0454) shown in Table 7. Similarly, the values of (MSE = 0.0502,
    0.0590 and 0.0605, RMSE = 0.0224, 0.243 and 0.245, LL = 0.1951, 0.2158 and 0.2864,
    ACC = 0.93, 0.92 and 0.91) (0.55%, 0.30% and 0.15% splitting) respectively obtained
    for the GBM, GLM, and RF models during the testing period. Comparisons of daily
    between measured and modeled by DL, RF, GBM and GLM models in the testing period
    for Patiala site is shown in Fig. 13. It is clear from the Table 9 that the DL
    model has the lowest RMSE, MSE, LL and the highest ACC as compared to RF, GLM
    and GBM models. The DL model is superior to the other models in the estimation
    of in the testing period, with the highest values of ACC = 0.95 for Hoshiarpur
    and ACC = 0.94 for Patiala station and the lowest values of MSE = 0.0369 for Hoshiarpur
    and MSE = 0.0442 for Patiala. 6.3. Analysis of complexity for models Computational
    complexity theory is the study of the scalability of algorithms, both in general
    and in a problem-solving sense. The term scalability refers to how the time and
    space is required to solve a problem grow as the input grow. All the computational
    complexity of models is represented by Big O notation. However, the amount of
    memory needed for H2O to run efficiently depends on the size and complexity of
    the data and the algorithm employed. Let n be the number of training data, m be
    the number of attributes/input features, M be the number of trees, h is the number
    of hidden layers, b is the bias, d is the max-depth, N is number of observation/rows,
    k is the number of nodes, p is the number of CPUs per node, and O is a complexity
    function. To balance computational complexity with model improvement, we settled
    on an interaction depth of 10 for the four regions. A random forest is an ensemble
    of decision trees that will output a prediction value. In Random Forest, each
    decision tree is constructed by using a random subset of the training data that
    has predictors with known response. The time complexity of a single decision tree
    is but for M number of trees in the forest(ensemble), computational complexity
    becomes where m is the number of attributes(features), n is the number of training
    sample in the dataset or n is the size of learning sample. The model complexity
    of deep learning is . or . Consider a hidden layers 40 60 40, with 6 numeric inputs
    and 1 output. It has ((6 40) + (40 60) + (60 40) + (40 8)) = 5360 K weights of
    Hoshiarpur and ((6 40) + (40 60) + (60 40) + (40 7))= 5320 K weights model complexity
    of Patiala site in deep learning. In this paper, L1 and L2 regularization parameters
    have been used to manage the model complexity. The model complexity can be defined
    as the proportional number of leaves in the learned trees. The computational complexity
    of statistical boosting approaches depends mainly on the number of separate base-learners.
    Numbers of leaves grows exponentially, model complexity (training/scoring time
    & storage) grows as: . The GBM model complexity as . Two most influencing parameters,
    both performance, and computational complexity, are tree depth and a number of
    trees in the forest. Maximum depth to grow the tree. A user-defined tuning parameter
    for controlling model complexity (by a number of edges). The computing cost is
    based on a number of factors, including the final count of leaves in all trees.
    The model complexity of generalized boosting machine (GLM) is for most standard
    GLM algorithms. . The model complexity is implemented based on iterative re-weighted
    least squares (IRLSM solver) to deal with the penalty. This method characterizes
    the computational complexity and scalability of a dataset with N observation and
    m predicator on a cluster with k nodes with p CPUs each. According to the Gram
    matrix complexity is as = 56052, it has a time complexity of approximately ( )
    for station 1, and = 68913 ( ) for station 2. Another model complexity solving
    via ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of the multiplier by Boyd et al. (2011))
    for inner solving is as = 54, it has a time complexity of approximately ( ) for
    both stations. 7. Conclusion In this article four data-driven models (DL, GBM,
    GLM, and RF) have been analyzed under H2O framework for evaluating daily at Hoshiarpur
    and Patiala sites in India. The fivefold cross-validation test has been deployed
    to estimate the performances of considered models. The newly developed DL model
    showed great capabilities for estimation and performed much better than the original
    and calibrated RF, GLM and GBM models. Moreover, the DL model has avoided the
    over-fitting issue by giving more accuracy on training, validation, and testing
    respectively. It has shown higher robustness than conventional approaches. The
    combination of six input variables i.e. , , , u2, and , have filled the appropriate
    missing values using MissForest for estimation of daily for Hoshiarpur and Patiala.
    The results obtained in this study can be compared with other soft computing and
    empirical methods in future studies. The findings of this presented work contribute
    a basic guidance to irrigation engineers and agriculturists for better estimation
    of , in the light of data availability, for irrigation scheduling and water resources
    management. In the future, proposed model can be applied to evaluate the crop
    coefficients for crop water modeling ( ). Acknowledgments The authors wish to

    is one of the most important components of the hydrological cycle as it accounts
    for more than two-thirds of the global precipitation losses. Indeed, the accurate
    prediction of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is highly significant for many
    watershed activities, including agriculture, water management, crop production
    and several other applications. Therefore, reliable estimation of ETo is a major
    concern in hydrology. ETo can be estimated using different approaches, including
    field measurement, empirical formulation and mathematical equations. Most recently,
    advanced machine learning models have been developed for the estimation of ETo.
    Among several machine learning models, evolutionary computing (EC) has demonstrated
    a remarkable progression in the modeling of ETo. The current research is devoted
    to providing a new milestone in the implementation of the EC algorithm for the
    modeling of ETo. A comprehensive review is conducted to recognize the feasibility
    of EC models and their potential in simulating ETo in a wide range of environments.
    Evaluation and assessment of the models are also presented based on the review.
    Finally, several possible future research directions are proposed for the investigations
    of ETo using EC. KEYWORDS: evapotranspiration predictionstate of the artevolutionary
    computing modelsinput variabilityfuture research directions 1. Introduction Proper
    monitoring of climate requires comprehensive information about land surface fluxes,
    particularly the latent and sensible components (Courault, Seguin, & Olioso, 2005).
    This information is also important for the evaluation of the parameterization
    schemes in the climate and weather models used for the flux exchange prediction
    between the surface and the lower atmosphere (Allen, Burt, Solomon, Clemmens,
    & O’Halloran, 2005; Fisher et al., 2009). In agriculture, it is required for irrigation
    scheduling and other applications (Farg, Arafat, Abd El-Wahed, & El-Gindy, 2012).
    It is a major component of the hydrological cycle and, therefore, it has significant
    implications on water requirements and water resource management (Figure 1). Therefore,
    it is necessary that water managers and irrigation engineers are provided with
    an accurate and robust tool for estimating surface fluxes, and especially evapotranspiration
    (Pereira, Green, & Villa Nova, 2006). Figure 1. Schematic diagram of hydrological
    cycle showing the importance of evapotranspiration (ET). Display full size The
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo) can be determined either directly through experiments
    or indirectly through mathematical models. Practically, the major classical methods
    for ETo measurement are only obtainable at the field scale (Bowen ratio, eddy
    correlation system, soil water balance) (Tao, Diop, et al., 2018). However, certain
    limitations restrict the application of these methods in flux prediction, especially
    when applied to large spatial scales (Kumar, Jat, & Shankar, 2012). Besides, the
    field methods are expensive, time consuming and difficult. ETo is also difficult
    to measure mathematically because it depends on the interaction of several climatic
    factors, including temperature, wind speed, humidity and radiation (Tao, Diop,
    et al., 2018). Hence, evapotranspiration is featured by a nonlinear and complex
    phenomenon and its determination is based on the availability of several climatic
    parameters and their mutual interactions with each other. Experts have developed
    several ETo estimation methods over the years; however, the selection of a suitable
    method depends mainly on the availability of the measured climatic factors. The
    generalized Penman–Monteith (PM) method is the most adopted method for the estimation
    of ETo in agricultural and environmental research, as it tallies well with ﬁeld
    observations (Penman, 1948). The PM model has been acknowledged as the standard
    ETo estimation method despite the fact that its application requires the availability
    of a signiﬁcant amount of climatic data, which may not be available in certain
    locations, such as in the developing countries. Such cases demand the deployment
    of alternative methods with less dependence on many weather inputs. The artificial
    intelligence (AI) methods can model highly nonlinear phenomena with a limited
    amount of data (Meng et al., 2019). Therefore, the application of AI methods has
    grown rapidly in recent years for the development of alternative methods of ETo
    estimation from limited weather inputs. 2. State of the art: evolutionary computing
    (EC) models for ETo simulation The evolution of computer technology has increased
    the applicability of AI in different scientiﬁc fields (Baghban, Jalali, Shafiee,
    Ahmadi, & Chau, 2019; Chau, 2017; Chuntian & Chau, 2002; Haie, Pereira, Machado,
    & Shahidian, 2019; Wu & Chau, 2011). AI is a connection of several processors,
    distributed in parallel and composed of simple processing units with the natural
    capability to store experimental information and produce it whenever needed (Danandeh
    Mehr et al., 2018; Yaseen, Sulaiman, Deo, & Chau, 2019). Since AI models require
    few inputs and can map input–output relationships without having prior knowledge
    of the physical processes involved, they are considered as effective tools for
    nonlinear process modeling. Consequently, several alternative intelligent computational
    models for the estimation of ETo have been developed over the last few decades
    (Chen, Chen, & Chen, 2018; Kumar, Raghuwanshi, & Singh, 2011; Sun et al., 2019).
    EC approaches, such as gene expression programming (GEP) and genetic programming
    (GP), are one of several types of AI model which have been considered appropriate
    for the modeling of ETo (Danandeh Mehr et al., 2018). These models were originally
    developed by Koza ( 1992), when the concept of GP was first introduced. They were
    conceptually developed based on the genetic algorithm (GA), an algorithm used
    for the implementation of symbolic regression when trying to establish a mathematical
    function that fits a data set (Maulik & Bandyopadhyay, 2000; Najafzadeh & Kargar,
    2019). Several attempts have been made regarding the feasibility of using EC to
    solve problems such as circuit design, multi-agent strategies and time-series
    prediction (Dineva et al., 2019; Mirjalili, Mirjalili, Saremi, & Mirjalili, 2020).
    Similarly, several researchers have examined the applicability of EC to solve
    hydrological, climatological, environmental and ecological problems over the past
    two decades (Yaseen, El-shafie, Jaafar, Afan, & Sayl, 2015). Within the scope
    of modeling the ETo process, a number of studies have been conducted using EC
    for different climatological scenarios. To investigate the effect of different
    climatic and topographic conditions (Parasuraman, Elshorbagy, & Carey, 2007),
    ETo was estimated using GP from ground temperature, wind speed, eddy-covariance-measured
    latent heat as a function of net radiation, relative humidity and air temperature.
    Based on the predictability comparison with the classical artificial neural network
    (ANN) and PM empirical formulation, it was found to be a potential model (Parasuraman
    et al., 2007). Guven, Aytek, Yuce, and Aksoy ( 2008) investigated the effect of
    ETo using the daily atmospheric variables collected from the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (CIMIS) database for Davis, Hasting, Suisun, Dixon
    and Oakville stations. The authors validated the performance of the GA model against
    several empirical models such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
    United Nations Penman–Monteith (FAO56-PM), the PM, the Jensen–Haise, the Hargreaves–Samani
    (HS) equation, the Jones–Ritchie, the Turc method and solar radiation-based models.
    It was found that the GA model performed better than the considered empirical
    models, with relatively low error and high correlation metrics. Kim and Kim (
    2008) proposed three type of GA model based on the generalized regression neural
    networks model (GRNNM) namely, COMBINE-GRNNM-GA, EXTREME-GRNNM-GA and Average-GRNNM-GA,
    for the estimation of pan evaporation and alfalfa reference evapotranspiration
    (ETref) for the period 1985–1992 at 14 meteorological stations located in the
    Republic of Korea. Based on statistical results, they found COMBINE-GRNNM-GA to
    be the best performing of these models. Kisi and Guven ( 2010) investigated the
    accuracy of linear genetic programming (LGP) with GEP for modeling ETo at three
    stations, and indicated the superior performance of LGP over GEP. El-Baroudy,
    Elshorbagy, Carey, Giustolisi, and Savic ( 2010) reported two case studies of
    the South West Sand Storage and the South Bison Hill, Mildred Lake mine, Canada,
    for the estimation of ETo using three intelligent models, namely evolutionary
    polynomial regression (EPR), ANN and GEP. The authors found better performance
    of the EPR model over the other models in estimation of ETo. Izadifar and Elshorbagy
    ( 2010) estimated ETo using a physical model, i.e. HYDRUS-1D, at Alberta, Canada,
    and compared its performance with different AI (ANN and GP) and statistical models.
    The results indicated that the multiple regression and GP models performed better
    than the ANN model in estimating ETo. Kisi ( 2010) used GA for the calibration
    of the fuzzy membership function for the modeling of daily ETo at three stations
    located in central California, USA, for the period 1998–2007. They employed the
    fuzzy-genetic (FG) model to estimate the ETo obtained using the FAO56-PM method
    and compared its performance with the Penman, Hargreaves, Ritchie, Turc and ANN
    methods. It was observed that the FG model, which uses only two parameters, performed
    better in estimating ETo compared to other empirical models. Shiri et al. ( 2012)
    applied the GEP model to determine the magnitude of ETo in the Basque Country
    (northern Spain). The models were developed using weather parameters, namely relative
    humidity, solar radiation, air temperature and wind speed. The capability of the
    GEP model was validated against the other AI and empirical models. Overall, the
    results showed that the GEP model achieved better accuracy than the Priestley–Taylor
    (PT), HS and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models. The generalizability
    of the GEP model was scrutinized by Traore and Guven ( 2012) for modeling the
    ETo in Sahelian country, Burkina Faso. They reported that the incorporation of
    several weather variables provided the best accuracy using the GEP model. Jean
    et al. ( 2012) proved that the combination of GEP and FAO56-PM models can better
    estimate evaporation and seepage for Datong Basin. In another major study, Eslamian,
    Gohari, Zareian, and Firoozfar ( 2012) developed hybrid ANN and GA (ANN-GA) and
    ANN models for the estimation of ETo. They found that the ANN-GA could calculate
    the ETo more accurately than the other models. Shiri et al. ( 2013) investigated
    the performance of GEP and ANFIS models for ETo estimation at five stations in
    Iran. The authors found that the GEP model outperformed the empirical formulations
    (e.g. HS, Makkink and Turc) and ANFIS model. The GEP model was developed for the
    estimation of ETo over West Africa (Traore & Guven, 2013). The authors reported
    a high performance of the algebraic formulation obtained using GEP for ETo simulation
    over the Sub-Saharan African regions. A comparative analysis using several intelligent
    models, namely ANN, ANFIS, support vector machine (SVM) and GEP to estimate the
    ETo was investigated by Shiri, Nazemi, et al. ( 2014). In addition, the capacity
    of the established AI models was validated against several empirical formulations,
    namely PT, HS, Turc and Makkink. The results showed the superiority of the GEP
    model over the other AI and empirical methodologies. Shiri, Sadraddini, et al.
    ( 2014) applied GEP to estimate ETo with different combinations of meteorological
    variables as input attributes to construct a predictive model. The study reported
    an excellent performance of GEP using all available meteorological variables.
    The performance of ANN, an integrative ANFIS with subtractive clustering and grid
    partition, and GEP models was inspected to simulate the long-term monthly ETo
    at 50 stations in Iran (Kisi, Sanikhani, Zounemat-Kermani, & Niazi, 2015). The
    authors reported the feasibility of the GEP model over the other developed AI
    models. They also reported a remarkably consistent predictability in ETo simulation
    using GEP. Martí, González-Altozano, López-Urrea, Mancha, and Shiri ( 2015) conducted
    a study to compare the performance of GEP in estimation of ETo with lysimeter
    data at two locations in Spain: Las Tiesas (Albacete) and La Orden (Badajoz).
    The study reported that the best results in the estimation of ETo were obtained
    using GEP. The performance of the PM model with four soft computing approaches,
    namely SVM–firefly algorithm (SVM-FFA), ANN, SVM-wavelet and GP, in the estimation
    of ETo in Serbia was assessed by Gocić et al. ( 2015). They reported that SVM-wavelet
    and SVM-FFA performed better than GP and ANN. Yassin, Alazba, and Mattar ( 2016b)
    developed mathematical equations using GEP for the estimation of ETo from meteorological
    data at 13 stations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and reported accurate estimation
    of ETo using the GEP model. However, they found a slightly better performance
    using ANN compared to GEP. Alazba, Yassin, and Mattar ( 2016) developed ETo models
    for eight combinations of inputs using GEP for 19 meteorological stations located
    in a hyper-arid region. The performance of the GEP model was compared with the
    PM model, and better formation of the GEP model with eight input variables was
    found. Yassin et al. ( 2016b) investigated the performance of GEP and ANN in modeling
    daily ETref at 19 meteorological stations in Saudi Arabia for the period 1980–2010.
    The results showed that the ANN performed better than the GEP in estimating ETref.
    Kumar, Adamowski, Suresh, and Ozga-zielinski ( 2016) investigated the performance
    of extreme learning machine (ELM), ANN, GP and SVM in estimating daily ETo in
    North Bihar, India, for the period 2001–2005. They reported that the ELM model
    performed better than the other machine learning and soft computing approaches.
    Karimi, Kisi, and Kim ( 2017) developed heuristic models combining SVM and GEP
    for the estimation of ETo in the Republic of Korea. The result showed that the
    GEP model outperformed the SVM model in the local and cross-station scenarios.
    Kiafar et al. ( 2017) derived equations for the estimation of ETo at two meteorological
    stations located in a hyper-arid region of Iran and at two stations in a humid
    region of Spain. The authors compared the performance of GEP with three empirical
    models to calculate ETo, namely the mass transfer, temperature-based and radiation-based
    models. They reported better performance of the GEP model with four inputs compared
    to the empirical models. Mehdizadeh, Behmanesh, and Khalili ( 2017) investigated
    the performance of SVM [Poly and radial basis function (RBF)], GEP, multivariate
    adaptive regression spline (MARS) and the empirical models to determine the ETo
    at 44 meteorological stations in Iran. The study reported that the MARS and SVM-RBF
    models performed better than the SVM-Poly and GEP models. The daily scale of ETo
    at Gaoyou station in China was predicted using the GEP algorithm (Traore, Luo,
    & Fipps, 2017). The study suggested that the GEP model can be used for estimation
    of ETo and also it can be employed as a tool for short-term irrigation scheduling
    for decision making. Different empirical and semi-empirical approaches namely,
    Kimberly–Penman, temperature-based and radiation-based models, were applied along
    with GEP by Shiri ( 2017) for the estimation of daily ETo at five meteorological
    stations in Iran. The author divided the data set into three segments for model
    calibration, testing and validation. The comparison of the results showed that
    the temperature-based empirical model developed using GEP was the most accurate
    in estimating ETo. The random forest model (RFM) and generalized regression neural
    network (GRNN) models were employed by Feng, Cui, Gong, Zhang, and Zhao ( 2017)
    to estimate the ETo for the period 2009–2014 at two stations in China. The results
    revealed that the temperature-based RFM and GRNN models could be applied successfully
    for daily ETo estimation. However, the RFM could perform slightly better than
    the GRNN in estimating ETo. The performance of AI-based models such as ANN and
    GEP and ancillary/external approaches were investigated by Landeras et al. ( 2018)
    for the estimation of ETo at four stations in Ghana. They used 7 years’ data (2006–2009)
    for the training and 4 years’ data (2009–2012) for the testing of the models.
    The study reported that the GEP and ancillary model could be applied for better
    estimation of ETo in West Africa. Mattar and Alazba ( 2018) examined the performance
    of the GEP model with eight input combinations for the simulation of monthly ETo
    at 27 meteorological stations in Egypt using the CLIMWAT meteorological data.
    The authors found that the air temperature, wind speed and relative humidity are
    required for accurate modeling of ETo. The results also indicated that multiple
    linear regression (MLR) and GEP with mean humidity and wind speed at 2 m height
    as inputs provide the best estimation of ETo. Mattar ( 2018) implemented eight
    combinations of GEP models to calculate the ETo at 32 stations in Egypt using
    the CLIMWAT data. The comparison of the performance of GEP model with other empirical
    models showed that the GEP model provides promising outcomes in the modeling of
    ETo. Mehdizadeh ( 2018) performed extensive research using MARS and GEP to determine
    the daily ETo at six stations in Iran, namely Isfahan and Shiraz (arid), Urmia
    and Tabriz (semi-arid) and Yazd and Zahedan (hyper-arid), for the period 2000–2014.
    They used daily meteorological data and their lags for the modeling of ETo, and
    concluded that MARS–autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (MARS-ARCH)
    and GEP-ARCH showed superior results compared to the standalone MARS and GEP models.
    The potential of the GEP model for the estimation of ETo was analyzed by Jovic,
    Nedeljkovic, Golubovic, and Kostic ( 2018). The models were built based on diverse
    meteorological variables including minimum and maximum temperature, vapor pressure,
    wind speed, sunshine hours and relative humidity. The authors evidenced the improved
    capability of the EC model through the incorporation of more climatic information.
    Mohammad, Pour, Piri, and Kisi ( 2018) investigated the performance of three data-driven
    models, SVM, ANFIS and GEP, to estimate the ETo. They used five different combinations
    of input for the simulation of ETo for the period 1970–2010 in south-eastern Iran.
    The results showed that the SVM model had superior performance with the input
    combination of average air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and sunshine
    hours. Six AI models, namely multilayer perceptron, GRNN, radial basis neural
    network (RBNN), ANFIS with grid partition (ANFIS-GP), ANFIS with subtractive clustering
    (ANFIS-SC) and GEP, were investigated by Sanikhani, Kisi, Maroufpoor, and Yaseen
    ( 2019) for the determination of ETo at two meteorological stations located in
    the Mediterranean region, at Antalya and Isparta in Turkey. The prediction results
    revealed that the best performance belonged to the GRNN and GEP models at Antalya
    station, and ANFIS-SC and RBNN models at Isparta station. Daily ETo was calculated
    using PM-FAO56, radiation-based, mass transfer-based and temperature-based models
    at five stations in Iran (Shiri, 2019). The performance of the empirical models
    was validated against the predominant EC model (i.e. GEP). The author reported
    the better performance of the mass transfer-based model and relatively lower performance
    of GEP, temperature-based and radiation-based models. Shiri ( 2019) presented
    the results of ETo models at five stations in Iran. The author calculated the
    daily ETo with FAO56-PM and compared the results with the temperature-, radiation-
    and mass transfer-based ETo equations and GEP-derived models. Overall, the results
    indicated that the temperature-based and the radiation-based empirical and GEP
    models could not provide satisfactory results to simulate ETo, while the models
    derived from mass transfer equations could provide more accurate results. Shiri,
    Marti, Karimi, and Landeras ( 2019) introduced a new approach for the estimation
    of ETo by splitting the data set and incorporating external ancillary inputs.
    They applied GEP with the temperature-based HS model and the radiation-based PT
    model for the estimation of ETo from the local meteorological inputs. Comparison
    of the performance accuracy of the models revealed that the GEP-based model produced
    the most accurate results among all the applied approaches. The present review
    also investigated the successful application of evolutionary algorithms in other
    fields. For instance, Danandeh Mehr, Kahya, and Ozger ( 2014) introduced a new
    explicit gene-wavelet model for drought forecasting, Mehr ( 2018) developed a
    new hybrid GA combined with GEP for stream flow forecasting in intermittent streams,
    and other studies investigated the capability of GP in advances in rainfall runoff
    modeling (e.g. Jayawardena, Muttil, & Lee, 2006; Nourani, Komasi, & Alami, 2013).
    3. Survey evaluation and assessment The summary of the research which implemented
    the EC models for the estimation of ETo over the period 2007–2018 is reported
    in Table 1. It was observed that a large number of studies has been conducted
    on the implementation of GP and GEP models for estimation of ETo. The main reason
    for preferring evolutionary models in estimating ETo their capability to provide
    explicit formulation and ease of application. The formulation provided by GEP
    can be simply used in practical applications. Table 1. Short review of the implementation
    of evolutionary computing models for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration
    (2007–2019). Download CSVDisplay Table Most studies have demonstrated a limitation
    in the predictability of EC models using fewer meteorological variables as input.
    This was observed more prominently in the regions characterized by arid and semi-arid
    climates. This can best be explained by the ETo processes being influenced by
    multiple climate variables and thus varying from one case to another. Hence, it
    can be concluded, based on the observations, that ETo models in such regions need
    several pieces of climate information to attain a reliable predictive capability.
    In Table 1, the GP or GEP models have been compared with several other methods
    in estimating ETo for different timescales (hourly, daily and monthly) and different
    climatic regions, ranging from hyper-arid to humid. In most of the studies, such
    models were found to be superior compared to other empirical and AI models. Only
    three studies reported a lower accuracy of GP/GEP compared to other AI methods
    in the estimation of ETo. El-Baroudy et al. ( 2010) compared GEP with EPR and
    ANN for modeling hourly ETo, and reported marginal differences among the models.
    However, a limited number of data was used in the study and, therefore, generalization
    of the obtained results is difficult. The data division rule (65% for training
    and 35% for testing) was also different from the related literature. Mehdizadeh
    ( 2018) compared GEP, SVM and MARS for the estimation of long-term monthly ETo
    (mean values for the period 1951–2010 and, thus, 60 values for each month) and
    found that MARS showed superior performance to the other methods. Kisi et al.
    ( 2015) compared the performance of ANN and ANFIS with GEP for the estimation
    of long-term monthly ETo (mean values for the period 1956–2010 and, thus, 55 values
    for each month) without climatic data as input, and found GEP to provide less
    accuracy in ETo estimation compared to ANN and ANFIS. Therefore, it may be remarked
    that GEP may not have good capability in the modeling of long-term monthly ETo
    in some climatic environments. The review also revealed that the training span
    of data has a substantial influence on the model’s predictability. Most of the
    studies reviewed in the present study (Table 1) used full climatic data as inputs
    to calculate ETo by the FAO56-PM method. The main reason for searching for alternatives
    to the standard method is that it requires a high number of climatic data as inputs
    and such data are not available at many stations, especially those located in
    developing countries. Therefore, the development of AI models using all available
    data, similar to the standard method (FAO56 PM), is not worthwhile. Because ETo
    can be calculated using the FAO56 PM method if the data of all meteorological
    variables are available, the alternative methods are not necessary for the replacement
    of this standard method. As an example, Sanikhani et al. ( 2019) used several
    AI methods including the EC method for the development of the ETo model using
    only temperature data, and their performances were compared with the corresponding
    HS empirical method, which uses the same inputs. Promising results, such as determination
    coefficient higher than 0.900, were obtained using the models, which means that
    the models could explain 90% of variations in the test data. However, the development
    of new models to attain similar accuracy to the established model using the same
    input variables is not worthwhile. Rather, emphasis should be placed on the development
    of models with better accuracy than the established model or the development of
    models with fewer inputs but similar accuracy. The GEP models developed for the
    estimation of ETo in all the studies are very complex. Many mathematical and logical
    operators and constants were incorporated in equations when attempting to develop
    models using few meteorological variables. For example, Mattar and Alazba ( 2018)
    utilized eight operators [+, –, ×, %, √, x2, power and ln(x)]. In some other studies,
    trigonometric (sin, cos and tan) and logical (AND and OR) operators were also
    included to generate the ETo equation. This has made the equations very complex
    and discouraged hydrologists and water professionals from implementing them in
    the field. Emphasis should be placed on developing equations with fewer operators
    to make them more usable in the field. In addition, uncertainty in the model output
    can be estimated and provided to end users to make them aware of the range of
    error in the estimated ETo values using GEP-derived equations. Another important
    issue is the development of separate ETo models using EC for each station. To
    date, a limited number of studies has considered the development of a generalized
    model which can be used for the estimation of ETo accurately at all stations in
    a region. This is very important, especially for developing countries where the
    meteorological variables required for the estimation of ETo are missing or not
    available for long periods for technical reasons. In such cases, generalized models
    including explicit equations obtained by pooled data or calibrated with data from
    nearby stations are very useful. Therefore, alternative methods which use information
    (e.g. limited climatic input such as temperature data) from both local and nearby
    stations should be further investigated for the modeling of ETo (Sanikhani et
    al., 2019). As briefly mentioned earlier, various data-division scenarios have
    been applied in previous studies. For example, Shiri, Sadraddini, et al. ( 2014)
    and Yassin et al. ( 2016b) divided data into two sets, training and test or calibration
    and validation, while other researchers used three data divisions, training, validation
    and test, in their applications. Others applied leave-one-out process (LOOP) or
    cross-validation (CV) methods for the development and evaluation of the model.
    A two-data-division procedure was preferred by most researchers in modeling ETo.
    The main drawback of this type of modeling is the evaluation of methods without
    independent data sets. By applying three data divisions, the methods are calibrated
    using the first part (training data) of the whole data set, the optimal ones are
    decided using the second part (validation data) and the optimal models are tested
    using the last part (test data) of the data set. The main disadvantages of the
    LOOP or CV approach are the use of fewer data for calibration and the requirement
    for a longer time for calibration. Therefore, it is recommended that the three-data-division
    rule or different training–testing scenarios should be used to obtain more robust
    models. 4. Possible future research directions A comprehensive review is conducted
    in this study to assess the potential of EC techniques in modeling ETo. The study
    revealed that EC has been used for the development of ETo models for a wide climatic
    range. The evaluation of the performance of the models as presented in this study
    revealed the high potential of EC in modeling ETo. Although significant progress
    has been achieved in the development of ETo models using EC, the synthesis of
    current understanding based on the literature reviewed in the present study indicates
    the need for future research in the following directions. In most of the previous
    studies, ETo models were developed with a large number of input variables. Many
    of these variables are not easily available in most of the meteorological stations,
    particularly in developing countries. The major challenge in ETo modeling is the
    reliable estimation of ETo with easily available meteorological variables. Future
    research should be directed towards the development of ETo models with easily
    available meteorological variables, such as maximum and minimum temperature. Although
    some temperature-based empirical models are available for the estimation of ETo,
    these are not useful for the projection of ETo owing to climate change. All the
    temperature-based models show a decrease in ETo under climate change scenarios,
    even though the temperature would rise. This is due to the higher influence of
    diurnal temperature range on ETo, which is projected to decline as a result of
    climate change. Therefore, it is important to develop simple temperature-based
    ETo models which can be used easily for the reliable projection of ETo under climate
    change scenarios. Most of the ETo models developed using EC are station specific.
    To increase the applicability of EC-based ETo models, it is important to develop
    a generalized model which can be used for the reliable estimation of ETo for a
    whole country, or at least in a homogeneous climatic region. This needs calibration
    and validation of the EC-based model with all the station data available in a
    region. Although reliable accuracy has been attained in the estimation of ETo
    using EC, there is still room to improve the accuracy of the models through optimization
    of EC parameters using sophisticated optimization algorithms. A possible direction
    is the use of other recent EC algorithms which have not yet been employed for
    modeling the ETo process, such as particle swarm optimization (Ali Ghorbani, Kazempour,
    Chau, Shamshirband, & Taherei Ghazvinei, 2018; Chau, 2007) and ELM (Taormina &
    Chau, 2015; Yaseen, Sulaiman, et al., 2019). Many recently developed and popular
    EC algorithms have yet to be applied to this area, and their performance on this
    particular topic is yet to be determined and compared with the performance of
    their counterparts. While some hybrid EC models have been developed individually
    for ETo modeling, the effectiveness of many other feasible combinations that have
    been applied to other fields (Ghorbani, Deo, Karimi, Yaseen, & Terzi, 2018; Ghorbani,
    Deo, Yaseen, & Kashani, 2018; Moazenzadeh, Mohammadi, Shamshirband, & Chau, 2018;
    Tao, Sulaiman, et al., 2018) is yet to be explored. It is worth investigating
    comprehensively how to employ hybridization with other algorithms to enhance their
    overall search performance by effectively coupling the strengths of each intelligent
    algorithm. Hybridizing nature-inspired optimization algorithm can positively enhance
    the internal hyperparameters mechanism of the EC models, particularly for such
    a complex hydrological process (Al Sudani, Salih, & Yaseen, 2019; Yaseen, Mohtar,
    et al., 2019). Symbolic regression models developed so far using EC are very complex,
    as they use a large number of mathematical operators. Research could be conducted
    into developing simple formulae with fewer computational steps for easy estimation
    of ETo in the field. With recent advances in computational power, in terms of
    parallel processing, software and hardware, a new machine learning paradigm, named
    the deep learning technique, is now feasible to address millions or even billions
    of weights among neurons for better learning of behaviors. It is recognized to
    have started a revolutionary era since it is able to address the problems that
    have resisted AI for a long time. It was proven to outperform other conventional
    machine learning algorithms in language translation (Sutskever et al., 2014),
    natural language understanding (Am, 2013), speech recognition (Hinton et al.,
    2012), financial markets (Fischer & Krauss, 2018), etc. However, the application
    of deep learning to hydrological prediction is still limited. The deep learning
    technique could be a promising field to explore for the modeling of ETo. In recent
    decades, geographical information system (GIS) and satellite data have been widely
    used in water resources management and hydrological modeling issues. High-resolution
    meteorological data from satellites may be used for ETo modeling. This type of
    modeling could be especially beneficial for places where climatic stations are
    rare or required data are missing. Satellite data can be calibrated by comparing
    the corresponding data acquired from the stations. In this way, better spatial
    modeling could be possible. Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest

    Metrics Abstract: An enhanced hybrid artificial intelligence model was developed
    for soil temperature (ST) prediction. Among several soil characteristics, soil
    temperature is one of the essential elements impacting the biological, physical
    and chemical processes of the terrestrial ecosystem. Reliable ST prediction is
    significant for multiple geo-science and agricultural applications. The proposed
    model is a hybridization of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system with optimization
    methods using mutation Salp Swarm Algorithm and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm
    (ANFIS-mSG). Daily weather and soil temperature data for nine years (1 of January
    2010 - 31 of December 2018) from five meteorological stations (i.e., Baker, Beach,
    Cando, Crary and Fingal) in North Dakota, USA, were used for modeling. For validation,
    the proposed ANFIS-mSG model was compared with seven models, including classical
    ANFIS, hybridized ANFIS model with grasshopper optimization algorithm (ANFIS-GOA),
    salp swarm algorithm (ANFIS-SSA), grey wolf optimizer (ANFIS-GWO), particle swarm
    optimization (ANFIS-PSO), genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA), and Dragonfly Algorithm
    (ANFIS-DA). The ST prediction was conducted based on maximum, mean and minimum
    air temperature (AT). The modeling results evidenced the capability of optimization
    algorithms for building ANFIS models for simulating soil temperature. Based on
    the statistical evaluation; for instance, the root mean square error (RMSE) was

    I. Introduction Soil temperature (ST) controls most of the biological, chemical,
    and physical processes within the soil [1], such as evapotranspiration, plant
    germination/growth, root development, and microbial activities is evident [2].
    Also, ST is the most important variable that influences the freezing depth and
    affects agricultural activities, irrigation scheduling, and soil drainage [3].
    Several factors, including topography, air temperature, solar radiation, precipitation,
    soil moisture, and thermal characteristics, govern ST [4], [5]. Attempts have
    focused on finding the relation between soil temperature and other variables for
    prediction of ST [6]. The relationship between AT and ST is significant to determine
    the soil’s heat regime. In some regions, ST is not measured and therefore the
    relationship between AT and ST can be used to construct a predictive model. The
    prediction of ST for any future time horizon without the need for direct measurement
    that is labour intensive and logistically expensive has a significant advantage
    of soft computing models that can help predict soil temperature for soil health
    and agriculture. Based on the predictive performance of the proposed hybrid intelligence
    model and for the univariate air temperature scenario, decision-makers can rely
    on data inexpensive approaches to better understand soil temperature dynamics
    to guide their practices. About 54% of the total energy from the sun is reflected
    by the earth while retaining the remaining 46% [7]. The reason for this phenomenon
    is the slow heat transport capability of the ground; it is also due to the high
    heat storage capacity and slow changes in temperature over long periods with respect
    to the measurement depth. This soil’s low thermal conductivity allows the release
    of heat through the cooling period and heat retention during the heating period.
    The heat retained in the soil during the hot season is released back to the air
    during the cold season and this heat exchange occurs throughout the year, making
    the soil a good thermal reservoir [8]. The ST during the winter season is higher
    than the temperature of the ambient air but reverses during the summer. This implies
    that ST can serve as an important meteorological parameter for different applications,
    including solar energy applications, frost prediction, agricultural applications,
    and ground source heat pump applications [9]. Several studies have been carried
    out recently on short to mid-term ST predictions in two specific categories [6],
    [10]. The first category focused on the use of statistical techniques, such as
    numerical weather prediction methods, which assume that changes in the statistical
    properties of ST data series in the future would be similar to those in the past
    [11]. These models for long-term prediction require large amounts of data which
    usually is not be available [12]–[14]. The second category uses artificial intelligence
    (AI) models, like support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN),
    genetic programming (GP), gene expression programming (GEP), adaptive neuro-fuzzy
    inference system (ANFIS), decision tree (DT), M5 Tree, etc [10], [15]–[22]. Many
    studies have modeled ST as a nonlinear physical phenomenon [19], [20], [23]–[26].
    One of the earliest studies used linear regression (LR) and ANN models for soil
    temperature prediction using several hydrometeorological variables including AT,
    atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshine
    at Adana, Turkey [7]. Results of the ANN model showed better predictive performance.
    Xing et al. (2018) predicted daily ST for different seasons in different climatic
    zones at United States using the SVM model with AT and solar radiation as predictors.
    The results evidenced the capacity of the SVM model. Samadianfard et al. (2018)
    integrated wavelet transformation with ANN and GEP models for ST prediction at
    different depths in Tabriz, Iran. The predictors were sunshine, radiation, and
    AT. Sanikhani et al. (2018) used the extreme learning machine (ELM) model as non-tuned
    predictive model for simulating ST at different soil depths at Mersin and Adana,
    Turkey. The ELM model was validated against ANN and M5 Tree models. Different
    climate variables, including AT, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind
    speed, were used as predictors. Soil temperature is a stochastic variable of great
    importance in various morphological and engineering areas [29]. Different AI models
    have been developed irrespective of internal parameters tuning [15]. Selection
    of the best model parameters using an optimization tool will ensure better model
    prediction [30]. Hybridized AI models have become one of the most successful nonlinear
    time series prediction methods in the field of signals and time-series analysis
    [31], [32]. Many studies have applied hybrid AI models but are limited on the
    measurement of ST at both surface and underground levels. The major aim of this
    study is to develop a univariate machine learning (ML) model for ST prediction
    using correlated independent variables. Among several ML models, ANFIS model have
    demonstrated an excellent predictive model for diverse engineering applications
    [33]–[39]. Based on the literature, the ANFIS model has been found to be a reliable
    intelligent model for simulating soil temperature, owing to its ability to account
    for the uncertainty of data [40]. However, this model is associated with the problem
    of internal membership function parameter optimization [41]. Hence, the ANFIS
    model is hybridized with new integrative bio-inspired optimization algorithm called
    Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) and Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). Several
    standard hybrid models are developed for the proposed model ANFIS-mSG model. In
    this context, the SSA algorithm showed promising results in solving a variety
    of optimization problems [42]–[45], because it has many advantages such as low
    computational cost, easy to implement, and few parameters to be optimized. However,
    it has some limitations like other metaheuristic methods, including slow convergence
    and low exploitation ability as well as it can get trapped in local optima. Therefore,
    the proposed method helps the SSA by adding a mutation strategy from getting trap
    in a local minimum, evolution stagnation, and premature convergence. The mutation
    strategy can assist metaheuristic algorithms to guide their populations toward
    the global optimum rather than getting trapped in local optima as well as increase
    the diversity of the search domain to speed up the convergence rate. Hence, the
    first phase of the proposed method is to improve the original SSA, then use this
    phase as a local search for the GOA algorithm. However, GOA, a recent metaheuristic
    algorithm, has drawbacks, including high computation time and premature convergence
    [46], [47]. Therefore, the second phase of the proposed method is to improve the
    exploration and exploitation of the original GOA using the first phase (i.e. mutation
    SSA phase). These two phases are mentioned in this manuscript as mutation-SSA-GOA
    (mSG). The final phase of the proposed method is to apply the mSG to train the
    ANFIS model in order to improve the predictiveness of the original ANFIS. The
    entire proposed method is called ANFIS-mSG. Thus, this study is the hybridization
    of the ANFIS model with a nature optimization algorithm (i.e., ANFIS-mSG) to develop
    a hybrid ST prediction model. The literature shows that hybrid models are receiving
    attention as evidenced by the number of studies integrating nature optimization
    algorithms with standalone ML models for solving hyperparameter problems. Until
    now, limited attention has been given to the use of metaheuristic optimization
    algorithms with ANFIS model for ST modeling. Therefore, this study aims to implement
    a suite of standalone and hybrid ANFIS models for ST modeling at different meteorological
    stations located in North Dakota, United States. This study used a univariate
    modeling scheme as only AT variability was used to model the ST. Indeed, establishing
    such a kind modeling process based on univariate weather information is highly
    essential for the regions where climatological or geoscience information availability
    are limited. In addition, establishing such intelligent predictive with less input
    variables to predict soil temperature is significantly important for multiple
    geoscience related implications that contributes to basic knowledge of various
    perspectives of soil engineering. The proposed ANFIS-mSG was validated against
    ANFIS, ANFIS hybridized with grasshopper optimization algorithm (ANFIS-GOA), salp
    swarm algorithm (ANFIS-SSA), grey wolf optimizer (ANFIS-GWO), particle swarm optimization
    (ANFIS-PSO), genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA), and Dragonfly Algorithm (ANFIS-DA).
    The main contribution of the current research is the newly developed hybrid ANFIS
    model for ST prediction which is important for soil health, agriculture, and the
    ecosystem. SECTION II. Case Study and Data Explanation North Dakota (ND), located
    in the center of North America, has a typical climate with cold winters and hot
    summers. Its climate is characterized by large temperature variations, which cause
    different weather conditions for each of the four seasons. The eastern and western
    parts of ND have different climate conditions. According to the Köppen–Geiger
    climate classification system, the climate of the eastern part of ND has a humid
    continental climate, while the western part has a semi-arid climate [48]. As noted
    by U.S. Global Change Research Program (2000), the average temperature in ND has
    increased about 3 °C. Figure 1 presents the locations of the stations. Figure
    2 illustrates variations of soil temperature over 2010–2018 for all five working
    stations (Baker, Beach, Cando, Crary, and Fingal) at 10 cm soil depth along statistical
    analysis of all metrological station (see Table 1). For Crary station, the variations
    of soil temperature throughout the consecutive nine years were persistent as well
    as extreme than at other stations. The ST for most of the years appeared stable
    for both Baker and Fingal stations. In contrast, Cando station had the most variability
    in ST among the nine consecutive years. The lowest ST was in 2014 and slowly inched
    upward till 2018, and 2010–2012 showed equivalent as well as peak ST among all
    years. For Beach station, the ST variations appeared broader and sharpener for
    each of the years equally mostly except in 2012 and 2015 where it was the lowest
    throughout the period. TABLE 1 Statistical Analysis of ST Dataset at Meteorological
    Station FIGURE 1. Locations of meteorological stations in North Dakota. Show All
    FIGURE 2. Trend of actual bare soil temperature at the five studied meteorological
    stations at 10 cm depth. Show All In 2012, ST was the least for three meteorological
    stations (Beach, Cando and Crary), where for Baker and Fingal the lease ST was
    in 2017 and 2015, respectively. A couple of lower values of ST occurred throughout
    all nine years for Baker, Beach and Cando, where three times of lower values of
    ST occurred for Fingal and in case of Crary it was more than three times. SECTION
    III. Methodological Overview A. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    ANFIS, developed by Jang [49], is a combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks,
    drawing on their advantages. ANFIS applies a Takagi–Sugeno inference method that
    generates nonlinear mapping, by the fuzzy IF–THEN rules, from input to output
    domains. It uses five layers to address its tasks. Figure 3a summarizes these
    layers and the following steps explain the working sequence of these layers. FIGURE
    3. a) Basic ANFIS model structure, b) Flowchart of the proposed method. Show All
    Layer 1 passes the inputs x and y to the nodes to calculate the output of this
    layer using the generalized Gaussian membership μ as in the following equations
    [50]: O 1i = O 1i = μ(x)= μ A i (x),i=1,2, μ B i−2 (y),i=3,4 e − (x− ρ i / σ i
    ) 2 (1) (2) View Source where B i and A i denote the values of the membership
    μ ; and σ i and ρ i denote the parameters set. Layer 2 applies Eq. 3 to calculate
    the output of each node (the firing strength of a rule). After that, the results
    are normalized in Layer 3 by Eq. 4: O 2i = O 3i = μ A i (x)× μ B i−2 (y) w ¯ i
    = ω i ∑ 2 i=1 ω i , (3) (4) View Source In Layer 4, the adaptive nodes are computed
    by Eq. 5: O 4,i = w ¯ i f i = w ¯ i ( p i x+ q i y+ r i ) (5) View Source where
    r, q, and p denote the parameters of the i -th node. Layer 5 computes the output
    results using the following equation: O 5 = ∑ i w ¯ i f i (6) View Source In several
    cases the search domain of the ANFIS model becomes wider but the convergence becomes
    slower, therefore it can get trapped in local optima [51]. Consequently, training
    the weights of the ANFIS model is a valuable step to overcome such a problem.
    B. SALP Swarm Algorithm (SSA) Salp swarm algorithm (SSA), proposed by [42], is
    an optimization technique mimicking the behaviour of the salp chains in nature.
    This behaviour is considered as a swarm behaviour; the target of this swarm is
    a food source. Salps use this behaviour to forage and move with fast harmonious
    diversity [52]. The SSA is formed mathematical to be used in the computational
    process. The initial population of SSA, after generation, is divided into two
    groups. The front one is called salp leader, whereas the reset is called salp
    follower. The search space of a given problem is represented in n-dimensions where
    n is the number variables. The salp leader positions are frequently updated using
    the following equation: x i j ={ F j + c 1 (( ub j − lb j )× c 2 + lb j ), F j
    − c 1 (( ub j − lb j )× c 2 + lb j ), c 3 ≤0 c 3 >0 (7) View Source where x 1
    j , ub j , and lb j denote the position, upper and lower bounds in j -th dimension,
    respectively; F j defines the food source; c 2 and c 3 are generated randomly
    in the range [0,1]; and coefficient c 1 balances the exploration and the exploitation
    stages, whereas the following equation is used to compute its value: c 1 =2 e
    − ( 4p P ) 2 (8) View Source where P and p denote the maximum number of loops
    and the current loop, respectively. The followers’ positions are also updated
    by the following equation: x i j = 1 2 ( x i j + x i−1 j ) (9) View Source where
    i>1 and x i j denotes the i -th follower position. C. Grasshopper Optimization
    Algorithm (GOA) GOA is an optimization technique and works as the grasshopper
    insects in nature (Saremi et al. 2017). The grasshopper is a kind of pest effects
    on agriculture and crop production. Its life cycle includes three stages: egg,
    nymph, and adulthood [54]. In the nymph stage, it moves slowly in rolling cylinders
    and jumps by small steps and eats vegetation in its path. In the adulthood stage,
    it uses swarm behaviour to migrate a long distance with long- range and abrupt
    movement. This behaviour can be mathematically expressed by the following equations
    [47]: x i = S i + G i + A i ,i=1,2,…,N (10) View Source where x i is the position
    of the i-th grasshopper, and S i is its social interaction that can be defined
    as follows: S i = ∑ j=1 i≠j N s( d ij ) d ^ ij , d ij =| x i − x j |,  d ^ ij
    = x i − x j d ij (11) View Source where d ij denotes the space between the j -th
    and i -th grasshoppers. d ^ ij indicates a unit vector from the i -th to the j
    -th grasshoppers, and s denotes the social forces’ strength that can be defined
    as: s(y)=f e −y l − e −y (12) View Source where l and f denote the attractive
    length scale and the attraction’s intensity, respectively. The wind direction
    is a main factor in the movement of nymph grasshoppers because they have no wings.
    In Eq. (13), A i and G i denote the wind advection and the gravity force for the
    i-th grasshopper, respectively: A i =u e ^ w , G i =−g e ^ g (13) View Source
    where u and g denote a constant drift and the gravitational constant, respectively;
    and e ^ w and e ^ g denote the unity vectors of the direction of wind and towards
    earth’s center, respectively. Taking these factors into account Eq. (13) is rewritten
    in Eq. (14) to be more suitable for searching for the solution of a given problem.
    x d i =c ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ∑ j=1 i≠j N c u d − l d 2 s(| x d j − x d i |) x j − x i
    d ij ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ + T ^ d , (14) View Source where u and l denote the upper and
    the lower bounds of the search domain, respectively; T ^ d denotes the current
    best solution; N is the population number; D denotes the dimension of the problem;
    and c denotes a decreasing coefficient to provide good balancing between exploration
    and exploitation phases and can be calculated by the following equation: c= c
    max −t c max − c min t max (15) View Source where c max and c min indicate the
    maximum and the minimum values, respectively, namely 1 for c max and 0.0001 for
    c min ; t denotes to the number of the current iteration; and t max is the maximum
    number of iterations. D. Proposed Method (ANFIS-mSG) The proposed method contains
    two improvement stages. The first stage is to improve the basic SSA using mutation
    phase in order to enhance its exploration phase. After that, the improved SSA
    algorithm is used as a local search for GOA algorithm; this stage produces an
    mSG algorithm. The second stage uses the mSG algorithm to improve and train the
    basic ANFIS model. These stages are explained in the following subsections. 1)
    First Stage (mSG) In this stage the basic SSA is improved by adding a mutation
    phase in its structure. This phase generates a mutation vector x mu as in the
    following equation: x mu,i = x p1 +δ×( x p2 − x p3 ) (16) View Source where, i=1,2,3,…,N
    ;whereas x q , x w , and x r are random populations; and δ is a constant ∈[0,2]
    and works to control the differential variation. Then this vector ( x mu,i ) is
    evaluated by the fitness function; if its fitness value is better than the fitness
    value of the original vector ( x i ), then it will be used, else the old fitness
    value will be retained. Consequently, the improved SSA is used as a local search
    for the basic GOA to help in exploring more domains in the search space. 2) Second
    Stage (ANFIS-mSG) In this stage the mSG algorithm is used to adjust the ANFIS’s
    parameters by passing the optimal weights between layers 4 and 5. The ANFIS-mS
    starts by receiving the predictors and splits them into train and test sets as
    well as setting up all parameter values. The membership function is determined
    by using the fuzzy c-mean method. The next step is to apply the mSG algorithm
    to optimize and adapt the ANFIS’s weight values, where the mSG searches for the
    best weights that can give the best solution by exploring various domains. In
    this stage, the mSG starts searching for the best parameters for the ANFIS. These
    parameters are fed to train the ANFIS, then the fitness values are evaluated by
    Eq. (17) to check if the candidate parameters are good and better than the old
    ones or the algorithm should search for another one. MSE= 1 n ∑ i=1 n ( a i −
    p i ) 2 (17) View Source where a denotes the actual values; p denotes the output
    values; and n is the size of inputs. MSE is the well-established metric used as
    determination for the fitness matrix, as reported over the literature [55], [56].
    MSE helps to know how close the predicted results to regression line, since the
    smaller value of MSE indicates the good results. It can effectively work with
    large error whereas, it gives a relatively high weight to them. MSE is a simple
    and common metric for measuring the performance of the regression models besides,
    it does not affect the computational cost. Therefore, the best parameters will
    be considered according to the smallest error between actual and predicted values.
    The ANFIS-mS works until reaching the maximum number of iterations which will
    be considered as a stop criterion. Then, the selected parameters are fed to the
    ANFIS to start preparing the predicted results in the test phase. The entire process
    of the proposed ANFIS-mSG model is illustrated in Figure 3b. It is worth to report
    the magnitudes of the internal tuning parameters of each model and those values
    reported in Table 2. TABLE 2 The Magnitudes of the Tuning Parameters of the Developed
    Models E. Model Development This study aims to investigate the ability of the
    ANFIS-mSG algorithm for predicting the soil temperature. For this reason, the
    experimental dataset is divided into two parts; the first part is used for training
    the proposed method, whereas the second part is used for the testing phase. In
    the training phase, the ANFIS-mSG begins by generating a random population x ;
    each x i, (i=1,2,3,… ., N ) represents a solution. This population is updated
    by the improved SSA and GOA using a probability ( pb ) to switch between them
    as in Equation 18: pb i = f i ∑ n i=1 f i (18) View Source where f i is the current
    fitness value. If pb i >rand() , the improved SSA will update the solution, else
    the GOA will be used. The reason for using this probability is to overcome the
    limitation of the original GOA, such as high computation time, premature convergence,
    and getting trapped in a local minimum. After this step, each solution is evaluated
    using the fitness function and consequently, the prediction error is calculated
    using Equation (17). The result of this equation is used to check if the current
    solution is better than the best solution or not. If true, the current solution
    will be saved for comparison in the next iteration. This sequence is repeated
    till meeting the stop condition which is the maximum number of iterations. Then,
    the best candidate parameter is passed to update the ANFIS model to start the
    testing phase. In the testing phase, the ANFIS-mSG method receives the test data
    to evaluate the candidate parameter of ANFIS. The output of this phase is evaluated
    using seven performance measures as shown below. F. Performance Metrics Seven
    performance measures are presented which were used to evaluate the proposed predictive
    models [57]. Root mean square error (RMSE): It is computed by the following equation:
    RMSE= 1 n ∑ i=1 n ( a i − p i ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (19) View Source
    where a denotes the output values, p denotes the real values, and n is the total
    number of items. Standard deviation (STD): It is computed by the following equation:
    STD= 1 n ∑ i=1 n ( RMSE i −μ ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (20) View

    where, μ a is the mean value of the a values. SECTION IV. Results and Analysis
    The main motivation of the current research was to investigate the feasibility
    of new hybrid intelligent models based on the integration the viability of nature
    inspired algorithms for optimizing the internal parameters of the ANFIS model
    and modeling soil temperature at five different meteorological station located
    in North Dakota, USA. The models were trained using a univariate modeling procedure
    based on AT data, including maximum, mean and minimum values. The proposed hybrid
    predictive model and the competing models were assessed and evaluated using statistical
    performance indicators. Figure 4 reveals two statistical performance metrics,
    including MAE and RMSE, for the applied predictive models (i.e., ANFIS-mSG, ANFIS,
    ANFIS-DA, ANFIS-GA, ANFIS-GO, ANFIS-GWO, ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-SSA) for all five
    meteorological stations (Baker, Beach, Cando, Crary and Fingal). With respect
    to MAE and RMSE statistics, the ANFIS-mSG model had the lowest magnitudes, showing
    the best performance for all stations except Fingal station where both proposed
    ANFIS-mSG and ANFIS-GA models were at the top with 81% and 82% enhancement in
    the case of RMSE and MAE, respectively, in comparison with the ANFIS. The highest
    performance enhancement was observed using the proposed ANFIS-mSG by (82% of RMSE
    and 79% of MAE) at Cando station in comparison with the least performed model
    (i.e., ANFIS-GOA). The lowest MAE and RMSE values of ANFIS-mSG model appeared
    for Crary, almost equivalent for both Baker and Fingal stations, while slightly
    higher and simultaneously highest values of the same matrices for Beach and Cando
    stations. In contrast, the highest MAE and RMSE values appeared for ANFIS model
    alone for all stations except Cando where ANFIS-GOA ranked the highest for the
    same performance matrices (See Table 3–7). This can be explained by the most unstable
    soil and air temperatures throughout 2010-2018, among all stations (Fig. 2), also
    this model supported the unstable variability. The second-best performing model
    was the ANFIS-GA model of all stations except Crary station where ANFIS-PSO scored
    higher than ANFIS-GA as per the same values of performance matrices. This can
    be clarified due to the capacity of the genetic algorithm and the particle swarm
    optimization as a robust nature inspired optimization algorithms for tuning the
    internal parameters of AI models [50], [58]. In addition, this could be due to
    the extreme ST traced within a year among all meteorological stations and AT showed
    more observations of low temperature throughout the years. TABLE 3 Statistical

    Models in the Testing Phase at Cando Meteorological Station TABLE 6 Statistical

    at Fingal Meteorological Station FIGURE 4. The magnitudes of (a) MAE and (b) RMSE
    of predictive models in the testing phase for all meteorological stations. Show
    All The second least performing predictive model was ANFIS-GOA, followed by ANFIS-DA
    model as per the magnitude of MAE and RMSE metrics. The third best-performing
    model came up with higher values of MAE and RMSE (i.e., ANFIS-SSA) which can be
    a promising competitor with ANFIS-GWO model, except for Beach station where the
    RMSE value was higher for the ANFIS-SSA and nearly similar with the MAE value.
    The variation of the results was apparently owing to different geographical locations
    of Beach among all meteorological stations and may cause the variety in various
    metrological parameters (Fig. 1); in the case of AT it exhibited the low variability
    with a year. Figure 5a shows the scatter plots of actual and predicted values
    of training and testing phases of all models for Baker station. The ANFIS-mSG
    and ANFIS-GA performances were at the top ( R 2 =0.977 ) for Baker station and
    as well as for all other stations where those two predictive models were followed
    by ANFIS-PSO models. On the contrary, ANFIS-GOA performed with least statistical
    matrices score and was followed by ANFIS-DA and ANFIS models, whereas ANFIS-SSA
    and ANFIS-GWO remained at the average level. It can be noted that, ANFIS-GOA consumed
    the highest convergence time among all models, followed by ANFIS-mSG. The least
    time was scored by ANFIS model alone, whereas the remaining models took on an
    average form. Figure 5b shows the agreement between actual and predicted values
    of ST for the training and testing phases of the eight models at Beach station.
    The best performance was by ANFIS-mSG ( R 2 =0.967 ), followed by ANFIS-GA and
    ANFIS-PSO, despite having high variance in AT and a smaller number of the negative
    value of ST in each year. ANFIS-SSA and ANFIS-GWO models had typical prediction
    performance. However, ANFIS-GOA and ANFIS models performed with lower predictability;
    yet, were better than ANFIS-DA whose performance was the least among all, with
    determination coefficient value R 2 =0.722 . The highest time consumption was
    observed by ANFIS-GOA (T 39.694 sec), followed by ANFIS-mSG (T 29.912 sec), while
    ANFIS-PSO (T 6.581 sec) was he least time-consuming model. FIGURE 5. Scatter plots
    for training and testing phases for predictive models at a) Baker, b) Beach, c)
    Cando, d) Crary and e) Fingal stations. Show All Figure 5c illustrates the training
    and testing phases of the proposed and competing predictive models for Cando station.
    The highest agreement between observed and predicted values was by ANFIS-mSG (
    R 2 =0.967 ) which was almost similar to ANFIS-GA ( R 2 =0.966 ) and ANFIS-PSO
    ( R 2 =0.965 ). These models performed better even for negative values of AT that
    appeared more times and most of the value of AT and ST were near to the mean value.
    The distinguished least performance was by ANIFS-GOA model in respect of R 2 =0.537
    as well as T 40.131 sec. The remaining models performed average (ANIFS-SSA, ANFIS,
    ANIFS-GWO and ANIFS-DA). In the case of time consumed by each of the models, the
    least time spent was by ANFIS model where ANIFS-GOA used up the highest, followed
    by ANFIS-mSG. Figure 5d shows the scatter plots of training and testing phases
    of each model for Crary station. In this case, ANFIS-mSG performed the best (
    R 2 =0.976 ), likewise for other stations. Another observation was that all models
    performed well with the range of R 2 =0.975 (ANIFS-GA) to R 2 =0.953 (ANFIS).
    The ST and AT were observed almost stable with its peak value as well throughout
    the years. The ANFIS model had spent the least time T 2.952 sec. On the other
    hand, ANIFS-GOA expended for the largest time (T 39.515 sec), followed by ANFIS-mSG
    (T 33.999 sec). The remaining models did not have a significant difference, the
    average time range was 6.5-11.4 sec. Figure 5e presents the scatter diagram of
    training and testing phases of the models to determine the relationship between
    the actual and predicted values for Fingal station. The ANFIS-mSG model showed
    the superior predictability. Likewise, at Fingal station, the least performing
    model was ANIFS-DA. ANFIS had an average performance in accordance with ANIFS-SSA,
    ANIFS-GWO and ANIFS-GOA, unlike other stations. Interestingly the time difference
    among all models was noticeable. Highest times were noticed for the ANIFS-GOA
    model, likewise other station, followed by ANFIS-mSG. By contrast, the least time
    (2.824 sec) was used by ANFIS and the remaining models had the average range of
    time (6-10 sec) consumed. Figure 6 presents the distribution of relative error
    of all models for the testing phase for all stations. The demonstration laid out
    the equivalent interquartile range (IQR) of ANFIS-mSG. In contrast, ANIFS-DA and
    ANFIS had unstable relative errors in the testing phase with noteworthy number
    of outliers. For instance, at Baker station, ANFIS has its median value tending
    towards the 1 st quartile (25 percentile of relative error) with the highest peak
    value in the case of minimum as well as maximum, while in the case of ANIFS-DA,
    it was opposite i.e. the median value was towards the 3 rd quartile (75 percentile
    of relative error). A distinguished position of the boxplot was unveiled by all
    models which were slightly on the upper side in comparison with other station.
    FIGURE 6. Relative error for testing phase for predictive models at all meteorological
    stations: a) Baker, b) Beach, c) Cando, d) Crary and e) Fingal stations. Show
    All The relative error at Beach station demonstrated no significant IQR difference
    between ANFIS-mSG and ANIFS-GOA. In contrast, ANIFS-DA, ANIFS-SSA, and ANIFS-GWO
    displayed a gap with an important number of outliers, along with the least IQR
    in the case of ANIFS-DA model. The ANFIS model stood with the extreme point of
    relative error along with the piece of IQR being higher than value +1 among all
    models, likewise in the case of Crary and Fingal stations. There was no weighty
    gap appearing in line to IQR between ANIFS-PSO and ANIFS-GA except for higher
    minimum value in the case of ANIFS-PSO. Based on the relative error in the testing
    phase for Cando station, the box plot exhibited no significant IQR difference
    among ANFIS-mSG, ANIFS-GO, ANIFS-PSO and ANIFS-GA, and the median value was slightly
    bending towards 1 st quartile (Figure 6c). However, for the case of ANIFS-SSA,
    ANIFS-GWO and ANIFS-DA the median values were found towards the 3 rd quartile
    with outliers towards the minimum error value. ANFIS and ANIFS-DA displayed significant
    statistical differences i.e., least IQR value of ANFIS with maximum outliers inside
    of the maximum error value, where the opposite position of maximum outlies was
    found in the case of the ANIFS-DA model. Figure 6d displays the boxplot of the
    relative error for the testing phase at Crary station. There was a noticeableposition
    of median observed in the case of ANFIS-mSG and ANFIS-GOA which was exactly between
    1 st and 3 rd quartile. There was no major important gap of IQR among all models
    except ANFIS which had the largest value of IQR and the median bending towards
    75 percentile relative error value. However, the performance of ANIFS-SSA, ANIFS-GWO,
    ANIFS-PSO, ANIFS-GA and ANIFS-DA exhibited the median value inclined to 25 percentile
    of relative error value. Figure 6e shows a noteworthy gap for IQR boxplots of
    ANIFS-GWO, ANIFS-DA, and ANFIS, whereas ANIFS-DA was found with a maximum number
    of outliers in the case of minimum as well as maximum, followed by ANIFS-GWO in
    line with outliers but limited to the minimum error value only. The median value
    of ANFIS and ANIFS-SSA slightly tended towards 3 rd quartile, while ANFIS had
    he largest value of IQR among all models with the least relative error. There
    was no substantial break between the IQR value of ANFIS-mSG, ANIFS-GOA, ANIFS-PSO
    and ANIFS-GA; and the evident point was the median value appearing exactly between
    1 st and 3 rd quartiles. It is worth highlighting that soil physical properties,
    such as bulk density, moisture content, organic matter, and mineral type, could
    affect the specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the soil and in
    turn affect the diffusion coefficient of soil temperature. With the increase in
    depth, the coefficient of thermal diffusivity decreases in soil. Furthermore,
    the surface temperature transfers with a smaller lag time to deeper layers. Thus,
    with increasing depth, the heat flux changes the temperature of a larger volume
    of soil and ST is reduced further. Soil thermal conductivity and soil moisture
    content (related to soil texture) have a strong influence on soil temperature
    gradients. Many hydrological, biogeochemical, biological processes and atmospheric
    water cycle are influenced by temperature and soil moisture. By definition, soil
    moisture refers to the total water volume (water vapor included) in unsaturated
    soil. Many microbes depend on water for their activity and survival. The biogeochemical
    environment for microorganisms is determined by soil moisture dynamics, as it
    affects dissolved nutrient availability, including organic carbon, ammonium, and
    nitrate. Soil moisture is highly important for microbial activity and diversity
    regulation. Despite the importance of soil moisture, it has not been considered
    as a parameter for weather prediction due to the complexity of its routine measurement
    over large areas. Accurate prediction of surface soil temperature can be achieved
    using analytical models as long as all the necessary input parameters are available,
    although this process is not efficient always. Based on the developed hybrid intelligence
    model, ANFIS-mSG, can be an effective and simple technique of soil temperature
    measurement since it does not require several input parameters. SECTION V. Conclusion
    This study aimed to predict ST using a univariate modeling scheme by incorporating
    only the air temperature information. It was evaluated the ability of the proposed
    hybrid intelligence model (i.e., ANFIS-mSG) to predict ST at different meteorological
    stations (i.e., Baker, Beach, Cando, Crary and Fingal) of North Dakota (ND), USA.
    The proposed hybrid intelligence model was validated against several benchmark
    models (i.e., ANFIS, ANFIS-DA, ANFIS-GA, ANFIS-GO, ANFIS-GWO, ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-SSA).
    The training and testing modeling phases were conducted based on historical information
    of maximum, mean, and minimum air temperature using daily records for nine years
    (1 of January 2010 - 31 of December 2018). Multiple evaluation techniques including
    statistical and graphical were used to present the predictive models. The modeling
    results acknowledged the feasibility of hybridizing ANFIS model with optimization
    algorithms (mSG) for building a robust and efficient predictive model for soil
    temperature. The convergence time of the proposed ANFIS-mSG was relatively acceptable;
    however, the standalone ANFIS reported minimal time but with a high level of prediction
    error. At Carary station, there was a slight difference in the predictive performance
    among the developed hybrid models. The RMSE metrics was enhanced by 73%, 74.4%,
    71.2%, 76.7% and 80.7% using the developed ANFIS-mSG over the standalone ANFIS
    model during the testing phase at Baker, Beach, Cando, Crary, and Fingal meteorological
    stations, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed hybrid artificial intelligence
    (i.e., ANFIS-mSG) model was found to be an efficient predictive model for soil
    temperature based on univariate air temperature scenario. Conflict of Interest

    For developing countries, scarcity of climatic data is the biggest challenge,\
    \ and model development with limited meteorologi-\ncal input is of critical importance.\
    \ In this study, five data intelligent and hybrid metaheuristic machine learning\
    \ algorithms, \nnamely additive regression (AR), AR-bagging, AR-random subspace\
    \ (AR-RSS), AR-M5P, and AR-REPTree, were applied \nto predict monthly mean daily\
    \ reference evapotranspiration  (ET0). For this purpose, climatic data of two\
    \ meteorological \nstations located in the semi-arid region of Pakistan were used\
    \ from the period 1987 to 2016. The climatic dataset includes \nmaximum and minimum\
    \ temperature (Tmax, Tmin), average relative humidity  (RHavg), average wind speed\
    \ (Ux), and sunshine \nhours (n). Sensitivity analysis through regression methods\
    \ was applied to determine effective input climatic parameters for \n ET0 modeling.\
    \ The results of performed regression analysis on all input parameters proved\
    \ that Tmin,  RHAvg, Ux, and n were \nidentified as the most influential input\
    \ parameters at the studied station. From the results, it was revealed that all\
    \ the selected \nmodels predicted  ET0 at both stations with greater precision.\
    \ The AR-REPTree model was located furthest and the AR-M5P \nmodel was located\
    \ nearest to the observed point based on the performing indices at both the selected\
    \ meteorological sta-\ntions. The study concluded that under the aforementioned\
    \ methodological framework, the AR-M5P model can yield higher \naccuracy in predicting\
    \  ET0 values, as compared to other selected algorithms.\nKeywords Reference evapotranspiration ·\

    The difficulty to access water has become one of the fun-\ndamental issues globally\
    \ through the twenty-first century \n(Gleeson et al. 2012; Elbeltagi et al. 2021).\
    \ Most of the \nreadily available fresh water on the earth’s surface is \nused\
    \ up by the agricultural sector. The amount of water \nwithdrawn from the surface\
    \ of the earth in developing \ncountries is estimated as ~ 81%, while the same\
    \ is ~ 71% \nglobally. Furthermore, irrigation plays a major role in the \nconsumption\
    \ of not less than 55% of the world’s freshwa-\nter reserves (Amarasinghe and\
    \ Smakhtin 2014). Being able \nto provide food for the world’s population has\
    \ become a \nconundrum amidst freshwater scarcity (Fischer et al. 2007; \nShukla\
    \ et al. 2021). Heightened demand for the limited \nwater resources under rising\
    \ climate change impacts and \ncertain agricultural commodities have constantly\
    \ hinted \nupon the need for ways to devise efficient use of the exist-\ning water\
    \ resources at our fingertips. This will also require \nsmart distribution of\
    \ limited water resources in terms of \nappropriate time and through the right\
    \ channel toward \npremium food production (Dhillon et al. 2019; Kushwaha \net al.\
    \ 2016). Gaining knowledge of the biophysical pro-\ncesses included in the uptake\
    \ of water through the root \nzone of the soil and the processes of transpiration\
    \ through \nthe plant canopy has become essential. The sustenance of \nthe development\
    \ of irrigation and its processes depends \non these aforementioned mechanisms.\
    \ Hence, it becomes \nnecessary to develop abilities for determining the precise\
    \ \namount of water requirements for an effective irrigation \nschedule (Rossini\
    \ et al. 2013; Kushwaha et al. 2021). Ref-\nerence evapotranspiration  (ET0) is\
    \ regarded as the prin-\ncipal component of the global hydrological cycle which\
    \ \nhas a direct effect on the yield of crops, water require-\nments, irrigation\
    \ facilities, future plannings, as well as \nthe management of water resources.\
    \ It is considered as the \naggregate term that combines the removal of water\
    \ from \nthe vegetative surface, which contains enough moisture, \nand the evaporation\
    \ from the catchment surfaces. Certain \nfactors such as certain management activities,\
    \ character-\nistics of crops, condition of the weather, land type, and \noperations\
    \ on the field are the major constituents that \nimpact the process of  ET0 (Sherma\
    \ 2016). A substantially \nuniform field of alfalfa (commonly known as grass)\
    \ is uti-\nlized worldwide for the reference surface. The properties \nof a reference\
    \ surface crop include uniform height, soil \nproperties, a specified amount of\
    \ applied water, and the \nfull growth of the crop in relation to at a certain\
    \ period \nunder the standard meteorological and agronomic condi-\ntions (Łabędzki\
    \ et al. 2011).\nBeing able to estimate  ET0 is paramount in the crop irri-\n\
    gation requirements at the regional and global scale as well \nas the preparation\
    \ of water budget and also in the influence \nof the various climatic changes\
    \ (Nouri et al. 2013; Vish-\nwakarma et al. 2022). The further assessment of \
    \ ET0 is of \nthe essence in the fields of agro-meteorology and hydro-\nmeteorology.\
    \ In reference to Lu et al. (2010) and Zhao \net al. (2013), serious challenges\
    \ have been encountered in \nthe accurate assessment of  ET0 as a result of impercepti-\n\
    ble processes exclusively in an ecosystem or a watershed \nspatial scale with\
    \ the desired level of accuracy. In lieu \nof  ET0 being a biophysical process\
    \ that provides ample \nchallenges on the land surface, the need for varying tech-\n\
    niques and hydrological models was invented to assist in \nthe estimation of \
    \ ET0. As such, an accurate measurement \nof the  ET0 plays other major roles\
    \ which are not limited \nto just the study of climate change and in the assessment\
    \ \nof water resources, but also toward effectively monitoring \nand providing\
    \ adequate forecast on drought as well as in \nthe proper use and growth of water\
    \ resources (Zhao et al. \n2013). As studied by (NOURI et al. 2013), the  ET0\
    \ com-\nputation process has a profoundly high level of desirability \nin its\
    \ impact on climate change, simulating and predicting \ncrop water scheduling,\
    \ in hydrological modeling (HM), \nand in situations of poor data situation and\
    \ how it affects \nland use.\nAn accurate estimation of the  ET0 values is essential\
    \ to \nthe estimation of the soil water balance; this, in turn, depicts \nthe\
    \ measure of water held within the body of the soil and \ncan be related to checkbook\
    \ balancing processes. In most \ncases, the function of the irrigation processes\
    \ is to over-\nsee the content of the soil water in other to promote proper \n\
    development. Good irrigation planning and management are \nenhanced by determining\
    \ the soil water balance, and hence, \nthe process is of paramount importance.\
    \ Knowing the soil’s \nwater balance helps negate the risk associated with apply-\n\
    ing excessive water which enhances percolation and over-\nflow. Irrigation scheduling\
    \ is defined as the proper amount \nof water being applied at the appropriate\
    \ period, and it is \nimpossible without bearing knowledge of the water balance.\
    \ \nThere are varying methods and techniques applicable to esti-\nmate  ET0, and\
    \ they include indirect, direct, and machine \nlearning models (Karimaldini et al.\
    \ 2011).\nThe best choice for direct measurement of  ET0 is by using \nlysimeters.\
    \ However, it is a cumbersome field experimenta-\ntion that is less time-efficient\
    \ and expensive. In addition, the \nmethod is also not considered to be viable\
    \ due to the lack of \nprecision in its planning, while the indirect and soft\
    \ com-\nputing models over the years have gathered importance in \nthe estimation\
    \ of  ET0 from climate and meteorological data. \nThe indirect methods utilized\
    \ for estimating or calculating \nof  ET0 include (1) empirical and semi-empirical\
    \ equations, \n(2) pan evaporation methods, (3) energy budget methods, \n(4) mass\
    \ transfer equations, (5) combination equations, and \n(6) radiation-based methods.\
    \ Further information on indirect \nApplied Water Science (2022) 12:152 \n1 3\n\
    Page 3 of 18 \n152\nmethods can be found in McMahon et al. (2013). In addi-\n\
    tion, empirical and semi-empirical equations based on the \npremise of Priestly–Taylor\
    \ and Penman–Monteith methods \n(Vinukollu et al. 2011) have been widely adopted\
    \ for estima-\ntion of  ET0.\nCoherently, one of the most widely accepted and\
    \ well-\nknown indirect methods for  ET0 estimation has been intro-\nduced by\
    \ the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of \nthe United Nations (Allen et al.\
    \ 1989, 1994). The method \nincludes the infusion of the Penman–Monteith equation\
    \ \nwhich was modified and reformed by Allen et al. (1998) \nas a reference equation\
    \ (FAO-PM56). This equation (FAO-\nPM56) is built on the premise that it has certain\
    \ factors, \nsuch as various climatic, aerodynamic, and surface resist-\nance\
    \ parameters, which it control and influence them. They \ninclude (in terms of\
    \ minimum and maximum magnitude) air \ntemperature, relative air humidity, wind\
    \ speed, solar radia-\ntion, saturation vapor pressure deficit, slope vapor pressure\
    \ \ncurve, and psychometric constant. Most weather stations are \nknown to suffer\
    \ anomalies to air temperature. The reliabil-\nity and completion of other variables\
    \ cannot be trusted in \nmany locations (Rahimikhoob 2010). However, this might\
    \ \nnot be a valid case for developed countries, even though \nit comes across\
    \ as a big challenge in developing countries \nwhere the integrity of the quantity\
    \ and quality of data cannot \nbe assured. According to Trajkovic and Kolakovic\
    \ (2009), \nthere are limitations to the reliability of weather datasets of \n\
    radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed in developing \ncountries. The need\
    \ for geographic data (latitude, longitude, \naltitude) becomes essential for\
    \ an adequate local adjustment \nof the different weather parameters. Such weather\
    \ param-\neters are atmospheric pressure, extra-terrestrial radiations \n(Ra),\
    \ and daylight hours (N) in the FAO-PM56 equation. \nFurthermore, the field measurement\
    \ efforts and the experi-\nmental approaches used are not time-effective or even\
    \ labor-\nintensive for the post-processing output processes. As a \nresult, it\
    \ is quite difficult to formulate the  ET0 equation to \novercome these effects\
    \ that can produce reliable and verified \nresults (Gavilan et al. 2007).\nThe\
    \ modernization and invention of machine learning \nalgorithms are making it easier\
    \ to tackle nonlinear processes \n (ET0) in various disciplines (Kumar et al.\
    \ 2011). The major \nproblem associated with the estimation of  ET0 is its non-\n\
    linear dynamic and high complexity nature. Instead of this, \nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms provide an essential alterna-\ntive for  ET0 estimation. The functionality\
    \ of these algorithm \nworks on the principles associated with the computational\
    \ \nintelligent system which aims to eradicate imprecision and \nvulnerability\
    \ in producing results. The proficiency associ-\nated with dealing with complex\
    \ problems makes these meth-\nods well accepted. More so, there is the added superiority\
    \ of \nusing these methods to deal with complex problems using \njust a set of\
    \ available data (Ibrahim 2016).\nCurrently, machine learning models, based on\
    \ robust \nalgorithms, are applied in mapping nonlinear processes, \nusing input\
    \ and output (target) variables. Raza et al. (2021a, \nb) reviewed  ET0 estimation\
    \ based on accuracy, structure, and \nits usefulness for the study period 2012–2020.\
    \ The primary \nobjective of the reported researches was to develop an alter-\n\
    native soft computing model against FAO-PM56 against the \nlimitation of requiring\
    \ large quantity of climate data as input \nand limited availability of such data\
    \ in the public domain \nacross developing countries. The study found that design-\n\
    ing soft computing models using all the usable data is not \neffective (similar\
    \ to FAO-PM56). Besides, limited studies \nare available that aimed for the development\
    \ of a generalized \n ET0 model for the accurate  ET0 estimation in all stations\
    \ \nwithin an area (Raza et al. 2021a, b). This becomes signifi-\ncant in the\
    \ case of developing countries where climate data \nfrom most stations are either\
    \ missing or not available due to \ntechnical issues and lack of technology. Thus,\
    \ the develop-\nment of  ET0 model with fewer climatic inputs (e.g., tem-\nperature\
    \ data) is mainly requisite. For this purpose, different \ntypes of machine learning\
    \ algorithms were developed in  ET0 \nmodeling, for example, support vector machine\
    \ (SVM) (Kisi \nand Imen 2009; Kushwaha et al. 2021; Mehdizadeh et al. \n2017;\
    \ Ferreiraand and Cunha 2020), least square support \nvector machine (Kisi 2013;\
    \ Guo et al. 2011), genetic pro-\ngramming (Traore et al. 2016; Valipour et al.\
    \ 2019; Mattar \n2018), extreme learning machine (ELM) (Shamshirband \nand Kamsin\
    \ 2016; Abdullah et al. 2015), tree-based models \n(Raza et al. 2021a, b) such\
    \ as M5 model tree (Fan et al. \n2018a, b; Granata 2019), random forest (Feng\
    \ et al. 2017a, \nb; Fang et al. 2018; Saggi and Jain 2019), and extreme gradi-\n\
    ent boosting (XGBoost) (Ferreira and Cunha 2020; Fan et al. \n2018a, b; Han et al.\
    \ 2019), artificial neural networks (ANNs) \n(Torres et al. 2011; Tang et al.\
    \ 2018; Walls et al. 2020), and \nadaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)\
    \ (Nourani \net al. 2019; Tabari et al. 2013).\nIn recent studies, data intelligence\
    \ and hybrid metaheuris-\ntic algorithms have been applied in  ET0 estimation\
    \ on New \nDelhi and Ludhiana stations located in north India due to its \ncapability\
    \ of detecting patterns and changes in time-series \ndata (Kushwaha et al. 2021).\
    \ Moreover, these algorithms can \nalso grab series data without discretization.\
    \ The perfect han-\ndling of time-series data makes their use successful in vari-\n\
    ous engineering problems, especially  ET0 estimation. Wu \net al. (2021) conducted\
    \ a study on  ET0 estimation in south \nChina and applied ELM in combination with\
    \ a clustering \napproach. The study recommended using proposed machine \nlearning\
    \ models in  ET0 estimation. Roy et al. (2021) esti-\nmated  ET0 using the ANFIS\
    \ model along with various algo-\nrithms in combination and concluded that hybrid\
    \ models \noutperformed single machine learning models. Similarly, \nAhmadi et al.\
    \ (2021) compared  ET0 estimation with novel \ndata intelligent models and another\
    \ commonly used genetic \n \nApplied Water Science (2022) 12:152\n1 3\n152 \n\
    Page 4 of 18\nexpression programming (GEP) and SVM single machine \nlearning model.\
    \ The study concluded that the proposed novel \ndata intelligent model in combination\
    \ with SVM has out-\nperformed and found best in comparison with the empiri-\n\
    cal model. Sattari et al. (2021) applied five data intelligent \nmachine learning\
    \ models for estimating  ET0 using several \ninput meteorological combinations\
    \ and found that combin-\ning machine learning (hybrid) models increase predictive\
    \ \nability in results. Malik et al. (2019) estimated  ET0 using \nfive machine\
    \ learning models using different meteorological \ninput combinations and concluded\
    \ that accuracy in results \nand efficiency can be increased by using hybrid machine\
    \ \nlearning models. It can be inferred from aforesaid stud-\nies that data intelligent\
    \ and hybrid metaheuristic machine \nlearning algorithms are recommended in  ET0\
    \ modeling and \ncan be considered the best alternative to conventional FAO-\n\
    PM56 equation. Thus, this study applied five data intelli-\ngent and hybrid metaheuristic\
    \ machine learning algorithms, \nnamely additive regression (AR), AR-bagging,\
    \ AR-random \nsubspace (AR-RSS), AR-M5P, and AR-REPTree, for esti-\nmating monthly\
    \ mean daily  ET0. Coherently, the contribu-\ntions of the current study in scientific\
    \ literature are as fol-\nlows: (1) developing and evaluating the potential of\
    \ AR, \nAR-bagging, AR-RSS, AR-M5P, and AR-REPTree in  ET0 \nestimation; (2) determining\
    \ effective meteorological input \ncombination by performing sensitivity analysis;\
    \ and (3) \ninvestigating best performing hybrid data intelligent and \nhybrid\
    \ metaheuristic machine learning algorithms based on \ndifferent standard statistical\
    \ indices.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy area, data preparation, and preprocessing\n\
    The study area is comprised of two stations, namely Fais-\nalabad and Islamabad\

    (U, km/day), and sunshine hours (N, h) are obtained from \nPakistan Meteorological\

    \ \nIn machine learning, the regression is preferably calculated \nby an algorithmic\

    \ Water Science (2022) 12:152\n1 3\n152 \nPage 6 of 18\nAdditive regression (AR)\n\
    In recent years, Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), \nwhich are a flexible\
    \ prediction machine learning approach, \nhave gained popularity among the research\
    \ community due \nto their widespread applications (Sparapani et al. 2021; \n\
    Tan and Roy 2019). This study has used BART for addi-\ntive regression using MATLAB.\
    \ This study has a continu-\nous outcome for  ET0 (say y) and p covariates x =\
    \ (x1, …, \nxp). The BART model, which aims for the prediction, can \ndefine complex\
    \ relations between the aforesaid x and y by \nestimating f(x) from models of\
    \ the form y = f (x) + ε, where \nε ∼ N(0, σ2). Further, a sum of m regression\
    \ trees is used, \ni.e., f(x) = ∑ g (x; Tj, Mj) ranging between j = 1 and j =\
    \ m \nwhich allows estimation of f(x). The expression for BART \nis shown in Eq. 1.\n\
    Bagging\nBootstrap aggregation or bagging is generally employed \nto decrease\
    \ variance within a noisy dataset. It follows the \nensemble learning method such\
    \ that when an algorithm \noverfits (high variance and low bias) or underfits\
    \ (low vari-\nance and high bias) to its training set, ensemble methods can \n\
    then account for the generalization of the model to new data-\nsets (Breiman 1996).\
    \ Considering this, in the present study, \na random sample of data in a training\
    \ set was selected with \nreplacement. This allowed the selection of individual\
    \ data \npoints more than once; however, the models so generated \nwere weak because,\
    \ on an individual level, its performance \nmay not be significant due to high\
    \ variance or high bias. \nPost-generation of several data samples, these weak\
    \ models \nwere then trained independently, given regression and clas-\nsification.\
    \ In general, the aggregation of these weak mod-\nels allowed reducing biases\
    \ and variances, thereby yielding \nimproved model performance.\nRandom Subspace\
    \ (RSS)\nThe random subspace (RSS) ensemble is a machine learning \nalgorithm\
    \ introduced by Ho (1998). The algorithm combines \nmultiple classifiers and their\
    \ outputs (predictions) from mul-\ntiple decision trees via a voting approach.\
    \ It has overcome \none of the critical shortcomings of traditional decision trees\
    \ \n(Lasota et al. 2013). This has been achieved by address-\ning the decision-making\
    \ tree classifier overfitting issue (i.e., \nhigh variance and low bias). Further,\
    \ it ensures that the pre-\ncision of the training results remained protected.\
    \ Skurichina \n(1)\ny = f(x) + 휀 =\nm\n∑\nj=1\ng(x;Tj, Mj\n) + 휀.\nand Duin (2002)\
    \ classified inputs of the RSS algorithm into \nfour categories, viz. (1) training\
    \ dataset (Tx), (2) base clas-\nsifier (Cw), (3) size of subspaces (SL), and (4)\
    \ number of \nsubspaces (Sds). In general, the procedure follows selecting \n\
    a random subset of input features (columns) for each model \nin the ensemble and\
    \ thereby fitting the model on the model \nin the entire training dataset. It\
    \ can be implemented using \nbootstrap or random sample (rows) in the training\
    \ dataset.\nM5P\nQuinlan (1992) introduced the M5 algorithm which was \nfurther\
    \ reconstructed to develop the M5P model tree. This \nintegrates the traditional\
    \ decision tree with the linear regres-\nsion function. Wang and Witten (1996)\
    \ described the four \nsteps in the M5P algorithm, viz. (1) splitting of input\
    \ spaces; \n(2) developing a linear regression model; (3) pruning pro-\ncess;\
    \ and (4) smoothing process. Besides, the M5P algo-\nrithm has been recognized\
    \ as a robust algorithm due to its \ngreater efficiency while dealing with missing\
    \ data problems. \nSince M5P can efficiently handle and process large datasets\
    \ \nso as to ensure reduced errors in the output, this study has \nconsidered\
    \ it for analyzing and predicting the  ET0 process \nin the study area.\nThe present\
    \ study acquired information about the splitting \ncriteria for the M5P model\
    \ tree based on the error calculated \nat each node. (Linear regression functions\
    \ are assigned on \nterminal nodes.) The standard deviation of the class values\
    \ \nis used for analyzing the error at each node. The attribute at \neach node\
    \ is tested so as to select a particular attribute for \nsplitting. This selection\
    \ is majorly driven by determining the \nattribute that maximizes the expected\
    \ error reduction, which \ncan be obtained by standard deviation reduction (SDR),\
    \ as \nshown in Eq. 2.\nwhere A represents the set of instances that attain the\
    \ node, \nAi represents the subset of illustrations that have the ith \nproduct\
    \ of the possible set, and SD represents the standard \ndeviation.\nREPTree\n\
    Quinlan (1987) introduced the reduced error pruning tree \n(REPTree) algorithm\
    \ as a representative technique to explain \ndecision tree learning problems.\
    \ REPTree is an ensemble of a \ntraditional decision tree, wherein it generates\
    \ a decision regres-\nsion tree by using the gain ratio information and by separating\
    \ \nand pruning the regression tree. More precisely, in this algo-\nrithm, the\
    \ training data are split into two sets, viz. training and \npruning set, such\
    \ that ~ 75% of the data are used for training \n(2)\nSDR = SD(A)\ni∑\n1\n||Ai||\n\

    purposes (training the decision tree), while the remaining data \nare used for\
    \ pruning purposes (pruning data help determine \naccuracy measurement). As pruning\
    \ decreases the decision \ntree size by error elimination of individual trees\
    \ (Rahman et al. \n2021), this study has considered the REPTree algorithm as a\
    \ \nstandard model for predicting evapotranspiration.\nModel performance indicators\n\
    This study included different statistical indices for evaluating \nthe model performance,\
    \ such as mean absolute error (MAE), \nrelative absolute error (RAE), root mean\
    \ square error (RMSE), \nroot-relative mean square error (RRMSE), and correlation\
    \ \ncoefficient (r). MAE statistics represent the mean absolute \ndeviation of\
    \ forecasted values from the observed values of \ntime series, as shown in Eq. 3,\
    \ while RAE statistic represents \nthe ratio of the absolute error of the measurement\
    \ to the actual \nmeasurement which helps to determine the magnitude of the \n\
    absolute error in terms of the actual size of the measurement. \nRMSE statistics\
    \ represent the root mean square deviation of \nforecasted values from the observed\
    \ values of time series, as \nshown in Eq. 4. More precisely, the relative error\
    \ provides \ninferences about the strength of measurement with reference \nto\
    \ the actual measurement. RRSE statistic normalizes the total \nsquared error\
    \ by dividing it with the simple predictor (average \nof the actual values), thereby\
    \ allowing reducing the error to the \nsame dimensions as the quantity being forecasted,\
    \ mathemati-\ncally shown by Eq. 5. The correlation coefficient represents \n\
    the measure of linear association between the dependent and \nindependent variables,\
    \ as shown in Eq. 6.\n(3)\nMAE = 1\nN\nN\n∑\ni=1\n|||ETpi − EToi|||\n(4)\nRMSE\

    \ respectively, and \n ETp and  ET0 are average values of  ET0 predicted/forecasted\
    \ \nand observed/calculated by FAO56-PM, respectively. \nBesides, N represents\
    \ the number of data, while the range \nbetween zero and the closest value indicates\
    \ good perfor-\nmance for all indices except r2, such that the best value for\
    \ \nr2 is 1.\nResults\nBest subset regression and sensitivity analysis\nSelection\
    \ of best input combination\nThe best input combination has been selected using\
    \ the six \nstatistical criteria (i.e., MSE, determination coefficients (R2),\

    \ It is apparent \nfrom Table 6 that the hybrid AR-RSS algorithm performed \n\
    better during the training period and the AR-M5P mod-\nels performs better than\
    \ other applied algorithms during \nthe testing period. The additive AR, AR-bagging,\

    Figure 4a–e shows the time-series plot (left side) and \nscatter plot (right side).\
    \ In scatter plots, the regression line \nprovided the coefficient of determination\

    RSS, 0.915 for the AR-M5P model, and 0.872 for the AR-\nREPTree model (Fig. 4a\
    \ to e). The regression line (RL) was \nlocated below the best fit (1:1) for all\
    \ the applied models, \nwhich means these models underestimated the  ET0 values\
    \ \nconcerning the observed  ET0 values. The AR-M5P model \nprovided the RL near\

    In addition to the above, the performance of the applied \nmodels was assessed\
    \ using a radar chart of the best-calcu-\nlated value of RMSE. Having a better\
    \ diagnostic analysis of \nthe efficiency of all models, the values of RMSE are\
    \ shown \nin Fig. 5. It can be inferred that the AR-M5P model has a \nlower value\
    \ of RMSE; this revealed that the AR-M5P model \nperformed better than other models.\
    \ Further comparative \nanalysis (AR) model was located furthest. The AR-M5P \n\

    \ input parameters, \nnamely minimum temperature and sunshine hours, exhibited\
    \ \nequally strong positive correlation with actual and AR-M5P \n ET0 which was\
    \ computed as 0.91 and 0.73 for Faisalabad \nstation, but 0.84 and 0.73 for Islamabad\
    \ station, respectively. \nStrong negative correlation was found between average\
    \ RH \nand actual (PM56)  ET0 (0.39, 0.48) in Faisalabad station. \nSimilar relation\
    \ was found between average RH and AR-\nM5P  ET0 (0.36, 0.49) in case of Islamabad\
    \ station. Interest-\ningly, wind speed parameter was also found strongly cor-\n\
    related with the AR-M5P  ET0 in positive direction (0.85) in \nFaisalabad, but\
    \ looked weakly correlated, i.e., 0.57 in case \nof Islamabad station. This indicated\
    \ that wind speed plays a \nvital role and should be considered as an effective\
    \ climatic \nparameter for  ET0 estimation at Faisalabad station. In addi-\ntion,\
    \ wind speed for Faisalabad station was recorded high-\nest (386.28 km/day) due\
    \ to its geographical position. Also, \nsevere types of the thunderstorm were\
    \ observed every year \ndue to western cold wind direction. Further, it has humid\
    \ \nsummer and dry winter seasons which also support our \nabove-mentioned results.\n\
    Discussion\nThe performance of hybrid machine learning algorithms was \nassessed\
    \ for the estimation of reference  ET0 values at two \ndifferent meteorological\
    \ stations. The results revealed that \nmachine learning algorithms have the prediction\
    \ potential \nfor  ET0. More specifically, the AR-M5P model showed the \nsuperior\
    \ result. The scatter plot between the observed and \nestimated  ET0 values at\
    \ different locations is presented in \nFigs. 4 and 5. It can be inferred that\
    \ the RL provided the \nhigh value of the R2 with reference to the AR-M5P model\
    \ at \nboth the selected stations. This showed the superiority of the \nAR-M5P\
    \ model. Further comparison among AR alone and \nhybrid algorithms was made using\
    \ a radar chart (Figs. 6, 7) \nof best-calculated value of RMSE. The result revealed\
    \ that \nthe AR-M5P model predicted  ET0 more precisely at both \nstations, as\
    \ it has a lower value of RMSE. The Taylor dia-\ngram (Figs. 8, 9) showed the\
    \ more comparable depiction of \nmodel performance in  ET0 values. The AR-REPTree\
    \ model \nwas located furthest and the AR-M5P model was located \nFig. 4  Observed\

    \ This showed AR-M5P model has higher \naccuracy in the prediction of  ET0 values\

    \ study were also compared \nwith the recent work (Kisi et al. 2015; Kisi 2015;\

    \ (ANFIS-GP), ANFIS with subtractive clustering \n(ANFIS-SC), and GEP, in predicting\
    \ monthly  ET0 from 50 \nmeteorological stations in Iran. The study concluded\

    \ Feng et al. (2017a, b) computed daily \n ET0 for southwestern China between\
    \ 2009 and 2014 using \nRF and GRNN models utilizing meteorological information.\
    \ \nThe RF method was deemed to be superior even though both \nmethods were judged\
    \ to be suitable. Shiri (2018) estimates \n ET0 by weather data via the combined\
    \ wavelet random forest \napproach (WRF). It was concluded that outcomes were\
    \ bet-\nter when the WRF hybrid model. Fan et al. (2018a, b) inves-\ntigated the\
    \ potential for the daily  ET0 modeling of restricted \nweather data using the\
    \ K-fold-validation approach in terms \nof gradient boosting decision-making (GBDT),\
    \ extreme \ngradient boosting (XGBoost), RF, and M5 modeling tree \n(M5Tree).\
    \ The authors also applied SVM and ELM models \nto compare the outcomes. They\
    \ employed meteorological \nvariables from a variety of climates to validate the\
    \ mod-\nels from 1961 to 2010 in China. The study suggested using \nGBDT and XGBoost\
    \ models to estimate  ET0 in China's \nvarying climate. Wang et al. (2017b) applied\
    \ models, such \nas the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), the fuzzy genetic \n(FG),\
    \ the long short-term memory (LSVM), the multi-\nlayer perceptron (MLR), and the\
    \ SS models, to predict pan \nevaporation in China. They claimed that soft computing\
    \ \nstrategies outperformed both the MLR and SS models in \nterms of performance.\
    \ A study conducted by Wang et al. \n(2017a) examined the ability of the FG, ANFIS-GP,\
    \ and \nM5Tree models to predict monthly pan evaporation in the \nYangtze River\
    \ Basin in China. The results revealed that the \nFG model outperformed the other\
    \ models in terms of esti-\nmated proficiency. Granata (2019) used meteorological\
    \ data \nfrom central Florida, USA, with four distinct neural network \nmodels\
    \ such as bagging, RF, M5P regression tree, and sup-\nport vector regression.\
    \ These algorithms were tested in the \nhumid subtropical climate conditions and\
    \ compared with the \nobserved  ET0 value. Experimental results showed that the\
    \ \nM5P model produced the greatest results when coupled with \nmeteorological\
    \ data and soil moisture content. The study \nalso confirmed that the AR machine\
    \ learning algorithms per-\nformed better with M5P algorithms and have higher\
    \ accu-\nracy than other applied hybrid models in the prediction of \n ET0 at\
    \ both stations.\nConclusions\nThis study applies five data intelligent and hybrid\
    \ \nmetaheuristic algorithms, namely additive regression \n(AR), AR-bagging, AR-random\
    \ subspace (AR-RSS), \nAR-M5P, and AR-REPTree, in order to investigate their \n\
    potential for reference evapotranspiration  (ET0) predic-\ntion. The input dataset\
    \ of 30 years (1987–2016) for two \nmeteorological stations from semi-arid climatic\
    \ condi-\ntions has been used in this study. In addition,  ET0 was \ndetermined\

    \ and machine learning is a hotspot research area in the domain of agriculture.\
    \ Agriculture \nanalytics is a data intensive multidisciplinary problem. Big data\
    \ analytics becomes a key technology to perform analysis \nof voluminous data.\
    \ Irrigation water management is a challenging task for sustainable agriculture.\
    \ It depends on various \nparameters related to climate, soil and weather conditions.\
    \ For accurate estimation of requirement of water for a crop a strong \nmodeling\
    \ is required. This paper aims to review the application of big data based decision\
    \ support system framework for \nsustainable water irrigation management using\
    \ intelligent learning approaches. We examined how such developments can be \n\
    leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models, analytics\
    \ and decision support tools for agriculture \nirrigation water system. Moreover,\
    \ water irrigation management need to rapidly adapt state-of-the-art using big\
    \ data technolo-\ngies and ICT information technologies with the focus of developing\
    \ application based on analytical modeling approach. This \nstudy introduces the\
    \ area of research, including a irrigation water management in smart agriculture,\
    \ the crop water model \nrequirement, and the methods of irrigation scheduling,\
    \ decision support system, and research motivation.\n1 Introduction\nWATER-Every\
    \ drop is precious, save it.  Water is the main \nlimiting factor of agricultural\
    \ development in semi-arid and \narid climates. It is a critical input for enhancing\
    \ agricultural \nproductivity. Arthur Keith said that the advancement of agri-\n\
    culture is the first major step for civilized life [1]. Even after \nsix decades\
    \ of planned development, agriculture has played \nan important role in the Indian\
    \ economy. However, the agri-\nculture sector of India has been transformed via\
    \ the effective \ndeployment of Information and Communication Technolo-\ngies\
    \ (ICTs) in traditional to modern practices which pro-\nvide various services\
    \ (such as- IoT agriculture, smart water \nmanagement, soil management, plant\
    \ diseases, crop manage-\nment, geo-spatial image and livestock monitoring).\n\
    In India, the demand of water for the agriculture and \nindustry sectors is continuously\
    \ increasing to fulfill the \nneeds of 1.366 billion people. Central Indian Punjab\
    \ is well-\nknown for its agricultural activities and has occupied a high \npercentage\
    \ of the land area all over India, and its agricultural \nproduction mainly depends\
    \ on irrigation.\nPunjab has 97.95% highest gross irrigation of the total \ncropped\
    \ area [2]. Recently, the achievement of the Green \nRevolution is endangered\
    \ by a significant decline in water \nresources. As a result, water conservation\
    \ and precision agri-\nculture are becoming vital issues in tropical climate areas.\
    \ \nWheat and Maize are the most commonly cultivated crops \nand have high water\
    \ consumption in Punjab, India. The \nmajor challenge in agriculture sustainability\
    \ and dawdling \nis due to climate change; therefore, every drop of freshwater\
    \ \nneeds to be utilize effectively and efficiently.\nTo overcome these challenges,\
    \ the multivariate, complex, \nand unpredictable agricultural ecosystems must\
    \ be well \nunderstood by continuously analyzing, measuring, and mon-\nitoring\
    \ several physical aspects and phenomena [3]. New \ntechnologies and knowledge\
    \ can help in this complex deci-\nsion-making. The fundamental idea is that the\
    \ DSS should \nserve as a farm management tool, supporting farm managers \nin\
    \ making decisions on irrigation, whether to irrigate and, \nif so, which field\
    \ with how much water. Wani et al. [4] pre-\nsented a thorough investigation to\
    \ evaluate the possibility of \nusing Machine Learning models to identify plant\
    \ diseases.\nIn the early twentieth century, irrigation is the most \ncrucial\
    \ practice no doubt and needs effective utilization. \n * Mandeep Kaur Saggi \n\

    \ \n1 3\nFarmers required to predict the need of water for the crops, \nto confirm\
    \ the data provided by agricultural weather stations \nor to get insight the free\
    \ water surface evaporation in lakes \nor dams. Agricultural irrigation scheduling\
    \ is becoming a \nvery important managerial activity whose ultimate purpose \n\
    is to achieve effective and efficient utilization of water. The \nprimary objective\
    \ of good irrigation scheduling is to apply \nthe right amount of water at right\
    \ time.\nIrrigation scheduling improves the water use efficiency \nand focus on\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods \nfor understanding of spatial variations\
    \ of ET. It determine \nirrigation applications such as identifying the water\
    \ balance \ncomponent, integrated various sensing technologies into \nirrigation\
    \ scheduling models and control, new improved \nsensor technology and integrated\
    \ water quality constraints \ninto irrigation scheduling and control [5]. Figure 1\
    \ presents \nthe six identified relevant works, indicating the smart water \n\
    management related research work such as crop water mod-\neling, soil monitoring,\
    \ water quality, drones field monitor-\ning, weather forecasting, and irrigation\
    \ scheduling.\nThe ultimate irrigation potential of India has been esti-\nmated\
    \ to be 139.5 million ha, comprising 58.5 million ha \nfrom major and medium schemes,\
    \ 15 million ha from minor \nirrigation schemes, 66 million ha from groundwater\
    \ exploi-\ntation, and an estimated 77 million ha beyond 2025 from \nfreshwater\
    \ use for irrigation [6]. It is approximated that after \ngaining the full potential\
    \ of the irrigation, nearly 50% of the \ntotal cultivated area will hold out rain-fed.\n\
    Irrigation is the most important factor for escalating the \nagricultural production\
    \ of plants. It is essential to determine \nthe quantity of water to get the optimal\
    \ benefits from the irri-\ngation, which depends on some factors such as the environ-\n\
    ment, type of crop, subsurface geo-hydrological condition, \nand the stage of\
    \ its growth.\nThe questions arise in the irrigation scheduling are as \nfollows:\
    \ (i) How to apply irrigation water?, (ii) How much \nto irrigate?, (iii) When\
    \ to irrigate. Currently, irrigation deci-\nsion-making systems are enforced to\
    \ the agricultural field \naiming for specific crop at a given area [7]. It is\
    \ difficult to \nbe practiced to different crops and areas. Under the grow-\n\
    ing environment, the amount of irrigation is defined as the \ndepth of water required\
    \ to meet the crop water loss through \nevapotranspiration. It can be obtained\
    \ via prediction using \nindirect channels or field measurement techniques. However,\
    \ \nthe amount and timing of water have major impact on qual-\nity of crop and\
    \ its yield. Several methods are applied for the \nirrigation scheduling such\
    \ as pan evaporation, soil moisture \nbasis, leaf water potential, and based on\
    \ growth-stages. The \ndemand of water can be fulfill by full or partial irrigation\
    \ in \nall methods.\n1.1  Motivation\nAs technology rapidly spread in a few decades,\
    \ precision \nagriculture is the key to fostering a new revolution in Irriga-\n\
    tion scheduling. The United Nations statistical data indicate \nthat agriculture\
    \ consumes 70% of the overall use of water \nworldwide, compared with 20% for\
    \ industry and 10% for \ndomestic use [8]. To ensure the proper use of water sup-\n\
    plies in irrigation we need more effective technologies. \nAutomatic irrigation\
    \ scheduling techniques replaced man-\nual irrigation which was based upon crop\
    \ water estimation. \nThe crop evapotranspiration can be determined by weather\
    \ \nparameters such as max–min temperature, humidity, wind \nspeed, solar radiations,\
    \ and even the crop factors such as the \nstage of growth, crop height, and the\
    \ soil properties for the \ndevelopment of irrigation scheduling. The machine\
    \ learning \nand deep learning advanced technologies provide direction \nand motivation\
    \ to propose a novel application on crop water \nmodeling. The influence of several\
    \ factors on crop yields and \ntemperature, precipitation have been found to have\
    \ maxi-\nmum influence on the yields of different crops [9].\n2  Reference Evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo\n“Evapotranspiration contains two processes, evapo-\nration in which water\
    \ is lost from the soil and plant \nsurface, and transpiration from plant surfaces\
    \ to the \natmosphere” [10].\nFig. 1  Smart water management in smart agriculture\n\
    4457\nA Survey Towards Decision Support System on Smart Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ Using Machine Learning…\n1 3\nThe water irrigation is enforced to match the\
    \ needs of evapo-\ntranspiration of crop. Therefore, the irrigation scheduling\
    \ \nneeds to estimate the daily crop evapotranspiration accu-\nrately. Evapotranspiration\
    \ of crops differs significantly over \nthe growing season mainly due to alterations\
    \ in climatic \nconditions and crop cover. It also varies among the crops. \n\
    The information about crop water demand (i.e., ET) is a \ncrucial practical consideration\
    \ in the planning, developing, \nand working of water and irrigation management\
    \ systems. \nFigure 2 presented the concept of ETo.\nTable 1 presented the ET\
    \ that affecting by weather ele-\nment. The reference evapotranspiration is approximated\
    \ \nfrom meteorological data (humidity, temperature, wind \nrun/wind speed, sunshine\
    \ hours/solar radiation) by using \nthe Penman-Monteith equation. However, the\
    \ adjusted pan \nevaporation measurements are also used.\n2.1  Factors Affecting\
    \ ETo\nClimate and weather play crucial role in determining \nlong-term and day-to-day\
    \ activities in the agriculture. The \ndemand of crop water is determined largely\
    \ by weather vari-\nables. Rainfall is the foremost weather variable that affects\
    \ \nthe water resources development planning, irrigation plan-\nning and agricultural\
    \ cropping. The main climatic/weather \ncomponents crucial for agriculture are\
    \ rainfall, maximum/\nminimum temperature, solar radiation, sunshine duration,\
    \ \nhumidity, photo-period or sunshine hour, wind speed, and \nnight temperature\
    \ [11] as depicted in Fig. 3. Table 2 shows \nthe different empirical methods\
    \ with weather parameters for \nestimation of ETo.\nWeather elements controls\
    \ the crop water demand and \ncrop ET. The ET depends upon the different weather\

    There are various mathematical models used to calculate \nthe reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo ). The updated proce-\ndures for calculating the ETo were introduced by\
    \ FAO. The \nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends the \nmethod for\
    \ calculating the ETo are as follows:\nAlthough, the method FAO-56 Penman–Monteith\
    \ \n(Allen et al. 1998) [10] is the most dominant as compared \nto others empirical\
    \ methods  [20, 21]. But, it requires sev-\neral climatic data factors [22].\n\
    The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM56) [10] has \nbeen broadly used to analyze\
    \ ETo from meteorological fac-\ntors and it is suggested as the standard technique\
    \ by the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(FAO)  [23]\
    \ and calculated by Eq. (1).\nFig. 3  Factors affecting evapo-\ntranspiration\n\

    \ temperature (°C); e a = actual vapour pressure(kPa); e s \n= saturation vapour\
    \ pressure(kPa); and (es − ea ) = vapour \npressure deficit (kPa).\nHowever, ETo\
    \ can be determined accurately by this \nmethod, large scale meteorological data\
    \ requirement at spe-\ncific spatio-temporal scales (vapor pressure deficit, wind\
    \ \nspeed, minimum and maximum air temperatures, and solar \nradiation) are quite\
    \ often not available in many develop-\ning countries [24]. Thus, the alternate\
    \ models are needed to \nestimate ETo when the available data are either insufficient\
    \ \nor limited. So, it is important to explore a simpler model to \ncalculate\
    \ ETo using fewer weather properties and a reason-\nable precision.\nThe need\
    \ of crop water depends on some factors: crop \ngrowth/stages, crop type and the\
    \ climate are given in detail \n[25]:\n3  Crop Evapotranspiration ETc\n“The crop\
    \ evapotranspiration denoted as ETc,is the \ncrop water requirements or crop water\
    \ need.”\nThe need for crop water is the depth (or quantify of water \nrequired\
    \ to cope with the loss of water through evapotranspi-\nration. In other words,\
    \ water needs to be cultivated optimally \nby different crops. Crop-growth models\
    \ were developed to \nimprove the understanding of crop dynamics and to pre-\n\
    dict crop growth and production under various agronomic \nconditions [35]. The\
    \ continuous monitoring of the soil sta-\ntus water, the conditions of crop growth,\
    \ and its spatial and \ntemporal patterns will help in irrigation and precision\
    \ water \nplanning. Evaporation and transpiration variations in the \nfield and\
    \ grass crops can be integrated into dual crop coeffi-\ncient or single crop coefficient\
    \ (Kc ): a soil evaporation coef-\nficient (Ke ) and a basal crop (Kcb ) and calculated\
    \ by Eq. (2).\n3.1  Climate Based ETc\nThe combination of two different processes\
    \ by which water \nevaporates from the soil surface and transpiration from the\
    \ \nplant is referred as evapotranspiration. It is determined \n(1)\nETo =\n0.408\

    (Kc) = (Kcb) + (Ke).\nby climatic factors including solar radiation, temperature,\
    \ \nwind, and humidity as well as environmental factors. The \nevaporation account\
    \ for approximately 10% of the overall \nevapotranspiration and the transpiration\
    \ of crops constitutes \nthe remaining 90%. Hence, there is a need for crop water\
    \ \nin hot, dry, windy, and sunny areas. For the lowest values \nwhen the wind\
    \ is cold, humid, and cloudy, with little to no \nwind. Climate impact on crop\
    \ water requirements is deter-\nmined by reference crop evapotranspiration ETo\
    \ and gener-\nally expressed per unit of time in millimeters., e.g. mm/day, \n\
    mm/month, or mm/season.\n3.1.1  Crop Type\nThe effect of the crop type in daily\
    \ crop water requirements \nis often referred to as a fully grown crop; Plant\
    \ height has \nreached maximum; Plants cover the ground optimally; prob-\nably\
    \ they began to flowering or developing to set grain; The \nwater demand is greatest\
    \ when the crop is fully cultivated. \nTheir water needs are called the “peak\
    \ period”.\nThe type of crop that has also affected the total growing \nduration\
    \ of crop development is known by seasonal crop \nwater need and can be obtained.\
    \ The best possible local \ndata can be obtained on the duration of the total\
    \ seasons of \nthe various plants cultivated in a region. Such data can be \n\
    collected from, for example, the seed supplier, the Exten-\nsion Service, the\
    \ Irrigation Department, or the Ministry of \nAgriculture.\n3.1.2  Growth Stages\
    \ of the Crop\nWhile planting and in the initial stage, evaporation is more \n\
    essential than transpiration. When the crop is fully devel-\noped, the need for\
    \ crop water is estimated to be 50% during \nthe mid-season phase. At the stage\
    \ of development, the crop \ndemand moderately increases from 50% of the maximum\
    \ \ncrop water requirement to the maximum crop water. Thus, \nthe maximum amount\
    \ of crop water is extended to the end \nof crop development stage, which is the\
    \ starting of mid-\nseason stage.\nThe value of K c depends on different factors\
    \ such as can-\nopy cover density, agriculture operations, weather variable, \n\
    type of crop, soil moisture, and growth stage [10]. The idea \nof crop coefficient\
    \ K c is proposed by Jensen [36] and has \nbeen improved by many researchers [37,\
    \ 38].\nHowever, K c method has the capability to determine the \nactual crop\
    \ evapotranspiration ETc precisely. According to \nthe FAO methodology, the four\
    \ growing stages of a crop are \nthe initial stage, crop development stage, mid-season\
    \ stage, \nand end-season stage (Allen et al. 1998) [10]. The crop coef-\nficient\
    \ method can be expressed as follows:\n4460\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\nThe\
    \ two-step crop coefficient K c reference evapotranspi-\nration has been a successful\
    \ method to predict the evapo-\ntranspiration (ET) and crop water requirements.\
    \ The total \ngrowing period is divided into 4 growth stages shown in \nFig. 4\
    \ [39]:\n• The initial stage the period ranges from transplanting or \nsowing\
    \ till crop covers the 10% of ground.\n• The crop development stage the period\
    \ begins at the com-\npletion of the initial stage and remains until the full\
    \ ground \nhas been covered (ground cover 70–80%). It does not cer-\ntainly mean\
    \ that the crop is at its maximum height.\n• The mid-season stage the period begins\
    \ at the completion \nof the crop development stage and remains till maturity;\
    \ it \nconsists grain-setting and flowering.\n• The late-season stage the period\
    \ starts at the completion \nof mid-season stage and remains until the last day\
    \ of the \nharvest; it consists ripening.\nwhere ETc represents the requirement\
    \ of crop water (mm \nd −1 ), ETo the reference crop water requirement (mm d −1\
    \ ), \nand K c the crop coefficient and calculated by Eq. (3). \nBesides, Kingra\
    \ et al. (2004) computed crop water require-\nment for Wheat and transplanted\
    \ Rice at Ludhiana, reported \nthat the Wheat crop used about 315 mm water whereas\
    \ the \nrice crop used about 780 mm water during its growing sea-\nson [40]. Saggi\
    \ et al. [41] collected the K c values as case \nstudy from Punjab agricultural\
    \ University (PAU), Ludhi-\nana and estimated the ETc for two crops. The K c values\
    \ of \nWheat1 crop were 0.4, 1.15 & 0.4 while for Wheat2 were \n0.5, 1.36, 1.42,\
    \ and 0.42 for the initial, mid and last stage of \ngrowth respectively. The length\
    \ of time (days) for four sea-\nsons of Wheat1 were 29, 55, 14 32 days while for\
    \ Wheat2 24, \n46, 35, 42 days. The K c values of Maize crop were 0.7, 0.85, \n\
    1.15 & 1.05 for the initial, mid, and end-stage of growth \n(3)\nETc = Kc × ETo\n\
    respectively. The length of time (days) for four seasons of \nMaize were 35, 18,\
    \ 17, and 15 days used in different stages. \nDetail of selected crops and period\
    \ of data for the study.\n4  Irrigation Scheduling\nIn 1996, Howell explored the\
    \ effects on water use and irri-\ngation scheduling [42]. It is an application\
    \ mechanism that \ncan lead to the effective and efficient use of water. This\
    \ \nefficiency can be enhanced by using advanced methods \nof irrigation. However,\
    \ even in advanced irrigation meth-\nods, irrigation scheduling at the farm level\
    \ is required. It \nis necessary when rainfall is deficient to remunerate for\
    \ \nthe water lost by evapotranspiration. The irrigation water \nneed is described\
    \ as the crop water requirement minus the \nfruitful rainfall. It is defined in\
    \ mm/month or mm/day. The \nmain goal of good irrigation scheduling is to apply\
    \ the cor-\nrect amount of water at the right time, and make sure that \nwater\
    \ is accessible when the crop requires it.\nAccording to predetermined schedules,\
    \ the irrigation \nwater is supplied to the cultivation by keep track of the \n\
    following [43]:\n• The status of soil water;\n• The need of crop water.\nThe purpose\
    \ of our research work is to present, analyze, \nand optimize some measure of\
    \ performance of the crop \nproduction under a set of specified conditions, such\
    \ as the \nlimited or unlimited total volume of water for the growing \nseason.\
    \ The main factors that influence the solution and \nimplementation of the irrigation\
    \ scheduling problem are \nthe characteristics of climate soil, crop, irrigation\
    \ water, \nand irrigation technology.\nJudicious usage of water for crop production\
    \ needs \nknowledge of water quality, soil, weather, crop, and drain-\nage situation.\
    \ The increase in efficiency of pumping sys-\ntems and conveyance need to review.\n\
    The soil types and climatic conditions have a consid-\nerable effect on the major\
    \ practical aspects of irrigation \nsuch as how much amount of water should be\
    \ supplied and \nwhen to a selected crop.\nA time-consuming and complex process\
    \ is a precise \nestimation of the irrigation schedule [25]. However, the \nadvent\
    \ of advanced technology has made it simpler and \nthe water supply can be scheduled\
    \ precisely to meet the \nwater requirements of cultivation. The timing for irriga-\n\
    tion applications can be fixed dates or on flexible dates. \nThe quantity should\
    \ not exceed the crop requirements per \napplication, including the leaching of\
    \ salts; otherwise, \nany excess water would not only reduce the efficiency of\
    \ \nits usage but can hinder the crop development. Standard \nFig. 4  Various\

    \ performance metrics are crop yields \nand net benefits per unit area.\nThe optimal\
    \ irrigation schedule is any schedule that \noptimizes the adopted output measurement\
    \ while meeting \nseveral defined constraints. Any schedule that optimizes \n\
    the adopted measure of performance while satisfying some \nspecified constraints\
    \ is the optimal irrigation schedule.\n4.1  Methods of Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    Different techniques can be apply to the plants with irriga-\ntion water and each\
    \ approach has its benefits and limita-\ntions. In this context, the best approach\
    \ to accommodate \nlocal conditions should be taken into account. Earlier, the\
    \ \nprimary irrigation method is applied via the source of supply \nsuch as a\
    \ bucket watering or a well. Although, it is a time-\nconsuming method.\nMore\
    \ advanced water application methods are used in \nlarger areas where irrigation\
    \ is needed. The suitability of \nseveral irrigation methods, i.e. sprinkler,\
    \ surface, or drip \nirrigation, depends on the following aspects: Natural condi-\n\
    tions, type of crop, type of technology, previous experience \nwith irrigation,\
    \ required labor inputs and costs and benefits.\nSurface irrigation may be categorized\
    \ based on mode of \nwater application as depicted in Fig. 5. [44] and Fig. 6\
    \ shown \nthe different types of irrigation methods. Table 3 presented \nthe different\
    \ types of irrigation methods, advantages and \ntheir applications.\nFig. 5  Irrigation\
    \ methods\nFig. 6  Types of irrigation \nscheduling\n4462\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain\
    \ \n1 3\n4.1.1  Border Irrigation\nSurface irrigation is where the water is applied\
    \ to the sur-\nface of field by gravity flow. The water is applied into small\
    \ \nchannels (furrows) or complete surface is flooded with water \n(basin irrigation)\
    \ or strips of land (borders). Border irriga-\ntion is a modern method of surface\
    \ irrigation. Borders are \nuniformly graded strips of land and long, set apart\
    \ by earth \nbunds. They are also known as border strips. There are sev-\neral\
    \ ways to fed the irrigation water to the border such as by \nusing small gates,\
    \ launching the channel bank, using spiles \nor siphons. A sheet of water is guided\
    \ by the earth bunds and \nflows down the slope of the border. It is mostly suited\
    \ to gen-\nerate long uninterrupted field lengths for facility of machine \noperations\
    \ in the huge mechanized farms. Borders can be up \nto 3-30m wide and at least\
    \ 800m in length depend on several \nfactors. It is less applicable to farms on\
    \ small-scale consist-\ning animal-powered cultivation techniques or hand labor.\n\
    4.1.2  Sprinkler Irrigation\nIt is equivalent to natural rainfall, where water\
    \ is pumped \nusing a pipe system and then rotating sprinkler heads used \nto\
    \ spray onto the crops. Further, the spray is applied into the \nair via sprinklers\
    \ to breaks it into small drops of water that \nfall on the ground. The sprinklers,\
    \ pump supply system, and \noperating conditions must be developed to apply the\
    \ water \nuniformly. It is well suited for the most field, row, and tree \ncrops.\
    \ Water can be sprayed under or over the crop canopy. \nAlthough, large sprinklers\
    \ are not suggested for delicate \ncrops such as lettuce due to the large size\
    \ water drops gen-\nerated by the sprinklers can harm the crops.\n4.1.3  Drip\
    \ Irrigation\nIt involves application of dripping water to the soil from a \n\
    small diameter plastic pipe systems attached with outlets \ncalled emitters or\
    \ drippers at very low rates (2–20 l/h). It is \nalso called as trickle irrigation.\
    \ Water is applied very close \nto plants so that only part of the soil in which\
    \ the roots grow \nis wetted, instead of sprinkler and surface irrigation, which\
    \ \nconsists wetting the complete soil profile [25]. It is well suited \nfor trees,\
    \ vine crops and row crops (vegetables, soft fruit), \nwhere one or more emitters\
    \ can be given for each plant. It is \nconsidered for high-value crops only due\
    \ to high capital costs \nrequired for installation of a drip system.\n4.1.4 \
    \ Need of Irrigation Scheduling\nHydrological, climatologist, and agronomical\
    \ processes play \nan significant part in the development of irrigation agriculture\
    \ \nproduction. These studies were mainly developed to estimate \ndaily, weekly,\
    \ or monthly evapotranspiration. The precise \napproximation of evapotranspiration\
    \ is an important process \nthat plays a key role in crop planning, deployment\
    \ and produc-\ntion of irrigation systems.\nIn recent years, several approaches\
    \ have been developed to \novercome the problems and obstacles that occur with\
    \ smart \nfarming, such as species recognition, yield prediction, disease \ndetection,\
    \ drought, crop productivity problems and irrigation \nmanagement.\nSo, there\
    \ is a great need to explore more research studies \nto enhance the scalability\
    \ of irrigation scheduling based on \nadvanced data analytic and machine learning.\
    \ Some research \nhas been done in the decision support system to improve the\

    \ Irrigation Scheduling Using Machine Learning…\n1 3\n5  Decision Support System\n\
    The idea of a decision support system (DSS) for irrigation \nwater management\
    \ is introduced in the 1970’s to assist \nusers in complex decision- making processes\
    \ and efficient \nuse of irrigation water at the farm level [53].\nDecision support\
    \ system (DSS) has great potential \nin agriculture era, if the water irrigation\
    \ management \nresearch is combined with the modeling approach using \nmachine\
    \ learning analytics and agriculture statistical, \nthe research level will be\
    \ achieved in different levels of \nthe agricultural development sector. The decision\
    \ sup-\nport system for crop water irrigation scheduling based on \ncrop water\
    \ model by estimation of evapotranspiration as \nweather parameter, historical\
    \ dataset, and using of differ-\nent Irrigation water management methods.\nThe\
    \ decision support system is an integrated approach \nto solve complex problems,\
    \ combining the computer cal-\nculation and data storage capacities with human\
    \ language \nand perception, support of mathematical model statistics, \nproviding\
    \ decision-maker. It is known as a primary tool \nin management for better decision\
    \ making and environ-\nmental resources. In 1985, Guariso et al. firstly intro-\n\
    duced the concept of DSS. Various researchers surveyed \nthe advanced use of the\
    \ management of DSS for water \nresources [54]. Today, it is required for the\
    \ on-farm irri-\ngation water management due to its use of the computer \nto relate\
    \ soil, crop, and water quality conditions. It can be \nused for analyzing and\
    \ determining how much water is \nneeded and when it should give next time.\n\
    5.1  Statistics\nThe statistical approach leads to the process of collection,\
    \ \npresentation, analyze, and apply the data to make deci-\nsions, problems solving,\
    \ design products, and processes. It \nis very useful for us to explore the description\
    \ and under-\nstand the variability. Statistical methods contributed for \nmaking\
    \ scientific judgments in the face of variation uncer-\ntainty. Russo et al. (2015)\
    \ Bayesian method is used to esti-\nmate the hydrological properties and irrigation\
    \ needs for \nan under-constrained mass balance model. They presented \nan approach\
    \ Markov chain Montecarlo algorithm to solve \nfor spreading of values for each\
    \ unknown parameter in a \nconceptual mass balance model [55].\n5.2  Machine Learning\n\
    From the last decade, machine learning and data analytics is \na hot-spot research\
    \ area in the domain of agriculture. Among \nthe other definitions, machine learning\
    \ is described as the \nscientific are that allows the machines to learn without\
    \ being \nstrictly programmed [56].\nMachine learning models have demonstrated\
    \ excellent \nresults for crop-based modeling in recent days. There is a \nvariety\
    \ of machine learning models based on prediction \nfor reference crop evapotranspiration.\
    \ The main contri-\nbution of our research prediction, by applying machine-\n\
    learning and data analytics based modeling to predict crop \nevapotranspiration.\n\
    Yamaç and Todorovic [57], revealed the satisfactory out-\nputs of ML with R2 ranged\
    \ from 0.81 to 0.97 [58] by apply-\ning several ML models on the climatic data.\
    \ A comparative \nanalysis was performed by Shiri et al. [59] to estimate the\
    \ \nETo using various intelligent models, namely ANN, ANFIS, \nsupport vector\
    \ machine (SVM), and GEP. In the domain \nof agriculture, big data analytic technologies\
    \ have offered \nnewly predictive models for ETo estimation, e.g. generalized\
    \ \nneuro-fuzzy models [60], artificial neural network (ANN), \n[61], adaptive\
    \ neuro-fuzzy inference system [62], multi-layer \nPerceptrons neural network\
    \ (MLPNN), Zaji and Bonakdari \n[63], extreme learning machine (ELM) Abdullah\
    \ et al. [64], \nmultivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and least \n\
    square support vector regression (LSSVM) [65], GRNN \n(2016), ELM, WNN and GANN\
    \ [66]. Moreover, the Auto-\nML technique is found to show excellence in application\
    \ of \nirrigation scheduling where border irrigation and sprinkler \nirrigation\
    \ methods are deployed.\n5.3  Deep Learning\nThe deep learning technique is now\
    \ practical to address mil-\nlions or even billions of weights among neurons for\
    \ better \nunderstanding of behaviors due to current advances in com-\nputational\
    \ power, in terms of software, hardware and parallel \nprocessing. It is accepted\
    \ to have established a revolutionary \nera since it can address the issues that\
    \ have countered AI for \na long time.\nDeep feed-forward neural networks are\
    \ based on multi-\nlayer Perceptrons (MLPs) published by Alexey Ivakhnenko \n\
    and Lapa in 1965 [67]. It can be used to model the com-\nplicated relationship\
    \ between input and output due of its \nhigh hierarchical structure model training,\
    \ construction and \nfeature learning [68]. It has been used in the hydrological\
    \ \nand agricultural fields because of the difficulty of software \ndata availability,\
    \ costs, and complexity, e.g., approximation \nand modeling of crop evapotranspiration\
    \ [42], Wang et al. \n(2018) determined that traditional ML and DL models are\
    \ \nequivalent as a data-driven artificial intelligence method that \ncan be used\
    \ to model the complicated relationship between \ninput and output [68]. However,\
    \ DL has a benefit over tra-\nditional ML, due to wits high hierarchical structure\
    \ model.\n4464\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\n5.4  Big Data Analytics\nBig Data\

    \ benefits \nin the agriculture economy. Advanced big data analytics \nhave improved\
    \ the tools and technologies that changed the \nway of real-time applications\
    \ to make better decision pro-\ncessing, high-performance platform to efficiently\

    \ 2nd worldwide in farm \nproduction and 1st largest country in irrigated land\

    \ in the tropical climate areas. Central Indian Pun-\njab is a well-known for\

    \ over India.\n6.1  A Bibliometric Perspective of Irrigation \nScheduling\nIn\
    \ this section, the articles from Science direct digital data-\nbase is considered.\
    \ Figure 8 shows the number of papers \npublished from 1995 to 2021 in field of\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning, reference evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspira-\n\
    tion. We have selected only elsevier science direct library \nto find out research\
    \ articles, where we found 34,083 results \nin area of irrigation scheduling,\
    \ 32,775 papers in reference \nevapotranspiration and 14,261 results articles\
    \ in crop evapo-\ntranspiration (crop water need).\nIrrigation scheduling, ETo\
    \ and ETc trends are represented \nby Green, Blue, and Yellow colored lines respectively.\
    \ Fig-\nure 8 shows the article type in which review reports, case \nreports,\
    \ data articles, mini review, and many more articles. \nFigure 8 shows the number\
    \ of top-journal publications. \nSeveral computer simulation techniques and decision\
    \ sup-\nport systems have been developed to estimate ETo , ETc and \nCrop Water\
    \ Requirement (CWR). It is important to identify \nchanges in the hydrological\
    \ cycle when we want to predict \nthe impacts of climate change. However, current\
    \ studies on \nclimate change must be expanded to cover the entire globe. \nThe\
    \ two main components of the global water cycle are \nevaporation and precipitation.\n\
    Methods for measuring evapotranspiration from meteoro-\nlogical data include a\
    \ number of climatology, and the physi-\ncal inputs which is directly estimated\
    \ in weather stations. \nOther parameters are associated with measured data and\
    \ can \nbe obtained by directly or empirical methods. Meteorologi-\ncal data can\
    \ be expressed in several units.\n6.2  Estimation and Forecasting \nof Evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo\nThe application of Evapotranspiration (ETo ) in irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ is divided into different categories for literature \nsection such as statistical,\
    \ machine learning, evolutionary \nmodels, and decision support system [42, 71,\
    \ 72]. We have \npresented a comprehensive review literature for reference \n\
    evapotranspiration as follows:\nFigure 9 presented the process of DSS for crop\
    \ water irri-\ngation scheduling. ETo is an imperative aspect of the hydro-\n\
    logical cycle that is stirring water availability on the earth \nsurface. It is\
    \ one of the significant criteria of accurate quan-\ntification of crop water\
    \ requirement that influence various \nhydrological processes, planing of water\
    \ management and \nresources [62], and requirement of irrigation [73]. Tradition-\n\
    ally, the ETo is estimated at the field scale, but it consumes \nlot of time and\
    \ is difficult to process by complex mathemati-\ncal calculations with various\
    \ climatic variables. Methods \nfor measuring evapotranspiration from meteorological\
    \ data \ninclude a number of climatology, and the field inputs which \nis directly\
    \ estimated in weather stations. Some parameters \nare associated with measured\
    \ data, where as others can be \nobtained directly or through empirical methods.\n\
    6.2.1  Existing Methods Based on Empirical\nSince many years, various researchers\
    \ have established \nreference evapotranspiration ETo estimation with empiri-\n\
    cal methods. There are few categories of ETo estimation \nmethods: Temperature-based,\
    \ Radiation-based, Empirical, \nPan, and many more. Commonly, FAO-56 Penman-Monteith\
    \ \nmethod is applied as the scientific, standard and temperature \nbased method\
    \ to estimate the ETo [10, 74]. FAO-PM has \nbeen extensively adopted because\
    \ to its positive outcomes \nin a variety of climates across the world. However,\
    \ it needs \na significant amount of meteorological data obtained from \nregular\
    \ meteorological observation stations [75].\nTo overcome the existing limitation\
    \ of the FAO-PM \nmodel, various attempts aiming to estimate ETo with limited\
    \ \nobserved data have been made. A large number of studies \nhave focused on\
    \ estimating ETo using empirical methods \nwith limited ground-level data such\
    \ as the Hargreaves and \nSamani equation, Priestley-Taylor equation, and Thorn-\n\
    thwaite equation have been used for estimating (ETo ) by \nTomas-Burguera et al.\
    \ [76].\nETo is estimated with simplified or empirical methods \n(e.g. Lysimetric\
    \ measurements) and it is highly difficult to \nachieve more precise and robust\
    \ approaches [77, 78]. HS \nequation is the most simple and accurate approach\
    \ based on \ntemperature [10, 31]. There are many empirical approaches \nto predict\
    \ the ETo using five mass transfer-based models \n(Ivanov, WMO, Penman, Trabert,\
    \ and Mahringer), five \nradiation-based approach (Tu, PT, Ab, JH, and Mk), and\
    \ \nfive temperature-based approach (HS, modified Hargreaves-\nSamani1 ) (Th,\
    \ BC, MHS1 , and MHS2 ) [79]. Table 4 shows \nthe literature of empirical methods\
    \ for estimation of ETo.\nMalamos et al. [80] investigated the monthly Geo-spa-\n\
    tial ETo with FAO Penman–Monteith using line, polygon, \nand point through a geometry\
    \ independent algorithm. They \n4466\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\nFig. 8  Number\

    \ for current and future \ndrought condition using PDSI tool, Spatial, and Temperature\
    \ \nbased models such as Penman–Monteith, Thornthwaite, and \nHamon methods. They\
    \ have selected T mean , u 2 , R H , I s input \nvariable, and analyzed on MATLAB\
    \ GUI [82].\nYang et al. [83] analyses the daily reference evapotranspi-\nration\
    \ (ETo ) using short-term forecasting with FAO-56 Pen-\nman–Monteith equation,\
    \ Hargreaves–Samani equation, and \nReduced-set Penman–Monteith (RPM). The R language\
    \ is \nused to simulate with various climate parameters including \nT mean , T\
    \ max , T min , u 2 , RHmean , I s , and Vapor pressure (ea).\n6.2.2  Existing\
    \ Methods Based on Machine Learning\nThere have been many studies on hybrid models\
    \ with \nmachine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to estima-\ntion of ETo\
    \ with few climate parameters around the world.\nPatil and Deka [85] investigated\
    \ the performance of \nextreme machine learning (ELM) to quantify the weekly \n\
    ETo in the Thar Desert of India. Also, they have showed \nthe comparison of Artificial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN) with \nthree input variable. The ELM model gives slightly\
    \ higher \naccuracy than empirical, and ANN models.\nWu et al. [86] proposed hybrid\
    \ model using machine \nlearning and soft-computing to estimate the monthly ETo\
    \ in \nsouth China with 26 data stations. The proposed (Kmeans-\nFFA-KELM) approach\
    \ developed with the three approaches \n(K-means clustering, Firefly Algorithms,\
    \ and Kernel \nExtreme Learning Machine model) found higher accuracy \nusing three\
    \ input variables (Temperaturemax , Temperaturemin , \nand R a ). Another study\
    \ showed performance of six remote-\nsensing based ML models to predict the daily\
    \ ETo in the \nAndalusian. The two ELM and MLP models found higher \naccuracy\
    \ than RF, SVM, GRNN, and XGBoost models [87].\nStacking and blending ensemble\
    \ based ML models are \nused to calculate the daily ETo with limited input variables.\
    \ \nTwo-layer ensemble model is build with RF, SVR, MLP, \nLR and KNN models and\
    \ found higher accuracy in terms \nof R 2 ranged from (0.66 to 0.99) as compared\
    \ to empirical \nmodels [88]. Another, ensemble based model is build with \nANN,\
    \ SVM and RF to estimate the ETo with geno-types \nand optimize the ETo with time\
    \ series data, and found the \ncorrect results [89].\nBai et al. [90] proposed\
    \ ensemble-based four ML mod-\nels with RF, BMA, KNN, SVM and MLP to calculate\
    \ the \nETo . The MLP-based ensemble model provides the efficient \nresults. However,\
    \ the ML and DL based models are proposed \nto estimate a urban ETo with Flux\
    \ Footprint, Remote Sens-\ning and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. The\
    \ \nRF model provides slightly better result in terms of R 2 of \n(0.840) and\
    \ RMSE of (0.0239 mm) than CNN model [91].\nAdnan et al. [92] demonstrated the\
    \ capability of dif-\nferent Neuro-Fuzzy methods to estimate the pan evapora-\n\
    tion monthly using climatic inputs of different parameters \nobtained from Uttarakhand,\
    \ (India). Recently, Adnan et al. \n[93] demonstrated the capability of dynamic\
    \ evolving Neu-\nral-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS) and Least-Square \nSupport\
    \ Vector Regression with a Gravitational Search \nAlgorithm (LSSVR-GSA) for estimating\
    \ ETo.\nIt has been shown that the extraterrestrial radiation or \ntemperature-based\
    \ LSSVR-GSA models are superior to \nFig. 9  Process of DSS for crop water irrigation\

    \ \nPruned Extreme Learning Machine (OPELM) in the Medi-\nterranean region of\
    \ Algeria. The OPELM models showed \ngood performances as compared to OSELM models.\n\
    Recently, Tikhamarine et al. [96] combined the Support \nVector Regression and\
    \ Grey Wolf Optimizer (SVR-GWO) \nto predict the monthly ETo at Annaba, Algiers,\
    \ and Tlem-\ncen stations in North Algeria. Moreover, the proposed \nmodel is\
    \ compared with the existing variants of SVR and \nshowed that the performance\
    \ of the SVR-GWO gives occa-\nsionally competitive and very promising results.\
    \ Marouf-\npoorb et al. [34] proposed the concept of hybrid Artificial \nNeural\
    \ Network-Gray Wolf Optimization (ANN-GWO) \nmodel and predicted the ETo for Iran.\n\
    Further, the proposed model showed more efficient \nand accurate results as compared\
    \ to ANN and LS-SVR. \nMohammadi and Mehdizadeh [97] proposed a hybrid of \ntwo\
    \ models Support Vector Regression and Whale Optimi-\nzation Algorithm to predict\
    \ the daily reference evapotran-\nspiration at three stations in Iran. It has\
    \ been shown that \nhybrid models outperformed the support vector regres-\nsions\
    \ models. Kisi [65] obtained weather dataset from \nTurkish Meteorological Organization\
    \ (TMO) for 2 sta-\ntions from 1982 to 2006 and applied MARS, LSSVR, and \nM5-Tree\
    \ to estimate ETo.\nValipour et al. [79] collected data for the period of \n(1961–2010)\
    \ with 50 climate parameters from 18 regions \nof Iran to estimate monthly ETo\
    \ using five models namely \n(mass transfer, radiation and temperature based).\n\

    \ presented gene \nexpression programming (GEP) and empirical models to \nestimate\
    \ ETo.\nTao [99] presented the hybrid intelligent ETo model using \ndata of three\
    \ meteorological stations during 1998 to 2012. \nThey used the Adaptive Neuron\
    \ Fuzzy Inference System \n(ANFIS), Firefly Optimization Algorithm with ANFIS\
    \ \n(ANFIS-FA) and Penman–Monteith models.\nCo-active Neuro Fuzzy Inference System\
    \ (CANFIS) \nmodel is proposed for modeling the monthly evaporation of \nLake\
    \ Nasser, Egypt [110]. The Gene Expression Program-\nming (GEP), Support Vector\
    \ Machine (SVM), Classifica-\ntion and Regression Tree (CART), the Cascade Correlation\
    \ \nNeural Network (CCNNs), and are proposed for estimating \nevaporation by Yaseen\
    \ et al. [100].\nFalamarzi et al. [101] estimated the daily ETo for water \nresources\
    \ with ANN and WNN models from the period of \n2009 to 2012. They have applied\
    \ RMSE, APE, N.S., R 2 met-\nrics to check the model accuracy with three input\
    \ parameters \nsuch as T min , T max , and u 2 . Models LS-SVM, MARS, and \nM5\
    \ models have been applied to estimate the Pan evapora-\ntion for Reservoir and\
    \ water resources management. They \nhave applied four input variable, T mean\
    \ , R s , u 2 , and R h with \ndataset of period 1986 to 2006 [102]. Another,\
    \ ANN model \nis applied to forecast the ETo for application of real-time \nirrigation\
    \ scheduling with T mean , R s , u 2 , and R h input param-\neters using dataset\
    \ of (2011 to 2012) [103].\nYassin et al. [73] analyzed the performance of ANN,\
    \ \nand GEP models to quantify the ETo with various climate \nparameters using\
    \ dataset from 1980 to 2010. The GeneX-\npro Tools 5.0, and Propagation version\
    \ 2.2.4 were used to \ndeveloped the model and also provide the accuracy on the\
    \ \nbasis of these metrics MAE, RMSE, R 2 , and OI. Gocic et al. \n[71] forecasted\
    \ the ETo using SVM, FFA, DWT, ANN, and \nGEP models with climate parameters for\
    \ the period of 1980 \nto 2010. Goyal et al. [104] explored the four ML models\
    \ \nnamely ANN, LS-SVR, FL, ANFIS, and Gamma Test to \nestimate the pan evaporation\
    \ for the duration of 2000 to \n2010. They have found the efficient results with\
    \ the FG and \nLS-SVR models using various climate parameters on MAT-\nLAB platform.\n\
    However, Chen et al. [105] found the best performance \nof Bayesian Model Averaging\
    \ Model to estimate the terres-\ntrial ETo using KGE and Cubist software. Mehdizadeh\
    \ et al. \n[106] proposed the hybrid model to estimate the monthly \nETo with\
    \ GEP, SVM-Poly, SVM-RBF, and MARS models \nfor duration of 1951 to 2010. The\
    \ performance of the applied \nmodels is compared with the empirical methods,\

    \ ELM model revealed a superior perfor-\nmance to estimate the daily ETo at the\
    \ four major countries \nof (US, Germany, Belgium, and Sweden) using 9 years of\

    \ coef-\nficients for initial, middle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51, and \n1.43\
    \ [127]. The derivation and development of crop K c were \nidentified for Castor\

    \ \nsoftware introduced to solve above model [57].\n7.2  Machine Learning and Evolutionary\
    \ Models\nThe Back-propagation Neural Network (BP-NN) model is \nproposed to evaluate\
    \ the crop evapotranspiration ETc with \ncombination of various climate parameters\
    \ (Tmax , T min , \nRHmean , S h , RF and crop coefficient K c ). It is observed\
    \ that \nthe combination of Eddy Covariance method and BP model \nachieved the\
    \ best accuracy in terms of R 2 (0.87) and accu-\nracy (91.44%) than MLR model\
    \ [130]. Mehta et al. [131] \nestimated the ETo , ETc and K c of Wheat and Maize\
    \ crops \nof Gujarat using climate data. They applied the various tem-\nperature\
    \ and radiation based empirical methods to calculate \nand estimate the crop water\
    \ requirement.\nIt is observed that the accurate value of K c for Wheat crop \n\
    is more efficient as compared to FAO-56 Penman–Monteith \nmethod results. Whereas\
    \ in case of maize crop the outcomes \nwere found less accurate at Surat and higher\
    \ outcomes as \ncompared to FAO method at Bharuch station.\nSaggi et al. [41]\
    \ proposed a novel multi-layer ensemble \nmodel based on fuzzy-genetic and regularization\
    \ random \nforest (FG-RRF) for predicting the K c and ETc of Ludhiana \nstation.\
    \ They found that the models had high performance \nfor modeling K c and ETc.\n\
    Elbeltagi et al. [132] presented the deep learning model \nto estimate the Wheat\
    \ ETc from 1970-2017 and forecasting \nthe future changes from 2022-2035 of Nile\
    \ Delta in Egypt \nusing Visual Gene Developer technology. For calibration R 2\
    \ \nof 0.95, 0.96, 0.97 and for testing R 2 of 0.94, 0.95, 0.95 have \nbeen found\
    \ efficient result respectively. Russo et al. [55] pre-\nsented the MCMC and Bayesian\
    \ algorithms to analysis the \nirrigation requirements for ground water mass balance\
    \ with \nsoil tensiometer of Rice crop. They have optimized the man-\nagement\
    \ decisions on crop replacement and increased the \nirrigation efficiency. The\
    \ NN model and regression model \nare explored to estimate a greenhouse tomato\
    \ crop yield, its \ngrowth, and efficiency in use of water with CropAssist and\
    \ \nNeuralWare platforms [133]. Maurya et al. [134] developed \na novel fuzzy-based\
    \ energy-efficient routing protocol based \non automated irrigation system for\
    \ Maize crop on MAT-\nLAB platform. The FIS-DSS (Flexible Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ \nDecision Support System) is proposed to analyze the optimal \nallocation of\
    \ water resources of irrigation system. Fuzzy-\ninference and knowledge based\
    \ user-friendly optimization \ntool is developed for Wheat and corn crops [135].\

    4471\nA Survey Towards Decision Support System on Smart Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ Using Machine Learning…\n1 3\nGavilán et al. [137] measured the daily greenhouse\
    \ crop \nevapotranspiration for strawberry and found more accuracy \nusing empirical\
    \ methods and sensors based on soil mois-\nture. Tabari et al. [138] explored\
    \ a ANFIS and SVM model \nperformance for Potato crop evapotranspiration ETc using\
    \ \nmeteorological data.\nYamaç et al. [139] applied the four scenarios based\
    \ on \nfeatures subset to accurately estimate the ETc of Potato \ncrop using ANN,\
    \ ABM and KNN models. Further, ANN \nand SVM models are also applied to estimate\
    \ the garlic ETc \nby Abyaneh et al. [140] and the outcomes are found accurate\
    \ \nas compared to lysimeter performance.\nThe need of precise estimation of crop\
    \ water is an crucial \naspect of agricultural planning and there exists several\
    \ meth-\nods for determining ET in crop land [124]. The field based \nestimations\
    \ are required and appropriate for monitoring the \ncrop-water status at the land-scale\
    \ level [125] [126].\nThe FAO-Penman and Penman methods are applied \nto forecast\
    \ the ET for rice crop using meteorological data \n[127]. They have found the\
    \ crop coefficients for initial, mid-\ndle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51, and 1.43.\
    \ The derivation \nand development of crop K c are identified for Castor and \n\
    Maize crops of Rajendranganagar by Reddy et al. [128]. Ko \net al. [129] conducted\
    \ a analyses report to evaluate the crop \nwater requirement for Cotton, and Wheat\
    \ crops at Uvalde, \nTX, USA. Fang and Ping [57] presented an optimal solution\
    \ \nto estimate the ETo using interval regression analysis, crop \nwater production\
    \ function and Penman-Monteith method \nwith LINGO software.\nNumerous experiments\
    \ have been conducted in recent \ndecades to investigate the possible effect of\
    \ climate change \non evapotranspiration ETc . For efficient crop evapotranspi-\n\
    ration ETc modeling using VIP (Vegetation Interface Pro-\ncesses) for Wheat and\
    \ Maize [141], durum Wheat in Tuni-\nsia [142], APSIM-Maize model [143], SEBAL\
    \ model for \nyield, WUE, IWUE and HUE for Wheat crop [144], weigh-\ning lysimeter\
    \ for K c and ETc [145], farm-level operational \nservices in smart agriculture\
    \ [146], crop water model based \non Crop2ML framework [147] have been used.\n\
    The ETc estimation results proved that the ML and EA \napproaches performed better\
    \ than existing classical methods. \nHowever, several studies have investigated\
    \ the estimation \nof ETc with empirical methods. But limited studies have \n\
    reported the estimation of ETc using ML, and EA models \nas shown in Table 6.\n\
    8  Decision Support System for Irrigation \nScheduling\nThis section considers\
    \ the Decision support system (DSS) \nbased on research that have included ETo\
    \ , ETc , and irri-\ngation requirement. An irrigation management system can \n\
    offer farmers with appropriate decision-making tools in \norder to regulate the\
    \ amount of water supplied to crops.\nA decision support system PETP V2.0.0 is\
    \ developed to \nanalysis and estimate the potential evapotranspiration ETo \n\
    using various empirical approaches namely Hargreaves, \nJensen-Haise, Penman-Monteith,\
    \ Priestley-Taylor, etc. Vis-\nual Studio 2010 software is used to build the computational\
    \ \ntool to estimate the accurate results for water requirement \nof crop [148].\n\
    Navarro et al. [149] developed smart irrigation DSS for \nmanaging the irrigation\
    \ scheduling. They purposed 2 ML \ntechniques i.e. PLSR and ANFIS. Maximum and\
    \ mini-\nmum relative humidity, temperature, and direction of wind, \nglobal radiation,\
    \ vapour pressure deficit, rainfall, dew point \nare the variables used to predict\
    \ the daily ETo with FAO \nPenman–Monteith method. Zizhong and Zenghui [150] pre-\n\
    sented a single irrigation system that enhanced higher corn \nproduction and also\
    \ provided efficiency in use of water in \nNortheast China. They include climate\
    \ parameters namely \naverage, max and min of air temperatures, max and min of\
    \ \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours from 1980 \nto 2012. Penman–Monteith\
    \ approach is used to determine \nthe soil evaporation and ETc.\nThe knowledge\
    \ of the irrigation management has an \nimpact on crop water requirements, maintaining\
    \ water bal-\nance and is the practical considerations to enhance produc-\ntivity\
    \ of crop [157]. Various research work in Punjab have \ndemonstrated the requirements\
    \ of crop water irrigation, irri-\ngation water based on ET and pan evaporation,\
    \ [158], but \nfew studies have focused on Soil Water Deficit (SWD) [159].\nParaskevopoulos\
    \ and Singels [151] investigated the inte-\ngrated content of soil water recordings\
    \ of real-time field into \nthe MyCanesim system to estimate its use in 15 sugarcane\
    \ \nfields of South Africa for supporting irrigation system. It is \nused to determine\
    \ the decision making for irrigation sched-\nuling based on the status of forecasts\
    \ of crop, soil water, \nand the next irrigation date. Ying et al. [152] represented\
    \ \nthe evaluation for summer Wheat and winter Maize crop-\nping system for optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling. Further, they \ndescribed topical versions of the SWAP\
    \ and Wofost models \nfor crop growing simulation and obtaining efficiency in\
    \ use \nof water.\nAfzal et al. [160] improved water resources management \nusing\
    \ different irrigation strategies and water qualities by \nfield, and modeling\
    \ study. To deficit irrigation PRD and RDI \nmethods are used to estimate the\
    \ effects of waste and fresh \nwater on salinity distribution, soil moisture,\
    \ and crop yield \nof Potato, Maize in Italy, Bologna through field experiments.\n\
    The fuzzy, evolutionary, and machine learning models \nare used to develop a DSS\
    \ model for irrigation schedul-\ning. Gaiqiang et al. [135] developed a FIS-DSS\
    \ software \nbased on knowledge, interface for user, and an inference \nengine\
    \ for wheat, corn and cotton crops. It is a fuzzy interval \n4472\n \nM. K. Saggi,\
    \ S. Jain \n1 3\nprogramming model having multiple objectives and con-\nstraints,\
    \ flexibility of model, data processing, and an alterna-\ntive solving algorithm.\
    \ The main objective is to maximize \nthe economic-based benefits for crop-land\
    \ in China. The NN \nmodel is used to train the model with precipitation and his-\n\
    torical climate parameters.\nGiusti and Marsili-Libelli [153] developed a fuzzy-DSS\
    \ \nto schedule the daily irrigation need of crop based on soil \nmoisture as\
    \ a predictive model and an inference model \nas irrigation decision maker. This\
    \ model determines the \nactual need of water for kiwi, corn, and potato crops\
    \ with \npast irrigation soil moisture, climatic parameters, and ETc . \nThey\
    \ used meteorological data including temperature, solar \nradiation, wind, rain,\
    \ etc. The objective of FDSS model is \nto reduce the water usage and provide\
    \ the efficient result in \nterms of saving water up-to 13.55, 18.3, and 72.95\
    \ water \nunits for irrigating three crops respectively. Sahoo et al. \n[161]\
    \ proposed fuzzy multi objective linear programming \napproach for planing of\
    \ land-water-crop system. The mete-\norological data like daily rainfall, evaporation,\
    \ temperature, \nsolar radiation, daily sunshine hours, humidity, wind veloc-\n\
    ity, and albedo are collected from the Central Rice Research \nInstitute, Cuttack.\
    \ The objective function is to optimize, \nmaximized crop production, net return,\
    \ and to minimize the \nlabor requirement for various vegetables and pulses.\n\
    Reddy and Kumar [162] demonstrated a multi-objective \nmethod for the optimal\
    \ crop pattern and multi-crop irriga-\ntion reservoir scheme by several procedures.\
    \ Adeyemo and \nOtieno [163] explored a method to solve the multi objective \n\
    crop planning model by an evolutionary algorithm. They \nhave found excellent\
    \ results in minimizing total water irri-\ngation, maximizing the yield productivity,\
    \ and net income \nfrom farming.\nIrrigation water management is numerically intensive\
    \ \nfor computations and provides model interpretation and \ndiscretization. Neural\
    \ networks and evolutionary algo-\nrithms demonstrated to estimate the irrigation\
    \ volume and \nalso determined the effectiveness to diminish irrigation \napplication\
    \ and maximize production [164]. Ortega Álva-\nrez et al. [154] proposed a non-linear\
    \ model to recognize \nyield schemes and water irrigation management plannings\
    \ \nusing the genetic algorithms. Further, they estimated crop \nyield, gross\
    \ margin and production as a function of irrigation \ndepth. Schmitz et al. [165]\
    \ simulated 92 percent greater pro-\nduction for corn using evolutionary algorithm\
    \ as compared \nto dynamic programming.\nApplication and web based DSS models\
    \ are developed \nfor the irrigation water scheduling by various researchers.\
    \ \nRecently, a web-based DSS is proposed to estimate the soil-\nwater balance\
    \ for irrigation system with limited input param-\neters such as (dual crop-coefficient\
    \ and meteorological). The \nirrigation parameters are computed through soil moisture\
    \ \nand requirement of water. A web-based irrigation decision \nsupport system\
    \ is introduced with limited inputs (WIDSSLI) \nfor summer corn and winter Wheat\
    \ irrigation management \nin North China Plain (NCP) [155].\nTable 7 presents\
    \ the estimation of ETo , ETc , and irriga-\ntion with DSS systems. Antonopoulou\
    \ et al. [166] presented \nan appropriate decision support system for crops which\
    \ is \nimplemented on web-based software. They introduced this \napproach by using\
    \ the Java and PHP technologies for spe-\ncific irrigation technique and soil\
    \ improvement instructions. \nDutta et al. [167] developed a mobile application\
    \ based on \nsustainable irrigation DSS. They proposed cloud sensors \nbased approach\
    \ to evaluate the ground water usage and avail-\nability of water. This approach\
    \ includes the CSIRO sensor \nbased cloud computing organization and integrated\
    \ big data \nthat includes machine learning technologies. Bonfante et al. \n[168]\
    \ proposed an irrigation water supply management tool \nto obtain the maximum\
    \ yield of Maize with W-tens, IRRI-\nSAT, and W-Mod approaches. W-Mod and IRRISAT\
    \ models \nfound more accurate results as compared to W-Tens in terms \nof irrigation\
    \ water use efficiency.\nA Climate-Smart Decision-Support System (CSDSS) \ntool\
    \ is proposed to evaluate the requirement of rice crop in \nMalaysia. They determine\

    \ proposed a SALTMED model which \nincludes the to partial root drying or deficit\
    \ irrigation, sub-\nsurface irrigation, soil nitrogen fertilizer application,\
    \ ferti-\ngation, dry matter production, plant nitrogen uptake, and \nnitrate\
    \ leaching.\nFor the model calibration and endorsement the statistical \nmeasurements\
    \ are used such as R2 coefficient, RMSE, and \npercentage error. The DIDAS software\
    \ package for irrigation \nsystem decision-making strategies of drip irrigation\
    \ systems \nis developed [46].\nA DSS framework have been introduced which includes\
    \ \n22 ETo estimation approaches using user-friendly GUI \n(Microsoft Visual Basic\
    \ 6.0) of 133 selected stations of \nIndia [170]. Potential-ETo and FAO56-PM ETo\
    \ are used to \nestimate the ETo in the Geisenheim Irrigation Scheduling \n(GS)\
    \ for vegetable crops using sprinkler irrigation [171]. \nBallesteros et al. [103]\
    \ estimated the ETo using FORETO \nsoftware with Hargreaves Samani (HS) equation\
    \ or the Pen-\nman Monteith (PM) and Artificial neural networks (ANNs) \nmodels.\
    \ Modern platforms (.NET and Java) software applied \nto calculate the daily/monthly\
    \ ETo using meteorological \nparameters [172]. There are various crop simulation\
    \ based \nmodels exists such as CropSyst [173], STICS (Brisson et al. \n1998)\
    \ [174], EPIC [175], DSSAT [176], VegSyst simulation \nmodel [177], and CERES\
    \ [178].\nA single approach, that can address all operational cir-\ncumstances\
    \ (weather information, crop growth monitoring, \nfield data, agricultural expertise\
    \ and infrastructure etc.), \nas well as the associated expenses for farmers which\
    \ may \nlimit the usage of these systems. Therefore, DSS’s for irri-\ngation scheduling\
    \ have been developed to integrating vari-\nous approaches in terms of (data collection\
    \ from meteoro-\nlogical), pre-processing techniques and modeling based on \n\
    empirical or artificial intelligence.\n9  Conclusion\nOverall agricultural systems\
    \ modeling needs to rapidly adopt \nand absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies\
    \ with \na focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating \nthose who\
    \ develop applications of their models. In spite of \nthe vast literature available,\
    \ the subject of irrigation water \nmanagement and crop water modeling for machine\
    \ learning \ntechniques are yet in its emerging phase. Although there \nis wide\
    \ literature available on statistics, machine learning, \ndecision support system\
    \ for general manifolds. To estimate \ncrop water modeling on general manifolds,\
    \ we have different \napproaches available in literature.\nMoreover, the water\
    \ balance is well-entrenched \napproach for estimating irrigation amount and time\
    \ \n(i.e. irrigation frequency) in irrigation scheduling. This \napproach is simple\
    \ to use, typically inexpensive and \nvery effective approach to estimates the\
    \ ETo , and ETc . \nThe major objective is to adopt the several approaches to\
    \ \ndevelop a flexible system that supports irrigation water \nrequirement system,\
    \ which may fit into diverse fields of \noperational activities (weather information,\
    \ field data \ncollection, crop coefficients etc.). This study provides \nan overview\
    \ of the irrigation water scheduling. It also \npresented the concept of reference\
    \ evapotranspiration \nand crop evapotranspiration for crop water modeling. It\
    \ \nalso presents the various methods of irrigation schedul-\ning. It also address\
    \ the need of decision support system \nand its various approaches that lead to\
    \ irrigation water \nmanagement.\nAcknowledgements Mandeep Kaur Saggi was supported\

    Article history Views PDF Share Tools Abstract Listen Reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) is used to determine crop water requirements under different climatic conditions.
    In this study, soft computing tools viz. artificial neural network (ANN) and k-nearest
    neighbors (KNN) models were evaluated for forecasting daily ET0 by comparing their
    performance with the Penman-Monteith model (PM) using climatic data from 1990
    to 2020 of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) farm observatory,
    New Delhi, India. The performance of these models was assessed using statistical
    performance indices viz., mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE),
    correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and index
    of agreement (d). Results revealed that the ANN model with sigmoid activation
    function and L-BFGS (Limited memory-Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) learning
    algorithm was selected as the best performing model amongst 36 ANN models. Amongst
    4 KNN models developed and tested, the K4 KNN model was observed to be the best
    in forecasting daily ET0. Overall, the best ANN model (M11) outperformed the K4
    KNN model with MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and d values of 0.075, 0.018, 0.997, 2.76 %,
    and 0.974, respectively and 0.091, 0.053, 0.984, 3.16 %, and 0.969, respectively
    during training and testing periods. Thus, we conclude that the ANN technique
    performed better than the KNN technique in forecasting daily ET0. Sensitivity
    analysis of the best ANN model revealed that wind speed was the most influential
    input variable compared to other weather parameters. Thus, the ANN model to forecast
    daily ET0 accurately for efficient irrigation scheduling of different crops in
    the study region may be recommended. HIGHLIGHTS Listen Regression analysis was
    performed for input variables selection. In this study, the performance of 36
    ANN models and 4 KNN models was evaluated. The ANN model with sigmoid activation
    function and L-BFGS algorithm was selected as the best-performing model. The best
    ANN model (M11) outperformed the K4 KNN model to forecast daily ET0. Sensitivity

    analysis INTRODUCTION Listen Water is the essential and most critical input for
    sustainable agriculture (Hyder et al. 2022). It is a valuable contribution of
    nature to the existence and survival of life on earth (Manikumari et al. 2017).
    But the distribution of water resources has changed in recent years due to climate
    change effects, which have been causing disaster events like floods and drought
    (Suwarno et al. 2021; Krisnayanti et al. 2022). Change in the occurrence and distribution
    of rainfall has affected the availability of freshwater resources at spatial and
    temporal scales (Chutiman et al. 2022). Moreover, increasing water demand due
    to a burgeoning population and changing climate necessitates judicious management
    of water resources in agriculture (Manikumari et al. 2017). Globally, about 70%
    of water drained from rivers and aquifers is diverted for agricultural activities
    (Shang et al. 2020). Therefore, evapotranspiration (ET), a significant component
    of the hydrologic cycle, needs special attention for accurate quantification.
    The reference evapotranspiration (ET0) expresses the simultaneous occurrence of
    the soil water evaporation and the crop transpiration processes on a vegetated
    surface (Allen et al. 1998). Real-time computations of actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) require forecasting of daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Therefore,
    precise ET0 quantification is necessary for determining irrigation demands, irrigation
    scheduling, water resource management, environmental impact assessment, and water
    balance studies at regional and local levels, and for its use in various rainfall-runoff
    and ecosystem models (Nema et al. 2017; Poddar et al. 2021). The Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) of the United Nations lately embraced a standardized form of
    the Penman–Monteith (PM) equation to establish a globally valid benchmark for
    calculating ET0, constructing crop coefficient curves for crops, and analyzing
    and calibrating other ET0 methodologies in situations where weighing-type field
    lysimeter measurements are inaccessible (Allen et al. 1998; Cai et al. 2007; Kumar
    et al. 2012; Garg et al. 2016; Kushwaha et al. 2021). Several process-based and
    empirical equations based on radiation, temperature, mass transfer, and water
    budget methods have been derived to determine ET0 with different input combinations
    of meteorological parameters (Majhi & Naidu 2021). These methods are physically
    based and require input data (Allen et al. 1998). Several authors have utilized
    these empirical models under data-limited conditions (Tabari 2010; Poddar et al.
    2021; Pandey & Pandey) to estimate ET0. In addition, irrigation scheduling software
    developed for different crops requires an accurate value of ET0 and the crop coefficient
    values at different crop growth stages (Genaidy 2020). Applications of soft computing
    techniques have become reliable in solving complex problems (Wagstaff 2012; Kumar
    et al. 2016; Hameed et al. 2021). Due to its high performance and the decisive
    advantage of capturing nonlinear and complex structures, machine learning is widely
    applied to different fields, namely, marketing for task classification, finance
    for forecasting, telecommunications for forecasting and task classification, and
    network analysis for relating different tasks (Bhandari 2021). Also, several studies
    have used machine learning algorithms to estimate reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) (Chia et al. 2020, 2022; Hanoon et al. 2021; Rai et al. 2022). ET0 forecasting
    models were developed using soft computing tools, namely, support vector machine
    (SVM), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), particle swarm optimization (PSO)
    SVM, and PSO-GBDT algorithms. Results indicated that SVM, GBDT, PSO-SVM, and PSO-GBDT
    models generally resulted in better forecasting of ET0, whereas the PSO-GBDT algorithm
    performed better for the Southwest China region (Zhao et al. 2021). Artificial
    neural network (ANN) modeling permits easier translation between humans and computers
    for decision-making and a better way to handle imprecise and uncertain information
    (Fernández-López et al. 2020). Multiple linear regression (MLR) showed that the
    ANN and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) models were superior to the MLR models
    in forecasting daily reference evapotranspiration at Pantnagar, India (Heramb
    et al. 2022). In another study, a comparison of the Feed Forward Neural Network
    (FFNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), and GEP machine learning
    algorithms for estimating daily ET0 in the Lower Cheliff Plain, northwest Algeria,
    was done (Achite et al. 2022). Results concluded that the RBFNN and GEP models
    showed promising performance. However, the FFNN model performed the best during
    training (R2 = 0.9903, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.2332, and EF = 0.9902)
    and testing (R2 = 0.9921, RMSE = 0.2342, and EF = 0.9902) phases in forecasting
    ET0 as compared with the PM evapotranspiration. The ANN model outperformed the
    linear regression model in forecasting daily evaporation (Singh et al. 2021).
    The ANN model with a 4-10-1 ANN structure was recommended to perform best for
    evaporation at the National Institute of Technology (NIH), Roorkee, India. Deep
    learning (DL) is also extensively used for forecasting hydrological variables.
    The performance of four learning algorithms, namely, DL-Multilayer Perceptron
    (DLMP), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting
    Machine (GBM), was assessed to forecast future ET0 for Hoshiarpur and Patiala
    district, Punjab, India. The study concluded that the DLMP outperformed other
    models during the training, validation, and testing stages, and the statistical
    performance indicator values for DLMP models ranged between 0.95 and 0.98 for
    NSE, 0.95 and 0.99 for the coefficient of determination (R2), 85 and 95 for the
    loss and accuracy (ACC), 0.0369 and 0.1215 for mean squared error (MSE), and 0.1921
    and 0.2691 for RMSE. Machine learning approaches, namely, k-nearest-neighbor (KNN)
    and ANN models, were applied to forecast daily ET0 using four combinations of
    climatic data in the Middle Anatolia region of Turkey. They concluded that the
    KNN had higher performances than the ANN in all combinations under full and limited
    data conditions (Yamaç 2021). The potential of algorithm KNN, a data mining method
    for estimating ET0, was investigated using limited climatic data in a semi-arid
    environment in China. Results showed that the input variables of the KNN-based
    ET0 forecast model, which requires maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature,
    and relative humidity, had the best accuracy (Feng & Tian 2021). The performance
    of soft computing algorithms, namely, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), SVM, KNN, and
    ANN, were compared for ET0 estimation against the PM model for Pakistan climatic
    conditions. The results showed that the KNN model was more accurate than SVM,
    GNB, and ANN models, with 92% accuracy (Hu et al. 2022). The performance of the
    ANN and KNN soft computing techniques in forecasting different real-world problems
    depends on various factors. The choice of activation function and solver using
    ANN techniques determine the ANN performance in forecasting daily ET0. Also, the
    number of neighbors (k) value using the KNN technique affects its efficacy in
    forecasting ET0. Several authors have applied different machine learning algorithms
    to forecast ET0 in different climatic conditions. However, less information is
    available on the application of different ANN learning algorithms in forecasting
    daily ET0 with a sigmoid activation function. Previous studies using KNN techniques
    lacked the effect of the number of neighbors on the algorithm''s performance in
    forecasting daily ET0. Keeping in view the research gap in forecasting daily ET0
    using soft computing tools in previous studies, the present study was undertaken
    to assess the performance of ANN and KNN techniques for precise forecasting of
    daily ET0. The novelty of this investigation is the application of the sigmoid
    activation function along with three activation learning algorithms for ANN techniques
    and the optimization of the number of neighbors for the KNN technique to forecast
    daily ET0. The sigmoid activation function tested three learning algorithms, namely,
    L-BFGS-B (Limited memory-Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno), stochastic gradient
    descent (SGD), and Adam, for daily forecasting of ET0. Also, the selection of
    ANN techniques based on an optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer for ANN-based
    ET0 forecasting models was carried out in this study. Additionally, the optimum
    number of nearest neighbors in the KNN algorithm, which influences the model performance
    in forecasting daily ET0, has been worked out for semi-arid climates. Another
    novelty of this work is performing the sensitivity analysis of the best daily
    ET0 forecasting model to identify the weather variables that most influence its
    performance. Thus, the current study was carried out with the objective of assessing
    the effectiveness of the ANN and KNN soft computing approaches in forecasting
    daily ET0 at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) farm in New Delhi,
    India, as well as to perform sensitivity analysis of the best ET0 forecasting
    model to detect the most affecting input variables. The developed model may aid
    in accurate quantification of daily basis ET0, which may be utilized to compute
    crop water requirements considering stage-wise water requirements for crops. MATERIALS
    AND METHODS Study area description Listen Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian
    Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-IARI) is located in the central district
    of New Delhi. The geographical coordinates of IARI are 28.080 N latitude and 77.120
    E longitude at an elevation of 228.61 m above mean sea level. The mean annual
    temperature is 25.5 °C. May and June are the hottest months, with 30 years’ average
    maximum temperatures of 39 °C, varying from 33.9 to 45.0 °C. The mean temperature
    of 14° C in January is considered the coldest. However, the minimum temperature
    dips below 1 °C. Approximately 75% of the rainfall is received during the monsoon
    season (June to September), with a mean annual rainfall of 710 mm. The average
    relative humidity (RH) in other months varies from 34.1 to 97.9%, and the mean
    daily evaporation ranges between 3 and 9 mm day−1. The average wind speed (WS)
    varies from 0.45 to 3.96 m/s. The location map of the study area is shown in Figure
    1. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Location map of the study area. Data collection
    and ET0 calculation Listen Weather data comprising daily maximum and minimum temperatures
    (Tmax and Tmin), wind velocity (WS), daily maximum and minimum relative humidity
    (RHI and RHII), and sunshine hours (SS) were collected during the period from
    1990 to 2020 from the observatory, Division of Agricultural Physics, Indian Council
    of Agricultural Research-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-IARI), New
    Delhi. The estimation of daily ET0 was carried out using Reference ET software
    (REF-ET). The REF-ET software is an open source software developed by Kimberly
    Research and Extension Center, Idaho, USA, and used by Jothiprakash et al. (2002),
    among others, for ET0 estimation. Solar radiation (SR) was derived using CROPWAT
    8.0 software using daily meteorological variable data. The REF-ET uses the Food
    and Agriculture Organization''s recommended PM Allen et al. (2006) model for ET0
    calculation. The PM equation for ET0 calculation is given by: where ET0 is the
    reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), Rn is the net radiation (MJ m−2 day−1),
    G is the soil heat flux (MJ m−2 day−1), γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1),
    es is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa), ea is the actual vapor pressure (kPa),
    Δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure–temperature curve (kPa °C−1),
    Tmean is the daily average temperature (°C), and u2 is the daily wind velocity
    (m/s). Soft computing techniques Listen An ANN is composed of numerous interconnected
    processing units and has a topology similar to a neuronal structure (Eslamian
    et al. 2012). ANNs are typically made up of layers of neurons, weights that denote
    the strength of interconnections, and a transfer or activation function. The links
    between weights (W) and biases (B) connect the input layer I to the hidden layer
    (j), which, in turn, connects to the output layer (k) (B). The weights alter the
    throughput characteristics as well as the linkages to the neurons (n). Biases
    are used as extra components within the hidden and output layer neurons. The neuron
    (processing element) in the hidden layer consists of aggregating weighted inputs
    to produce a quantity-weighted input (activation value). In the hidden layer,
    the neuron''s activation value (hj) is mathematically presented using the following
    equation (Haykin 1998) The activation functions (f) of the hidden layer neurons
    serve to transform the input variables (the activation levels of the neurons)
    into the needed output variable. The sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent transfer functions
    are the most commonly used in hydrological modeling (Dawson & Wilby 2001; Zanetti
    et al. 2007). Activation function Listen Previous studies (Trajkovic et al. 2003;
    Alves et al. 2017; Amir-Ashayeri et al. 2021) applied logistic sigmoid activation
    function for ET0 forecasting and found satisfactory results. In this study, the
    logistic sigmoid activation function is used and expressed by the following equation:
    where x is either the value of nij or njk. ANN algorithms Listen Initially, ANN
    models in ET research focused solely on the back-propagation learning algorithm
    (Kuo et al. 2011; Nazari & Band 2018). However, in recent years, these models
    have been further refined by exploiting alternative learning algorithms, such
    as the radial basis function (Wu et al. 2012; Du & Swamy 2014; Majhi & Naidu 2021),
    quick propagation (Landeras et al. 2008), Levenberg–Marquardt (Poddar et al. 2021),
    and conjugate gradient descent (Landeras et al. 2008). The present study used
    three learning algorithms, namely, L-BFGS-B learning algorithm, SGD learning algorithm,
    and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). L-LFGS-B algorithm Listen The L-BFGS-B
    algorithm extends the L-BFGS algorithm to handle simple bounds on the model (Zhu
    et al. 1997). The BFGS–ANN algorithm enhanced the performance of the ANN model
    in ET0 estimation for drought-prone arid and semi-arid regions over Gaussian process
    regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), and long short-term memory
    (LSTM) models (Sattari et al. 2021). SGD algorithm Listen where is the updated
    weight; is the previous value of the weight; is the learning rate of 0.1, and
    E is the output error computed by the objective function (Walls et al. 2020).
    Adam algorithm Listen Adam optimization is applied to calculate the adaptive training
    rate of the parameters. The ADAM optimization algorithm was used in previous studies
    for ET0 estimation (Sattari et al. 2020). The ANN structure Listen The network
    geometry is generally highly problem-oriented to obtain optimal network geometry
    through the trial-and-error approach. The number of hidden neurons in the network
    responsible for capturing the dynamic and complex relationship between input and
    output variables is identified through different trial runs. For each set of hidden
    neurons, the network is trained with input datasets in the batch mode to minimize
    the mean squared error at the output layer. The efficacy of the ANN is influenced
    by different factors such as learning rate, momentum coefficient, and the combination
    of transfer functions for hidden and output layers (Walls et al. 2020). This study
    used the ANN model with seven input layers, one output layer, and one hidden layer
    with varying (1–12) neurons in the hidden layer to develop the best-performing
    model. The optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer was found by the trial-and-error
    approach. The ANN schematic diagram used in the present investigation is shown
    in Figure 2. Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE The ANN architecture used in the
    present study. KNN technique Listen The KNN is the simple classification method
    presented by Cover & Hart (1967), which is a widely used machine learning method
    (Wu et al. 2008). It is non-parametric, easy to implement, and yields efficient
    and competitive results. This advantage makes the method more significant than
    other machine learning methods. The generalized architecture of KNN is displayed
    in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the methodology adopted in the present study. Figure

    4 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Flow chart of the methodology developed for daily ET0
    forecasting. Performance evaluation Listen The performance of the ANN and KNN
    soft computing techniques was evaluated using five commonly used statistical indices
    to determine the best model for forecasting daily ET0. These indices are as follows:
    1. Mean squared error (MSE) 2. Mean absolute error (MAE) 3. Correlation coefficient
    (r) 4. Willmott index/index of agreement (d) 5. Mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) where ET0PM is reference evapotranspiration calculated using the FAO-Penman-Monteith
    equation, and ET0F is the model forecasted. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Input feature
    selection Listen The input feature was selected using MLR approaches between dependent
    (ET0) and independent (meteorological variables). Based on the values of statistical
    indices, a combination of all seven independent variables was selected for forecasting
    the ET0. The input selection results showed that combining all meteorological
    variables resulted in the lowest MSE value of 0.13. Similarly, other statistical
    indices, namely, R2, adjusted R2, Mallows’ Cp, Schwarz information criterion (SBC),
    the Schwarz information criterion (SBC) and Amemia''s prediction criterion (PC),
    were 0.96, 0.96, 8, −23,197.80, −23,139.12, and 0.04, respectively, and are shown
    by blue color in Table 1. For all other variable combinations, the values of input
    selection indices are displayed in Table 1. The Type III sum-of-square statistics
    indicated that variable Tmax was the most influential among the ET0 influencing
    variables. At the same time, RHII was the least influential variable among all
    seven variables. Table 1 Regression analysis of input variables for best input

    regression equation derived for ET0 estimation is given as follows: where ET0
    is in mm day−1, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, and a6 are the regression coefficients, and
    c is the intercept. The regression coefficients between ET0 and the independent
    features, namely, Tmin, Tmax, WS, RHIO, RHII, SS, and SR, were 0.036, 0.059, 0.156,
    −0.012, −0.003, −0.031, and 0.156, respectively. The intercept (c) was −0.786.
    The standardized coefficients obtained for independent features and the regression
    analysis are presented in Figure 5. Figure 5 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Standardized
    coefficients of input features for ET0 forecasting. A correlogram was plotted
    considering all input features and ET0 is shown in Figure 6. It is understood
    from Figure 6 that the ET0 is highly positively correlated with the Tmax, Tmin,
    and SR having Pearson''s correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.74, 0.85, and
    0.85, respectively. Independent features, namely, WS and SS, were moderately positively
    correlated with the ET0 having r values of 0.56 and 0.55, respectively. However,
    a highly negative correlation (r = −0.70) was observed between ET0 and RHI, which
    exhibited a negative relationship between these two variables. In addition, a
    negative correlation was found between RHII and ET0. A positive correlation indicates
    a direct relationship between the independent and dependent variables and vice
    versa. Figure 6 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Correlation plot of daily ET0 and meteorological
    parameters. Performance evaluation of soft computing techniques Performance of
    ANN models Listen The statistical parameter indices, namely, MAE, MSE, r, MAPE,
    and d, were used to evaluate the performance of the ANN model for ET0 forecasting.
    The number of neurons in the hidden layer varied from 1 to 12 and stopped after
    it as further increments resulted in the poor performance of the ANN in ET0 forecasting.
    The performance of the algorithms is displayed in Table 2. The results indicated
    that the combination of sigmoid as an activation function and L-BFGS-B as a solver
    performed the best. The model''s performance with the ANN architecture (7,11,1,
    i.e., M11) was the best among all 12 models. The best model reported values of
    indices, namely, MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and d, were 0.075, 0.018, 0.997, 2.76%, and
    0.974, respectively, during the training period. The performance of model 11 (7,11,1)
    was poor during the testing period compared to the training period. The values
    of the performance indices were found to be 0.091, 0.053, 0.984, 3.16%, and 0.969
    for MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and d, respectively, for model M11 during the testing period.
    The performance of model M2 (7,2,1) was found to be worst during the training
    and testing period based on the statistical performance indicator values among
    all the 12 models developed using sigmoid as an activation function and L-BFGS-B
    as a solver. The performance of the models significantly improved by increasing
    the number of neurons in the hidden layers except model M2, which showed poor
    performance compared to the M1 model. For the M12 model, the MAE and MSE indices
    improved by 72.72% compared to the M1 model during the training period. Similarly,
    the MAPE showed an improvement of 12.93% compared to the M1 model during the training
    period. However, the performance indices, namely, r and d, showed slight improvement
    for the M12 model over M1. The r and d had increased by 0.10 and 0.73%, respectively,
    during the model training period. The values of performance indicators during
    the model testing period showed improvement for MAE, MSE, MAPE, and d, and the
    performance was improved by 10.76, 12.67, 3.87, and 0.52% for the best model M12
    compared to the M1 model. However, r showed a slight reduction in the model''s
    performance and its value was reduced by 0.52%. Overall, we found that the performance
    of the ANN using sigmoid activation function and an L-BFGS-B solver to forecast
    daily ET0 had improved by increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer.

    performed worst in forecasting daily ET0. The values of the MAE, MSE, r, MAPE,
    and d for the M17 model obtained were 0.268, 0.143, 0.975, 10.54%, and 0.907,
    respectively, during the training period and 0.242, 0.122, 0.979, 9.79%, and 0.916,
    respectively, during the testing period. The M24 model reported that the performance
    indices, namely, MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and d resulted in values of 1.440, 2.934,
    0.031, 59.12%, and 0.00, respectively, during the model training period and 1.455,
    2.885, 0.003, 61.82, and 0.000, respectively, during the model testing period.
    The comparison between the minimum and maximum number of neurons in the hidden
    layer showed that M14, M23, and M24 models performed more poorly in forecasting
    daily ET0. Overall, we observed that the performance of the ANN using sigmoid
    activation function with a SGD solver to forecast daily ET0 had showed the effects
    of the number of neurons on the performance significantly. The performance of
    models developed using sigmoid as an activation function and Adam as a solver
    was improved during the testing period over the training period, as indicated
    by the performance indicator values in Table 2. Among all the 12 combinations
    of the ANN structure-based models, model M32 (7,8,1) performed the best. The statistical
    performance indices, namely, MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and d, reported values of 0.164,
    0.081, 0.986, 7.22%, and 0.943 during the training period and 0.162, 0.082, 0.986,
    7.10%, and 0.944, respectively, during the testing period. On the other hand,
    model M31 (7,7,1) performed worst among all the 12 models as reported by the low
    values of statistical performance indices. The performance of all 36 models is
    presented in Table 2. The values of MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and d for model 31 were
    found to be 0.434, 0.500, 0.911, 14.37, and 0.849, respectively. The same during
    the testing period were 0.413, 0.421, 0.924, 14.14, and 0.857, respectively. All
    the remaining models gave the values of statistical performance indices better
    than model M31 and poorer than model M32. The increment of the number of neurons
    from 1 to 12 was done to determine the best model. It was found that the ANN functioned
    differently and there was no incremental improvement in the performance indicator
    values while increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer. Therefore,
    among 12 models developed using sigmoid as an activation function and Adam as
    a solver, model M32 was found to be best for forecasting daily ET0. We found that
    among all the three solvers with sigmoid activation function, the performance
    of the models developed using a L-BFGS-B solver gave best results and thus we
    recommend employing the ANN model with sigmoid function and an L-BFGS-B solver
    to forecast daily ET0 under semi-arid climatic condition. The line diagram and
    scatter plot of the best ANN model M11 (7,11,1) during training and testing are
    shown in Figure 7. From Figure 7, it is evident that the data points located below
    the 1;1 line are the under forecasted values of ET0, and data points above the
    best fit line (1:1 line) are the over forecasted ET0 values. It is evident from
    Figure 7 that the majority of the data points were lying within the forecasting
    confidence limit (±5) of the regression line. Figure 7 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE
    Line diagram and scattered plot between PM and the ANN model during training and
    testing periods. Performance of KNN models Listen The performance of models developed
    using different neighbor (k) values to forecast the ET0 at the IARI, New Delhi,
    is presented in Table 3. The trial-and-error approach identified the k-value for
    the best ET0 forecasting model. The KNN model with a neighbor (k) value of 1 yielded
    an absolute value of performance indices during training and unacceptable values
    during model testing. Thus, model k1 was rejected for subsequent analysis. Therefore,
    only four developed models have been evaluated and discussed. It was observed
    that as the number of neighbors increased from 1 to 5, the performance of KNN
    improved, and further iteration using a higher k-value (over 5) resulted in a
    decrease in the KNN performance in forecasting the daily ET0. Thus, the K-value
    was restricted to 5 to avoid overfitting of the developed models. Interestingly,
    increasing the k-value from 1 to 5 has decreased the KNN''s performance during
    training while improving the performance during testing. Model K1 yielded the
    best performance indicators during training and model K4 during testing. The values
    of performance evaluation indices, namely, MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and d, were 0.184,
    0.065, 0.989, 5.95%, and 0.936, respectively, during the training period for model
    K4. While during the testing of model K4, the values of MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and
    d were obtained as 0.217, 0.103, 0.964, 6.97%, and 0.962, respectively. Therefore,
    it can be recommended to use model K4 for forecasting daily ET0 values among the
    four developed models. The line diagram and scatter plot of the best KNN model
    M4 for the training and testing periods are shown in Figure 8. Table 3 Performance

    KNN model during training and testing periods. Sensitivity analysis of the ANN
    model Listen Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess each input feature''s
    effect on the ANN models’ forecasting capability. Out of 36 ANN models developed
    using a combination of activation functions and solvers with the different ANN
    structures, model M11 was chosen for sensitivity analysis based on its forecasting
    of daily ET0 performance. Each input feature, namely, Tmin, Tmax, WS, SR, SS,
    RHI, and RHII, was omitted once to check its influence on the ET0 forecasting
    ability of the ANN model based on the performance evaluation indices. Table 4
    shows the influence of the skipped input variable on the performance index values.
    The kite diagram has been plotted for the training and testing period to visualize
    the effect of each skipped input variable on the ANN model M11 (7,11,1) performance
    to forecast daily ET0 (Figure 9). In general, skipping each variable showed a
    decrease in the model''s performance to forecast ET0 based on the performance
    index values. However, the most critical input variable influencing the model''s
    performance was WS during training and testing. The influence of skipping parameters
    on the ET0 forecasting was followed by SR, Tmax, SS, RHI, RHII, and Tmin, respectively,
    during the training period of the M11 model. Table 4 The ANN best model (M11)

    9 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Kite diagram for sensitivity analysis of model M11
    during training and testing periods. Conversely, during the testing period of
    the sensitivity analysis, WS emerged as the most influential input variable for
    ET0 forecasting. Furthermore, the influence of the input variables was followed
    by SR, Tmax, RHII, SS, RHI, and Tmin, respectively, in decreasing order. Therefore,
    it may be concluded that the WS is the most influential input variable and its
    omission in forecasting ET0 using the developed ANN model M11 reduces the model
    performance during training and testing periods. Overall, the performance of the
    ANN model M11 outperformed all the ANN- and KNN- based models, and therefore,
    model M11 may be used to forecast daily ET0 at the IARI, New Delhi. Comparison
    with previous studies Listen Many researchers have employed different machine
    learning algorithms to forecast ET0. In many cases, a single algorithm based on
    ET0 forecasting was better, and in some cases, meta-heuristic algorithms performed
    better than single algorithms. For example, the deep neural network (DNN) model
    was superior in forecasting daily ET0 based on a single input meteorological variable
    compared to RF and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms in California
    (Ravindran et al. 2021). Improved machine learning algorithms such as the SVM-cuckoo
    algorithm (SVM-CA) outperformed genetic programming (GP), model tree (M5T), and
    the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in forecasting ET0 at Ranichuri,
    Uttarakhand, India (Ehteram et al. 2019). In another study, the ANN model with
    the Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm, single hidden layer, and nine neutron
    configurations were found to be the best for ET0 forecasting in Dehradun, India
    (Nema et al. 2017). This study''s findings align with other study results. Our
    study showed that all the meteorological variables are essential to forecast ET0.
    However, Alves et al. (2017) reported that air temperature alone could be sufficient
    to forecast daily ET0 accurately using the ANN algorithm under a data-limited
    scenario. In comparison to Hargreaves and the FAO-PM methods, the ANN model has
    shown to be a reliable choice for estimating ET0 using Tmax and Tmin for Salinas,
    California, United States of America, providing superior performance index, standard
    error of estimate, and correlation (Lucas et al. 2008). In forecasting ET0, the
    performance of the KNN model was better than the SVM, GNB, and ANN models with
    92% accuracy in the Multan region, Pakistan (Hu et al. 2022). However, the findings
    of our study contradict the findings reported by Hu et al. (2022). This could
    be due to various factors, including agro-climatic conditions, algorithm structure,
    and the activation function used in the ANN techniques. The activation function
    selection and the learning algorithm influenced the ANN performance. The influence
    of the ANN activation function and the architecture in forecasting daily ET0 was
    assessed for Nissouri Creek, Oxford County, Canada (Walls et al. 2020). Study
    results showed that the SGD learning algorithm for 500 training epochs had performed
    better compared to a combination of ReLU and root-mean-square-propagation (RMSprop)
    learning algorithms in forecasting daily ET0 for Nissouri Creek, Oxford County,
    Canada (Walls et al. 2020). The ANN-based model showed higher efficacy in modeling
    daily ET as compared to kNN, RF, SVM, XGBoost, and LSTM ML as evidenced by the
    low RMSE (ranged between 18.67 and 21.23) and stronger r (ranged between 0.90
    and 0.94) values for global cropped lands (Liu et al. 2021). The findings of the
    present study are in line with the study (Liu et al. 2021). The performance of
    the ANN model for drought-prone arid and semi-arid regions of Corum, Turkey proved
    to be better in ET0 estimation compared to GPR, SVR, and LSTM approaches with
    full and partial dataset conditions (Sattari et al. 2021). The efficacy of the
    machine learning models is influenced by the data availability. For instance,
    Yamaç (2021) found that the kNN was superior to the ANN in modeling daily potato
    crop evapotranspiration under limited meteorological dataset conditions at the
    Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Bari (CIHEAM-Bari), Valenzano, Southern Italy.
    However, under a full dataset scenario, the ANN model gave slightly better statistical
    indicators than the kNN. Thus, our findings are in line with the study (Yamaç
    2021). The performance of the KNN was assessed to forecast daily ET0 in the Ningxia
    irrigation area, China under a limited dataset scenario (Feng & Tian 2021). They
    reported that the KNN-based ET0 forecast model (K = 3) performed better than other
    nearest-neighbor (k) values. Based on the different model''s efficacy in forecasting
    daily ET0, they found that the KNN-based ET0 forecast model which requires Tmax,
    Tmin, and RH as input variables had the best accuracy. They concluded that the
    KNN-based prediction were consistent with the PM model and recommend applying
    it in semi-arid environments. The performance of the ANN model is highly dependent
    on its structure, i.e., the number of variables, the number of hidden layers,
    and the number of neurons in the hidden layers. The daily evaporation was forecasted
    by Singh et al. (2021) and reported that the ANN with structure (4-9-1) was better
    than other structures and outperformed the MLR model. Many neighbors (k) in the
    KNN algorithm influenced its ET0 forecasting capability, as reported by Feng &
    Tian 2021. They found that input variables in the KNN-based ET0 forecast model,
    which requires Tmax, Tmin, and RH, resulted in higher forecasting accuracy. The
    optimal number of neighbors found was 3 (k = 3) for ET0 forecasting in Ningxia,
    China. The findings of different algorithms in forecasting ET0 vary under different
    climatic conditions. Therefore, under the prevailing climatic conditions of the
    study region, the performance of the ANN models was better compared to the KNN
    models. CONCLUSION Listen Irrigation water management at the field level requires
    an accurate estimation of crop water requirements, for which the reference evapotranspiration
    is the prerequisite. Soft computing techniques like ANN and KNN are easy alternatives
    that can be developed using meteorological parameters. Furthermore, comparing
    advanced soft computing tools with standard methods enables the user to change
    the structure and algorithms to suit a particular climatic condition. The best
    selected ANN (M11) model''s performance was superior to the KNN models. This study
    also demonstrated that the hidden layer structure influenced the performance of
    the ANN model in forecasting daily ET0. The performance indices for model M11
    were superior to others with MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and d as 0.075, 0.018, 0.997,
    2.76%, and 0.974, respectively, during model training and 0.091, 0.053, 0.984,
    3.16%, and 0.969, respectively, during model testing. Sensitivity analysis of
    the best selected model revealed that the WS influenced the model''s performance
    and, thus, an essential variable for daily ET0 forecasting. Therefore, it can
    be recommended that the model M11 (7,11,1) with logistic activation function and
    L-BFGS-B learning algorithm can be utilized for ET0 forecasting at the IARI, New
    Delhi. The research conclusions reported here provide irrigation managers and
    cultivators with fundamental guidance for forecasting ET0 for irrigation planning
    and managing water resources in the context of available information. The present
    study considered the full meteorological dataset availability condition. However,
    such a dataset may not be available in all the regions especially in the ungauged
    watershed. Therefore, under such a meteorological data limitation scenario, the
    developed models may not perform accurately enough to predict daily ET0. Hence,
    the ANN and KNN techniques required to be tested depending on the meteorological
    data availability. Also, the performance of the soft computing techniques in forecasting
    daily ET0 may be significantly influenced by the selection of algorithm, study
    location, dataset size, and partitioning of the dataset. Therefore, we suggest
    evaluating the application of the ANN and KNN techniques under different climatic
    conditions with varying scenarios of data availability and data partitioning to
    arrive to concrete conclusions for their application in forecasting daily ET0
    in other climatic conditions. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Listen The authors are thankful

    is essential for planning and designing an efficient irrigation system. The present
    investigation assessed the capability of four machine learning algorithms, namely,
    XGBoost linear regression (XGBoost Linear), XGBoost Ensemble Tree, Polynomial
    Regression (Polynomial Regr), and Isotonic Regression (Isotonic Regr) in modeling
    daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) at IARI, New Delhi. The models were developed
    considering full and limited dataset scenarios. The efficacy of the constructed
    models was assessed against the Penman–Monteith (PM56) model estimated daily ETo.
    Results revealed the under full and limited dataset conditions, XGBoost Ensemble
    Tree gave the best results for daily ETo modeling during the model training period,
    while in the testing period under scenarios S1(Tmax) and S2 (Tmax, and Tmin),
    the Isotonic Regr models yielded superior results over other models. In addition,
    the XGBoost Ensemble Tree models outperformed others for the rest of the input
    data scenarios. The XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithms reported the best values
    of correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE),
    root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Thus,
    we recommend applying the XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm for precisely modeling
    daily ETo in semi-arid climatic conditions. HIGHLIGHTS Listen Four machine learning
    algorithms were tested for daily ETo modeling. Five input scenarios were developed
    using cross-correlation analysis. The performance was assessed using five statistical
    performance indicators. The XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm is found best in daily
    ETo modeling. The weighted score-based model ranking was done. box plot, irrigation

    is crucial to fulfill the global food demand of the growing demography. It accounts
    for 40% of the total land area used for agriculture (Meier et al. 2018). However,
    in some regions, agricultural water availability is predicted to diminish in the
    coming years amid climate change and insufficient water resources management approaches
    (Clothier et al. 2022). In India, the regions of Marathwada in Maharashtra, Bundelkhand
    in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and Rayalaseema in Andhra Pradesh are among
    the areas that have experienced water scarcity in recent years (Marathwada, Vidarbha
    and Bundelkhand region gets ‘WARM’ – India | ReliefWeb 2017). Also, Latur in Maharashtra,
    western Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Gujarat are other regions that have
    faced water shortages. This water availability scarcity threat poses challenges
    to managing water resources to ensure sustainable development. The limitation
    of freshwater availability varies at both temporal and spatial scales and needs
    to be tacked as per the requirements. Considering that 40% of worldwide crop yields
    are obtained from irrigated fields, the regional constraint of freshwater water
    availability significantly influences global agriculture production (Meier et
    al. 2018). Development of irrigation schedules and optimal design of irrigation
    systems/schemes require accurate quantification of evapotranspiration at all scales.
    The estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is particularly useful in
    regions where irrigation water or blue water resources are not readily available.
    In such areas, the calculation of ETo can aid in selecting crops based on the
    availability of green water, which refers to effective rainfall that can be utilized
    by crops. The crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for a specific crop in a particular
    location can be determined by multiplying the ETo with the crop coefficient (Kc)
    (Dimple et al. 2020; Rajput et al. 2022a). This provides a means of estimating
    the amount of water needed for a specific crop in a given location, taking into
    account local climatic conditions and the plant''s water requirements. Such estimations
    can assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding crop selection and water
    management, ultimately leading to greater efficiency and sustainability in agricultural
    practices. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo), an integral element of the hydrologic
    cycle, is the combined water demand of the atmosphere from a cropped field. Quantification
    of ETo at the spatiotemporal scale is needed to optimize the water resources (Jalgaonkar
    & Singh 2021). The ETo estimation is necessary for the calculation of irrigation
    water needs, management of water resources, hydrological, environmental challenges,
    and the calculation of the water balance, particularly in drier environments where
    water resources are few and fresh freshwater is limited (Dimple et al. 2022b).
    There are several direct and indirect approaches to estimate ETo. Lysimeters are
    typically used to precisely measure the ET; although this method is expensive
    and time consuming, it is impossible to employ in many locations (Clothier et
    al. 2022). In addition, eddy covariance and Bowen ratio energy balance are further
    direct methods for estimating ETo that is rarely utilized in reality due to their
    complexity and affordability. The cost and time for lysimeter experiments can
    vary depending on several factors such as the size and complexity of the lysimeter
    system, the type of crop or vegetation being studied, and the specific research
    need. In general, the initial setup costs for a lysimeter system can be relatively
    high, as it may involve the construction of a large container or set of containers
    capable of supporting the desired plant growth and collecting the necessary data.
    Ongoing maintenance and monitoring costs may also be significant, particularly
    if the lysimeter system requires regular calibration or data collection (Howell
    2005). Lysimeters are typically employed in situations necessitating the monitoring
    of water, nutrient, or contaminant flux across the soil–plant–atmosphere system.
    Such contexts may encompass agricultural research aimed at optimizing irrigation
    and nutrient management practices, as well as environmental research seeking to
    comprehend the fate and transport of pollutants in soil and groundwater systems.
    Lysimeters are also a valuable tool in ecological research to investigate the
    impact of climate change, land use alterations, and other environmental stressors
    on plant growth and ecosystem processes (Goss & Ehlers 2009). Also, the duration
    of lysimeter experiments is contingent upon the specific research objectives.
    For instance, certain experiments may necessitate only a few weeks or months of
    data collection, while others may demand several years of monitoring to comprehensively
    capture the ecological or agricultural processes under study. Weather conditions,
    plant growth rates, and the availability of necessary equipment and personnel
    are additional factors that may impact the time required for lysimeter experiments
    (Sołtysiak & Rakoczy 2019). In addition, the development of crop coefficients
    for vegetable crops of shorter duration would require lesser time for lysimetric
    experiments than the orchards/trees. Indirect methods frequently used to determine
    ETo can be broadly grouped into many categories, including temperature, radiation,
    and mass transfer models (Kushwaha et al. 2021). The Food and Agriculture Organization
    recommended that the Penman–Monteith model is assumed to be the most accurate
    technique to estimate ETo at the global level. Though the PM model is an efficient
    technique to quantify the ETo, it requires many meteorological variables. Different
    meteorological parameters affect ETo, including air temperature, humidity, radiation,
    and wind speed (WS) (Allen et al. 1998). In most circumstances, gaining access
    to the meteorological data is quite challenging, particularly in developing nations.
    Consequently, quantifying the direct ETo via field measurements is complicated
    and time consuming, and in specific locations, it is not even possible due to
    cost constraints (Clothier et al. 2022). Consequently, several attempts have been
    made to estimate the ETo by indirect approaches. ETo is one of the complicated
    and essential hydrologic processes. Therefore, this developed modeling methodology
    would enhance the prediction precision of ETo and assist in sustaining the agriculture
    water resources management to manage the escalating water pressure in farming
    triggered by worldwide ecological oscillations. Realizing the significance of
    ETo in optimum water resource management and the planning for existing resource
    systems, it is vital to estimate ETo values for each region using appropriate
    methods. With the advent of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques,
    the use of machine learning techniques (ML) to simulate various environmental
    variables and processes has increased in the recent times. ML techniques have
    been applied effectively for predicting groundwater quality indices (Dimple et
    al. 2022a), water temperature (Vishwakarma et al. 2022), evaporation (Kushwaha
    et al. 2021), runoff (Bhadra et al. 2010), pollutant removal (Divband Hafshejani
    et al. 2022), dissolved oxygen (Arora & Keshari 2021), rainfall-runoff relationship
    (Lakshmi et al. 2022), monthly rainfall (Zhao et al. 2022), wastewater treatment
    processes (Icke et al. 2020), soil permeability (Ozcoban et al. 2018), rain garden
    infiltration (Kumar & Singh 2021), control of wastewater treatment plant (Bernardelli
    et al. 2020), mean sea level (Adwait & Thendiyath 2022), land surface temperature
    (Maddu et al. 2021), suspended sediment load (Farzin & Valikhan Anaraki 2021),
    aerosol properties retrieval (Srivastava et al. 2021), flood susceptibility (Eslaminezhad
    et al. 2022), agricultural drought (Fung et al. 2019), among applications in other
    fields as well. The most common algorithms for ETo modeling include support vector
    machine (SVM), gradient boosted tree (GBT), artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest
    neighbors (kNN), M5 model tree (M5Tree), multivariate adaptive regression spline
    (MARS), probabilistic linear regression (PLR), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
    system (ANFIS), multiple linear regression (MLR), extreme learning machine (ELM),
    gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and
    Gaussian process regression (GPR) (Ayaz et al. 2021). The performance of ANN to
    estimate ETo using scarce data and their performance against the PM model was
    done for Raipur, India. The study concluded that model M1 (having a full dataset
    of inputs, namely, Tmax, Tmin, RH (I), RH (II), WS and sunshine hours (SSH)),
    outperformed other developed models (with limited dataset inputs). The Model M1R
    gave the maximum value for the coefficient of correlation (r), coefficient of
    efficiency (CE) and Index of Agreement (IOA) value as 99.7, 99.4, and 99.8 and
    99.7, 99.5, and 99.6 during the training and testing period. Therefore, the constructed
    ANN models are appropriate for adoption for the objective of calculating ETo in
    the location with a satisfactory level of precision (Bai et al. 2017). A comparison
    of eight empirical models and ANN was carried out to compute ETo in the dry sub-humid
    agro-ecological region in Varanasi, India. The study reported that ANN with feed-forward
    network and resilient back-propagation method found the best to predict ETo (Kar
    et al. 2016). In another investigation, the efficiency of the ANN model was assessed
    to estimate ETo for the Tarai region, Uttarakhand, India. The ANN consisted feed-forward
    multilayer ANNs of single and two hidden layer(s). The ETo prediction efficiency
    of ANN models was examined to that of the most trustworthy and conventional FAO-56
    PM method. According to the study''s findings, applying an ANN model resulted
    in superior performance for the calculation ETo. The correlation coefficient between
    the projected ETo values from the ANN model and the computed ETo values from the
    PM model was found to be 0.9527. It is possible to draw the conclusion from these
    findings that the ANN is superior to more traditional approaches in its ability
    to forecast ETo (Kumar et al. 2015). Various regression algorithms have been employed
    for predicting various environmental phenomena. Amongst all the regression algorithms,
    multi-linear regression (MLR) has been employed in previous studies to model ETo.
    Ponraj & Vigneswaran (2020) used MLR, random forest (RF) and gradient boosting
    tree (GBR) to estimate ETo. They indicated that the pre-processed GBR model predicts
    the ETo more accurately than the remaining two models. Different regression techniques
    for daily ETo forecasting applied are MLR (Yirga 2019), MARS (Wu et al. 2019),
    support vector regression (SVR) (Mohammadi & Mehdizadeh 2020), multivariate fractional
    polynomial (Khoshravesh et al. 2017), robust regression (Khoshravesh et al. 2017),
    Bayesian regression (Khoshravesh et al. 2017), among others. The literature reviewed
    indicated that there had been limited application of the Polynomial Regr and Isotonic
    Regr in modeling hydrological variables, particularly ETo. However, Polynomial
    regression (Polynomial Regr) has been utilized for stress in the structures (Ostertagová
    et al. 2016) and traffic speed analysis (Yue et al. 2010) among applications in
    other domains. Isotonic regression (Isotonic Regr) has been employed to predict
    corrosion depth in the oil refinery industry (Alqarni et al. 2022). These techniques
    have not been tested in modeling daily ETo under semi-arid climatic conditions
    using different combinations of the input variables. Data-limited scenario permits
    exploring the new concepts of soft computing and artificial intelligence techniques
    to improve the precise quantification of ETo. The effectiveness of the Hargreaves
    Samani (HS), ANN, MLR, and ELM models to compute ETo using temperature data in
    the Verde Grande River basin, Southeastern Brazil was examined (Reis et al. 2019).
    The study concluded that the locally learned models were more precise than the
    pooled data models; nevertheless, the pooled data models might be utilized to
    estimate ETo when local meteorological data are unavailable. In addition to traditional
    ML models and empirical equations, deep learning models have been widely used
    to model different environmental phenomena. For instance, Ravindran et al. (2021)
    constructed a deep neural network (DNN) structure that forecasts daily ETo utilizing
    a single input variable picked based on the attribute significance (FI) score
    the ML algorithms provided, namely, RF, and XGBoost in California. This was accomplished
    by using the feature importance score. They determined that irrespective of the
    datasets, DNN-Ret surpassed XGB-Ret and RF-Ret. The applicability of three deep
    learning methods (DL), namely, DNN, temporal convolution neural network (TCN),
    and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) to model daily reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) using limited meteorological data in the Northeast plain, China was carried
    out (Chen et al. 2020). They concluded that the TCN outscored the classical ML
    models and empirical models (Chen et al. 2020). Under the meteorological data
    limitation scenario, the PM model cannot be utilized to calculate ETo. Thus, techniques
    requiring fewer meteorological variables must be developed for daily ETo modeling
    in semi-arid climatic conditions. Though a plethora of ML algorithms have been
    applied to model ETo in different agro-climatic conditions by various authors,
    the combination of regression and extreme gradient boosting techniques have not
    been applied for ETo modeling considering dataset restriction. Thus, in this investigation,
    we have considered four ML algorithms, namely, XGBoost linear regression (XGBoost
    Linear), XGBoost Ensemble Tree, Polynomial Regr, and Isotonic Regr and developed
    models under full and limited dataset conditions scenarios for ETo modeling at
    ICAR-IARI, New Delhi Pusa utilizing 31 years long-term weather data (1990–2020).
    The capability of the developed models for modeling daily ETo was assessed using
    well-known model performance indices. The developed models would help in estimating
    ETo under different data availability scenarios for precise irrigation schedules
    which may lead to optimal water application in the irrigation sector in semi-arid
    climatic conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study area description Listen Indian
    Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-IARI) is located in the central Delhi district,
    Delhi. It has east longitude of 77.1525° E and north latitude of 28.6331° N. The
    altitude is 228.61 m above msl. The climatic condition is semi-arid. The mean
    annual precipitation in Delhi is 611 mm. July and August are the wettest months
    of the year. The average WS ranges from a low of 3.5 km/h/h in the month of October
    to a high of 6.4 km/h/h in the month of April. Storms with strong wind speeds
    are commonly coupled with precipitation that occurs during the winter. The average
    relative humidity (RH) is at its lowest point during the summer months, ranging
    from 40 to 45%, whereas it reaches its highest point during the monsoon season
    (when it is at its highest). The mean annual temperature is 24 °C, with the warmest
    month being June (with an average maximum temperature of 45 °C and the coldest
    month being January (with an average minimum temperature of 7 °C). The post-monsoon
    and winter months have lower average wind speeds than the summer and monsoon months,
    which both have higher average wind speeds. The IARI, New Delhi location map is
    shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Meteorological station location

    evapotranspiration was estimated using the REF-ET. The dataset comprises the past
    daily basis 31 years of data (1990–2020) of daily weather parameters and daily
    reference evapotranspiration. The ML algorithms were applied using the KNIME software.

    XGBoost Linear (Extreme Gradient Boosting Linear Algorithm) XGBoost Linear is
    a variant of the XGBoost algorithm that uses linear models instead of decision
    trees to make predictions. It generates probabilities for classification problems
    and is commonly used for binary classification tasks. Unlike the traditional XGBoost
    algorithm, which builds an ensemble of decision trees, XGBoost Linear fits a linear
    function to the input features. The linear function is learned by minimizing a
    regularized objective function using gradient descent. The regression model is
    the one that is used whenever the prediction function is used. We must have an
    understanding of the process that lies underlying the model to get a clear vision
    of the model. First proposed by Chen & Guestrin (2016), the XGBoost linear is
    an ML approach that is both effective and scalable, and it makes use of tree-boosting
    systems. It is built on the basic gradient-boosting framework developed by Friedman
    (2002). In contrast to the original gradient boosting model, XGBoost can perform
    parallelization procedures in created boost trees to generate branches independently.
    XGBoost utilizes a classification and regression tree (CART) ensemble to fit training
    data samples. Each CART has a corresponding autonomous decision rule for a binary
    tree, and the predicted score at each leaf node is derived from that rule. The
    split is complete when the gain is less than zero, and the CART structure is established
    after this point. The subsequent CART is built using the identical procedures
    as the previous one, and it uses the residual of the preceding tree as its training
    target. After that, the XGBoost model, which is comprised of all of the CARTs,
    can deliver the ultimate prediction outcome (Yan et al. 2020). The algorithm outputs
    the sum of the corresponding node values for a given input. 2. XGBoost Ensemble
    Tree (Extreme Gradient Boosting Ensemble Tree Linear Algorithm) Tianqi Chen is
    the one responsible for the development of the XGBoost. XGBoost Ensemble Tree
    is a powerful ML algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions.
    It is a supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used for both classification
    and regression tasks. The model builds an ensemble of decision trees iteratively,
    where each tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous trees. XGBoost
    uses a combination of the gradient descent and Newton''s method to optimize the
    loss function efficiently. One of the key advantages of XGBoost Ensemble Tree
    is its ability to handle high-dimensional and sparse data efficiently. The algorithm
    can also handle missing values and automatically select relevant features to improve
    the model''s performance. In the development of XGBoost, extensive consideration
    was given to both the principles of ML and the optimization of computer systems.
    Learning through ensembles involves compiling many predictors, each of which is
    a different model, to improve the predictions'' accuracy. This investigation used
    a tree ensemble to create ML models. Sahin (2020) evaluated the effectiveness
    of the XGBoost algorithm for mapping landslide susceptibility compared to gradient
    boosting and RF. They concluded that the XGBoost ensemble tree had the greatest
    predicting capacity. 3. Isotonic Regr Isotonic Regr problem can be expressed as
    a least-squares problem with order restrictions. Inventive efforts were made by
    Ayer et al. (1955), a thorough analysis may be found in Barlow & Brunk (1972).
    It fits a piecewise-constant non-decreasing (or non-increasing) function to the
    data such that the values of the fitted function are monotonically increasing
    (or decreasing) with respect to a single variable (Barlow & Brunk 1972). The pool-adjacent
    violators'' approach (PAVA) can be used to find the only solution to the basic
    Isotonic Regr problem (Best & Chakravarti 1990). Isotonic Regr is highly tempting
    from a model form perspective when monotonicity is an acceptable assumption, but
    other frequent assumptions, such as linearity or additivity, are not. It is a
    type of regression that reduces the quadratic form to its smallest possible value:
    with yi being the response variable, θi is a function of the predictors; θ must
    be isotonic, that is, θi < θj for all i < j; and wi is the weight for each data
    point. Isotronic regression has been employed for group testing data (Yuan et
    al. 2021) and risk assessment (Li et al. 2020), among other applications. Isotonic
    Regr has been used to analyze the relationship between plant biomass and environmental
    factors, such as temperature and precipitation (Franklin et al. 2016). This technique
    has not been evaluated earlier to simulate the hydrological variables. Thus, we
    have considered Isotonic Regr in the present investigation for daily ETo modeling.
    4. Polynomial Regr Polynomial Regr is a type of linear regression in which the
    relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is modeled
    as an nth-degree polynomial (Kim et al. 2022). It is a powerful and flexible non-parametric
    regression method that can fit a wide range of data patterns. The key advantage
    of Polynomial Regr is its ability to fit both linear and nonlinear relationships
    between the variables. The degree of the polynomial determines the flexibility
    of the model and can be chosen based on the complexity of the relationship between
    the variables. A generalized expression for Polynomial Regr is as follows: where
    k is the degree of the polynomial, and the degree of the polynomial is the order
    of the model. Polynomial Regr or its variants has been tested on different variables.
    For instance, Khoshravesh et al. (2017) have utilized multivariate fractional
    Polynomial Regr for studying the reference evapotranspiration. Hierarchical Polynomial
    Regr Models were applied to predict global-level covid transmission (Ekum & Ogunsanya
    2020). Model development Listen The PM model takes into account a variety of weather
    variables, including sunshine hour, air temperature (minimum and maximum), RH,
    and WS. Sunshine hour affects the energy available for evapotranspiration, while
    higher temperatures increase the rate of evapotranspiration. In contrast, RH reduces
    ETo, while increased WS can increase the rate by carrying more moisture away from
    the surface. Weather variable data record of 31 years (1990–2020) was obtained
    from the observatory available at the ICAR-IARI Institute. In order to develop
    ML models using limited data, it is essential to find the relationship between
    the ETo and the weather parameters. In this study, daily ETo was estimated using
    the REF-ET software. Therefore, cross-correlation analysis between the dependent
    (ETo) and independent variables (weather variables) was done to find the input
    variables having the best correlations with the daily ETo. The cross-correlation
    analysis was performed using XLSTAT 2022 free version as displayed in Table 2.
    According to Table 2, BSS has a positive correlation with PM ETo (0.546), indicating
    that more bright sunshine hours (BSS) are associated with higher ETo. WS also
    has a positive correlation with ETo (0.559), indicating that higher wind speeds
    are associated with higher potential evapotranspiration. Tmin has a strong positive
    correlation with Tmax (0.838), suggesting that the two variables increase together.
    Both Tmin and Tmax have a positive correlation with ETo (0.738 and 0.852, respectively),
    indicating that higher temperatures are associated with higher ETo. Also, the
    strong positive correlation between Tmin and Tmax (0.838) indicates that the two
    variables vary together and increase as the temperature rises during the day and
    decreases at night. On the other hand, RHavg has a negative correlation with PM
    ETo (−0.527), suggesting that higher RH is associated with lower ETo. This is
    because high levels of humidity indicate that the air is already saturated with
    moisture, making it more difficult for evaporation and transpiration to occur.
    The correlation Table 2 shows that BSS and WS have a weak positive correlation
    (0.145), suggesting that more BSS are associated with slightly higher wind speeds.
    These correlations highlight the importance of considering multiple weather variables
    when estimating ETo rates using the PM method. Table 2 Correlation matrix between
    independent and response variable Variables BSS WS Tmin Tmax RHavg PM ETo BSS  1  0.145  0.076  0.348  −0.489  0.546  WS  0.145  1  0.304  0.272  −0.182  0.559  Tmin  0.076  0.304  1  0.838  −0.118  0.738  Tmax  0.348  0.272  0.838  1  −0.466  0.852  RHavg  −0.489  −0.182  −0.118  −0.466  1  −0.527  PM
    ETo  0.546  0.559  0.738  0.852  −0.527  1  After listing the variables as per
    their correlation coefficient (r) values in decreasing order, the model formulation
    was proposed based on the number of variables scenarios. The first scenario (scenario
    1) was developed by considering only a single input variable for modeling daily
    ETo. It is visible from Table 2 that Tmax (daily maximum temperature) has the
    highest r (0.852) with ETo. Thus, Tmax was considered under scenario 1. Similarly,
    scenario 2 had two input variables, i.e., Tmax and Tmin (Daily minimum temperature),
    as the Tmin has the second-best r (0.738) with ETo. Likewise, under scenario 3,
    Tmax, Tmin, and WS variables were chosen to develop models. WS gave an r value
    of 0.559 with ETo. BSS have the fourth best r (0.546) with the ETo; thus, scenario
    4 was formed using Tmax, Tmin, WS, and BSS. In scenario 5, all five input variables
    were considered: Tmax, Tmin, WS, BSS, and RHavg (average RH). Average RH is negatively
    correlated (r = −0.527) with the ETo. All weather variables except RHavg showed
    a positive correlation daily ETo. Different models were developed for varying
    numbers of input variables in different scenarios, with each model being designated
    by a unique symbol. For instance, scenario S1 includes models M1–M4, scenario
    S2 has models M5–M8, scenario S3 includes models M9–M12, scenario S4 has models
    M13–M16, and scenario S5 includes models M17–M20. Table 3 shows the models developed
    and their input attributes under different scenarios. The process diagram for
    ML model development and evaluation for ETo modeling in the current study is shown
    in Figure 2. Table 3 Model development considering different input variable scenarios

    Tree, Polynomial Regr, and Isotonic Isotonic Regr algorithms was assessed using
    five generally used performance matrices to identify the best model for modeling
    daily ETo. These matrices are given in Table 4. Table 4 Performance criteria for

    model, and EToM is the modeled value. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Evaluation of developed
    models Listen In order to determine the optimal model for daily ETo modeling,
    various models were assessed under different input variable scenarios at IARI
    in New Delhi, India. The primary objective of the study was to identify the most
    effective algorithm that could be utilized as an alternative to the PM model,
    specifically under conditions of limited data availability. The modeling was conducted
    using the open-source software KNIME to develop ML models. Since the data did
    not contain any missing values, no further adjustments were made before the modeling
    process. The model performance indicators summary of the developed models for
    modeling daily ETo under data limitation scenario (S1–S4) is displayed in Tables
    5 and 6 during the training and testing phases. The performance of developed models,
    namely, XGBoost Linear, XGBoost Ensemble Tree regression (XGBoost Ensemble Tree),
    Polynomial Regr, and Isotonic Regr was assessed by estimating model performance
    criteria like r, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The results have been discussed under
    two segments, i.e., adequate data availability and limited data availability.

    dataset condition Listen Four different scenarios have been undertaken to assess
    the efficacy of the created models under data-limited conditions. These four scenarios
    are S1, S2, S3, and S4. Under scenario S1 (only Tmax as a predictive variable),
    the model ETo results indicated that all four developed models (M1–M4) showed
    a strong positive correlation with the ETo estimated using the PM model. When
    it comes to evaluating the accuracy of a model, the ideal values for mean squared
    error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean
    absolute percentage error (MAPE) are those that are close to or equal to zero.
    This implies that the predictions made by the model are very similar to the measured
    ETo values, indicating a higher level of accuracy. Therefore, a smaller MSE, RMSE,
    MAE, and MAPE indicate that the model is performing better in terms of prediction
    accuracy. However, the value of the correlation coefficient (r) can range from
    −1 to +1, where a value of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, a value
    of −1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and a value of 0 indicates no
    correlation between the variables. In general, a higher absolute value of ‘r’
    indicates a stronger correlation between the variables. Amongst all the models,
    model M2 reported the highest value of r (0.882) and lowest values for MAE, MSE,
    RMSE, and MAPE with values of 0.633 mm day−1, 0.654 mm day−1, 0.809 mm day−1,
    and 21.60%, while model M3 recorded the poorest values of the indices, namely,
    r, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE with values of 0.873, 0.662 mm day−1, 0.702 mm day−1,
    0.838 mm day−1, and 22.648%, respectively, during the model training phase. During
    the model testing phase, model M4 performed best than other models under scenario
    S1. Model M4 recorded the values of r, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE as 0.881, 0.625
    mm day−1, 0.637 mm day−1, 0.798 mm day−1, and 21.855%, respectively. Similarly,
    under scenario S2 (Tmax and Tmin). Similar results were obtained under scenario
    S2 and the model M8 emerged as the performing model for modeling daily ETo during
    the model testing phase. The model M10 outperformed other models under scenario
    S3 (Tmax, Tmin, and WS as predictor variables). The values of r, MAE, MSE, RMSE,
    and MAPE for model M10 were found as 0.965, 0.336 mm day−1, 0.199 mm day−1, 0.446
    mm day−1, and 11.337%, respectively, during the models training phase, while model
    M10 reported the best values of r, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE as 0.929, 0.470 mm
    day−1, 0.399 mm day−1, 0.632 mm day−1, and 15.340%, respectively, during the model
    testing period under scenario S3. The performance of the developed models under
    scenario S4 was superior to scenarios S1, S2, and S3. The model M14 reported the
    best values of the performance indices as 0.992, 0.161 mm day−1, 0.045 mm day−1,
    0.213 mm day−1, and 5.510% for r, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE, respectively, during
    model training and 0.986, 0.211 mm day−1, 0.085 mm day−1, 0.291 mm day−1, and
    7.115%, respectively, during the model testing phase. Results from Table 5 indicate
    that the performance of the Isotonic Regr models was the poorest under all the
    data limitation scenarios during the model training phase. Conversely, models
    M4 and M8 reported the best results under scenarios S1 and S2 during the model
    testing phase. Performance assessment criteria values for different models developed
    under considered scenarios have been given in Table 6. Under a single input scenario
    (S1), the XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm performed better than the remaining
    algorithms during the training period. However, during the testing period, the
    Isotonic Regr algorithm worked slightly better than the XGBoost Ensemble Tree
    as per the value of statistical performance indicators. The XGBoost Ensemble Tree
    and Isotonic Regr algorithms reported a value of r above 0.88, which shows a strong
    relationship between the PM estimated ETo and the modeled ETo. This demonstrates
    that in the absence of the other input weather variables, Tmax could be employed
    for modeling daily ETo. Under the S2 scenario, except the XGBoost Linear algorithm,
    XGBoost Ensemble Tree, Polynomial Regr, and the Isotonic Regr algorithms improved
    performance during the training period. The r value improved by 4.30, 0.45, and
    0.22% for the XGBoost Ensemble Tree, Polynomial Regr, and the Isotonic Regr algorithms,
    respectively. Similarly, the MAE improved by 1.25% for Isotonic Regr, 2.26 for
    Polynomial Regr and 18.16% for the XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm. The performance
    criteria MSE improved between 2.53 and 31.49%, and RMSE also showed improvement
    by 1.34–17.30%. Although for the XGBoost Linear algorithm, the MAPE showed improvement
    under scenario S2 from S1, all other performance criteria indicated a decrease
    during the model training period. During the testing of the algorithms under scenario
    S2, the performance of all the algorithms could have been better compared to the
    S1 scenario. The results indicated that the r value decreased from 0.34 to 2.59%.
    Similarly, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE confirmed the same. The MAE was reduced from
    3.04 to 6.99%, MSE between 6.01 and 16.72%, and RMSE from 2.98 to 8.13%. The MAPE
    also showed a slight decrease in the performance by the indicator''s value in
    the 0.44–0.90% range. It was seen from the results that the addition of Tmin (scenario
    S2) had reduced the capability of algorithms in modeling daily ETo. WS is considered
    one of the crucial factors in controlling daily ETo, particularly in semi-arid
    and arid climates (Dong et al. 2020). The performance of the algorithms was enhanced
    significantly under the S3 scenario compared to S1. The r improved in the range
    of 0.22–9.41%. Similarly, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE improved between 1.25 and 46.91%,
    1.94 and 69.57%, 0.97 and 44.87%, and 0.94 and 47.53%, respectively. The XGBoost
    EnsembleTree algorithm reported the most remarkable improvement in the statistical
    performance indicators values. It reported improvement in r, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and
    MAPE by 9.41, 46.91, 69.57, 44.87, and 47.53%, respectively. In contrast, the
    slightest improvement was reported by the Isotonic Regr algorithm, and its r,
    MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE improved by 0.22, 1.25, 1.94, 0.97, and 0.94%, respectively,
    during the training period. However, during the testing period, except for algorithm
    Isotonic Regr, all three algorithms showed a performance improvement compared
    to the S1 scenario. Likewise, the performance of the algorithms improved under
    the S4 scenario during the training period. The performance indicator r improved
    by 12.97, 12.47, 11.11, and 0.11% for XGBoost Linear, XGBoost Ensemble Tree, Polynomial
    Regr, and Isotonic Regr compared to the S1 scenario. Likewise, other performance
    indicators (MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE) showed improvement. During testing, the
    Isotonic Regr reported a decrease in performance, and the remaining algorithm
    improved its performance. The value of MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE improved compared
    to the S1 scenario. The MAE improved from 43.75 to 61.92%, MSE from 68.27 to 83.79,
    RMSE from 43.65 to 59.70%, and MAPE from 41.85 to 63.15%. Under scenario S4, all
    the input weather variables are considered to develop a model for daily ETo modeling.
    The scatter diagrams of the ML model''s performance compared to the PM model for
    daily ETo modeling under different input limitation scenarios are displayed in
    Figure 3. S5 is displayed in Figure 3. It is clear from Figure 3 that daily ETo
    values obtained using the XGBoost Tree Ensemble model are lying around the best-fit
    line (1:1 line) during training and testing phases, while the ETo modeled using
    other algorithms had been spread sparsely. The performance of the XGBoost Tree
    Ensemble had improved during the testing phase as reflected by the improvement
    in the coefficient of determination (R2) (Lama et al. 2021) value. Among all the
    model''s developed under data limitation scenarios (S1–S4), the best performance
    was obtained in the S4 scenario. However, the performance of the Isotonic Regr
    algorithm had reduced with the increase in the input number of variables. Figure

    different input limitation scenarios (S1–S4). The R2 values for models M13, M14,
    M15, and M16 were computed during the training and testing periods to evaluate
    their performance in estimating the target variable. For the training period,
    model M14 displayed the highest R2 value of 0.984, indicating that it could explain
    98.4% of the variance in the target variable. Model M13 had the second-highest
    R2 value of 0.900, followed by M15 with an R2 of 0.941. Model M16 had the lowest
    R2 value of 0.774, suggesting that it was not as effective as the other models
    in explaining the variability in the target variable during the training period.
    During the testing period, model M14 still had the highest R2 value of 0.964,
    indicating that it performed consistently well in estimating the target variable.
    Model M15 also had a high R2 value of 0.943, suggesting that it was reliable in
    predicting the target variable during the testing period. Model M13 showed an
    improved R2 value of 0.914 during the testing period, indicating that it had a
    better performance than during the training period. Model M16, however, had the
    lowest R2 value of 0.772 during the testing period, indicating that it was not
    as effective as the other models in predicting the target variable. Full dataset

    phase. The model M18 reported a value of R2 as 0.971. Likewise, models M17, M19,
    and M20 gave R2 values of 0.925, 0.947, and 0.768, respectively. Figure 4 VIEW

    Compared to the S1 scenario, the performance of all the algorithms improved under
    the S5 scenario during the training stage. The performance indicator r improved
    by 12.40, 12.81, 11.34, and 0.22% for the XGBoost Linear, XGBoost Ensemble Tree,
    Polynomial Regr, and Isotonic Regr algorithms. The MAE also reported an improvement
    of 15.72, 79.77, 51.81, and 2.03% for the XGBoost Linear, XGBoost Ensemble Tree,
    Polynomial Regr, and Isotonic Regr algorithms. Similarly, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE
    also improved by 74.97, 50, and 46.59%, respectively, for the XGBoost Linear algorithm.
    Likewise, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE also improved by 95.41, 78.49, and 78.87%, respectively,
    for the XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm. The Isotonic Regr regression showed a
    slight improvement in MSE, RMSE, and MAPE values by 4.02, 2.07, and 1.18%, respectively.
    The performance of the Polynomial Regr algorithm under the S5 scenario improved
    by 77.63, 52.74, and 45.55% for MSE, RMSE, and MAPE, respectively. During the
    testing of the algorithms under the S5 scenario, the performance was improved
    for XGBoost Linear, XGBoost Ensemble Tree, and Polynomial Regr compared to the
    S1 scenario. But, the Isotonic Regr algorithm showed a decline in its performance
    to model daily ETo. The change in the performance indicators values for the best
    scenario (S5) compared to the S1 scenario is displayed in Figure 6. Also, the
    box plots of the models during the training and testing period for the full dataset
    scenario are displayed in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. The daily ETo data points
    displayed over the box plots show that there were few outliners using all algorithms
    (except XGBoost where the mean (black colored line) and the median line (red colored
    line) both coincide). Figure 6 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Change in the performance

    We have also used the Taylor diagram to visualize the performance of the models,
    as displayed in Figures 9 and 10, for the model training and testing phase for
    the full dataset scenario (S5). It is viewed from Figure 9 that model M18 (XGBoost
    Tree Ensemble) is placed nearest to the PM model. The standard deviation (σ) and
    correlation coefficient (r) value of the M18 model is closest to the σ and r of
    the PM model during the model training phase. Conversely, model M20 is placed
    farthest from the PM model and reported the poorest performance in modeling daily
    ETo. Similarly, during the model testing phase, the M18 model showed the least
    distance from the reference PM model, while, the M20 model gave the most significant
    distance from the PM model. Taylor diagrams have been utilized in previous studies
    for reference evapotranspiration (Elbeltagi et al. 2022; Kushwaha et al. 2022),
    evaporation (Kushwaha et al. 2021), water quality indices (Dimple et al. 2022a,
    2023), and water temperature forecasting (Vishwakarma et al. 2022). Figure 9 VIEW

    model performance during training period for full dataset scenario. In addition,
    radar diagrams were also plotted to compare the modeling results as displayed
    in Figures 11 and 12 for the model training and testing phase. Various researchers
    have graphically compared different models using radar diagrams in modeling water
    temperature (Vishwakarma et al. 2022), evaporation (Kushwaha et al. 2021), and
    water quality indices (Dimple et al. 2022a). It can be seen from Figures 11 and
    12 that model M18 (XGBoost Tree Ensemble) gave a higher value of the correlation
    coefficient and lower values of the error prediction indicators, namely, MSE,
    MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. In contrast, the model M20 (Linear tree) gave the lowest
    value of the r and a higher value of the prediction indicators. The radar diagrams
    have been plotted for the best model performance scenario, i.e., under full dataset
    conditions (S5). Figure 11 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Radar diagram for model performance
    during training period for full dataset scenario. Figure 12 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Radar diagram for model performance during testing period for full dataset
    scenario. Model ranking Listen To assess the capability of applied algorithms,
    the ranking of the developed models under limited dataset and full dataset conditions
    was carried out by the relative performance of models concerning various performance
    measures like r, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE. Then, the average rank of the developed
    models was obtained. The ranking of the models is displayed in Figure 13 by plotting
    the heatmap. It is seen from Figure 13 that model M18 was found to be the best
    in modeling daily ETo. At the same time, model M5 was the worst for daily ETo
    modeling. Therefore, the XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm may be utilized to model
    daily ETo in semi-arid climatic conditions. It is also visible from Figure 13
    that the performance of the algorithms had bettered by increasing predictive variables
    for daily ETo modeling. In Figure 13, some models performed equally with others
    and therefore ranked the same. Figure 13 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Ranking of the
    models under full dataset scenario (S5). Comparison with previous study findings
    Listen Water is a finite renewable resource and must be managed smartly to sustain
    life on Earth. As a principal constituent of the water cycle, evapotranspiration
    is essential in water resource availability in a specific climate. The accurate
    estimation of reference evapotranspiration has always been a major challenge due
    to its complex nature. Many empirical equations have been developed for their
    estimation, but due to their regional validity, more efforts are being made to
    develop a better framework. Advancements in artificial intelligence, communication
    technologies, and soft computing algorithms are spreading their applications to
    almost every field for resource optimization and future predictions. Also, the
    usability of the FAO-recommended PM model is subject to the availability of significant
    weather parameters, which is usually not available in developing countries and
    quite tricky in ungauged study regions. Therefore, in this investigation, we have
    attempted to evaluate the efficacy of four ML algorithms, namely, XGBoost Linear,
    XGBoost Ensemble Tree, Polynomial Regr, and Isotonic Regr for modeling daily reference
    evapotranspiration under limited meteorological variables scenario. The effectiveness
    of the soft computing approaches kNN and ANN models for predicting daily ETo utilizing
    four combos of climate data in the Middle East. Anatolia region, Turkey, was evaluated.
    They investigated four different combinations of meteorological characteristics
    as input variables. The findings show that the kNN performed significantly superior
    to the ANN across all possible configurations. In the testing subset, the kNN
    model''s statistical indicators revealed ETo values with MSE, RMSE, MAE, MSE,
    and R2 ranging from 0.541 to 0.031 mm day−1, 0.735 to 0.175 mm day−1, 0.5470.124
    mm day−1, 0.937 to 0.997, and 0.900 to 0.994, respectively. Additionally, the
    model''s RMSE ranged from 0.547 to 0.031 mm day-1. Consequently, the kNN can be
    employed for the forecasting ETo using complete and limited input weather information
    (Yamaç 2021). In contrast, the performance of the ANN was found to be better than
    the KNN in forecasting daily ETo in India. They reported that the best ANN model
    outperformed the KNN models with MAE, MSE, r, MAPE, and IOA (d) values of 0.075,
    0.018, 0.997, 2.76%, and 0.974, respectively, during training and 0.091, 0.053,
    0.984, 3.16%, and 0.969, respectively, during testing of the models (Rajput et
    al. 2022b). The applicability of the ANN, RF, SVM, and MLR algorithms was tested
    to estimate monthly ETo for the Minas Gerais region under different input data
    combinations and scenarios. They concluded that the ANN and RF performed better
    in ETo estimating under full dataset conditions. Additionally, in cases where
    just air temperature and RH data are available, the SVM and MLR models are recommended
    for all scenarios (Santos et al. 2022). Yildirim et al. (2023) assessed the feasibility
    and effectiveness of three ML techniques for daily ETo estimation in Türkiye.
    The three techniques under investigation were the KNN, multigene genetic programming,
    and SVR. Out of the three ML techniques evaluated, the SVR model exhibited the
    best performance in determining ETo, with performance indices of R2 = 0.961, RMSE
    = 0.327 mm, and MAE = 0.232 mm. The input variables used for the SVR model were
    solar radiation, temperature, and RH. This study further confirms that the under
    data limitation scenario, lesser weather could be a choice to efficiently estimate
    ETo. Besides, ETo estimation using limitation data, Aghelpour et al. (2022) have
    applied ML techniques to estimate rice crop evapotranspiration in rice cultivation
    regions, in Iran and concluded that models showed the most accurate performances
    in the input combination of four climatic variables: sunshine duration, maximum
    temperature, RH, and WS. Similarly, Yamaç & Todorovic (2020) evaluated the efficacy
    of three distinct models, namely kNN, ANN, and AdaBoost, in predicting daily potato
    crop evapotranspiration in Southern Italy. The model''s performance was assessed
    based on four scenarios of available meteorological data. The scenarios included:
    scenario 1, which considered only air temperature, scenario 2, which included
    air temperature and solar radiation, scenario 3, which included air temperature,
    solar radiation, and WS, and scenario 4, which encompassed air temperature, solar
    radiation, WS, and RH. Results showed that the kNN model demonstrated the best
    performance with impressive evaluation metrics across all three scenarios. The
    model achieved R2 values of 0.813, 0.968, and 0.965, regression slopes of 0.947,
    0.980, and 0.991, and modeling efficiency (EF) of 0.848, 0.970, and 0.972. Additionally,
    the kNN model exhibited low RMSE of 0.790, 0.351, and 0.355 mm day−1, MAE of 0.563,
    0.263, and 0.274 mm day−1, and MSE of 0.623, 0.123, and 0.126 mm day−1 for scenarios
    1, 2, and 3, respectively. However, it is concluded that the ANN performed better
    than the ANN under full dataset conditions. Our study also found that the performance
    of the models increased with increasing the number of input variables. Similarly,
    Sammen et al. (2023) evaluated the performance of SVM, RF, Bagged trees algorithm
    (BaT), and Boosting trees algorithm (BoT) in Hemren catchment basin, Iraq to estimate
    ETo. Results indicated that the RF method showed the highest accuracy, especially
    when using inputs such as Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, and solar radiation (SR). The BaT
    and BoT methods also performed well, while the SVM method displayed the lowest
    accuracy. However, in some cases, the first input scenario (Tmax, Tmin, Tmean,
    SR, WS, and RH) yielded marginally better results than the second input scenario
    (Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, and SR). The feasibility of four ML models, including ELM,
    generalized linear regression (GR), and SVR, for predicting daily ETo in New Mexico
    was done (Mokari et al. 2022). They developed four limited data scenarios and
    selected six weather observatory sites in various climate zones. The results demonstrated
    that the projected daily ETo varied significantly throughout distinct climatic
    regions based on the ML model kinds and inputs scenarios, concluding that the
    models worked best under conditions of complete datasets (Mokari et al. 2022).
    Field estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) has always accompanied numerous problems,
    prompting investigators to discover a technique to remotely assess this constituent
    in horticultural and agricultural domains. Daily rice crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) was estimated utilizing techniques such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
    Radial Basis Function (RBF), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and
    Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), along with the fewest climatic variables
    that are currently available in Iran. According to the findings, the models provided
    the most accurate performances when given the input combination of four environmental
    factors: the amount of sunshine, the highest temperature, the RH, and the WS.
    A comparison among the models revealed that the GMDH model outperformed its counterparts
    (Aghelpour et al. 2022). To estimate daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
    using limited meteorological data in the Northeast plain of China, deep learning
    methods (DL), including deep neural networks (DNN), temporal convolution neural
    networks (TCN), and long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) were created.
    When temperature-based features were available, the TCN and LSTM models did much
    better than temperature-based empirical models outside the study areas. When radiation-based
    or humidity-based features were accessible, all of the suggested DL and classical
    machine learning (CML) models did best than radiation-based or humidity-based
    empirical equations outside of the study areas in which they were trained (Chen
    et al. 2020). In another study by Reis et al. (2019), the adaptability of the
    HS, ANN, and MLR ELM models were assessed to predict ETo using temperature data
    from the Verde Grande River basin in southeastern Brazil. Compared to the original
    and modified HS models, the ANN and ELM and the MLR model proved superior. The
    modeling of ETo based on a single meteorological parameter would be advantageous
    in locations where collecting climatic parameter data is difficult. A DNN architecture
    that uses RF and XGBoost ML techniques in California to forecast daily ETo with
    a single input parameter. The performance evaluation of the constructed models
    demonstrated that DNN-Ret beat XGB-Ret and RF-Ret irrespective of the data. The
    DNN-Ret gave coefficients of determination (R2) ranging from 0.914 to 0.954 in
    the local scenario, with an average drop of 8–9.5% in MAE and RMSE, and an improvement
    of 2.6–2.9% in Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and 1.7–2% gain R2 (Ravindran et al.
    2021). Our results also confirm that ETo can be estimated satisfactorily using
    a single input parameter under data limitation conditions. The ability of several
    modern computing tools and approaches, such as decision trees, RF, AdaBoost, Gradient
    Boosting Machines (GBM), and (v) Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), was evaluated
    and compared to determine how well they can estimate daily P-M ETo in Bengaluru,
    Karnataka, India. They concluded that the XGBosst algorithm could efficiently
    estimate ETo with fewer input variables, unlike the FAO-PM model, which requires
    a large number of weather parameters for daily ETo estimation. Our study also
    concludes that the XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm was found best in modeling
    daily ETo. Authors Yu et al. (2020) utilized the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
    algorithm to optimize the parameters of XGBoost in predicting ETo under greenhouse
    conditions in Xiaotangshan Town, Changping District, Beijing, China. They concluded
    that the accuracy of the algorithms has reduced under data-limited conditions
    but could be utilized when data are scarce. We also obtained a similar trend in
    the performance of the XGBoost Ensemble Tree under the data scarcity scenario.
    Various global researchers have evaluated the applicability of the various regression
    techniques. Khoshravesh et al. (2017) assessed the applicability of multivariate
    fractional polynomial, Bayesian regression, and robust regression models in three
    arid environments in Iran to estimate the monthly ETo. They found that the multivariate
    fractional polynomial (MFP) model gives better estimates than the other two models
    for ETo estimation at all stations. In contrast, compared to the Isotonic Regr
    algorithm in our study, the Polynomial Regr algorithm performed poorly during
    the training and testing period under all the input scenarios. The Polynomial
    Regr performed better than the MLR in modeling daily ETo considering all limited
    and full datasets as input as well as at different time scales (daily/monthly
    and annually) in South Korea (Kim et al. 2022). However, studies were only found
    using the Isotonic Regr for daily ETo modeling. Overall, we conclude that the
    XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm was outstanding in predicting daily ETo under
    semi-arid climatic conditions of New Delhi. It performed superior over the algorithms
    under full and limited dataset conditions. CONCLUSIONS Listen Accurately estimating
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is crucial but challenging due to its dependence
    on multiple parameters. Various techniques have been developed to quantify ETo
    as accurately as possible. The standard Penman–Monteith model is commonly used
    to estimate ETo, but it requires a significant number of meteorological inputs.
    Therefore, it is desirable to develop models that require fewer meteorological
    parameters for daily ETo modeling. This study evaluated the potential of four
    ML algorithms under limited and full dataset conditions. The findings suggest
    that the XGBoost Ensemble Tree models performed the best under both full and limited
    dataset scenarios. The XGBoost Ensemble Tree model M18 produced the most accurate
    results for daily ET0 estimation under the optimal scenario (S5), with the highest
    correlation coefficient (r) of 0.986, and the lowest MAE of 0.211 mm day−1, MSE
    of 0.085 mm day−1, RMSE of 0.291 mm day−1, and MAPE of 7.115%. Thus, it is recommended
    to use the XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm for daily ETo modeling for better results,
    particularly in semi-arid climatic conditions. This recommendation is significant
    for the estimation of PM ETo in real-time water management, which allows for an
    irrigation water supply that is ‘on-demand,’ potentially improving total irrigation
    efficiency in major irrigation projects. Machine learning has limitations in estimating
    ETo, such as the dependence on input data quality and quantity, difficulty in
    interpreting results, the need for large amounts of training data, and sensitivity
    to algorithm and parameter selection. These limitations should be considered when
    applying machine learning for ETo estimation. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Listen The authors

    Abstract\nWheat plays a vital role in the food security of society, and early\
    \ estimation of its yield will be a great help to macro-decisions. \nFor this\
    \ purpose, wheat yield and water productivity (WP) by considering soil data, irrigation,\
    \ fertilizer, climate, and crop \ncharacteristics and using a novel hybrid approach\
    \ called hazelnut tree search algorithm (HTS) and extreme machine learn-\ning\
    \ method (ELM) was examined under the drip (tape) irrigation. A dataset including\
    \ 125 wheat yield data, irrigation and \nmeteorological data of Mahabad plain\
    \ located southeast of Lake Urmia, Iran, was used as input parameters for crop\
    \ year \n2020–2021. Eighty percentage of the data were used for training, and\
    \ the remaining 20% for model testing. Nine different \ninput scenarios were presented\
    \ to estimate yield and WP. The efficiency of the proposed model was calculated\
    \ with the \nstatistical indices coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square\
    \ error (RMSE), normalized root-mean-square error, \nand efficiency criterion.\
    \ Sensitivity analysis result showed that the parameters of irrigation, rainfall,\
    \ soil moisture, and crop \nvariety provide better results for modeling. There\
    \ was good agreement between the practical values (field management data) \nand\
    \ the estimated values with the HTS–ELM model. The results also showed that the\
    \ HTS–ELM method is very efficient in \nselecting the best input combination with\
    \ R2 = 0.985 and RMSE = 0.005. In general, intelligent hybrid methods can enable\
    \ \noptimal and economical use of water and soil resources.\nKeywords Drip (tape)\

    Introduction\nIran is located in one of the arid regions of the world, and \n\
    due to low annual rainfall, its water resources are declining \n(Ghazvinian et al.\
    \ 2021; Dehghanipour et al. 2021). In Iran, \nthe agricultural sector accounts\
    \ for the majority of total water \nconsumption, which can be saved by improving\
    \ applied water \nmanagement and water productivity (WP). Accurate estima-\ntion\
    \ of WP and crop yield is one of the most basic information \nto improve applied\
    \ water management (Aliasgharzadeh and \nSanainejad 2006; Khoshnavaz et al. 2016).\
    \ Increasing demand \nfor agricultural products and challenges in obtaining field\
    \ data \npoint to the need to use appropriate models to estimate WP \nand crop\
    \ yield. Computer models have made it possible to \nanalyze different management\
    \ strategies (Bagheri et al. 2012a, \nb; Ghanizadeh et al. 2022; Fakharian et al.\
    \ 2023). Most of \nthese models require input parameters that are difficult to\
    \ \naccess or require significant time and cost. For this purpose, \nartificial\
    \ neural networks and meta-heuristic algorithms are \nconsidered superior options\
    \ (Shirdeli and Tavassoli 2015; \nNaderpour et al. 2020a, b; Rezazadeh Eidgahee\
    \ et al. 2022). \nThese models can predict changes in Intended variables with\
    \ \nminimal measurement parameters and acceptable accuracy. \nSince wheat plays\
    \ a crucial role in food security, predicting \npre-harvest wheat production provides\
    \ ample time to deal \nwith food shortages (Dehghanisanij et al. 2021, Emami et al.\
    \ \n2019). To predict crop yield, it is necessary to identify yield-\nlimiting\
    \ factors. Grain yield when water is a yield constraint is \na function of the\
    \ amount of water available to the plant, water \nuse efficiency, and individual\
    \ yield. Grain yield (when water \n * Hossein Dehghanisanij \n \nh.dehghanisanij@areeo.ac.ir\n\

    \ and specific gravity (Greaves \nand Wang 2017; Silva et al. 2020; Dehghanisanij\
    \ et al. 2022). \nNowadays, crop simulation models are proposed as a multi-\n\
    purpose tool in agricultural research and management. There \nare different yield\
    \ prediction models, one of the most common \nand straightforward of which is\
    \ experimental regression mod-\nels (Murthy 2004; Oteng-Darko et al. 2013; Chlingaryan\
    \ et al. \n2018; Fan et al. 2022). Researchers have evaluated the yield \nand\
    \ WUE in orchards according to irrigation management \nand different surface irrigation\
    \ methods (Zhang et al. 2005; \nKaul et al. 2005; Alvarez 2009; Gonzalez-Sanchez\
    \ et al. 2014; \nMatsumura et al. 2015). Chipanshi et al. (1999), by examining\
    \ \nthe limiting factors of dryland wheat growth, showed that the \namount of\
    \ soil moisture during vegetative growth and cluster \ngrowth is the most crucial\
    \ determinant of dryland spring wheat \nyield. Farajzadeh (2000) predicted the\
    \ dryland wheat yield \nusing regression models in Urmia, Iran, and reported that\
    \ rain-\nfall during the growing season and full frost days are the most \ncritical\
    \ factors determining the dryland wheat yield. Tatari \net al. (2008) studied\
    \ the dryland wheat yield in the Khorasan \nregion, Iran, using an experimental\
    \ regression model and con-\ncluded the dryland wheat yield could be estimated\
    \ only with \nacceptable accuracy based on rainfall factors. Gu et al. (2017)\
    \ \nused a genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network \n(GA-BP) to predict\
    \ corn yield under subsurface drip irriga-\ntion. The results showed that the\
    \ GA-BP model provided more \naccurate predictions. Abrougui et al. (2019) predicted\
    \ organic \npotato yield using tillage systems and soil properties by an \nartificial\
    \ neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regres-\nsion (MLR) and concluded that\
    \ the MLR model estimated \ncrop yield more accurately than the ANN model. Emami\
    \ et al. \n(2019) estimated barley yield using radial basis function (RBF) \n\
    and feed-forward neural (GFF) models in Torbat Heydariyeh, \nlocated in southeastern\
    \ Iran. The results showed that the RBF \nmodel with the input parameter of irrigation\
    \ water levels could \nbetter estimate the barley yield. Chen et al. (2020) evaluated\
    \ a \nnew irrigation decision support system (DSS) for improving \nWP and cotton\
    \ yield in an arid climate. The results showed \nthat the implementation of DSS\
    \ increased WP and cotton seed \nyield by 20% and 32%, respectively, compared\
    \ to the soil mois-\nture sensor method. Naderpour et al. (2020a, b) introduced\
    \ a \nnew approach based on the group method of data handling to \nestimate the\
    \ moment capacity of ferrocement members. The \nresults showed that the GMDH model\
    \ was ideally successful \nin estimating the moment capacity of ferrocement members.\
    \ \nShi et al. (2021) presented a crop growth model to investigate \ncrop yield\
    \ and WUE. The results showed that the presented \nmodel increased the WUE during\
    \ the growth stages. Sharifi \n(2021) proved that the Gaussian process regression\
    \ algorithm \nhas the best performance in estimating barley yield. Prasad \net al.\
    \ (2021) used the random forest algorithm for estimating \ncotton crops at the\
    \ regional level. The results indicated that \nthe RF model had a high potential\
    \ in predicting crop yield. \nDehghanisanij et al. (2021) reported that irrigation-fertilizer\
    \ \nand crop variety parameters are the most influential param-\neters in estimating\
    \ the yield and water productivity of tomato \ncrops. Eidgahee (2022) developed\
    \ predictive models based \non machine learning, using artificial neural networks\
    \ (ANN), \ngenetic programming (GP), and data handling combined group \nmethod\
    \ (GMDH-Combi), for the dynamic module. The results \nshowed that the ANN model\
    \ is more accurate compared to \nthe developed models based on GMDH and GP. Shada\
    \ \net al. (2022) used a hybrid wavelet-support vector machine \n(WSVM) model\
    \ to predict the hourly flood of the Achankovil \nriver in India. The results\
    \ showed the acceptable efficiency \nof the WSVM model in flood prediction. Haque\
    \ and Matin \n(2022) investigated the change in the Jamuna river shoreline \n\
    using a multi-variate regression approach and reported that this \nmodel is effective\
    \ in predicting lateral erosion.\nPolicymakers and managers need facts about WP\
    \ and \ncrop yield at different scales to devise appropriate manage-\nment strategies.\
    \ Estimating WP and crop yield is difficult \nand costly due to the scarcity of\
    \ sufficient field details. Intel-\nligent methods have high flexibility and can\
    \ change the input \nparameters and select the most optimal parameters. Due to\
    \ \nthe need to replace complex crop models in evaluating yield \nand WP with\
    \ simpler statistical models and limited previ-\nous studies, this study aims\
    \ to present a model based on the \nhazelnut tree search algorithm (HTS) and extreme\
    \ machine \nlearning method (ELM) for estimating WP and wheat yield \nunder the\
    \ Lake Urmia basin. This study also presents the \ndetermining parameters in WP\
    \ and yield and introduces the \nmost effective ones. The contributions of this\
    \ article are as \nfollows:\n• Drip (tape) irrigation (DTI), sprinkler irrigation\
    \ (SI), \nand basin irrigation (BI) methods are considered, and \nthe superior\
    \ irrigation method is selected.\n• Yield and WP factors are estimated using field\
    \ results of \nthe DTI method.\n• A hybrid approach called HTS–ELM is presented\
    \ for \nestimating yield and WP.\n• The HTS–ELM approach is evaluated on the collected\
    \ \ndataset, and its results are compared with previous intel-\nligent methods.\n\
    Materials and methods\nStudy area\nThis research was carried out in Mahabad plain\
    \ in the \nsoutheast of Lake Urmia in the 2020–2021 crop year. \nMahabad’s geographic\
    \ coordinates are 45°  43′  N, \n36° 46′ E, and its altitude is 1320 m above sea\
    \ level. The \nApplied Water Science (2023) 13:61 \n1 3\nPage 3 of 16 \n61\naverage\
    \ annual rainfall is 413 mm and the average humid-\nity is 53%. The average annual\
    \ temperature and minimum \ntemperatures are 12.8 °C and 6.7 °C, respectively.\
    \ The \naverage number of freezing days is 84 days. The average \nannual evaporation\
    \ from the pan is 1860 mm, and the aver-\nage evaporation from the free surface\
    \ is 1560 mm (Bah-\nramzadeh 2015). Mahabad plain has relatively prosperous \n\
    agriculture with an irrigation and drainage network and \npotential lands. The\
    \ main products of this plain include \nwheat, barley, sugar beet, alfalfa, oilseeds,\
    \ tomatoes, \nweeds, vegetables, potatoes, apple orchards, peaches, \nnectarines,\
    \ and grapes. Figure 1 shows the geographical \nlocation of the study area and\
    \ selected farms.\nDescription of treatments\nTwo wheat cultivated farms (F1 and\
    \ F2) were selected in the \nstudy area under farmers’ management. Pishgam and\
    \ Mihan \nwheat varieties were used in F1 and F2 farms, respectively. \nThe selected\
    \ farms were part of a regional project conducted \nby the Agricultural Engineering\
    \ Research Institute (AERI) \nduring the 2020–2021 crop growing season in the\
    \ Lake \nUrmia basin to encourage farmers to decrease applied water \nwhile the\
    \ yield is constant or improved. In the AERI pro-\nject, different technologies\
    \ were transferred to the farmers \nand farmers' knowledge improved accordingly.\
    \ The impact \nof transferred technology was studied using on-farm and \nFig.\

    \ experimen-\ntal treatments for irrigation management were considered, \nincluding\
    \ drip (tape) irrigation (DTI) and sprinkler irrigation \n(SI) in F1 and basin\
    \ irrigation (BI) in F2 farms. The emit-\nter's discharge under 1 bar pressure\
    \ was ranging between \n1.1 and 1.8 l/h in DTI, and that was 0.71 l/s for sprinklers\
    \ \nin SI under 4 bar pressure. The distance between the drip \n(tape) lines was\
    \ 20 cm, and the sprinkler array in SI was \n15 m*18 m. The volume of applied\
    \ water into each treatment \nwas measured using a calibrated volumetric flow\
    \ meter. The \nfirst irrigation water was applied to the DTI using the basin \n\
    irrigation method to ensure crop growth and establishment.\nThe chemical and physical\
    \ factors of soil and water are \npresented in Table 1. A sampling of disturbed\
    \ and undis-\nturbed soil was performed to determine physical and \nchemical properties,\
    \ soil texture, pH, saturated moisture, \nfield capacity, and permanent wilting\
    \ point of 0–30 cm and \n30–60 cm. The root zone depth of farms F1 and F2 was\
    \ \nassumed to be 60 cm. Soil bulk density and soil texture were \nmeasured by\
    \ cylindrical and hydrometric methods, respec-\ntively. The data in Table 1 were\
    \ used to handle the irrigation \nschedule. The selected farms represent two different\
    \ farms \nsituation in the situation. The water quality in F1 is more \nsaline\
    \ but the soil type is lighter which causes salinity to \nwash out from the soil.\
    \ OC and soil pH which are impor-\ntant for production are almost similar to other\
    \ farms (https:// \nzoom. earth/# view= 36. 77904 7,45. 68245 ,10z/ map= live).\n\
    The studied area does not have spatial diversity and all \ntreatments in F1 and\
    \ F2 farms have the same soil texture. \nThe soil survey and harvest calendar\
    \ are shown in Table 2.\nThe number of irrigation events in DTI, SI, and BI treat-\n\
    ments was 9, 6, and 3, respectively. The irrigation date and \nvolume of applied\
    \ water in each treatment are presented in \nTable 3. Wheat rows were spaced 0.03 m\
    \ apart with an in-\nrow spacing of 0.11 m between plants, which accommo-\ndates\
    \ 303 plants (per 1  m2). Planting and harvesting of wheat \ncrops on both farms\

    Soil moisture was measured by a gravimetric method on \nboth farms and at least\
    \ three points on the farms (beginning, \nmiddle, and end).\nUniformity coefficient\n\
    To calculate uniformity, the distances of emitters and sprin-\nklers were divided\
    \ into several cells as 0.2 m*0.4 m and \n15 m*18 m, respectively. A water collection\
    \ can be placed \nin each cell to drain the droplets from the drippers and sprin-\n\

    \ After one hour of emitters and \nsprinklers work, water depth in cans was measured\
    \ using a \ngraduated cylinder. The uniformity coefficient was calcu-\nlated as\

    \ methods\nDrip (tape) irrigation\nDrip (tape) irrigation (DTI) is one of the\
    \ drip irrigation \nequipment with a thinner wall than drip tubes. In the DTI\
    \ \nmethod, water is applied to the ground near the crop root \nzone to wet a\
    \ small area and depth from the soil surface \n(Dong et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2023).\n\
    Sprinkler irrigation\nSprinkler irrigation (SI) is a method in which water is\
    \ dis-\ntributed as rain on the ground. The SI method passes the \nwater required\
    \ for agriculture through a series of pipes using \npumping. The sprinkler system\
    \ gives the water needed for \nagriculture through a series of lines using pumping\
    \ and falls \nto the ground by sprinklers (Solgi et al. 2022).\nBasin irrigation\n\
    The Basin irrigation method (BI) is the simplest surface irri-\ngation method\
    \ used to irrigate all crops. In the BI method, \nthe farm needs to be divided\
    \ into plots with specific dimen-\nsions, and the slope of the farm is less than\
    \ 1% (Pramanik \net al. 2022; Ali Shah et al. 2022).\nHazelnut tree search (HTS)\
    \ algorithm\nHazelnut tree search (HTS) is a multi-agent algorithm that \nprovides\
    \ the process of finding the most optimal hazelnut \ntree in a forest (Emami 2021).\
    \ This algorithm has three \noperators: growth, fruit dispersion, and root dispersion.\
    \ This \nalgorithm starts with an initial population. In the growth \nstage, the\
    \ effect of trees on each other in competition for \nshared resources is calculated.\
    \ The algorithm in the fruit \nscattering phase examines the search space to find\
    \ promis-\ning solutions beyond the current area. In the root propaga-\ntion stage,\
    \ an irregular local search is performed around the \ntrees to exploit the optimal\
    \ solutions. The growth stage, fruit \ndispersion, and root expansion are applied\
    \ to the population \nseveral times to create the conditions for achieving the\
    \ most \noptimal hazelnut tree in a forest (Emami 2021). Figure 2 \nshows the\
    \ flowchart of the HTS algorithm.\nExtreme learning machine (ELM)\nThe extreme\
    \ learning machine (ELM) method generalizes \nsingle-layer backpropagation networks\
    \ (Hu et al. 2022). \nUnlike conventional learning methods, the ELM randomly \n\
    selects the input weights and biases of hidden layer neurons \nand can generate\
    \ these parameters before viewing the learn-\ning data. The ELM neural network\
    \ is a generalized single \nhidden layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) (Wang\
    \ \net al. 2014; Hu et al. 2022). Figure 3 shows the structure \nof SLFN.\nSLFN\
    \ is formulated as follows (Tian et al. 2022; Hu et al. \n2022):\nwhere Vj shows\

    HTS–ELM model\nThe parameters and structure of the ELM model need to \nbe adapted\

    using the HTS algorithm. HTS algorithm was compared \nwith evolutionary algorithms,\

    \ 85 and 90%; acceptable up to \n65% and unacceptable, below 65%. Little et al.\
    \ (1993) sug-\ngested a classification of uniformity of a sprinkler irrigation\
    \ \nsystem as very good, good, poor, and worse if the uniformity \ncoefficient\
    \ (CU) value equals 90%, between 80 and 89%, \nbetween 70 and 79%, and 78% to\
    \ be the minimum accept-\nable performance level for economic system design. The\
    \ \naverage irrigation depth in DTI, SI, and BI treatments was \n27.37 mm, 55.22 mm,\
    \ and 142.20 mm, respectively, which \nindicates a reduction of 50% and 80% of\
    \ irrigation depth \nin treatment DTI, respectively. Under DTI treatment, water\
    \ \nloss due to evaporation and deep infiltration was mainly less \nthan in SI\
    \ and BI treatments. The low AE in BI and SI treat-\nments shows the tendency\
    \ of the farmer to over-irrigate. One \nof the reasons for low AE in treatment\
    \ BI is the failure of \nthe farmer to apply the flow reduction method. The maxi-\n\
    mum AE is related to the first and last irrigation, where the \nsoil moisture\
    \ deficit is significant and the irrigation depth \nis saved. The results showed\
    \ that in all treatments, AE was \nhigher during the spring than autumn growth\
    \ period. The \nscarcity of effective rainfall in the spring growth period is\
    \ \nthe long intervals between irrigations and as a result, the \nsoil moisture\
    \ is low before irrigation. The average AE in \nSI and DTI treatments is high,\
    \ and one of the important \nreasons is the irrigation method in both treatments.\
    \ Deep \npenetration losses were lower in DTI and SI treatments than \nin BI treatment.\
    \ One of the effective factors in the amount \nof applied water and deep penetration\
    \ in DTI is the different \nirrigation method of this treatment. Irrigation depth\
    \ values \nwere greater than soil moisture deficit (SMD) for all irriga-\ntion\
    \ events, so crops were not water stressed despite reduced \napplied water. Changing\
    \ the irrigation method reduced the \nirrigation depth by 53.10%. Mean AE is higher\
    \ in treatment \nDTI than in BI and SI, which is one of the important rea-\nsons\
    \ for using the drip (tape) method. In SI and BI treat-\nments, the entire field\
    \ wet. On the other hand, the treatment \nDTI reduces the wetted surface area\
    \ of the field and reduces \nlosses due to deep penetration. The results showed\
    \ that AE \nis higher in the spring growth period than in the fall, and one \n\
    of the reasons for this is related to the lack of effective rain-\nfall in the\
    \ spring growth period and long intervals between \nirrigations, and as a result,\
    \ low soil moisture before irri-\ngation. The results obtained are consistent\
    \ with the results \nof research by Yuan et al. (2003), Akhavan et al. (2007),\
    \ \nEmami et al. (2019) and Dehghanisanij et al. (2021). Also, \nin the AE term,\
    \ treatment DTI increased by 5% compared \nto SI and BI treatments.\nIn DTI, SI,\
    \ and BI treatments, the measured yield was \n5755 kg/ha, 5400 kg/ha, and 5050 kg/ha,\
    \ respectively, which \nshowed a 6.17% and 12.25% increase in yield in treatment\
    \ \nDTI compared to SI and BI treatments. WP in DTI, SI, and \nBI treatments was\
    \ calculated to be 1.70 kg/m3, 1.47 kg/m3, \nand 0.91 kg/m3, respectively. Thus,\
    \ the application of DTI \ntreatment increased water productivity by 0.23 kg/m3\
    \ and \n0.79 kg/m3 compared to SI and BI treatments. Changing the \nirrigation\
    \ method from basin and sprinkler to drip (tape) \nincreased water efficiency\
    \ and wheat yield. Crop yield is \naffected not only by irrigation, but by many\
    \ other factors \nsuch as soil salinity, crop variety, crop management, soil \n\
    fertility, pesticide and fertilizer applications. High WP val-\nues are the reason\
    \ for the low amount of available water. The \nproposed treatment DTI improved\
    \ AE, increased WP and \nreduced applied water. Mihan variety had the lowest seed\
    \ \nyield with an average of 5000 kg/ha. The Pishgam variety \nhas the highest\
    \ seed yield due to the high number of seeds \nper panicle and number of panicles\
    \ (in 1  m2). The results \nshowed that with decreasing applied water, WP increases,\
    \ \nwhich is consistent with the results of research by Afshar \net al. (2020)\
    \ and Dehghanisanij et al. (2022). Turknejad et al. \n(2006) by comparing drip\
    \ irrigation (DI) systems and furrow \nirrigation in wheat cultivation, showed\
    \ that WP in the DI \nsystem was almost doubled compared to furrow irrigation.\
    \ \nPaltineanu et al. (1994) evaluated the effect of three DI, SI, \nand FI methods\
    \ on winter wheat and reported that the high-\nest grain yield and water use efficiency\
    \ in drip irrigation at \n6600 kg/ha ton and 2.97 kg/m3. Wang et al. (2009) and\

    \ for esti-\nmating wheat yield and WP were presented. The accuracy of \nthe HTS–ELM\
    \ technique in estimating WP and wheat yield \nis presented in Table 8.\nThe superior\
    \ model (χ12) estimates wheat yield and \nWP based on six-month effective rainfall\
    \ (Pe), irrigation \n(I), soil moisture (SM) and crop variety (V). According to\
    \ \nsuperior model, wheat yield and WP are positive with the \namount of moisture\
    \ at the field capacity point (FC) and nega-\ntive with the amount of moisture\
    \ at the permanent wilting \npoint (PWP). The higher the moisture at the FC point,\
    \ the \ngreater the water holding capacity of the soil. The results \nof selecting\
    \ variables showed that the model with I, V, \nPe, and SM inputs using the HTS–ELM\
    \ hybrid technique \nwith R2 = 0.982, RMSE = 0.006, NRMSE = 0.008, and \nNSE =\
    \ 0.980 has a high impact on the estimation of yield \nand WP. According to studies\
    \ by Richards et al. (2001) and \nTatari et al. (2008), wheat yield is a function\
    \ of irrigation \namount. Stone and Schlegel (2006) reported that 70% of \nchanges\
    \ in wheat yield in the US plains depend on soil water \nholding capacity. Dehghanisanij\
    \ et al. (2021) concluded that \nirrigation parameters, effective rainfall, and\
    \ crop variety \nare the most critical factors in estimating yield and WP in \n\
    tomatoes crop. Arora et al. (1983) Tatari et al. (2008) and \nDehghanisanij et al.\
    \ (2021) reported the effect of rainfall \nduring planting as one of the essential\
    \ factors on plant ger-\nmination and the final yield of wheat. Taliei and Bahrami\
    \ \n(2002) showed that the amount of soil moisture at the time of \nplanting is\
    \ one of the factors determining the dryland wheat \nyield. Fredrich and Combertoa\
    \ (1995) considered available \nwater as one of the essential factors in wheat\
    \ yield. Numer-\nous studies have shown that soil texture affects the amount \n\
    of available water to the plant (Koucheki and Alizadeh 1991; \nMirkhani 2003).\
    \ Soil texture parameters showed good per-\nformance in WP and yield estimation.\
    \ Gupta and Larson \n(1979), reported that the amount of available water depends\
    \ \non the particle size, soil bulk density (B.D.), and percent-\nage of soil\
    \ organic matter. Due to the lack of organic mat-\nter in the soils of the study\
    \ area, particle size and B.D. are \na function of soil texture (Alizadeh 2004),\
    \ so the positive \nrelationship between the percentage of clay and wheat yield\
    \ \nis acceptable. Vrindits et al. (2005), concluded that wheat \nyield depends\
    \ on the rate of clay and the B.D of the soil.\nAfter determining the superior\
    \ model, yield and WP were \nmodeled based on its parameters. Figures 7 and 8\

    \ technique based on the hazelnut \ntree search algorithm-extreme machine learning\
    \ technique \ncalled HTS–ELM for estimating wheat yield and WP under \ndifferent\
    \ irrigation levels was introduced. For this purpose, \nirrigation, meteorological\
    \ and soil parameters were selected \nas model inputs. The HTS–ELM considering\
    \ irrigation \nparameters, effective rainfall, soil moisture, and crop variety,\
    \ \ndeveloped superior results with R2 = 0.985, RMSE = 0.005, \nNRMSE = 0.008,\
    \ and NSE = 0.980, respectively. The results \nshowed that the WP and wheat yield\
    \ has a direct relation-\nship with the amount of moisture in the field capacity\
    \ point. \nIn comparison, the HTS–ELM technique performed better \nthan the practical\
    \ methods. Based on the results of using \nthe HTS–ELM technique, an accurate\
    \ estimate of WP and \nwheat yield was obtained in the Lake Urmia basin. Also,\
    \ \nthe output of the proposed model can be developed as user-\nfriendly mobile\
    \ applications. In the agricultural sector (for \nfarmers), without much experimentation\
    \ (even without \nresearch in several different areas), the best effective param-\n\
    eters in estimating yield and WP can be determined using \nintelligent methods,\
    \ irrigation-fertilization scheduling, and \neven the cultivation pattern based\
    \ on it. In general, the HTS \nalgorithm is a fast convergence algorithm and outperforms\
    \ \nthe peer algorithms in optimizing the ELM parameters and \nthereby estimating\
    \ the wheat yield and WP. Regardless, the \nHTS–ELM model requires to be parameterized,\
    \ and the \nimplementation of HTS–ELM is slightly less than ideal. In \ngeneral,\
    \ the HTS algorithm is a fast convergence algorithm \nand outperforms the peer\
    \ algorithms in optimizing the ELM \nparameters and thereby estimating the wheat\
    \ yield and WP. \nRegardless, the HTS–ELM model requires to be parameter-\nized,\
    \ and the implementation of HTS–ELM is slightly less \nthan ideal. Consequently,\
    \ in future studies, it was suggested \nto combine the HTS algorithm with SVR,\
    \ ANN, and ANFIS \nmodels and artificial neural networks to enhance errors and\
    \ \nsupply generalizable results.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank the\

    \ cul-\ntivation significantly contributes to the global economy. Irrigation is\
    \ a key factor in walnut cultivation and \nits most important problem is related\

    \ using meteorological data in western Turkey, \nwhich has semi-arid climatic\

    \ and ANFIS was obtained from the fourth scenario with R = 0.95 and two \nclimate\
    \ parameters: sunshine duration and mean temperature. Both ANN and ANFIS were\
    \ able to predict \ncrop water use obtaining a high correlation and the minimum\

    1. Introduction\nDue to its high economic value, walnut cultivation \nhas been\
    \ steadily increasing across the world in recent \nyears, with about 1.3 million\
    \ ha and an average yield \nof 4.5 million t. Turkey ranks third in the world\
    \ due \nto its annual walnut production of nearly 225 000 t \n(FAO, 2019). Walnut\
    \ trees can easily adapt to various \nsoil and climate conditions. Walnuts require\
    \ cool \nenough weather in winter and autumn to satisfy the \nneed for cooling\
    \ and a temperature of 25-35 ºC in \nspring and summer, which is enough to support\
    \ nor-\nmal growth and maturing. Although it takes a long \ntime to grow, walnut\
    \ is one of the most widespread \nfruit species in the world, with a cooling requirement\
    \ \nof 400-1800 h. In general, walnut trees adapt more \neasily to valleys that\
    \ are sun-drenched in the sum-\nmer and moderately warm in winter, protected from\
    \ \nthe wind. In certain regions, late frosts in the spring \nare among the most\
    \ important factors which cause \ninefficiency in walnut trees.\nIrrigation and\
    \ the correct choice and application \nof the irrigation method are too among\
    \ the most im-\nportant factors. A total minimum annual precipitation \nof 500\
    \ mm is sufficient for walnut cultivation; how-\never, it is of great importance\
    \ that the precipitation \nis regular. Especially in the summer, there should\
    \ be \nenough water and humidity in the soil. According to \nmany studies that\
    \ have examined crop yield response \nto irrigation of walnut trees, their annual\
    \ water de-\nmand is around 750-1500 mm (Goldhamer et al., \n1982, 1984; Fulton\
    \ et al., 2003; Chauvin et al., 2005; \nFAO, 2012; Goldhamer and Beede, 2015).\
    \ There are \nmany studies about irrigation modernization, as well \nas various\
    \ irrigation project designs (Fukui et al., \n1980; Andrade and Allen, 1999; Ortega\
    \ et al., 2004; \nRocamora et al., 2013; Zapata et al., 2013). The topics \nof\
    \ drip irrigation and the quality of irrigation water \nfor good crop production\
    \ were studied by Ayers and \nWescott (1985), Grattan et al. (2004), Master et\
    \ al. \n(2007), Díaz and Grattan (2009). \nThe estimation of walnut crop evapotranspiration\
    \ \n(ET) is of great relevance for improved water man-\nagement, especially in\
    \ arid and semi-arid regions \nwhere irrigation is needed to stabilize and increase\
    \ \nagricultural production. ET is a vital variable for \nhydrological and agrometeorological\
    \ studies and, \nparticularly, for the optimization of water use in \nagricultural\
    \ crop cultivation. A particular attention \nis given to the estimation of crop\
    \ evapotranspiration \n(ETc) in arid and semi-arid regions, under water \nscarcity,\
    \ and when crops are exposed to different \nkinds of abiotic stress (water, salinity,\
    \ etc.). However, \nmodeling ETc is a complex process due to its non-lin-\near\
    \ structure and the intricate relationship between \nmeteorological and crop parameters.\
    \ Moreover, the \nmeasurements of crop ET are tedious and prone to \nerrors due\
    \ to difficulties in adequately considering \nnumerous factors that affect the\
    \ uniformity and sta-\nbility of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (Allen \n\
    et al., 2011). Consequently, the investigation of the \nmost appropriate and accurate\
    \ methodology for ET \nestimation remains a priority topic for the planning \n\
    and management of water resources, on-farm ir-\nrigation scheduling, crop growth\
    \ simulations, and \nclimate change studies. There are different methods \nand\
    \ techniques for measuring or estimating ET. Each \nof them has advantages and\
    \ disadvantages based on \ntheir usage and data requirements. Many researchers\
    \ \nhave investigated the direct and indirect measurement \nof ET using lysimeters\
    \ and other tools; however, this \nis a time consuming and expensive method (Campbell\
    \ \nand Norman, 1998; Dinpashoh, 2006; Ali and Shui, \n2009; Ding et al., 2010;\
    \ Abyaneh et al., 2011; Agha-\njanloo et al., 2013; Jovanovic et al., 2018).\n\
    The Penman-Monteith (PM) equation is one of \nthe most widely used methods to\
    \ assess reference \ngrass evapotranspiration (ETo) based on weather \nvariables.\
    \ It is recommended by the Food and Agri-\nculture Organization (FAO) of the United\
    \ Nations as a \nstandard method (FAOPM) for ETo estimation (Allen \net al., 1998).\
    \ This method was tested against many \nother equations under different climatic\
    \ conditions \nand for various time steps adopted for ET estimation \n(Todorovic,\
    \ 2006; Pereira et al., 2015).\nThere are some alternative machine learning \n\
    techniques that can be used for ET estimation as \nmore economical and less time-consuming\
    \ meth-\nodologies. However, these methods are difficult to \ndevelop due to the\
    \ non-linear dynamic complexity of \nthe ET process, which depends on the interaction\
    \ of \nseveral meteorological and crop variables (Martí and \nGasque, 2010; Traore\
    \ et al., 2010). Moreover, the ac-\ncuracy of ET estimation by mathematical approaches\
    \ \ndepends on the number of available meteorological \nparameters, as well as\
    \ the quality of measured input \ndata. Since the beginning of this century, machine\
    \ \n297\nCrop water use estimation\nlearning algorithms have been increasingly\
    \ applied in \nmodeling ET (Kumar et al., 2002, 2011; Trajkovic et \nal., 2003;\
    \ Pal and Deswal, 2009; Martí and Gasque, \n2010; Kisi et al., 2015; Yassin et\
    \ al., 2016; Mattar, \n2018; Mehdizadeh, 2018; Sattari et al., 2020). Anto-\n\
    nopoulos and Antonopoulos (2017) studied the esti-\nmation of daily ETo using\
    \ artificial neural networks \n(ANN) and empirical methods in northern Greece.\
    \ \nTheir results demonstrated that the application of \nANN yielded a satisfactory\
    \ performance (Kisi, 2016; \nDou and Yang, 2018). Tabari et al. (2013) studied\
    \ the \nadaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and \nsupport vector machines\
    \ (SVM) for modeling potato \nETc in northwest Iran. The results demonstrated\
    \ that \nthe ANFIS and SVM techniques simulated better \npotato ETc than all empirical\
    \ methods.\nThis study was aimed at identifying the best \nmodel to estimate crop-walnut\
    \ ET based on scenarios \nincluding meteorological data and to compare it with\
    \ \na well-known and frequently used method.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1 Study\
    \ site\nThe study was performed in the walnut orchards \nin the district of Gölcük,\
    \ Kocaeli, Western Turkey \n(40º 43’ 36.5” N 29º 48’ 23.8” E) as shown in Figure\
    \ 1. \nAll the orchards where walnuts were cultivated had \nbeen set up according\
    \ to the cultivators’ own knowl-\nedge and experience. While some of the orchards\
    \ \nwere set up on the plain, others were set up on high \nlands within the forest,\
    \ approximately 500-800 masl. \nThe district is under the influence of the Black\
    \ Sea cli-\nmate, but it also exhibits the semi-arid climate prop-\nerties of\
    \ the Marmara region. When average climatic \nvalues measured throughout many\
    \ years (1950-2015) \nare studied, it is seen that the average temperature is\
    \ \n23.8 ºC, while the highest average temperature has \nbeen measured in July\
    \ as 29.6 ºC. The lowest average \ntemperature has been measured in January as\
    \ 3.3 ºC. \nThe average number of rainy days has a maximum of \n17.4 in January\
    \ and a minimum of 5.2 in August. The \nannual average rainfall in the region\
    \ is 768 mm. Total \nmonthly precipitation has been recorded to be high-\nest\
    \ in December, with an average of 110.0 kg m–2, \nand lowest in July, with an\
    \ average of 37.1 kg m–2 \n(TSMS, 2017). The four-year climate data of the \n\
    region used in the models were obtained from the \nGeneral Directorate of Meteorological\
    \ Service. \nThe local walnut species cultivated in the research \narea are Şebin\
    \ and Bilecik, while Chandler and Pikan \nare the foreign species that provide\

    \ shells, thus \nyielding high income. The walnut orchards in the \nresearch area\
    \ vary between 5 and 10 ha in size. The \nyoung trees in the orchards are generally\
    \ planted \nwithin 9 × 9 and 10 × 10 m spaces.\nAll the information that was needed\
    \ for the plan-\nning of the irrigation system, the sizing of the system \nelements,\
    \ and the configuration and operation of the \nsystem were obtained through terrain\
    \ analyses. Fol-\nlowing these efforts, the drip irrigation project was \nprepared\
    \ and set up in the orchard. The drip irrigation \nsystem consisted of the water\
    \ source, pumping unit, \ncontrol unit, pipelines and drippers. Irrigation water\
    \ \nwas filtered taking care not to clog the drippers and \nthen mixed with the\
    \ necessary nutrients. After the \npressure and flow rate checks, it was distributed\
    \ to \nthe research plots. The control unit was made up \nof a fertilizer tank,\
    \ a strainer filter and manometers \nfor pressure control. Soil samples were taken\
    \ and \nanalyzed according to Blake (1965) and Benami and \nDiskin (1965). The\
    \ soil texture was measured with \na hydrometer as explained in Bouyoucos (1962).\
    \ \nIrrigation water quality analyses were performed in \nthe laboratory, in accordance\
    \ with USDA (1954). \nThe actual value of infiltration rate was identified \n\
    (Criddle et al., 1956) by double ring infiltrometer \nmeasurements.\n2.2 Data\
    \ collection, description and analysis\nThe raw data set (Table I) to be used\
    \ in the model \nincludes the parameters of maximum, minimum and \naverage temperatures\
    \ (Tmax, Tmin and Tavg, respec-\ntively), wind speed (u2) and sunshine hours (n).\
    \ The \nreference dataset in this study was the calibrated \nclimate data from\
    \ regional weather stations for the \nperiod 2016-2019, provided by the Turkish\
    \ State \nMeteorological Service (TSMS, 2022). The averages \nof annual temperature,\
    \ wind speed, and the sunshine \nduration recorded between the first and last\
    \ frost dates \nwere 20.50 ºC, 1.92 m s−1, and 6.9 h, respectively, \nwhile the\
    \ highest values of maximum and minimum \ntemperatures were 40.7 and 31.9 ºC,\
    \ and the lowest \nvalues 12 and 2.5 ºC. The extreme values for all me-\nteorological\
    \ parameters were observed during these \nyears. Therefore, the raw data set was\
    \ subjected to \nquality control by removing 5% of noisy data from \nthe data\
    \ set.\nThe reference evapotranspiration was calculated \nbased on the PM-FAO\
    \ method in Eq. (1), using me-\nteorological data (Allen et al., 1998).\nET0 =\n\

    \ in the \nfield throughout the study period from the first frost \non April 15\
    \ to the last frost on November 10. During \nthis period, four major growing stages\
    \ were distin-\nguished as the initial, crop development, mid-season \nand late\
    \ season stages. Accordingly, the correspond-\ning Kc values were adopted from\
    \ investigations by \nthe General Directorate of Agricultural Research \nand Policies\
    \ for a specific region in Kocaeli as Kcini \n= 0.41, Kcmid = 1.17 and Kcend =\
    \ 0.77.\nThe data were normalized from 0 to 1 based on Eq. \n(3) to ensure they\
    \ remained within a certain range and \nthe statistical distribution was uniform\
    \ when scaling.\nX′ =\nXi − Xmin\nXmax − Xmin\n \n(3)\nwhere Xi is raw data, Xmin\
    \ is the minimum value \nof X, Xmax is the maximum value of X, and Y is the \n\
    standardized data value.\n2.3 Probabilistic scenarios\nThe ReliefF feature selection\
    \ algorithm, which is \na filter feature selection method modified by Kira \n\
    and Rendell (1992), was used to filter the data and \nsort them according to their\
    \ weight values between \n–1 (worst) and +1 (best). The processing procedure \n\
    was repeated for each attribute and the weight value \nof each attribute was calculated\
    \ at the end (Köksal, \n2020; Sattari et al., 2021). A series of probabilistic\
    \ \nscenarios based on ReliefF results were created to \nbe used in the artificial\
    \ intelligence models. Matlab \nR2016a was used to implement ANN and ANFIS \n\
    models and Weka 3.9.4 modules were used to im-\nplement ReliefF.\n2.4 Artificial\
    \ intelligence methods\n2.4.1 Artificial neural networks\nAn ANN model was created\
    \ for each probabilistic \nscenario obtained from the ReliefF algorithm. Once\
    \ \nthe probabilistic scenarios were created as model \ninput, the entire dataset\
    \ was randomly split. The \nreason for the random division of the data was the\
    \ \nincrease and decrease of climatological parameters \nduring the development\
    \ period (Yu et al., 2020; \nPandey and Pandey, 2020). Different percentages \n\
    of data sets (training, validation, and testing) were \napplied at a rate from\
    \ 75 to 85% for training, 0 to \n10% for validation, and 15 to 20% for testing\
    \ in \neach ANN model. There is no specific and accepted \nmethodology for the\
    \ network architecture created to \ndetermine the best performance of ANN (Wu\
    \ et al., \n2014; Antonopoulos et al., 2015). Therefore, neuron \nnumbers were\
    \ determined by trial and error for the \nbest performance in all probabilistic\
    \ scenarios. The \nperformance of each model was evaluated according \nto R2 and\
    \ MSE (Sagi and Jain, 2020; Adeloye et al., \n2012), and the best scenario was\
    \ selected.\n2.4.2 Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system\nThe model was run with\
    \ the five input parameters \n(Tmax, Tmin, Tavg, u2, and n) using the Matlab R2016a\
    \ \nmodule to implement ANFIS. In the model, different \nmembership functions\

    \ be-\ntween 60-80% for training and 20-40% for testing.\n3. Results \n3.1 Results\
    \ of data analysis and probabilistic sce-\nnarios\nThe real data set consists\
    \ of 879 rows with the five \nmeteorological parameters covering the growth \n\
    periods of 2016-2019. When the dataset was exam-\nined after the data analysis,\
    \ the mean Tavg remained \napproximately constant, while the standard deviation\
    \ \ndecreased from 5.058 to 4.46. In addition, three \noutliers were removed from\
    \ the dataset because un-\nexpected records could create a bias in the model.\
    \ As \na result, the maximum and minimum values of Tavg \nfor four years were\
    \ prepared for the model as 28.9 \nand 9 ºC, respectively.\nAccording to the analysis\
    \ results for maximum \nand minimum temperatures, the four peak values \nand the\
    \ three lowest maximum temperature values \nwere removed from the dataset, and\
    \ it was found \nthat Tmax decreased from 40.7 to 37.4 ºC. In addi-\ntion, it\
    \ was found that while the mean maximum \ntemperature value increased, the standard\
    \ deviation \nvalue decreased from 5.706 to 4.853. On the other \nhand, it was\
    \ determined that the average minimum \ntemperature value increased from 15.8\
    \ to 16.3 ºC. \n300\nF. Dökmen et al.\nFollowing this, there was a decrease in\
    \ the minimum \ntemperature deviation from the mean.\nAs can be seen in Figure\
    \ 2, the wind speed set \ndoes not show a uniform distribution, but there are\
    \ \na few values above 3 m s–1. When these data are \nremoved (see Fig. 3), the\
    \ maximum and minimum \nwind speeds are 2.9 m s–1 and 1.1 m s–1, respectively,\
    \ \nand a uniform distribution is formed with 1.89 m s–1.\nNo specific data was\
    \ observed in the sunshine \nduration data, so it was removed from the dataset.\
    \ \nHowever, due to the other parameters that were re-\nmoved, the dataset was\
    \ positively affected. For this \nreason, the average mean sunshine duration increased\
    \ \nfrom 6.69 to 7.32 h, but the standard deviation value \ndecreased from 3.769\
    \ to 3.563.\nIn summary, from the set of 891 data, 57 were \nremoved, corresponding\
    \ to 6% percent of the total \ndataset. Of the 879 datasets, 45 were reserved\
    \ for ver-\nification and not included in the models. Therefore, \n834 datasets\
    \ were used in the training, validation and \ntesting stages. According to the\
    \ data analysis results, \nit was concluded that the standard deviation value\
    \ \ndecreased in all parameters and the mean values \nremained approximately constant.\n\
    The aim of proposing these scenarios was \nmainly to determine whether there was\
    \ a high \ncorrelation with models that have descending prob-\nabilistic input\
    \ parameters. The ReliefF algorithm \nwas used to rank the five selected input\
    \ parameters \nto estimate the output parameter of each AI model. \n0.06\n0.05\n\

    \ This reduction model can be expected to be \nat an acceptable level of performance\
    \ (see Table II). \nTable III shows different inputs based on alternative \nscenarios.\
    \ In the first scenario, the model is run \nusing all input parameters. Then,\
    \ in each scenario, \nthe accuracy of the model was reassessed with one \nmissing\
    \ parameter.\n3.2 Crop water use estimation by artificial neural \nnetworks\n\
    Various training functions and different numbers \nof neurons were used to investigate\
    \ the best perfor-\nmance. A trial and error approach was adopted to \nfind the\
    \ optimum number of neurons. The random-\nization of the hidden layer’s neurons\
    \ was found to \nbe between six and three neurons in parallel with the \ninput\
    \ parameter. In the hidden layer, the values with \nthe best number of nodes and\
    \ lowest error were used.\nIn the models created with ANN, the MSE and R2 \nvalues\
    \ were obtained by running each model 15 times \non average. As shown in Table\
    \ IV, over-learning was \ndetected in scenarios 1, 2 and 3 despite optimizing\
    \ \nthe number of neurons. To solve this problem, 5% \nof the dataset was used\
    \ for the validation part. It was \nconcluded that the best training performance\
    \ of the \nmodels was in the first scenario with an R2 of 0.91. \nHowever, it\
    \ was concluded that R2 and MSE values \nremained constant when the wind speed,\
    \ and the \nmaximum and minimum temperatures were removed \nin other scenarios.\
    \ Accordingly, when Scenario 4 \nwas examined, it was seen that the R2 values\
    \ for \ntraining and testing were 0.90 and 0.89, and MSE \nvalues for training\
    \ and testing were 0.9324834 and \n0.9306326 mm day–1, respectively. On the other\

    \ 5 and the errors in \nthe estimation increased, it was not considered appro-\n\
    priate for the model estimation. As a result, Scenario \n4, which had the highest\
    \ correlation, minimum mean \nsquare error, and minimum input parameter was \n\
    considered to be the best model. \nEven when high correlation is found throughout\
    \ \nthe network training, testing and validation phases, \nthe models still need\
    \ to be verified to prove that they \nperform accurate estimations. The 45 datasets\
    \ that \nwere not used in the training, validation and testing \nof the ANNs model\
    \ were separated as one value for \neach month and used in verification. Each\
    \ probabilis-\ntic scenario was used while verifying the model. The \ngraphs between\
    \ the predicted and observed values for \nall parameters are shown in Figure 4.\n\
    3.3 Crop water use estimation by ANFIS\nIn the generated probabilistic scenarios,\
    \ the data sets \nwere manually distributed as 80 and 20% for training \nand testing,\
    \ respectively. Membership functions (MF) \nthat are used in training ANFIS models\
    \ are functions \nused to determine the classes of values. The MF type \nis of\
    \ great importance in training the network. For \nthis reason, “gaussmf” and “gauss2mf”\
    \ functions \nwith the lowest error margin were selected by trial \nand error\
    \ for all applied MF types. \nIt was found that the smallest MSE in the ANFIS\
    \ \nmodel was 0.209896 mm day–1 in Scenario 1 with \nfive input parameters (Tavg,\
    \ n, Tmax, Tmin and u2), and \n0.701142 mm day–1 in Scenario 5 with only one input\
    \ \n(Tavg). It was concluded that R2 values of scenarios \n1, 2, 3, and 4 remained\

    \ in Scenario \n5 these values increased to 0.701142 and 0.898864 \nmm day–1.\
    \ On the other hand, while values for R2 \nwere 0.90 for both training and testing\
    \ in Scenario \n4, it was found to be 0.81 for training and 0.79 for \ntesting\
    \ in Scenario 5. Therefore, it was concluded \nthat Scenario 4 was more successful\
    \ in estimating \ncrop water use (see Table V).\n3.3.1 Model verification\nThe\
    \ same 45 data sets used in ANN models were \nalso used for the verification of\
    \ ANFIS models. The \nmost advantageous aspect of the model verification \ndataset\
    \ is the presence of parameters that are not \ntrained by the model. For example,\
    \ while the highest \nand lowest model-trained ETc values were 7.49 and \n0.88\
    \ mm day–1, the highest and lowest ETc values in \nthe validation dataset were\
    \ 7.92 and 0.51 mm day–1. \nIn other words, ANFIS models can predict even the\
    \ \nhighest and lowest values in all scenarios which they \nhave not encountered\
    \ before with the lowest rate of \nerror. Figure 5 shows the observed and estimated\
    \ \ncrop water use values.\n3.4 Performance of the Penman Monteith approach \n\
    for crop water use\nETc values obtained from the Penman approach, \nconsidering\
    \ multiple climate parameters and plant \ncharacteristics, were plotted in Figure\
    \ 6 together with \nthe verification results used for the scenario proposed \n\
    in the models. As seen in the figure, the results of \nthe model obtained with\
    \ a few parameters are in \nparallel with Penman’s results, and the ANFIS and\
    \ \nANN models have the highest statistical correlation \n(–0.349 and –0.361,\
    \ respectively) according to the \ncomparison (two-simple t test) .\nConsidering\
    \ the predicted ETc, rainfall and also \nthe 2-year phenological follow-ups, it\
    \ was deter-\nmined that irrigation must be initiated at the begin-\nning of April\
    \ when walnut trees are forming leaves \nand blossoming, and continued through\
    \ October. If \nthe trees are unable to get enough water during this \nperiod,\
    \ growth and vegetation will slow down and \nthere will be decreases in quality\
    \ and efficiency, \nsince fruits will not be able to grow enough meat. It \nis\

    \ evaluated \nusing the artificial intelligence methods of ANN \nand ANFIS with\
    \ few parameters, including average \ntemperature (Tavg) and sunshine duration\
    \ (n). Terzi \nand Keskin (2005) predicted daily panevaporation \nusing the ANN\
    \ model with six meteorological \nvariables in the Eğirdir lake region. Deswal\
    \ and \nPal (2008) used ANN to investigate the impact of \nvarious collections\
    \ of meteorological parameters \non water surface evaporation. They found that\
    \ the \nmost effective parameter in probabilistic scenar-\nios created for the\
    \ model is average temperature. \nThrough scientific studies, it has been demonstrated\
    \ \nthat maximum, minimum and average temperatures \nare more successful than\

    \ et al., 2013; Yamaç and \nTodorovic, 2020; Sattari et al., 2021).\nAccording\
    \ to the ANN and ANFIS results in this \nstudy, these models had an acceptable\
    \ performance \nwith high accuracy R and low mean square error to \nestimate ET.\
    \ It was also concluded that ANFIS has \na better performance than ANN. Likewise,\
    \ Karimi et \nal. (2012) stated that the ANFIS model gave better \nresults than\
    \ ANN.\nNumerous studies sustain that the results of \nvarious machine learning\
    \ methods (including ANN \nand ANFIS) are more certain and accurate regarding\
    \ \ncrop water consumption and evaporation compared \nto empirical methods. Many\
    \ researchers have used \nartificial intelligence models to predict evapotranspi-\n\

    \ accordance with Kisekka and \nPeddinti (2022) , who observed a statistically\
    \ strong \nrelationship with similar models between walnut ETc \nand different\

    \ of \nhydrology, water management, and environmental \nand agricultural studies,\
    \ including agriculture and \nET estimates, has increased in the last years. In\
    \ this \nstudy, ANN and ANFIS were introduced to predict \nET and investigate\
    \ their modeling performance \nwith different scenarios of meteorological input\
    \ \ndata availability. In this context, estimated ET was \nsimulated by different\
    \ machine learning methods \nand was compared to detailed empirical data. This\
    \ \nmethodology allowed to quickly produce statisti-\ncally reliable predictions\
    \ with less data, which in \nturn allowed to determine the evapotranspiration\
    \ of \nwalnut trees and their fruits in the Marmara basin \nof Turkey. These results\
    \ will also assist in the de-\ntermination of crop ET under limited water supply\
    \ \nand stress conditions in terms of irrigated agriculture \nand efficient water\
    \ use.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Kocaeli University \n\

    Abstract: Earth observation (EO) techniques have signiﬁcantly evolved over time,\
    \ covering a wide\nrange of applications in different domains. The scope of this\
    \ study is to review the research conducted\non EO in the Eastern Mediterranean,\
    \ Middle East, and North Africa (EMMENA) region and to\nidentify the main knowledge\
    \ gaps. We searched through the Web of Science database for papers\npublished\
    \ between 2018 and 2022 for EO studies in the EMMENA. We categorized the papers\
    \ in\nthe following thematic areas: atmosphere, water, agriculture, land, disaster\
    \ risk reduction (DRR),\ncultural heritage, energy, marine safety and security\
    \ (MSS), and big Earth data (BED); 6647 papers\nwere found with the highest number\
    \ of publications in the thematic areas of BED (27%) and land\n(22%). Most of\
    \ the EMMENA countries are surrounded by sea, yet there was a very small number\
    \ of\nstudies on MSS (0.9% of total number of papers). This study detected a gap\
    \ in fundamental research\nin the BED thematic area. Other future needs identiﬁed\
    \ by this study are the limited availability of\nvery high-resolution and near-real-time\
    \ remote sensing data, the lack of harmonized methodologies\nand the need for\
    \ further development of models, algorithms, early warning systems, and services.\n\

    \ of the EMMENA region. \nThe region has a rich history and cultural heritage\
    \ but has also been exposed to var-\nious risks over the decades [8]. The EMMENA\
    \ region has been suﬀering from geopolitical \ntensions, political instability,\
    \ and conﬂicts [8]. Furthermore, population growth and ex-\npanding urbanization\
    \ in the EMMENA region have increased the pressure on ecosystems \nand on available\
    \ resources [9–12]. In addition, this region has been characterized as a cli-\n\
    mate change hot spot, leading to increasing temperatures, extended droughts, and\
    \ a de-\ncline in rainfall [13,14]. The agricultural sector, of which 70 percent\
    \ is rainfed, is highly \nexposed to changing climatic conditions [14]. This is\
    \ of critical importance as the agricul-\nture sector contributes signiﬁcantly\
    \ to the national economies of many EMMENA coun-\ntries. Additionally, climate\
    \ change will have negative impacts on many other aspects in-\ncluding air quality,\
    \ human health, land ecosystems, marine ecosystems, freshwater re-\nsources, and\
    \ energy demand [15,16]. Finally, many countries of the EMMENA region are \nFigure\
    \ 1. Countries of the EMMENA region.\nThe region has a rich history and cultural\
    \ heritage but has also been exposed to various\nrisks over the decades [8]. The\
    \ EMMENA region has been suffering from geopolitical ten-\nsions, political instability,\
    \ and conﬂicts [8]. Furthermore, population growth and expanding\nurbanization\
    \ in the EMMENA region have increased the pressure on ecosystems and on\navailable\
    \ resources [9–12]. In addition, this region has been characterized as a climate\n\

    \ decline in\nrainfall [13,14]. The agricultural sector, of which 70 percent is\
    \ rainfed, is highly exposed to\nchanging climatic conditions [14]. This is of\
    \ critical importance as the agriculture sector\ncontributes signiﬁcantly to the\
    \ national economies of many EMMENA countries. Addi-\ntionally, climate change\
    \ will have negative impacts on many other aspects including air\nquality, human\
    \ health, land ecosystems, marine ecosystems, freshwater resources, and\nenergy\
    \ demand [15,16]. Finally, many countries of the EMMENA region are situated on\n\
    complex topography and on tectonically active areas, thus are prone to hazards\
    \ related to\nlandslides and earthquakes [17].\nEO plays a crucial role in understanding\
    \ processes on our planet, enabling us to\nadvance our monitoring capabilities\
    \ over various domains of interest [18]. The information\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15,\
    \ 4202\n3 of 35\ngenerated from EO enables researchers and decisionmakers to formulate\
    \ and apply effective\npolicies for environmental protection and sustainable management\
    \ of natural resources.\nThe amount of freely accessible EO data has been increasing\
    \ over the years, mainly due to\ntechnological advancements and the implementation\
    \ of open data policies. For example,\nthe yearly volume of open and freely available\
    \ satellite data increased from 0.25 PB in\n2013 (MODIS and Landsat missions)\
    \ to 4.25 PB in 2019 (MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel\nmissions) [19]. These data\
    \ provide the opportunity to expand our knowledge in many\nthematic areas including\
    \ atmosphere, water, agriculture, land, disaster risk (reduction),\ncultural heritage,\
    \ energy, and marine safety and security. However, due to the expanding\namount\
    \ of data, there is a need for novel solutions to properly store, process, disseminate,\n\
    and analyze these big Earth data sets [18].\nThe ongoing development of big Earth\
    \ data techniques and the increasing availability\nof satellite EO data provide\
    \ opportunities to better monitor the aforementioned thematic\nareas [20,21].\
    \ As the EMMENA region is a fairly new segment for EO activities, there are\n\
    many opportunities to expand in EO research [6]. However, it is crucial to document\
    \ ﬁrst\nthe current EO applications per thematic area and to identify the existing\
    \ knowledge gaps.\nCurrently, review papers on EO are focusing on speciﬁc thematic\
    \ areas [22–29]. To the best\nof our knowledge, there are no review papers available\
    \ on the full range of EO applications.\nFurthermore, review studies on EO in\
    \ the EMMENA region are limited. The aim of this\nscoping review is to ﬁll this\
    \ gap by focusing on the wide range of EO applications in the\nEMMENA region.\
    \ The speciﬁc objectives of this study are to (1) provide an overview of\nEO studies\
    \ in the EMMENA region per thematic area and per country; and (2) identify the\n\
    EO applications and explore the existing limitations and knowledge gaps of the\
    \ research\nwith the highest impact per thematic area.\n2. Materials and Methods\n\
    Similar to Imane et al. [30], the search strategy consisted of three steps (Figure\
    \ 2):\nIdentiﬁcation: The key word searches were conducted in the Web of Science™\
    \ database\nto ﬁnd articles about EO in the EMMENA region for the past ﬁve years.\
    \ As search terms,\nwe selected the “Topic” option which searched journals’ title,\
    \ abstract, and keywords for\nthe following keywords: “Remote sensing OR Satellite\
    \ OR Earth observations OR GIS OR\ngeographical information systems”. With the\
    \ ‘’AND Topic” option, we constrained the\nresearch to the EMMENA region by inserting\
    \ the following keywords: “Algeria OR Bahrain\nOR Cyprus OR Egypt OR Iran OR Iraq\
    \ OR Israel OR Jordan OR Kuwait OR Lebanon OR\nLibya OR Malta OR Morocco OR Oman\
    \ OR Palestine OR Qatar OR Saudi Arabia OR Syria\nOR Tunisia OR Turkey OR United\
    \ Arab Emirates OR Yemen”. Additionally, with the “AND\nYear published” option\
    \ we further constrained the search to the past ﬁve years by inserting\nthe following:\
    \ “2018–2022”.\nScreening: Duplicates and articles not written in the English\
    \ language and not having a\ndigital object identiﬁer (DOI) were excluded from\
    \ the analysis. The relevance of the papers\nwas further examined by consulting\
    \ the keywords, titles, and abstracts. Furthermore, in\ncase of uncertainty the\
    \ full texts were evaluated. Articles of which their study area covered\nmore\
    \ than one country were named as “regional”. Author names and afﬁliations, the\n\
    journal title, keywords, and abstracts, the number of citations, and the DOI were\
    \ exported\nand analyzed in Excel® (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, DC, USA) and\
    \ in ArcGIS Pro\n(ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).\nEligibility: The papers were categorized\
    \ into the following thematic areas based\non the relevant EO applications (Table\
    \ 1): Atmosphere (ATM), water (WAT), agriculture\n(AGR), land (LAN), disaster\
    \ risk reduction (DRR), cultural heritage (CH), energy (EN),\nmarine safety and\
    \ security (MSS), and big Earth data (BED). The latter thematic area,\nwhich includes\
    \ data mining and information extraction, machine learning and artiﬁcial\nintelligence,\
    \ visual exploration and semantic enrichment, and geoinformation, can also be\n\
    considered as a horizontal thematic area as its applications are often supplementary\
    \ to the\nrest of the thematic areas. Articles which were not classiﬁed into any\
    \ of the above thematic\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n4 of 35\nareas were named\
    \ as “other” and articles which were classiﬁed into more than one thematic\narea\
    \ were named as “interdisciplinary”. Thus, some articles were categorized into\
    \ more\nthan one thematic area. Assuming that citations are a relevant measure\
    \ of the impact of\nan article, the top 20 highly cited articles (up to 13 March\
    \ 2023) from each thematic area\nwere included in the review. The categorization\

    to 6647 (Figure 3); 1291 of these studies had a regional geographic focus, extending\
    \ beyond\ncountry borders. The geographic focus of most publications was on Iran\
    \ (1883 publications),\nwhile EO studies in Bahrain were the least common (10\
    \ publications). Similarly, for the\nauthor afﬁliation country (Table 2), Iran\
    \ has the highest (2186) and Bahrain has the lowest\n(14) number of afﬁliations.\
    \ However, 44.8% of the authors’ afﬁliations are not within the\nEMMENA region.\
    \ Considering the population of each country, Cyprus has the highest\nauthor afﬁliation\
    \ number per capita (770 per 1 million people). Countries that are suffering\n\
    from political and military conﬂicts, such as Libya and Yemen, have the lowest\
    \ author\nafﬁliation number per capita (7 and 13, respectively). This is also\

    \ not written in the English \nlanguage and not having a digital object identiﬁer\
    \ (DOI), the total number of publications \ndropped to 6647 (Figure 3); 1291 of\
    \ these studies had a regional geographic focus, \nextending beyond country borders.\
    \ The geographic focus of most publications was on Iran \n(1883 publications),\

    \ of atmosphere are\non precipitation estimates (4 articles), on dust storms (6\
    \ articles), and on the impact of\ncoronavirus on air quality through EO (4 articles).\n\
    Spatiotemporal precipitation estimates of high accuracy are essential in climate\
    \ stud-\nies and in water resource planning and management, especially in regions\
    \ where in situ\nprecipitation data are not available [33,34]. Amjad et al. [35]\
    \ evaluated the performance of\nsatellite-based (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission\
    \ (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation\nAnalysis (TMPA), the Integrated Multi-satellitE\
    \ Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measure-\nment (IMERG)) and model-based\
    \ (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\n(ECMWF-ERA interim, ERA5))\
    \ precipitation products over varying climate and complex\ntopography. For their\
    \ evaluation, they used 256 ground-based gauge stations between 2014\nand 2018\
    \ over Turkey. They reported that satellite-based products consistently performed\n\
    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n11 of 35\nbetter than model-based products in detecting\
    \ and estimating daily precipitation intensities.\nMahmoud et al. [36] assessed\
    \ the accuracy of the IMERG products by using ground-based\nrain gauge observations\
    \ throughout Saudi Arabia for the period from October 2015 to\nApril 2016, based\
    \ on six statistical indices. The authors highlighted the potential of IMERG\n\
    products in complementing ground precipitation measurements. However, the accuracy\n\
    of this product is limited in regions with high heterogeneity in the rainfall\
    \ distribution\nand with high variability in the terrestrial topography. Similarly,\
    \ Hosseini-Moghari and\nTang [33] found poor accuracy of IMERG products in regions\
    \ with higher precipitation in\nIran. The systematic error varied from less than\
    \ 12% in dry regions to more than 60% in\nwet regions. In their study on the assessment\
    \ of satellite-based precipitation measurement\nproducts over Egypt, Nashwan et\
    \ al. [37] evaluated the performance of three satellite-\nbased high-resolution\
    \ gridded rainfall datasets, namely the gauge-corrected Global Satellite\nMapping\
    \ of Precipitation (GSMaP), IMERG, and the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed\nPrecipitation\
    \ with Stations (CHIRPS), in the hot desert climate of Egypt with different sta-\n\
    tistical indices. Overall, CHIRPS was more accurate than the other products in\
    \ estimating\nrainfall amounts but IMERG was better at detecting the occurrence\
    \ of rainfall than CHIRPS.\nIn order to overcome the contradictory results obtained\
    \ using different statistical metrics,\nSalman et al. [34] proposed the use of\
    \ compromise programming for the selection of the\nappropriate gridded precipitation\
    \ datasets.\nDust storms are considered a common environmental phenomenon in the\
    \ EMMENA\nregion with signiﬁcant impact on human health, the environment, and\
    \ many associated\nsocioeconomic factors [38–41]. The study of Namdari et al.\
    \ [42] examined the impacts\nof climate ﬂuctuations on dust storm activity over\
    \ the Middle East. They used aerosol\noptical depth, temperature, and precipitation\
    \ data between 2000 and 2015, obtained from\nMODIS Collection, Tropical Rainfall\
    \ Measuring Mission (TRMM), Global Historical Climate\nNetwork (GHCN) of the NCDC/NOAA,\
    \ ECMWF, and from the Iran Meteorological Organi-\nzation (IMO). Their results\
    \ indicate that long-term reduction in rainfall has promoted lower\nsoil moisture\
    \ and vegetative cover, leading to more intense dust emissions. Furthermore,\n\
    short-term variations in temperature in hot periods exacerbate the inﬂuence on\
    \ the dust\nstorm genesis. Yassin et al. [38] used a backward trajectory method\
    \ on the HYSPLIT model\nto study the sources of dust storms over Kuwait during\
    \ a 12-year period (2000–2012). The\nauthors compared MODIS satellite observations\
    \ at various latitudes (1000, 3000, 5000 m)\nwith the HYSPLIT model and reported\
    \ similar results. The sources of dust storms were\nidentiﬁed from both the Sahara\
    \ Desert and the Arabian Desert. Similarly, Beegum et al. [39]\ninvestigated dust\
    \ storms over the Arabian Peninsula using the regionally adapted chem-\nistry\
    \ transport model CHIMERE coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF)\n\
    model. They found good agreement (R ~0.73 and RMSE ~0.1) in the spatiotemporal\
    \ pattern\nbetween simulations and observations (MSG/SEVRI RGB dust, MODIS Deep\
    \ Blue Aerosol\nOptical Depth: DB-AOD, Ozone Monitoring Instrument Observed UV\
    \ Aerosol Absorption\nIndex: OMI-AI and AERONET AOD). Boroughani et al. [40] used\
    \ three statistical-based\nmachine learning algorithms (weights of evidence, frequency\
    \ ratio, and random forest)\nto produce a dust source susceptibility map (DSSM)\
    \ in Khorasan Razavi Province (Iran).\nLand use, lithology, slope, soil, geomorphology,\
    \ normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI), and distance from river data\
    \ were included in the models. The random forest\nmodel with an area under the\
    \ curve (AUC) value equal to 88% showed higher performance\nthan frequency ratio\
    \ (80%) and weights of evidence (81%) when validated with MODIS\ndata (23 images\
    \ during the 2005–2016 period). Similarly, Gholami et al. [41] applied eight\n\
    algorithms including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian\
    \ additive\nregression trees (BART), radial basis function (RBF), extreme gradient\
    \ boosting (XGBoost),\nregression tree analysis (RTA), Cubist model and boosted\
    \ regression trees (BRTs), and\nan ensemble modeling (EM) approach for generating\
    \ spatial dust distribution maps in\nKhuzestan Province (Iran) and Iraq. The EM\
    \ approach showed the highest performance\n(AUC = 99.8%) for generating the dust\
    \ storm provenance map.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n12 of 35\nSpaceborne NO2\
    \ column observations from two high-resolution instruments, Tropo-\nspheric Monitoring\
    \ Instrument (TROPOMI, Sentinel-5 Precursor) and Ozone Monitoring\nInstrument\
    \ (OMI), were used to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on NO2 pollu-\n\
    tion in ﬁve different regions (China, South Korea, western Europe, the USA, and\
    \ Iran) [43].\nThe results showed a 20–40% decrease in NO2 columns over China,\
    \ Europe, South Korea,\nand the United States between January and April 2020,\
    \ due to the lockdown measures\nimplemented by the governments. A likely explanation\
    \ for the absence of a decrease in\nNO2 in Iran is that complete lockdowns were\
    \ not enforced in Iran. The authors emphasized\nthat further studies are needed\
    \ to evaluate the effects of the temporary lockdowns on\nglobal air quality and\
    \ climate and the gradual return the values of to prelockdown periods.\nOn the\
    \ contrary, the study of Broomandi et al. [44] showed that the COVID-19 lockdown\n\
    positively affected Iran’s air quality, as evident by the reduction in the levels\
    \ of CO, NO2,\nSO2, and PM10. Similar trends of NO2 reduction during the lockdown\
    \ were observed for\nother EMMENA countries, such as Egypt and Iraq [45,46].\n\
    The remaining studies in the atmosphere thematic area focus on the improvement\n\
    of CO2 anthropogenic emission measurements [47], climate change [48,49], aerosol\
    \ pollu-\ntion [50], drought estimation [51], and preseismic ionospheric anomalies\
    \ [52].\nReuter et al. [47] developed a co-location method with the simultaneous\
    \ use of CO2\n(OCO-2) and NO2 (Sentinel-5) data for the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of anthro-\npogenic emission plume signals. The authors highlighted that existing\
    \ satellites present\nhigh ﬂux uncertainties which are expected to be reduced\
    \ by the planned European Coper-\nnicus anthropogenic CO2 monitoring mission (CO2M),\
    \ due to higher spatial resolution and\nbetter imaging capabilities.\nLong-term\
    \ trends between vegetation and climate showed apparent climate change\neffects\
    \ in Iran [48]. Using 33-year records of NDVI (calculated with data from the\n\
    Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite) and climate variables,\n\
    Lamchin et al. [48] found that the vegetation greenness trend consistently decreased\n\
    (range = −0.47 to −0.08) in eastern Iran. Similarly, projected land use changes\
    \ for Saudi\nArabia between 2014 and 2100 showed reductions in vegetation due\
    \ to climate change and\nanthropogenic activities [49].\nHossein Mardi et al.\
    \ [50] examined the long-term temporal and spatial characteristics\nassociated\
    \ with aerosol pollution in Lake Urmia by using daily aerosol optical depth (AOD)\n\
    data from MODIS satellites, between 2001 and 2015. They found that aerosols in\
    \ the area\nare emitted more effectively from bordering lands (desiccated areas,\
    \ dried watercourses,\nand river deltas), rather than the Lake Urmia salt crust.\n\
    The study of Alizadeh and Nikoo [51] evaluated the performance of three advanced\n\
    fusion-based methodologies including the ordered weighted averaged (OWA) approach\n\
    based on the ORNESS weighting method (ORNESS-OWA) and ORLIKE weighting method\n\
    (ORLIKE-OWA) for drought estimation with the use of different remotely sensed\
    \ pre-\ncipitation data products (CHOMPS, GPCP, CMAP, PERSIANN-CDR, TRMM, GLDAS-2,\n\
    and MERRA-2). Their results showed that the ORNESS-OWA method had the highest\n\
    performance (MARE = 2.51% and R2 = 95%) in comparison with all other fusion-based\n\
    models, demonstrating an effective proﬁciency in drought estimation.\nTariq et\
    \ al. [52] showed the feasibility of detecting earthquake (EQ)-related anoma-\n\
    lies in the ionosphere with the use of the Temporal Electron Content (TEC) from\
    \ Global\nIonospheric Map TEC (GIMTEC) and ground-based dual-frequency GPS receivers.\
    \ They\nused data for three major (M > 7.0) earthquakes in Nepal and the Iran–Iraq\
    \ border from\n2015–2017. Their statistical procedures showed positive ionospheric\
    \ anomalies within\n10 days before all the major earthquakes.\n3.2.2. Water\n\
    The main focus of the 20 most highly cited articles in the thematic area of water\
    \ (Table 4)\nis on groundwater potential mapping (10 articles) and on groundwater\
    \ quality (7 articles\nMost of the EMMENA countries suffer from water scarcity\
    \ because of the semi-arid and\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n13 of 35\narid climate\
    \ which, combined with the population growth and the growing demand for\nwater,\
    \ creates an urgent need to further explore the potential groundwater resources\
    \ as\nan alternative [53–62]. Existing groundwater resources in EMMENA countries\
    \ (e.g., Iran,\nEgypt) have signiﬁcantly declined, both in terms of quality and\
    \ quantity [60,63–68]. Due to\nanthropogenic activities and mismanagement, groundwater\
    \ bodies in the EMMENA region\nface many threats such as brackish water [63–65],\
    \ poor water quality index [66], ﬂuoride\nand nitrate contamination [67,68], and\
    \ high levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) [60].\nAccording to Arabameri et\
    \ al. [54], due to the constant technical advancements in the ﬁeld\nof groundwater\
    \ potential mapping, there is no current agreement or reference on which\napproach\
    \ is more suitable to predict high groundwater potential. However, all studies\n\
    have in common the use of GIS and geostatistical methods, including different\
    \ models\nand algorithms. The studies used various sources of data (e.g., ALOS\
    \ PALSAR, ASTER,\nLandsat, ground-based) related to water quantity, land use/land\
    \ cover, soil and geology,\ndigital elevation, and morphological (e.g., slope,\
    \ aspect) and hydrological data (e.g., river\nnetwork). The choice of the input\
    \ data depends on the site-speciﬁc characteristics of each\nregion. All these\
    \ studies highlighted that the results will be useful for better water and\nland\
    \ management practices and policies.\nThe remaining studies in the water thematic\
    \ area focus on dam site selection [69],\nquantiﬁcation of irrigation water [70],\
    \ and on evapotranspiration estimates [71].\nJozaghi et al. [69] conducted a comparative\
    \ analysis of the analytic hierarchy process\n(AHP) and the technique for order\
    \ of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for\nthe optimum dam\
    \ site selection in Sistan and Baluchestan Province (Iran), with the use of\n\
    GIS. Their comparison was made based on geographic (geology, land use, sediment,\
    \ erosion,\nslope, groundwater, and discharge) and water quality (soluble sodium\
    \ percentage, total\ndissolved solids, potential of hydrogen, and electrical conductivity)\
    \ criteria. The authors\nreported that the TOPSIS method is better suited to the\
    \ problem of dam site selection for\nthis study area.\nJalilvand et al. [70] used\
    \ the SM2RAIN algorithm for the estimation of irrigation\nwater use at the southern\
    \ Urmia Lake catchment (Iran) based on satellite soil moisture\nobservations obtained\
    \ from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). They\nfound that the\
    \ simulated quantities of the irrigation water were consistent with the observed\n\
    data with an average R = 0.86 and RMSE = 12.89 mm/month. Zamani Losgedaragh and\n\
    Rahimzadegan [71] applied three different models (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm\n\
    for Land (SEBAL), Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC),\n\
    Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS)) to estimate the amount of evapotranspiration\
    \ over\nthe region of the Amirkabir dam reservoir (Iran). Sixteen Landsat 5 and\
    \ Landsat 8 satellite\nimages from 2011 to 2017 were used in these models to compute\
    \ evapotranspiration\nand the results were validated with ground truth pan evaporation\
    \ data. The authors\nfound good performance of the SEBS (R2: 0.62, RMSE: 0.93)\
    \ and METRIC (R2: 0.57,\nRMSE: 2.02 mm) models. On the contrary, the SEBAL model\
    \ showed poor performance\n(R2: 0.36, RMSE: 5.1 mm).\nTable 4. Research focus\

    \ area of agriculture cover a wide range of topics\nsuch as evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) estimation [73–76], land suitability for agriculture [77–83],\nirrigation\
    \ mapping [84], agricultural land loss [85], crop monitoring [86,87], crop production\n\
    and yield prediction [88,89], crop mapping [90], stem water potential monitoring\
    \ [91], and\ncrop water footprint estimation [92].\nAccurate assessment of water\
    \ use in agriculture is of critical importance due to the\nchanging climate and\
    \ increasing water scarcity. Thus, modeling crop water use is a powerful\ndecision\
    \ tool for agricultural policy decisionmakers to improve water use efﬁciency [92].\n\
    In their study on crop water footprint estimation, Elbeltagi et al. [92] modeled\
    \ the green\nand blue water footprints of maize by using an artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ (ANN) in major\nmaize-producing sites in Egypt, between 2006 and 2016. Meteorological\
    \ data were collected\nfrom the Climatic Research Unit Time Series and the Japanese\
    \ 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55)\nin NetCDF formats. Their model achieved high accuracy\
    \ with deviations between the\nactual and predicted water footprints ranging from\
    \ −2.6 to 6.6% and from −2.4 to 3.2% for\nthe blue and green water footprints,\
    \ respectively.\nRepresentative and accurate evapotranspiration maps are needed\
    \ to achieve the plan-\nning and management of sustainable water use in water-scarce\
    \ regions, such as the EM-\nMENA region [76]. Jamshidi et al. [74] compared four\
    \ different evapotranspiration meth-\nods, including ET estimates from reanalysis\
    \ data (NCEP, ERA-Interim, ERA5), MODIS\nET datasets, Landsat-based ET models\
    \ (METRIC, SEBS), and in situ measurements, from\n2009 to 2014, in southern Iran.\
    \ The authors reported 4.6% overestimation and 11.4% un-\nderestimation of ET\
    \ with the METRIC and SEBS models, respectively. Huang et al. [73]\nreported that\
    \ actual evapotranspiration in daily time steps predicted based on the SEBAL\n\
    method is underestimated for barley, cucumber, chickpea, and alfalfa and overestimated\
    \ for\nwheat, potato, onion, lentil, bean, and maize and is close to the calculated\
    \ values of SWB for\ntomato, colza, and sugar beet. Furthermore, Rahimzadegana\
    \ and Janani [75] showed good\nefﬁciency of the SEBAL model for estimating the\
    \ actual ET of pistachio. Mahmoud and\nGan [76] computed the actual evapotranspiration\
    \ (AET) over the central region of Saudi\nArabia from 1950–2013, based on meteorological\
    \ data and on crop coefﬁcients (Kc) which\nwere modeled as a function of a 16-day\
    \ time-series MODIS normalized difference vege-\ntation index (NDVI). They reported\
    \ that annual AET estimated by the soil water balance\nmodel was between 9 and\
    \ 11% higher than the modeled AET. The studies emphasized the\nneed for high-quality\
    \ in situ data in future studies to improve the model’s performance.\nLand suitability\
    \ studies were conducted both with GIS and multi-criteria decision-\nmaking analysis\
    \ for wheat (Turkey), Citrus (Turkey, Morocco), legumes (Morocco), maize\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n15 of 35\n(Iran), soybean (Iran), rapeseed (Iran), barley\
    \ (Iran), olives (Morocco), and jojoba (UAE)\ncrops. The studies reported that\
    \ their ﬁndings can help in improving the management of\ncrop production and that\
    \ future studies should expand on different crops and soil types.\nIn their study\
    \ on soil moisture and irrigation mapping in Tunisia, Bousbih et al. [84]\npresented\
    \ a new technique based on the synergistic interpretation of multi-temporal optical\n\
    and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1). Their approach\
    \ is\nbased on the inversion of the water cloud model, using radar data and NDVI\
    \ data derived\nfrom optical images. Their results showed an RMSE of 4.3% and\
    \ a bias of 1.9% between the\nsatellite and observed data.\nCrop production and\
    \ yield prediction using remotely sensed data are generally scarce\nin the EMMENA\
    \ region due to the inter-annual variation in meteorological factors com-\nbined\
    \ with anthropogenic factors (such as war conflicts) [88]. In the study on barley\
    \ yield\nprediction in Iran, Sharifi [89] combined vegetation indices (NDVI and\
    \ EVI) derived from\nSentinel-2 data, barley yield data, and four algorithms,\
    \ including a backpropagation neural\nnetwork, decision tree, K-nearest neighbor,\
    \ and Gaussian process regression. The latter\nalgorithm had the highest performance\
    \ (r2 = 0.84) and estimated yield with a root mean\nsquare error of 737 kg ha−1\
    \ and mean absolute error of 650 kg ha−1. Qader et al. [88] devel-\noped an empirical\
    \ regression-based model to forecast winter wheat and barley production\nin Iraq,\
    \ based on MODIS satellite data and in situ crop data. They found that the highest\n\
    accuracy (R2 = 0.70) is achieved when the vegetation index (VI) is at the maximum.\
    \ Crop\ngrowth dynamic observations from satellites are often limited by the coarse\
    \ spatial and\ntemporal resolutions. To address this issue, Nguyen et al. [87]\
    \ proposed the use of data from\ndifferent ongoing satellite missions of Sentinel-2\
    \ (ESA) and Landsat 7/8 (NASA) through\nharmonization techniques. They found that\
    \ improved topographic correction models are\nneeded to achieve higher performance\
    \ of the harmonized products in mountainous areas.\nSadeh et al. [86] developed\
    \ a new method to fuse a time series of images sourced from\ntwo different satellite\
    \ constellations (Sentinel-2, Planetscope) which combines the advan-\ntages of\
    \ each satellite (high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution). This new technique\n\
    was applied to create spectrally consistent daily images of wheat LAI at a 3 m\
    \ resolution\nwhich were then compared with in situ wheat LAI measurements from\
    \ Australia and Israel.\nTheir approach successfully estimated LAI (R2 = 0.94)\
    \ throughout the growing season for\nLAI < 3.\nAshourloo et al. [90] examined\
    \ the potential of automatic mapping of canola\n(Brassica napus L.) using time\
    \ series of Sentinel-2 images. They found that multiplication\nof the near-infrared\
    \ (NIR) band by the sum of red and green bands is an efﬁcient index to\nidentify\
    \ canola during the ﬂowering stage. The kappa and overall accuracy (OA) were more\n\
    than 0.75 and 88%, respectively. Furthermore, Helman et al. [91] examined the\
    \ relationship\nbetween stem water potential and four vegetation indices (GNDVI,\
    \ NDVI, EVI, and SAVI)\nin Mediterranean vineyards (Israel) through the use of\
    \ high spatial resolution Planetscope\nimages. The authors highlighted that SAVI\
    \ displayed a slightly better correlation with\nstem water potential than the\
    \ other three indices, likely due to its capacity for reducing\nsoil effects.\n\
    Urban expansion has critical consequences for agricultural production in the EM-\n\
    MENA region. Radwan et al. [85] analyzed 24 LULC maps from the European Space\n\
    Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) land cover viewer (http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.\n\
    be/CCI/viewer/, accessed on 13 March 2023) and found that 74,600 hectares of fertile\n\
    agricultural land in the Nile Delta (Old Lands) was lost due to urban expansion\
    \ from\n1992 to 2015 at an average rate of 3108 ha year−1. Also, 206,100 hectares\
    \ of bare land\nwas converted to agricultural land at an average rate of 8588\
    \ ha year−1. According to\nthe authors, more sustainable land use strategies are\
    \ needed to minimize the threats to\nagricultural sustainability and food security.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n16 of 35\n3.2.4. Land\nLand degradation due to soil\
    \ erosion is one of the major problems which the EMMENA\nregion is facing as highlighted\
    \ by most of the studies in the land thematic area [93–99].\nJazouli et al. [99]\
    \ integrated the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) in a GIS\nenvironment\
    \ to quantify soil loss and to map erosion risk of the Oum Er Rbia River basin,\n\
    located in the Middle Atlas (Morocco), for 2013, 2013, and 2017. For their analysis,\
    \ they\nused satellite images of Sentinel-2A, Landsat Oli-8, and ETM and applied\
    \ cellular automata\nMarkov to forecast the land use/land cover map and to detect\
    \ the associated changes.\nTheir results showed an estimated annual soil loss\
    \ of 58 t ha−1 yr−1 in 2003, while the\npredicted annual soil loss for 2030 increased\
    \ to 142 t ha−1 yr−1. Different techniques can be\nfound in the literature for\
    \ creation of soil erosion susceptibility maps. Ameri et al. [98] used\nfour different\
    \ multi-criteria decision-making models (SAW, VIKOR, TOPSIS, and CF) and\nconcluded\
    \ that the VIKOR method has higher predictive accuracy than TOPSIS, SAW, and\n\
    CF models for the Ghaemshahr Basin in Iran. They used the Advanced Space Thermal\
    \ Emis-\nsion Radiometer (ASTER) digital elevation model (DEM) with spatial resolution\
    \ of 30 m\nfor the extraction and analysis of 23 morphometric parameters. Arabameri\
    \ et al. [94] evalu-\nated the performance of three data-driven models (frequency\
    \ ratio, weights of evidence,\nindex of entropy) and the AHP knowledge-based technique\
    \ for gully erosion susceptibility\nmapping in the Toroud watershed (Iran). Morphological\
    \ and land use parameters were\nderived from ALOS PALSAR and Landsat 8 satellite\
    \ images. All four models showed\nexcellent accuracy in prediction of areas prone\
    \ to gully erosion. Zabihi et al. [97] tested\nthe same models in the Valasht\
    \ watershed (Iran) and found that the frequency ratio model\nhad better performance\
    \ (80.4%) than the weight of evidence (79.5%) and index of entropy\n(79%) for\
    \ erosion mapping. In another study, Arabameri et al. [95] studied the performance\n\
    of three algorithms (random forest, boosted regression tree, and multi-variate\
    \ adaptive\nregression spline) for gully erosion susceptibility mapping in the\
    \ Shahroud watershed, Iran.\nLandsat 8 and ASTER GDEM data were used in their\
    \ analysis. According to the authors,\nthe random forest model had the highest\
    \ prediction accuracy. Similar high performance for\nthe random forest algorithm\
    \ was reported by Garosi et al. [96]. Finally, Arabameri et al. [93]\nproposed\
    \ a new model which combines the geographically weighted regression technique\n\
    with the certainty factor and random forest models to produce gully erosion zonation\n\
    mapping. The proper selection of the data in these studies depends on their availability\
    \ and\nsite-speciﬁc characteristics.\nInformation about the location, extent,\
    \ and type of land use/land cover (LULC) is\nessential for improving land management\
    \ practices [100]. Mansour et al. [101] applied\nadvanced GIS techniques, spatial\
    \ modeling, and utilization of satellite images (Landsat 5/8)\nto simulate LULC\
    \ changes and to predict the urban expansion in the mountainous cities of\nOman,\
    \ for the years 2028 and 2038. Their predictions showed a 50% increase in the\
    \ built-up\narea in 2038; on the contrary, vegetation will decrease by 36.5%.\
    \ Ghorbanian et al. [100]\ndeveloped an object-based land cover classiﬁcation\
    \ methodology using the Google Earth\nEngine in order to improve the land cover\
    \ map of Iran. They used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\nimagery data for the fusion\
    \ of SAR and multi-spectral data to increase the land cover\nclassiﬁcation accuracy.\
    \ The land cover map for Iran (2017) had an overall accuracy of 95.6%.\nMohajane\
    \ et al. [102] studied the vegetation change in Azrou Forest (Morocco) between\n\
    1987 and 2017. They combined Landsat images (MSS, ETM+, TM, OLI) and used the\
    \ NDVI\nand ground-based survey to improve the discrimination between LULC categories.\
    \ Land\ncover maps for each year were produced with the maximum likelihood (ML)\
    \ classiﬁcation\nmethod. The authors reported high classiﬁcation accuracies and\
    \ showed that the total\nforest cover over the 30-year period remained stable.\
    \ Rasul et al. [103] developed the dry\nbuilt-up index (DBI) and dry bare-soil\
    \ index (DBSI) to map built-up and bare areas in\ndry climates with the use of\
    \ Landsat 8 images. The results from the city of Erbil (Iraq)\nshowed an overall\
    \ classiﬁcation accuracy of 93% (κ = 0.86) and 92% (κ = 0.84) for DBI and\nDBSI,\
    \ respectively.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n17 of 35\nRapid and extensive urbanization\
    \ over the past few decades has led to changes in the\nmicroclimate of urban environments\
    \ [104]. Urban regions experience warmer temperatures\nby absorbing a greater\
    \ amount of solar radiation than their natural rural surroundings,\na phenomenon\
    \ well known as urban heat island (UHI). Shirani et al. [104] used satellite\n\
    images of Landsat 7 ETM+ (1999 and 2006) and Landsat 8 (2013 and 2016) to retrieve\n\
    the Earth surface temperature of Isfahan (Iran). Their results showed an increase\
    \ in the\nminimum temperature of 2016 compared to 1999 and that the heat island\
    \ ratio followed a\nrising trend, moving from 0.16 (1999) to 0.3 (2016). Similarly,\
    \ the study of Weng et al. [105]\nshowed that surface urban heat island intensity\
    \ in the city of Babol (Iran) increased signiﬁ-\ncantly (24%) during the period\
    \ from 1985 to 2017. Cetin et al. [106] found a temperature\ndifference between\
    \ urban high building density areas and other terrestrial areas, ranging\nfrom\
    \ 0.4 to 2.5 ◦C.\nKnowledge about the distribution of soil properties over the\
    \ landscape is required for\na variety of land management applications and resources,\
    \ modeling, and monitoring prac-\ntices [107,108]. Amazirh et al. [109] developed\
    \ a method for retrieving surface soil moisture\nat a high spatiotemporal resolution,\
    \ by combining Sentinel-1 (S1) microwave and Landsat\n7/8 thermal data. The authors\
    \ reported a root mean square difference between satellite and\nin situ soil moisture\
    \ of 0.03 m3m−3. Zeraatpisheh et al. [107] used the normalized difference\nvegetation\
    \ index (NDVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), perpendicular vegetation index\n\
    (PVI), clay index (CI), Landsat image band 4 (B4), and soil adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (SAVI),\nderived from the Landsat enhanced thematic mapper, in order to\
    \ predict and compare\nthe spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC),\
    \ calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE),\nand clay content by using different machine\
    \ learning techniques (Cubist, random forest,\nregression tree, and a multiple\
    \ linear regression) in Iran. Their results showed that the\nhighest and the lowest\
    \ prediction accuracies were obtained for clay and SOC using random\nforest and\
    \ random tree models, respectively. Fathololoumi et al. [110] showed that the\
    \ use\nof dynamic (multi-temporal) satellite data fusion, rather than static,\
    \ can greatly improve\nsoil modeling and mapping.\nAccurate measurements of aboveground\
    \ forest biomass are crucial for estimating forest\ncarbon stocks and for regional,\
    \ sustainable land use planning. Vafaei et al. [111] applied ma-\nchine learning\
    \ techniques in order to improve the forest aboveground biomass estimation.\n\
    They generated three datasets including the Sentinel-2A dataset, the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2\n\
    dataset, and the combination of the Sentinel-2A dataset and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2\
    \ dataset\n(Sentinel-ALOS). They found that aboveground biomass models derived\
    \ from the combina-\ntion of the Sentinel-2A and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data had\
    \ the highest accuracy, followed\nby models using the Sentinel-2A dataset and\
    \ the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset.\n3.2.5. Disaster Risk Reduction\nDisaster risk\
    \ reduction is the thematic area with the highest average number of cita-\ntions\
    \ per thematic area for the top 20 cited papers (Figure 7). The focus of these\
    \ papers is\non landslides [112–122] and on ﬂoods [118,123–125].\nLandslides are\
    \ often catastrophic natural hazards leading to loss of life, damage to\nproperties,\
    \ and economic disruption [113]. All the studies on landslides have in common\n\
    the coupling of machine learning (or artiﬁcial neural network) algorithms with\
    \ spatial data\ntypes. The data used in these studies can be categorized into\
    \ ﬁve main categories: topo-\ngraphical (e.g., aspect, slope, elevation), hydrological\
    \ (e.g., rainfall, river density), lithologi-\ncal (e.g., lithology, faults),\
    \ land cover (e.g., NDVI), and anthropogenic (e.g., road density).\nTopographical\
    \ and land cover data are often derived from satellite images. However, the\n\
    source of these data was not provided in most studies. According to Merghadi et\
    \ al. [113],\ntree-based ensemble algorithms achieve excellent results compared\
    \ to other machine learn-\ning algorithms for landslide susceptibility mapping.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the random forest al-\ngorithm offers robust performance for accurate\
    \ landslide susceptibility mapping with\nonly a small number of adjustments required\
    \ before training the model. The studies of\nPourghasemi and Rahmadi [117], Youssef\
    \ and Pourghasemi [122], Arabameri et al. [121],\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n\
    18 of 35\nand Achour and Pourghasemi [119] reported similar robust performance\
    \ for the random\nforest algorithm for landslide susceptibility assessment. Tien\
    \ Bui et al. [126] applied the\nmetaheuristic algorithm Harris hawks optimization\
    \ (HHO) in order to improve the per-\nformance of the artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ (ANN) for landslide susceptibility assessment in\nwestern Iran. The authors\
    \ found that the HHO algorithm improved the performance of the\nANN in both recognizing\
    \ and predicting the landslide patterns. Shirzadi et al. [127] showed\nthat the\
    \ use of a hybrid approach of alternative tree decision and ensemble algorithms\n\
    (rotation forest and multi-boost) will improve the predictions of landslide susceptibility\n\
    due to decreasing noise and over-ﬁtting problems. According to Reichenbach et\
    \ al. [112],\nfor the preparation of landslide susceptibility assessment there\
    \ are nine steps that need\nto be considered, which include obtaining relevant\
    \ landslide and thematic information,\nselecting the appropriate mapping unit\
    \ and model, evaluating model ﬁtting and predictive\nperformance, estimating model\
    \ uncertainty, ranking model quality, and designing the land-\nslide protocol.\
    \ Future studies should consider these steps and focus on the development of\n\
    landslide early warning systems at different geographical scales.\nRemote Sens.\

    \  \n4.1. EO Studies in the EMMENA Region \nOver the past years, there has been\
    \ an increasing trend in EO research in the \nEMMENA region (Figure 8). However,\
    \ the number of EO studies in the EMMENA region \nrepresents only 3% of the EO\
    \ studies carried out worldwide. Also, as we have shown in \nTable 2, the amount\
    \ of EO research is highly uneven between countries within the \nEMMENA region.\
    \ Iran is the most active EMMENA country in terms of EO publications, \nas shown\
    \ both from the number of publications and the author aﬃliations. However, from\
    \ \nour analysis we found that almost half of the studies were conducted by researchers\
    \ not \naﬃliated with the EMMENA region. We assume that, to some extent, the barrier\
    \ for the \nexpansion of EO research can be attributed to the lack of collaborations\
    \ and knowledge \ntransfer within EMMENA countries. Towards this direction, the\
    \ recent establishment of a \nCentre of Excellence acting as a digital innovation\
    \ hub for EO in the EMMENA region is \na signiﬁcant advancement in expanding EO\
    \ research and in seeking future collaborations \nand knowledge transfer schemes\
    \ among the EMMENA countries [211]. \nThe plethora of satellite data currently\
    \ available are usually scattered among \ndiﬀerent platforms (Table 3), resulting\
    \ in more time and work needed for data collection \nand preprocessing [18]. The\
    \ development of a user-friendly central data hub (or data \ncubes) can resolve\
    \ this issue. An example of such a central data hub is the GEO-CRADLE \nEU project\
    \ which facilitates access to and sharing of geospatial data and information \n\
    collected from satellites and ground based networks in the North Africa Middle\
    \ East and\nFigure 7. Average number of citations per thematic area (top 20 highly\

    \ derived from the Aster digital elevation model (DEM) of 30m resolution and the\
    \ land\nuse and NDVI maps were extracted from Landsat 8 Operational Land Image\
    \ (OLI). Their\nresults showed that all models have good performances in ﬂood\
    \ susceptibility assessment,\nwith the ADT model having the highest predictive\
    \ capability. Tien Bui et al. [126] com-\nbined the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference\
    \ system (ANFIS) with two GIS-based ensemble\nartiﬁcial intelligence approaches,\
    \ the imperialistic competitive algorithm (ICA) and the\nﬁreﬂy algorithm (FA),\
    \ for ﬂood spatial modeling and mapping applications in the Haraz\nwatershed (Iran).\
    \ The ten factors included in their analysis were slope angle, elevation,\nstream\
    \ power index (SPI), curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, rainfall,\n\
    land use, stream density, and the distance to river. The results showed high prediction\n\
    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n19 of 35\naccuracy of the two ensemble models with\
    \ values of MSE and RMSE for ANFIS-ICA\nand ANFIS-FA equal to 0.41 and 0.35 and\
    \ 0.169 and 0.129, respectively. According to\nAhmadlou et al. [123], ﬂood occurrence\
    \ is mainly affected by plan curvature, followed by\naltitude, geology, distance\
    \ to river, slope, soil, land use, rainfall, and aspect. A range of\nmodels and\
    \ machine learning techniques have been applied in order to improve the ﬂood\n\
    susceptibility mapping [118,125,126,128–131]. However, future studies should focus\
    \ on\nthe development of ﬂood forecasting and warning systems which is essential\
    \ in order to\nminimize the ﬂood hazards [124].\n3.2.6. Cultural Heritage\nEO\
    \ within the culture heritage thematic area includes detection, monitoring, mapping,\n\
    and management of archaeological sites [132–140], looting detection [141,142],\
    \ and other\nthreats to cultural heritage sites [143–149].\nThe studies on detection,\
    \ monitoring, and management employed various satellite\ndata (Corona, Landsat,\
    \ Spot, Quickbird, Sentinel-2A, COSMO-SkyMed) and reported that\nthere is a need\
    \ for further development of machine and deep learning techniques in or-\nder\
    \ to automate feature extraction and pattern detection in very high-resolution\
    \ (VHR)\nimages [132,134]. Soroush et al. [134] tested the application of deep\
    \ convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for automated remote sensing detection\
    \ of qanat systems in the Erbil\nPlain (Iraq), with the use of Corona imagery.\
    \ They demonstrated that even with small\ndatasets, deep learning can be successfully\
    \ applied to automate the detection of qanat\nshafts. According to Bachagha et\
    \ al. [137], the combined use of LiDAR, aerial photographs,\nhistorical records,\
    \ and satellite images will further enhance the investigation of ancient sites.\n\
    By screening long Sentinel-2 time series for Aleppo and Apamea, Tapete and Cigna\
    \ [132]\nshowed that changes in textural properties and surface reﬂectance can\
    \ be associated with\nevents relevant for conservation. Tapete and Cigna [133]\
    \ also suggested the use of COSMO-\nSkyMed data for condition assessment of archaeological\
    \ heritage and landscape disturbance\ndue to their capabilities for very high\
    \ spatial resolution images and for site revisit of up to\none day. Stott et al.\
    \ [139] applied airborne laser scanning (ALS) remote sensing and pho-\ntogrammetric\
    \ techniques, including enhancing local topographic contrast for archaeological\n\
    interpretation, residual relief modeling, sky view factor, and local dominance,\
    \ and they\nwere able to accurately map known archaeological features and to detect\
    \ a wide variety of\npreviously unrecorded potential features. A major issue for\
    \ the preservation of archaeolog-\nical areas appears to be urban and agriculture\
    \ sprawling [132,135,139,143–145]. With the\nuse of multi-temporal and multi-sensor\
    \ satellite data (Corona, Landsat, Spot, Quickbird,\nand Sentinel-2A), Elfadaly\
    \ et al. [135] showed that urban fabric continuously expanded\nfrom 1984 to 2017,\
    \ posing a severe threat at the Theban temples at west Luxor (Egypt).\nLasaponara\
    \ and Masini [142] introduced an automatic method for an archaeological\nlooting\
    \ feature extraction approach (ALFEA) which is based on looting enhancement\n\
    using spatial autocorrelation, unsupervised classiﬁcation, and segmentation. For\
    \ their\nanalysis, they used images available from Google Earth. Their results\
    \ from the evaluation\nprocedure showed satisfactory performance from two analyzed\
    \ test cases with a rate of\nsuccess higher than 90%. According to the review\
    \ study by Tapete and Cigna [141], a\nvariety of satellite data were used for\
    \ the detection of archaeological looting, such as HR\nmulti-spectral imagery\
    \ from Sentinel-2, VHR X-band SAR data from COSMO-SkyMed,\nVHR panchromatic and\
    \ multi-spectral WorldView-2 imagery, and VHR optical data from\nGeoEye-1, IKONOS-2,\
    \ QuickBird-2, and WorldView-3; 89% of the studies on looting\ndetection exploited\
    \ optical images and the majority of these studies used VHR images (less\nthan\
    \ 1 m resolution). According to the authors, the use of open high-resolution (HR)\
    \ data\n(e.g., Sentinel-2 and Landsat) is still at the early stage. Currently,\
    \ there is lack of common\npractices in the domain of looting detection from space,\
    \ thus there is a need to move toward\nsharing and harmonization of methodologies.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n20 of 35\nApart from looting and urbanization described\
    \ above, remote sensing techniques have\nalso been applied in other domains which\
    \ may threaten cultural heritage sites such as\nerosion [146,148], earthquakes\
    \ [149], ﬂooding [147], and salt weathering [144].\n3.2.7. Energy\nThe majority\
    \ of the top 20 highly cited articles in the energy thematic area focus\non the\
    \ spatial assessment of the energy potential and on the location selection for\
    \ en-\nergy plants [150–166]. Thirteen of these studies focus on solar energy\
    \ (photovoltaics,\nconcentrating solar power), two studies focus on wind energy,\
    \ and two studies focus on\nbioethanol/biogas. The three remaining studies focus\
    \ on techno-economical assessment of\nenergy resources [167,168] and on the design\
    \ optimization of off-grid hybrid renewable\nenergy systems [169]. The geographical\
    \ focus of the studies was on Iran (nine studies),\nMorocco (four studies), Egypt\
    \ (two studies), Turkey (two studies), Algeria (one study), and\nSaudi Arabia\
    \ (one study).\nIn their study on the spatial assessment of solar energy potential\
    \ at a global scale,\nPravalie et al. [157] analyzed the solar radiation distribution\
    \ and intensity based on global\nhorizontal irradiation (GHI) and direct normal\
    \ irradiation (DNI) data. They found that\nmost of the countries located in the\
    \ EMMENA region (Saharan countries and countries\nlocated in the Arabian Peninsula)\
    \ present superb (maximum) solar potential, thus there\nare opportunities for\
    \ developing solar energy at a national or international (regional)\nlevel. However,\
    \ there are additional factors that can affect solar power generation in this\n\
    region, such as dust particles and dust storms, high air temperatures, insufﬁcient\
    \ ﬁnancial\nresources, and political instability or war conﬂicts.\nEleven studies\
    \ in the spatial assessment of the energy potential and on the location\nselection\
    \ for energy plants combined GIS and multi-criteria decision models (Table 5).\n\
    The assessment of the energy potential and the location of energy plants includes\
    \ a range\nof criteria such as climatic (e.g., solar radiation, sunshine, land\
    \ surface temperature),\nmorphological (e.g., slope and aspect), locational (e.g.,\
    \ distance from cities, roads, and\nelectricity grid), land cover, and hydrological\
    \ (e.g., distance from dams and groundwater)\ncriteria [150–153,158,159]. The\
    \ criteria for the assessment of the offshore wind energy\npotential include,\
    \ among others, wind characteristics, water depth, soil substrate, and\ndistance\
    \ from the shoreline, military areas, parks, submerged cables, shipping routes,\n\
    and ﬁshing areas [155,156]. Finally, the criteria for bioethanol facility location\
    \ selection\ninclude social (e.g., policies, work force, societal impact, quality\
    \ of life), environmental\n(e.g., ecologically sensitive areas), and economic\
    \ (e.g., investment, maintenance, and opera-\ntion costs) criteria [154].\nTable\

    Marine safety and security is the thematic area with the lowest average number\
    \ of\ncitations per thematic area for the top 20 highly cited papers (Figure 7).\
    \ Studies include oil\nspill detection and assessment [170–177], marine habitat\
    \ mapping [178], toxicity assessment\nof heavy metals [179], environmental pollution\
    \ of coastal zones [180], detection of ﬂoating\nplastic litter [181–183], marine\
    \ mucilage monitoring [184], ecology of sea turtles [185–187],\nhabitat suitability\
    \ model for Posidonia oceanica [188], characterization of natural hydrocar-\n\
    bon seepage [189], and relative sea-level rise and potential submersion risk [190].\n\
    Oil pollution is among the major maritime environmental disasters and has become\
    \ a\nworldwide concern due to the increasing rate of offshore oil production and\
    \ transport [177].\nAbou Samra et al. mapped and examined the oceanographic parameters\
    \ that may affect\noil pollution dispersion along the offshore zone of the Nile\
    \ Delta with the use of GIS\ntechniques. They analyzed data of wave patterns,\
    \ bathymetry, sea surface temperature\n(SST), chlorophyll content, phytoplankton\
    \ concentration, and organic carbon concentration.\nThey found that oil spills\
    \ along the offshore region are primarily inﬂuenced by bathymetry\nand SST. Chaturverdi\
    \ et al. [173] and El-Magd et al. [175] used SAR data from Sentinel-1\nsatellites\
    \ to detect and map oil spills in the Al Khafji area (Saudi Arabia) and in the\
    \ coastal\nwaters of Egypt. Their results demonstrated the capability of utilizing\
    \ Sentinel-1 for oil spill\ndetection and mapping. Arslan [172] analyzed Sentinel-1\
    \ data to detect an oil spill caused\nby a ship on 18 December 2016 off the coast\
    \ of Ildır Bay (Izmir, Turkey). Furthermore,\nLandsat 8 data were used for validation\
    \ purposes by estimating brightness temperatures to\nobserve oil spill changes\
    \ in temperature on the sea surface. Park et al. [171] combined very\nhigh-resolution\
    \ satellite images (Planetscope) with an artiﬁcial neural network technique\n\
    to detect an oil spill accident that occurred on 10 August 2017 near the Ras Al\
    \ Zour area\n(Kuwait). The accuracy and kappa coefﬁcient of the oil classiﬁcation\
    \ map obtained from\nthe optical image were 82.01% and 72.42%, respectively. Future\
    \ studies should focus on\nsatellite data of higher temporal resolution to verify\
    \ the results with in situ or satellite SAR\ndata and to develop better algorithms\
    \ for rejecting low-probability pixels and dust. Finally,\nthere is a need to\
    \ develop a near-real-time warning and alarm system for oil spill cases as a\n\
    service, which can help to identify the ship or platform that is liable for the\
    \ pollution [175].\nMateos-Molina et al. [178] analyzed a variety of different\
    \ data sources, including\nSentinel-2 and DubaiSat-2 imagery, and mapped the spatial\
    \ distribution of coastal marine\nhabitats in the north-western United Arab Emirates\
    \ (UAE). Their multiple data analysis\napproach overcame the limitation of turbid\
    \ waters and habitat seasonality with an overall\naccuracy of 77%.\nIvanov et\
    \ al. [189] studied the hydrocarbon seep characteristics and their relation\n\
    to the local hydrocarbon ﬁeld or potential hydrocarbon reservoirs in the South\
    \ Caspian\nsea (Iran). They analyzed SAR images (Sentinel-1) together with bathymetry\
    \ and geo-\nlogical and geophysical data with GIS. Their results showed that the\
    \ oil slicks have a\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n22 of 35\nnatural origin, related\
    \ to the bottom seepage phenomenon and associated with an existing\nhydrocarbon\
    \ system.\nFatehian et al. [180] designed and implemented an integrated volunteered\
    \ geographic\ninformation (VGI)-based system based on coastal pollution management\
    \ concepts and\npublic participation in order to monitor coastal pollution in\
    \ the port city of Nowshahr\n(Mazandaran Province, Iran). Tourists, residents,\
    \ and other present individuals were\nasked to report observable pollutants at\
    \ their location; 86% of the reports referred to the\naccumulation of garbage,\
    \ while 10% and 4% of the remaining reports were related to\nwastewater pollution\
    \ and oil contaminants, respectively. According to the authors, future\nwork should\
    \ focus on the integration of spatial decision support systems (SDSSs) in the\n\
    existing tool to improve coastal pollution management.\nEl-Alfy et al. [179] used\
    \ Landsat OLI images, synchronized with the sampling time\nof water and sediment\
    \ samples, to assess the toxicity of heavy metals and organochlorine\npesticides\
    \ in freshwater and marine environments in the Rosetta area (Egypt). They\nfound\
    \ that drainage canals, cultivations, and urbanized zones were the major sources\
    \ of\ncontamination in the studied area. They recommended biological treatment\
    \ processes such\nas using naturally grown plants like Phragmites australis in\
    \ the contaminated sites.\nThe increasing level of marine plastic pollution poses\
    \ severe threats to marine\necosystems, thus cost-effective solutions for identifying\
    \ plastic litter are essential.\nThemistocleous et al. [181] examined the potential\
    \ of detection of ﬂoating plastic litter by\nintroducing the plastic index (PI)\
    \ and reversed normalized difference vegetation index\n(RNDVI), based on the Sentinel-2\
    \ B08 (842 nm) and B04 (665 nm) bands. They found\nthat Sentinel-2 satellite images\
    \ were effective in identifying plastic clusters in the sea,\nthrough the high\
    \ reﬂectance of solar radiation at NIR wavelengths. They highlighted that\nfuture\
    \ research should focus on the use of Sentinel-1 SAR images for the identiﬁcation\
    \ of\nplastic litter in the sea. Sannigrahi et al. [182] combined Sentinel-2 imagery\
    \ with machine\nlearning algorithms (support vector machine and random forest)\
    \ for the development\nof an automated marine ﬂoating plastic detection system.\
    \ The authors found that the\nrandom forest algorithm performed better than the\
    \ support vector machine, as it detected\nﬂoating plastic from real-world data\
    \ collected from Calabria and Beirut with 91% accuracy.\nZhou et al. [183] combined\
    \ WorldView-3 satellite data with a knowledge-based classiﬁer\nand concluded that\
    \ this approach is efﬁcient and reliable for monitoring and identifying\nplastic\
    \ materials. Global warming and human activities have caused abrupt changes in\n\
    marine ecosystems. Yagci et al. [184] investigated the potential of using the\
    \ coarse spatial\nresolution MODIS products for mucilage detection and monitoring\
    \ in the Sea of Marmara\n(Turkey). The validation carried out with the reference\
    \ mucilage datasets derived from\nSentinel-2A imagery and with in situ spectroradiometer\
    \ measurements showed that the\nproduced MODIS-based maps accurately depicted\
    \ the mucilage-covered areas. Bakirman\nand Gumusay [188] combined GIS, MCDM,\
    \ and remote sensing techniques (SPOT 7 optical\nimagery) for the identiﬁcation\
    \ of suitable habitats for Posidonia oceanica in Gulluk Bay,\nTurkey. The authors\
    \ used the following criteria: depth, sheltered area, slope, sediment\nyield,\
    \ and topographic position index. Their model identiﬁed suitable habitats for\
    \ seagrass\nwith an overall accuracy of 76%. Human activities have resulted in\
    \ negative effects on\nsea turtle populations in the Mediterranean, thus sufﬁcient\
    \ conservation and monitoring\nefforts are essential [187]. Towards this direction,\
    \ satellite telemetry and conventional GPS\ndata loggers have been proven to be\
    \ valuable tools for mapping the spatial ecology of\nsea turtles [185,186]. Antonioli\
    \ et al. [190] studied the relative sea-level rise and potential\nsubmersion risk\
    \ for 2100 on 16 coastal plains of the Mediterranean Sea (France, Spain,\nTunisia,\
    \ Cyprus) by analyzing LiDAR data and different climate projection scenarios.\
    \ They\nestimated a potential loss of land for the above areas between about 148\
    \ km2 for the IPCC-\nRCP8.5 scenario and 192 km2 for the Rahmstorf scenario, impacting\
    \ a coastline length of\nabout 400 km. However, the low resolution (25 m × 25\
    \ m) of the digital terrain model map\nof Cyprus prevented any further detailed\
    \ coastal hazard assessment.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n23 of 35\n3.2.9. Big\

    \ the past years, there has been an increasing trend in EO research in the EMMENA\n\
    region (Figure 8). However, the number of EO studies in the EMMENA region represents\n\
    only 3% of the EO studies carried out worldwide. Also, as we have shown in Table\
    \ 2,\nthe amount of EO research is highly uneven between countries within the\
    \ EMMENA\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n24 of 35\nregion. Iran is the most active\
    \ EMMENA country in terms of EO publications, as shown\nboth from the number of\
    \ publications and the author afﬁliations. However, from our\nanalysis we found\
    \ that almost half of the studies were conducted by researchers not\nafﬁliated\
    \ with the EMMENA region. We assume that, to some extent, the barrier for the\n\
    expansion of EO research can be attributed to the lack of collaborations and knowledge\n\
    transfer within EMMENA countries. Towards this direction, the recent establishment\
    \ of a\nCentre of Excellence acting as a digital innovation hub for EO in the\
    \ EMMENA region is a\nsigniﬁcant advancement in expanding EO research and in seeking\
    \ future collaborations\nand knowledge transfer schemes among the EMMENA countries\

    \ Gaps, and Future Directions  \nA general limitation on EO research which was\
    \ identiﬁed in all thematic areas is the \nlack of in situ (ground truth) data.\
    \ This issue has many implications such as on the vali-\ndation of the EO outputs\
    \ and on the further development of algorithms and models. The \nincreasing number\
    \ of countries and organizations adopting open data policies will par-\ntially\
    \ resolve this issue, but inevitably there is a need for research infrastructure\

    \ range of EO applications in the thematic area of atmos-\nphere. Similar to the\
    \ ﬁndings of Imane et al. [30], we found that many studies in the EM-\nMENA focused\
    \ on dust (PM10/PM2.5), as this is a common problem among these countries. \n\
    Also, most of the EMMENA countries are situated in water-scarce semi-arid and\
    \ arid cli-\nmate zones. Thus, as expected, EO research on precipitation estimates\
    \ has a high research \nimpact. In addition to this, the rise and peak of the\
    \ coronavirus pandemic occurred within \nthe period selected for this review,\
    \ thus many studies related to the virus outbreak re-\nceived high research interest.\
    \ Future studies on the thematic area of atmosphere should \nfocus on the development\
    \ of EO methods for improved monitoring of air quality [30]. \nMost studies in\
    \ the water thematic area focus on groundwater research, as shown \nboth by the\
    \ article review and the results of the citation topics. However, there is a range\
    \ \nof topics where EO applications can contribute such as monitoring the water\
    \ level of lakes, \ndams, and rivers with satellite radar altimeters and identifying\
    \ the presence of diﬀerent \nsubstances in water based on their unique spectral\
    \ signatures, which can be measured by \nsatellites with thermal and optical sensors\
    \ and provide further information on water qual-\nity parameters (e.g., chlorophyll-a,\
    \ total suspended sediments, colored dissolved organic \nmatter) [212]. In addition\
    \ to this, the management of transboundary rivers at a watershed \nlevel will\
    \ be an emerging issue as water resources continue to diminish in the EMMENA \n\
    region. Thus, EO applications may become a necessity in the emerging topic of\
    \ hydrodi-\nplomacy. \nEO research in the agriculture thematic area covered a\

    \ region (blue line) and the world\n(red line).\nThe plethora of satellite data\
    \ currently available are usually scattered among differ-\nent platforms (Table\
    \ 3), resulting in more time and work needed for data collection and\npreprocessing\
    \ [18]. The development of a user-friendly central data hub (or data cubes)\n\
    can resolve this issue. An example of such a central data hub is the GEO-CRADLE\
    \ EU\nproject which facilitates access to and sharing of geospatial data and information\
    \ collected\nfrom satellites and ground-based networks in the North Africa, Middle\
    \ East, and Balkans\n(NAMEBA) region.\n4.2. EO Studies per Thematic Area: Limitations,\
    \ Research Gaps, and Future Directions\nA general limitation on EO research which\
    \ was identiﬁed in all thematic areas is\nthe lack of in situ (ground truth) data.\
    \ This issue has many implications such as on the\nvalidation of the EO outputs\
    \ and on the further development of algorithms and models. The\nincreasing number\
    \ of countries and organizations adopting open data policies will partially\n\
    resolve this issue, but inevitably there is a need for research infrastructure\
    \ investments,\nespecially in data-scarce regions.\nOur review revealed a wide\
    \ range of EO applications in the thematic area of atmo-\nsphere. Similar to the\
    \ ﬁndings of Imane et al. [30], we found that many studies in the\nEMMENA focused\
    \ on dust (PM10/PM2.5), as this is a common problem among these coun-\ntries.\
    \ Also, most of the EMMENA countries are situated in water-scarce semi-arid and\
    \ arid\nclimate zones. Thus, as expected, EO research on precipitation estimates\
    \ has a high research\nimpact. In addition to this, the rise and peak of the coronavirus\
    \ pandemic occurred within\nthe period selected for this review, thus many studies\
    \ related to the virus outbreak received\nhigh research interest. Future studies\
    \ on the thematic area of atmosphere should focus on\nthe development of EO methods\
    \ for improved monitoring of air quality [30].\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n\
    25 of 35\nMost studies in the water thematic area focus on groundwater research,\
    \ as shown both\nby the article review and the results of the citation topics.\
    \ However, there is a range of topics\nwhere EO applications can contribute such\
    \ as monitoring the water level of lakes, dams, and\nrivers with satellite radar\
    \ altimeters and identifying the presence of different substances in\nwater based\
    \ on their unique spectral signatures, which can be measured by satellites with\n\
    thermal and optical sensors and provide further information on water quality parameters\n\
    (e.g., chlorophyll-a, total suspended sediments, colored dissolved organic matter)\
    \ [212]. In\naddition to this, the management of transboundary rivers at a watershed\
    \ level will be an\nemerging issue as water resources continue to diminish in\
    \ the EMMENA region. Thus, EO\napplications may become a necessity in the emerging\
    \ topic of hydrodiplomacy.\nEO research in the agriculture thematic area covered\
    \ a wide range of applications.\nAccording to the World Bank, due to population\
    \ growth agricultural production will need\nto expand by approximately 70% by\
    \ 2050 to cover the food need. Thus, it is important\nto develop sustainable farming\
    \ practices, such as precision (smart) irrigation through EO.\nSuch studies are\
    \ having a great impact on agriculture, especially in water-scarce regions\nsuch\
    \ as EMMENA. However, our review did not reveal high-impact studies on this topic.\n\
    Also, there were no studies on the emerging subject of the photosynthetic activity\
    \ of plants\nbased on solar-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF) which can be obtained by\
    \ the Sentinel-5 satellite\nmission [213]. Furthermore, research on pest and disease\
    \ detection, especially in the early\nstages, was limited. There is a great potential\
    \ to advance EO research in this direction.\nThe thematic area of disaster risk\
    \ reduction can be considered the most impactful in\nterms of research interest,\
    \ as it has on average a higher number of citations than the other\nthematic areas.\
    \ This was expected, as this thematic area deals with human casualties and\neconomic\
    \ losses. However, our review identiﬁed research carried out only on landslides\n\
    and ﬂoods. Unexpectedly, forest ﬁres were not included among the top 20 articles.\
    \ The\nchoice of the proper parameters needed and the variety of algorithms available\
    \ (machine\nlearning, artiﬁcial intelligence, hybrid) along with the rapid development\
    \ in the ﬁeld of big\nEarth data have created confusion on which approach is more\
    \ suitable for landslide and\nﬂood mapping. Future studies should focus on the\
    \ development of protocols which will\nguide researchers and stakeholders towards\
    \ the selection of the most suitable algorithm\nor method based on the speciﬁc\
    \ characteristics of their research. Services related to early\nwarning and decision\
    \ support systems will upgrade EO applications, especially in thematic\nareas\
    \ dealing with hazards and human health [113,117,180]. The improvement of existing\n\
    services or the continuous development of new systems will help stakeholders and\
    \ the\nrelevant authorities to take the appropriate actions aiming at reducing\
    \ the number of\nhuman casualties and severe economic losses. Similar systems\
    \ will be extremely useful\nin the thematic areas of atmosphere and agriculture,\
    \ with applications regarding extreme\nweather warnings and irrigation support.\n\
    Research in speciﬁc thematic areas is surprisingly limited. The Mediterranean\
    \ Sea\nis one of the busiest seas in the world, accounting for 20% of seaborne\
    \ trade and over\n200 million passengers [214]. Studies on ship detection and\
    \ more particularly of those\nrelated to illegal activities were absent. In addition\
    \ to this, the Mediterranean Sea is\nexposed to many risks such as rising CO2\
    \ emissions, pollution, marine litter, and collisions.\nHowever, this is not reﬂected\
    \ by the number of studies carried out in the marine safety\nand security thematic\
    \ area. We speculate that the reason for the low number of studies in\nthis thematic\
    \ area may be twofold: restrictions on data sharing which are often applied\n\
    in the sea region due to security reasons and the insufﬁcient resolution and revisiting\n\
    time of existing non-commercial satellites which limit their ability to detect\
    \ objects and\nthe movement of these objects in time. Similarly, EO applications\
    \ in the cultural heritage\nthematic area are very rare (1.4% of all EO applications)\
    \ with the insufﬁcient resolution\nof existing non-commercial satellites being\
    \ identiﬁed as the main limitation. Finally, we\nexpect that the EO research in\
    \ the energy thematic area will attract more attention in the\nfollowing years\
    \ due to the gradual transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy.\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2023, 15, 4202\n26 of 35\n5. Conclusions\nThe EMMENA region is facing\
    \ many challenges related to climate change, environ-\nmental degradation, energy,\
    \ water scarcity, and hazards. The ongoing development of EO\nparallel with advancement\
    \ in the domain of big Earth data has provided the opportunity\nto better assess\
    \ and address the various challenges. This work provides an overview of\nthe existing\
    \ EO applications in the EMMENA region, where 6647 articles were efﬁciently\n\
    categorized into the following thematic areas: Atmosphere, water, agriculture,\
    \ land, disas-\nter risk reduction, cultural heritage, energy, marine safety and\
    \ security, and other. The big\nEarth data thematic area was identiﬁed as horizontal.\
    \ A total of 180 articles were further\nreviewed from the selection of the top\
    \ 20 highly cited articles per thematic area.\nThe results from the top 20 articles\
    \ revealed a high research interest in the thematic\narea of disaster risk reduction\
    \ with almost two times higher number of citations than\nthe second thematic area\
    \ (water). The focus of these articles is limited to ﬂoods and\nlandslides. The\
    \ main knowledge gap was the lack of protocols and the development of\nearly warning\
    \ systems based on EO. The results also revealed limited research in speciﬁc\n\
    EO applications for the water thematic area, which include water body monitoring\
    \ through\nradar altimeters and water quality parameter estimation through thermal\
    \ and optical\nsatellite data. Also, EO research related to cultural heritage\
    \ (1.4% of the total number\nof studies) and marine safety and security (0.9%\
    \ of the total number of studies) was\nsurprisingly rare. The main research interest\
    \ in the thematic area of atmosphere was related\nto precipitation estimates,\
    \ dust, and the impact of coronavirus on air quality. The thematic\narea of agriculture\
    \ covered a wide range of EO applications (evapotranspiration estimation,\nland\
    \ suitability for agriculture, irrigation mapping, agricultural land loss, crop\
    \ monitoring,\ncrop production, yield prediction, crop mapping, stem water potential\
    \ monitoring, and\ncrop water footprint estimation).\nThe study has also identified\
    \ the top authors, research organizations, and funding\nagencies for the EMMENA\
    \ region. Sentinel-2 data (60.8%) and Sentinel-1 data (35.4%) are the\nmost widely\
    \ used among the Sentinel missions. Similarly, Landsat 8 (83.2%) and Landsat 7\n\
    (10.0%) are the most widely used data sources among the Landsat missions. The\
    \ ongoing\ndevelopment of big Earth data techniques and the increasing availability\
    \ of satellite EO data\nwill enhance the research capabilities in the aforementioned\
    \ thematic areas.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information\

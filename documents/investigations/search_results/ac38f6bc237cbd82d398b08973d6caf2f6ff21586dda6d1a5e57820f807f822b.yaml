    43 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The Data-Intensive Farm Management (DIFM)
    project works with participating farmers, using precision technology to inexpensively
    design and run randomized agronomic field trials on whole commercial farm fields,
    to provide data-based, site-specific farm input management guidance, thus providing
    economic and environmental benefits. This article lays out a conceptual framework
    used by the multidisciplinary DIFM research team to facilitate collaboration and
    then presents details of DIFM''s procedures for what it calls on-farm precision
    experimentation (OFPE), which includes field trial design and implementation,
    data generation, processing, and management, and analysis. It is argued that DIFM''s
    data and the agricultural “Big Data” currently being collected with remote and
    proximal sensors are complementary; that is, more of either increases the value
    of the other. In 2019, DIFM and affiliates conducted over 120 trials, ranging
    from 10 to 100 ha in size, on maize, wheat, soybeans, cotton, and barley in eight
    US states, Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa. The DIFM is developing cyberinfrastructure
    to “scale up” its activities, to permit researchers and crop consultants worldwide
    to work with farmers to conduct trials, then process and manage the data. In Addition,
    DIFM is in the early stages of developing a software system for semi-automatic
    data analytics, and a cloud-based farm management aid, the purpose of which is
    to facilitate conversations between agronomists and farmers about implementing
    data-driven input management decisions. The proposed framework allows researchers,
    agronomists, and farmers to carry out on-farm precision experimentation using
    novel digital tools. Core Ideas The Data-Intensive Farm Management project''s
    on-farm trials can generate massive amounts varied managed input data. The Data-Intensive
    Farm Management project''s data fill a gap in agricultural “Big Data,” to enable
    data-intensive crop management. The Data-Intensive Farm Management project''s
    protocols support trial design, data processing and analysis. The Data-Intensive
    Farm Management project can be implemented by researchers, consultants, and farmers
    in diverse agronomic scenarios. Abbreviations 3DEP 3D Elevations Program DEM digital

    alone are still not well understood by researchers, advisors, or farmers. There
    is a myriad of variables involved in a decision about how much N to apply in a
    given growing season. … This makes providing reliable recommendations inherently
    difficult, both for researchers trying to distill complex science into useable
    information and for advisors trying to craft recommendations for individual farms
    and fields.” (Reimer et al. 2017, p. 6A) “Digital agriculture … has been trying
    to attract customers before the ecosystem has been properly constructed. What
    we believe is missing is a standardized way to gather and interpret data, and
    then translate actionable insights to commercial users—insights which then, in
    turn, can deliver value to growers.” (Zuckerberg and Kennes, 2017) A principal
    objective of agronomic and agricultural economic sciences is to provide farmers
    with science-based farm input management advice, which can lead to economic and
    environmental benefits (Scott et al., 2015; Wolfe et al., 2016). Knowledge of
    yield response functions is key to providing that advice. For almost 200 years,
    agricultural scientists have relied on small-plot randomized agronomic field trials
    to generate the data needed to estimate yield response to inputs (e.g., Spillman,
    1933; Heady and Pesek, 1954; Waugh et al., 1973; Stauber et al., 1975; Odell et
    al., 1984; Ackello-Ogutu et al., 1985; Cerrato and Blackmer, 1990; Paris, 1992;
    Bullock and Bullock, 1994; Makowski and Wallach, 2002; Tembo et al., 2008; Marenya
    and Barrett, 2009; Tumusiime et al., 2011), and small-plot trials remain the principal
    method of providing input-yield response data. In a typical trial, researchers
    apply inputs and harvest the crop by hand or with specialized machinery, and analyze
    the resulting data to understand input-yield relationships. However, despite the
    concerted efforts, the generation of small-plot field trial data has always been
    limited because the trials have been labor-intensive, involving numerous workers
    conducting hours of fieldwork, and thus expensive. The first purpose of this article
    is to describe the Data-Intensive Farm Management Project (DIFM) (Bullock et al.,
    2016) and present its methods of on-farm precision experimentation (OFPE) as an
    alternative to, or enhancement of, small-plot trials. Following statistical principles,
    DIFM researchers design and run large-scale, on-farm randomized agronomic field
    trials, applying small-plot first-principal concepts to whole fields (Fig. 1).
    The DIFM has developed computer code that “instructs” Global Positioning System
    (GPS)-linked variable rate application equipment to apply inputs at different
    randomized rates on the different plots (grid cells). Most importantly, because
    application rates are changed by a computer program and GPS-linked variable rate
    equipment, the implementation of this type of trial requires little extra work
    from the farmer, who “just drives.” Moreover, the data generated provide information
    about yield response on the same fields for which management information is sought.
    Table 1 summarizes trials run by DIFM and its affiliates in 2016 to 2019. The
    DIFM''s objective is to enable scientists to develop data-intensive, site-specific
    input management advice to improve the efficiency of farm management throughout
    the world. This article''s second purpose is to illustrate how scientists, crop
    consultants, and farmers participate in the construction of the “ecosystem” referred
    to by Zuckerberg and Kennes (2017). The proposed approach can be expanded to enable
    thousands of OFPEs to provide the data as indicated by Reimer et al. (2017) needed
    to gain the kind of understanding of complex biophysical systems and improve real-world
    farm input management. Table 1. On-farm precision experiments conducted by DIFM

    field in central Illinois. CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND: OPTIMAL APPLICATION OF INPUTS
    The DIFM is a multidisciplinary research project, involving crop scientists, soil
    scientists, computer scientists, statisticians, ecologists, hydrologists, agricultural
    engineers, mechanical engineers, experts in robotics, experts in artificial intelligence
    and machine learning, and economists. In this section, the conceptual framework
    that facilitates communication among the scholars in this wide array of research
    disciplines is presented. Following Bullock et al. (1998), the data from a generic
    agronomic field trial is conceptualized as falling into four categories. The first
    category is made up of variable y, crop yield. The second we represent by a multi-element
    vector c of variables that vary spatially within a field but not much temporally
    (“field characteristics”, e.g., soil clay content and topographical slope). The
    third we represent by a multi-element vector z of variables that vary temporally
    but not much spatially within a field (“weather” or “bio and abiotic stress”).
    The fourth we represent by a multi-element vector x of the farmer''s managed input
    choice variables (e.g., fertilizer application rates, seeding rates, irrigation
    dates). Yield results from a natural process described by a function f, which
    depends on input management choices, field characteristics, and weather: y = f(x,
    c, z). Figure 2 illustrates why information about the yield response function
    is fundamental to effective input management. The left-hand side of the Figure
    shows a Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) soil map of a central Illinois
    farm field; the map is of the same sort that can be downloaded from the USDA''s
    Web Soil Survey website (United States Department of Agriculture 2019). The right-hand
    side of the panel shows two hypothetical “yield response curves,” one assumed
    to show yield response on the parts of the field with soil type 45A, and the other
    for soil type 68A. For simplicity, in both diagrams, it is assumed that the vector
    z2019 describes the year''s weather events. In reality, farmers do not know at
    planting and at their first fertilizer application of the season what the crop
    growing season''s future weather events will be. The DIFM analysts can employ
    more sophisticated models of decision-making under uncertainty to take into account
    stochastic weather events. Figure 2 is drawn under the assumption that parts of
    the field assigned the same SSURGO soil type also feature a common yield response
    curve. We understand this assumption will not generally hold, since oil maps are
    coarse, and yield can respond to variability in soil properties and topographic
    characteristics within soil type not considered when soil types are assigned.
    Consider a simple case, in which the farmer''s goal is to maximize monetary profits.
    In reality, farmers’ goals can be much more complicated, but we focus on a simple
    situation for conceptual clarity. Suppose that the farmer knows with certainty
    that a price p will be received per unit of the crop sold and that every unit
    of an input x applied costs w. For simplicity, also ignore that the decision-maker
    might need to choose values for multiple inputs, that the farmer knows with certainty
    the functional form of the yield response f, the value of the field characteristics
    on parts of the field with SSURGO code of 45A, and that the weather variable will
    take on the values in vector z2019 during the growing season. In this case, the
    decision-maker will be able to draw the yield response curve, f(x, c45A, z2019)
    shown in the bottom right-hand panel of Fig. 2. He/she could also (conceptually,
    at least), maximize revenues minus input costs, and therefore find the economically
    optimal x-rate function, here called x∗(p, w, c45A, z2019), which solves the profit-maximization
    problem: (1) Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Yield response curves and economically
    optimal N-rates in parts of field with SSURGO soil-types 45A and 68A, given 2019
    weather (z), output price of (p), and N price of (w). Elementary calculus shows
    that the profit-maximizing level of x (given the field characteristics vector
    c and weather z) denoted x∗(p, w, c, z), is the rate at which the slope of the
    yield response curve equals the ratio of the input price to the output price,
    w/p: (2) Since in this simple example, the shapes of yield response curves depend
    only on soil type, then given any price ratio, areas with different soil types
    may have different economically optimal x application rates. Given prices p and
    w, in the diagram those rates are shown in the diagram to be x∗(p, w, c45A, z2019)
    for parts of the field with soil type 45A, and x∗(p, w, c68A, z2019) for parts
    of the field with soil type 68A. The key point is that to find economically optimal
    input application rates; one must know the yield response function f. The principal
    goal of the DIFM project is to generate and analyze better information about f,
    and thereby to present decision-makers and their advisors with improved input
    application recommendations. It is likely that farmers encounter a more complex
    scenario than that defined by (Eq. [1]), and thus the solution algorithm also
    likely to be more complex than the implicit solution to Eq. [2] THE NEED FOR VARIED
    MANAGED INPUT AND YIELD DATA Data variation is key to statistical analysis. To
    use statistical analysis and better understand the function y = f(x, c, z), it
    is necessary to have adequate variation in all four categories of the variables:
    y, x, c, and z. Without adequate variation in all four, f cannot be reliably estimated,
    and neither can x∗(p, w, c, z), whether x∗(p, w, c, z) is the solution to the
    problem (Eq. [1]) or a more realistic (and complicated) management problem. This
    makes intuitive sense: it is necessary to observe different types of input management
    under differing crop growth conditions to understand how optimal input management
    choices vary under differing crop growth conditions. Figure 3 depicts some of
    the forms in which y, c, and z data currently exist; these and like data are the
    much-touted agricultural “Big Data.” The center panel of Fig. 3 is a yield map
    which was recorded using a corn (Zea mays L.) yield monitor and GPS at harvest
    on a 35-ha central Illinois cornfield in 2016. Farmers have been using yield monitors
    to gather yield data since the 1990s, and, y data is abundant—some farmers feel
    too abundant. In the hundreds of interviews conducted by DIFM personnel, several
    farmers made statements like the one that came from a northern Illinois corn and
    soybean producer, “Yeah, I look over the yield maps every year. Then I put them
    in my yield maps binder, and put that back up on the shelf in the shop, with my
    other twenty years-worth of yield maps” (Anonymous, personal communication, 2017).
    For over 20 yr now, it has been widely held that yield maps can provide information
    useful for management choices. This belief was centered around the theory of yield-based
    management algorithms. However, yield-based algorithms have been frequently discredited
    in empirical studies, and their academic origin is suspect (Rodriguez et al.,
    2019). Therefore, it is far less clear now than when precision technology was
    first commercialized how, in themselves, yield maps can be used to improve input
    management. The right-hand panel of Fig. 3 depicts c data. In particular, the
    panel shows a map of the field''s apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) readings,
    taken by a portable sensor pulled over the fields with a small four-wheeled vehicle
    (e.g., Veris Technologies, 2019). Commercial markets are currently packed with
    start-up companies, all attempting to measure field characteristics or inexpensively-obtainable
    proxies of field characteristics. For example, several companies are currently
    selling imagery data from drones (e.g., Agribotix, 2019), airplanes (Crop Quest,
    2019), and satellites (Satellite Imaging Corporation, 2019). Because c data are
    collected from widespread geographic locations, they also are available in abundance
    and with significant variance. Weather data, z, is also abundant in many forms
    from many places. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer Types of current agricultural
    “Big Data”: as-applied-N-rate, yield, and electrical conductivity maps for 2016,
    35-ha central Illinois cornfield. The farmer set his variable rate fertilizer
    applicator at a constant rate. Though varied y, c, and z data are readily available,
    a problem remains for scientists wanting to estimate yield response functions:
    there is insufficient variation in existing x data. A great deal of x data is
    available in the form of “as-applied” and “as-planted” maps, which are generated
    when farmers apply inputs with variable-rate equipment. Most often, however, these
    “as-” maps provide little variance in x, because farmers still generally apply
    inputs at uniform rates across their fields, or at least across large areas within
    fields. The left-hand panel of Fig. 3 depicts the situation, showing the as-applied
    N-fertilizer map for the 2016 central Illinois cornfield. No trial was run on
    this field. Rather, the farmer fertilized the field at a uniform targeted rate,
    which was standard practice in his area. Ninety-five percent of the field was
    recorded as having fertilized at N-rates between 219 and 235 kg of urea ha−1.
    (The farmer had programmed for a uniform applied N rate, but applied rates varied
    because of imperfections in machinery calibration.) Also, it is clear in the figure
    that fertilization rates near the ends of rows were either inaccurately applied
    or recorded. Herein lies the problem: farmers and their neighbors tend to use
    similar input management strategies across their fields. Therefore, while a good
    deal of x data exists, it does not vary adequately, especially within fields,
    to help much with the estimation of f. Figure 4 illustrates the statistical difficulty
    on a given field caused by inadequate variation in x data. It is assumed in Fig.
    4 that yield is a simple function of a single managed input N (the nitrogen fertilizer
    application rate, which is one variable in the x category) and a single soil characteristic,
    which can take on the values csilt and csand. A researcher attempting to estimate
    the “true” but unknown yield response curves, labeled f(N, csilt) and f(N, csand),
    needs sufficient variation in the N data—one cannot with confidence fit a curve
    through a vertical stack of data points. Without an adequate estimation of yield
    response, an optimal input choice map, which is derived from x∗(c, z, p, w), cannot
    be well estimated. Implications are that current agricultural “Big Data” is of
    limited use for many forms of crop production management and that more variation
    in x data is needed to take full practical advantage of existing “Big Data” in
    farm management. Put another way, data from OFPE, such as is conducted by DIFM,
    and sensor-based field characteristics (SBFC) data are economic complements; having
    more of one increases the value of the other (Bullock et al., 1998; Bullock and
    Bullock, 2000). As impressive as is the current volume of the satellite imagery,
    apparent electroconductivity (ECa) readings, etc. that are agricultural “Big Data,”
    the value of that data can still be increased greatly by gaining an understanding
    of how yield response curves, such as those in Fig. 2, shift when field characteristics
    change. But those changes can only be estimated if OFPE data and SBFC data are
    analyzed together. The principal methodology of the DIFM project is to show how
    large-scale, on-farm randomized agronomic field trials can be run at a low cost
    to generate varied x data in many (c, z) environments, to take full advantage
    of the all-important economic complementarity between these categories of data.
    Figure 4 Open in figure viewer If input application rates are not varied, ƒcannot
    be well estimated. There is little information about how yield response differs
    under different growing conditions, even through ample field characteristics data
    are gathered. DIFM FIELD TRIAL METHODOLOGY Trial Design and Data Collection Protocols
    To illustrate typical DIFM trial design protocols, Fig. 5 offers a close-up view
    of part of the field trial depicted in Fig. 1. The plot width in the depicted
    trial was 18.2 m, and the plot length was 77.4 m. Plot width is typically determined
    by the width of the farmer''s machinery. The farmer of this particular trial used
    an 18.2 m-wide planter, an 18.2 m-wide fertilizer applicator, and a 9.1 m-wide
    harvester. Thus, every plot hosted one pass of the planter and one pass of the
    fertilizer applicator. The farmer harvested the field such that, for every-other
    harvest pass, the center of the 9.1 m cornhead passed through the center of a
    plot. Thus, yield, as-applied, and as-planted data were taken only from the middle
    50% of each plot. Whether taking this conservative approach and thus avoiding
    problems of N fertilizer “bleed” from one plot to another is superior to taking
    an approach in which each plot receives two full cornhead passes, is an open research
    question. How long a trial design should make the experimental plots is also an
    open research question. The 77.4 m length of the depicted trial was established
    under consideration that maize yield monitors do not adjust instantaneously to
    sudden changes in yields. Recent research is beginning to provide evidence that
    the optimal plot length for maize trials may be far shorter than 77.4 m (Gong
    and Kuhns, 2019). Several questions also exist about how many years field trials
    should be run on a field before discontinuing experimentation and beginning to
    use the information generated from past trials in actual site-specific management.
    The variation in the optimal number of experiment years will depend on the crop,
    agroclimatic variability, the management practices under evaluation, and the expected
    field variability. Bullock et al. (2019) have conducted simulations on this topic,
    deriving very preliminary findings indicating that on “flat-black” Illinois fields,
    it maybe be economically optimal to run trials for only 1 or 2 yr for N management.
    In contrast, Lawrence et al. (2015) pursued the same question about Montana wheat
    fields and estimated that 6 to 8 yr of experimentation might be needed to stabilize
    yield predictive parameter distributions. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer Illustration
    of data collection protocol from three plots in 2018 central Illinois field trial.
    Cooperating farmers provide the information required for designing field-scale
    experiments on their farms, including field boundary and AB-line shapefiles, as
    well as information on the “typical” way the field would be managed in the absence
    of a DIFM experiment (e.g., baseline seeding and fertilizer application rates),
    and yield maps from previous years. The farmers also submit information about
    their equipment, such as the guidance system they use, the width of their planters,
    fertilizer spreaders and harvesters, and, if possible, an estimate of the lag
    time associated with their planters and spreaders adjusting application rates,
    to ensure that the experimental design is practical for each field. Farmer-supplied
    data sometimes also include 4- to 6-yr field management histories in the forms
    of fertilizer used and application timing, tillage methods and timing, and crop
    rotation. This type of farm- and field-specific information is generally relatively
    easy for the farmer-participants to gather and submit, which is consistent with
    DIFM''s efforts to limit farmers’ research participation costs. DIFM researchers
    collect field characteristics data, c, for each experimental field, utilizing
    a variety of means. Field characterization technology is changing rapidly, and
    methodologies mentioned here could soon be outdated as the markets and technology
    rapidly change. The DIFM currently collects data on soil type, drainage class,
    and soil organic matter (SOM) from the SSURGO georeferenced digital soil maps,
    which are available for download from the USDA-NRCS''s Geospatial Data Gateway
    (USDA, 2016). These soil properties influence soil N mineralization, loss, and
    availability. A member of the DIFM team maps each field by collecting geo-referenced
    soil ECa data using a Veris U3 Optimapper (unless the farmer can provide a previously
    made ECa map). This ECa mapping is typically completed in the spring of a year,
    before planting, when rainfall increases the likelihood that soil moisture will
    be at field capacity. The Veris U3 Optimapper collects soil ECa from a depth of
    60 cm. The data is recorded at 1-s intervals as the system is pulled through the
    field by a tractor, corresponding to 2-m data spacing, and typically 18-m transect
    spacing. Soil ECa measurements are proxies of chemical and physical properties
    including texture, bulk density, water content, salinity and cation exchange capacity
    (Corwin and Lesch, 2005; Martín et al., 2005; Sudduth et al., 2013; Cho et al.,
    2016). The U3 Optimapper also estimates SOM and pH. The DIFM obtains elevation
    data for each experimental site, either from 3D Elevation Programs (3DEP) (USGS,
    2019), or Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017), with a resolution of 1/3
    arc-s (10-m north/south). A field''s digital elevation map (DEM) can be obtained
    using the 3D analyst in ArcGIS 10.4 (ESRI, 2019), or QGIS 3.8 (QGIS Development
    Team, 2019) and from there topographical factors can be derived, such as slope,
    aspect, topographic wetness index, total solar radiation, direct solar radiation,
    duration of direct solar radiation, and total terrain surface curvature for each
    field-scale experiment. The DIFM obtains satellite imagery from RapidEye (BlackBridge,
    Berlin, Germany) and Google Earth Engine. The RapidEye imagery has a spatial resolution
    of 5-m with five spectral bands ranging from 440 to 850 nm and temporal resolution
    of 6.5 d. RapidEye offers several types of image processing; DIFM utilizes Level
    3A of this product suite because it corrects images based on radiometry, geometry,
    and terrain. Google Earth Engine provides aerial images captured by digital cameras
    mounted on fixed-wing aircraft at an altitude of 5000 feet on clear days every
    2 wk during the growing season, with high resolution (0.5–1 m), 4-band (blue band
    at 410–490 nm, green band at 510–590 nm, red band at 610–690 nm, and NIR at 800–900
    nm) or hyperspectral digital cameras. The DIFM researchers calculate the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference red edge (NDRE) using
    the satellite imagery, according to Eqs. [3] and [4]: (3) (4) where bandnir, bandred,
    and bandedge refer to near-infrared (NIR) bands (760–850 nm), red bands (630–685
    nm), and red-edge bands (690–730 nm). Both indices are calculated for each field
    because recent research suggests that NDRE gives better insight into within-field
    spatial and temporal variations of the crop properties, mainly chlorophyll content
    (Zillmann et al., 2015). The DIFM researchers obtain weather data from the nearest
    NOAA weather stations at 4-km-grid resolution, and radar maps of daily weather
    from the National Climate Data Center (NCDC) archive of global historical weather
    and climate data. The daily rainfall values for each month are aggregated into
    cumulative monthly or seasonal totals, such as March through May or March through
    August for corn belt-region fields, or January through December for fields located
    in wheat-growing regions. Each sampling location is assigned one rainfall value
    from the closest grid by overlaying the rainfall map and the sampling location
    map. For each crop, the growing degree days (GDD) measure, which is an accumulation
    of heat units and widely used to describe and predict crop development physiological
    stages, is calculated for each experimental field by the method described by Nielsen
    and Hinkle (1996). In regions where fields are much larger (e.g., in Montana up
    to 160 ha, and in Argentina up to 600 ha), gridded data is often available, allowing
    multiple precipitation and temperature values within a field (e.g., AgriMet in
    the Pacific Northwest). The DIFM researchers verify the successful implementation
    of the field trials by processing and analyzing raw as-applied and as-planted
    data files from the cooperators’ field applications and planting equipment. Application
    errors are inherent with many forms of field application equipment, so DIFM researchers
    inspect the data closely when it is received. Cooperators must be educated on
    proper calibration techniques to ensure that their systems limit errors between
    target and as-applied rates. For example, conducting field research with fertilizer
    spinner/disc spreaders can contribute to errors given that the distribution pattern
    of those systems can be negatively impacted based on variable-rate applications.
    Field calibration using collection pans can add confidence in such product placement,
    or reveal that equipment may not be suitable for such studies, or reveal that
    certain blended products may not disperse accurately (Virk et al., 2013). More
    recently, seed-drop tube sensors and flow monitoring of liquid application equipment
    have improved the ability to control and monitor these crop inputs, which boosts
    confidence in field trial implementation. For example, liquid fertilizer application
    systems using pulse-width modulation (PWM) technology may react within 1 to 2
    s of rate changes, which is a significant improvement over previous flow compensation
    systems (Bennur and Taylor, 2010). In many ways, errors from GNSS can impact as-applied
    data in the same way that yield data are affected, but similar methods can be
    used to eliminate those areas from field studies to ensure quality data are collected.
    Data Processing Procedures As described above, field characterization technologies,
    processing procedures, and technologies for digital agriculture''s rapidly expanding
    database are changing rapidly (e.g., Climate Corporation, 2019). While software
    exists for cleaning various types of agricultural yield and characteristics data
    (e.g., Sudduth et al., 2012), OFPE data require special procedures. The DIFM is
    currently working on creating efficient, automated data processing procedures,
    as are various commercial groups. In the following, details of why OFPE and SBFC
    data need to be processed, and how to process them, are presented. While it may
    not be necessary in the near future to clean and process in the laborious, step-by-step
    process DIFM currently uses, it is hoped that the following discussion can be
    referred to by future researchers, to limit the “black box” aspects of OFPE and
    SBFC data processing and cleaning procedures. Figure 6 illustrates raw yield data
    readings from about 30 ha of a 2018 northern Illinois corn trial, and why DIFM
    must examine and clean raw data coming off farm machinery before using them in
    statistical analyses. First, DIFM removes and does not use data from end-of-row
    “headlands” (Fig. 6, left-hand panel). Farmers turn machinery around on headlands,
    which often leads to overlapping applications and irregular driving patterns.
    Second, DIFM removes side-of-field data, because crops growing near sides of a
    field generally receive different amounts of sunlight and wind than does the crop
    in the rest of the field. Third, DIFM removes data that appear in irregularly
    shaped patterns. These data may be produced when machinery must be driven around
    an obstacle, because an operator makes a driving error, radically changes speed,
    or stops during the application or harvesting process. Finally, DIFM removes data
    coming from partial plots. Sometimes DIFM needs to remove data because of operator
    or researcher error. The center panel of Fig. 6 illustrates that the operator
    drove the combine a few meters east of the planned harvest rows, which ran south–north.
    The harvester made four passes up and down each column of plots. However, because
    the combine was not properly positioned, the yield readings from the westernmost
    combine pass of each plot came from grain harvested both from the intended plot
    and the plot immediately to its west. Therefore, the westernmost pass of yield
    data in each plot was removed. The right-hand panel of Fig. 6 shows cleaned data
    from the 2018 experiment after the first round of cleaning. The left-hand panel
    of Fig. 6 illustrates the second round of cleaning. While a specific software
    package (e.g., Yield Editor) was not incorporated directly into data analysis
    procedures, many of the techniques and filters utilized by this program (Sudduth
    et al., 2012) were manually applied to yield datasets to improve their overall
    quality. For instance, start/stop errors contributing to under- and overestimates
    of yield within field plots were flagged for removal. The conventional use standard
    deviations among neighboring yield points to find “inliers” is not generally appropriate
    for OFPE data, however, because significant yield differences can be expected
    to occur over short distances because neighboring plots can be assigned very different
    treatments. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer Representation of data cleaning process:
    (a) removal data from side-of-field, headlands, too-small plots, and data in geometrically
    irregular patterns; (b) removal of observations taken too close to plot boundary,
    meaning that the harvester straddled plots during one-fourth of its passes, in
    which case single data point readings came from different treatment zones; (c)
    yield data points kept after the first round of cleaning. To eliminate yield monitor
    lag-time issues, DIFM places approximately 10 m-long “transitional buffer zones,”
    at the ends of each plot. The transitional buffer zones are needed for grain and
    soybean trials because yield monitors suffer reading delays when moving between
    different yield zones, and it can take several seconds before being readings are
    sufficiently accurate. In addition, the responses of field application equipment
    (e.g., planters and fertilizer applicators) tend to lag as the equipment passes
    between treatment boundaries (as witnessed during observations of as-applied datasets).
    Thus, buffering these areas reduces the likelihood that application errors may
    contribute to yield variability within plots. Perez-Muñoz and Colvin (1996) found
    that yield monitor estimates were sufficient as plot lengths approached 100 m,
    but that errors were significant at plot lengths approaching 20 m. They attributed
    the monitor inaccuracy mostly to flow delays at the beginning of plots. Al-Mahasneh
    and Colvin (2000) found that plot lengths exceeding 80 m could generate correlation
    coefficients exceeding 0.95 between weigh wagons and yield monitor data measurements.
    Increasing the plot length essentially provides for greater grain weights collected.
    Doerge (1996) reported 2 to 4% differences (between yield monitors and weigh wagons)
    for loads exceeding 1800 kg, with errors exceeding 10% for loads less than 1800
    kg. Through 2018, DIFM designed trials with plot lengths between 75 and 95 m.
    In the end, cooperators are instructed to perform field calibration of yield monitors
    before harvest based on manufacturers’ specifications to minimize any effect that
    calibration errors may contribute to overall results. The DIFM is currently conducting
    empirical studies to examine optimal field trial plot length in more accurate
    yield monitoring (Gong and Kuhns, 2019), which will impact trial designs shortly.
    As of 2019, DIFM does not use data from the transitional buffer in its analyses.
    The DIFM''s current trial design protocol for corn, wheat, and soybeans involves
    plots between 75 and 90 m in length, each of which is assigned one of some number
    of randomized managed input treatments. However, the data gathered come in much
    finer resolutions. The lower panel of Fig. 7 illustrates, showing the relative
    locations of as-planted and yield readings in a single 24.4 × 88.5 m plot of an
    85-ha 2018 northern Illinois corn trial. The single plot is shown to contain 160
    yield readings (one at approximately every 2 m of four cornhead passes), and 72
    ha planted readings. Data from field characteristics, for example, slope, were
    also gathered at multiple points in the plot. The nature of the data means that
    it must be gathered into a set of observational units. The DIFM partitions the
    interior of a plot into three or four subplots, each usually about 20 m in length.
    In the field shown in Fig. 7, the subplots were 19 m long. Subplots are thus the
    observational unit for data on dry yield, moisture, as-applied input rates, as-planted
    seed rates, SSURGO soil type, deep ECa, shallow ECa, elevation, topographical
    slope, topographical curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI). Approximately
    every 2 wk within the growing season, DIFM downloads and processes data on the
    vegetative indices NDVI and NDRE collected from publicly available satellite imagery.
    This resampling process diminishes the standard deviation while keeping the covariance
    constant (Plant, 2012), facilitating the identification of associations among
    variables. Data Analysis On-farm precision experiments are conducted on large
    research fields with numerous experimental units to determine relationships between
    site attributes, management treatments, and crop yield. Most of the OFPE studies
    evaluate treatment effects as quantitative responses in the form of linear or
    quadratic regression coefficients, rather than considering treatments as categorical
    variables. By estimating yield responses, it is possible to estimate economically
    optimal application and planting rate strategies (Bullock et al., 1998; Lawrence
    et al., 2015). To obtain unbiased estimates from OFPE trials, it is necessary
    to address issues of spatial autocorrelation. Under these conditions, it is expected
    that observations from experimental units are not solely dependent on the treatments
    and random independent errors. Unaccounted-for spatial effects impact yield variability,
    taking the form of varying responses to treatments and spatially correlated residuals.
    Thus, the spatial effect inflates the effective number of degrees of freedom,
    and artificially decrease the standard error, leading to a higher likelihood of
    Type I errors (Plant, 2012). Figure 7 Open in figure viewer Upper panel: yield
    and as-planted data points in a 24.4m × 88.5m plot from a 85-ha northern Illinois
    corn trial. Lower panel: partition of the plot into “buffer zones” and “subplots.”
    The DIFM is currently taking two approaches to modeling neighboring effects. These
    alternative approaches will be further explored in subsequent manuscripts. One
    is the spatial econometrics approach defined by Anselin et al. (2004). Spatial
    econometric models account for spatial autocorrelation by using a neighboring
    matrix. This approach incorporates information from neighboring experimental units
    as a function of their spatial arrangement. “Rook” and “Queen” positions are often
    considered as spatial neighbor arrangements to evaluate these effects. The main
    spatial econometrics models are the “lag model” and the “spatial error model.”
    Spatial econometrics models are selected by using a sequence of diagnostics tests.
    A spatial econometric model is suitable in scenarios of spatial experimental or
    observational units defined as polygons, such as counties and field plots defined
    as polygons. The DIFM also analyzes its data using the geostatistical approach,
    which can be implemented by Generalized Least Squares (GLS) (Pinheiro and Bates,
    2000). The GLS technique estimates the unknown parameters in a linear regression
    model when there is a certain degree of correlation between the residuals that
    allows modeling the spatial structure of the error term using a semivariogram
    model. The semivariogram captures information about how variation between observations
    changes as a function of the spatial distance between them. This semivariogram
    model can then be used to parameterize the GLS error term to account for the spatial
    structure of the residuals. Walthall et al. (2007) provide an example of the application
    of GLS models in a precision farming research framework. In precision agriculture
    research, there are several statistical approaches to studying site-specific responses.
    One consists of quantifying sources of variation in soil and crop responses, often
    in the form of yield maps, and using a general function or algorithm for the entire
    field to examine the effects of different input application rates (de Carvalho
    et al., 2016). Alternatively, different areas with common site characteristics
    can be considered when assigning treatments and identifying differential responses
    (Ruffo et al., 2006). Both approaches make assumptions about the role of site
    characteristics and yield responses to inputs. Precision agriculture researchers
    and practitioners commonly use SSURGO maps digitalized by NRCS to identify areas
    by their soil mapping units (MUKEYs) and then examine whether the different zones
    exhibit different yield responses. The top panel of Fig. 8 maps a field with distinctive
    areas based on SSURGO soil types. These site-specific classifications of experimental
    group units correspond to the site-specific yield responses for soil-type based
    field zones shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 8. The DIFM uses geographically
    weighted regression (GWR) to highlight local differences in the relationship between
    spatial variables (Trevisan et al., 2019). Geographically weighted regression
    is particularly suitable for OFPE field arrangements since the treatments are
    randomly assigned to entire fields. The GWR model parameters vary over space and
    can be mapped and interpreted as spatial variables (Fotheringham, 1997; Plant,
    2012). Figure 9 presents a case in which GWR was applied to data from a 2018 central
    Illinois corn trial, to classify different areas of the field (two areas, for
    illustrative purposes) measuring a yield response coefficient (the slope of a
    linear yield prediction curve). After identifying the zones by N response, GWR
    was used to estimate nonlinear site-specific yield responses defined earlier by
    the vector x. Combining this OFPE methodology with machine learning and other
    emerging analytical methods will open opportunities site-specific research is
    conducted their results implemented Figure 8 Open in figure viewer Representation

    This overview of the DIFM project introduced the main guiding principles for the
    stages of trial design, data processing, and analysis as part of a novel framework
    for conducting on-farm experiments. The main elements of the stage of trial design
    and trial implementation were discussed. In this stage, an important barrier for
    potential participants is access to GPS enabled site-specific applicators and
    planters, restricting the scope of farmers that could participate. For the stages
    of data processing and analysis, the protocols applied in DIFM were presented.
    Crop yield and other information collected during the season are integrated with
    the treatments under experimentation. Differences in farm machinery standards
    and the lack of geospatial processing workflows utilizing GIS data functions make
    this process time consuming and prone to errors. Additional sources of confusion
    and delays result from differences in how field variables accounted for by different
    participants and misunderstanding of measurement units. Figure 9 Open in figure
    viewer Geographically weighted regression techniques were used to divide the field
    into “low N response” and “high N response” zones, and then non-linear regression
    techniques were used to estimate expected yield curves confidence intervals for
    yields at various N-rates. To overcome these challenges, we propose the development
    of software that will standardize and scale up the process of trial design, facilitating
    interaction with agronomists and farmers. Similarly, new software can be developed
    to conduct data processing and analysis that would streamline research and extension
    efforts. Addressing these limitations would make possible to expand the DIFM approach
    to more farmers, increasing our knowledge of the f(x, c, z) function with new
    insights in vector x. More importantly, expanding the DIFM approach will strengthen
    on-farm research facilitating the interactions between researchers, agronomists,
    and farmers though experiments, datasets, and digital tools. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This

    co-creation and value-in-use with a specific focus on big data technology in agriculture.
    The authors provide a unique narrative of how farmers experience co-creation and
    value-in-use in monetary and non-monetary forms. Design/methodology/approach The
    qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews with mid-Western farmers.
    The constant comparative method was used for coding the data. Results were analyzed
    through open and axial coding, and matrix queries helped establish linkages between
    different concepts via NVivo 12. Findings The paper provides rich insight into
    co-creation through direct and indirect interaction, autonomous co-creation and
    epistemic, monetary and environmental value-in-use in the digital agriculture
    sector. Interestingly, co-creation through indirect interaction gives rise to
    epistemic value-in-use. Also, value-co-destruction can undermine co-creation,
    while relational actors and the concept of psychological ownership are very relevant
    to the process of co-creation. Research limitations/implications The authors build
    on the extant literature on co-creation in knowledge-intensive B2B sectors with
    the unique findings linking different forms of co-creation with value-in-use.
    Practical implications The findings on co-creation and value-in-use are beneficial
    to diverse agriculture stakeholders such as farmers, agriculture technology providers,
    extension agents and policymakers. Agricultural technology providers can determine
    how to make the co-creation process more meaningful for farmers and also create
    suitable technology tools that enrich farmers’ knowledge about crop management.
    Agricultural stakeholders can learn how to develop big data analytic tools and
    marketing narratives to maximize value-in-use and pre-empt value co-destruction.
    Social implications The research can impact policy, as it addresses a very relevant
    issue of how farmers relate to big data technology amidst growing consolidation
    and privacy concerns in the digital agriculture sector. Originality/value Our
    work is both theoretically and contextually relevant. We incorporate elements
    of service-dominant and customer-dominant logic while analyzing farmers’ perspectives
    of co-creation and value-in-use. Keywords Agriculture Co-creation Big data Value-in-use

    \ basis for food security and survival. Mankind living on the globe depends majorly\
    \ \non the agri based crops for their survival. India is an agricultural dependent\
    \ country and the fact that  \nthe majority of the populations are vegetarians\
    \ and solely depends on the agricultural products for their \nsurvival. Being\
    \ an agricultural based nation, country’s economy is principally influenced by\
    \ annual crop \nyields of agricultural practices. Recent survey indicates that\
    \ more than 60 % of the population is in to \nagriculture and the majority among\
    \ the rest is connected to the other aspects of agricultural practices.  \nThe\
    \ other facets of agricultural practices include agricultural machinery companies,\
    \ fertilizer companies, \ncrop yield marketing and sales companies etc. Agriculture\
    \ activities help humans to raise the most principle \nfood crops with ideal animal\
    \ population to achieve environmental balance. In the country like India,  \n\
    farmers cultivate major food crops such as rice, wheat, cereals, pulses, different\
    \ vegetables known as onions, \npotatoes, sugarcane, oil seeds, mango, orange,\
    \ red chilli and also various commercial crops such as coconut, \ncoffee, tea,\
    \ cotton, rubber and jute. The majority of the rural population close to 70% depends\
    \ on  \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci  \nISSN: 2502-4752 \n \n \nTechnology\
    \ in Indian agriculture – a review (R S Upendra) \n1071 \nthe agriculture for\
    \ their household. Agriculture contributes approximately 18% to the total GDP\
    \ of  \nthe country and provides employment to over 60 to 70 % of the population\
    \ in India [1, 2].  \nAt present India stands second globally in terms of agricultural\
    \ based products. Cultivation of \nvarious agricultural crops influences the economy\
    \ of the country at broadest range and plays a pivotal role in \nthe overall in\
    \ socio-economic structure of the country. The success rates of agri practices\
    \ majorly influenced \nby certain factors namely soil fertility, climatic conditions,\
    \ weather forecast, temperature, water level with \nthe rainfall measures, irrigation\
    \ condition, fertilizers availability, pesticide used, controlling of weed \n\
    population, process of cultivation, harvesting methods employed and economic and\
    \ political scenarios [3]. \nMajority of the former communities in India predict\
    \ crop yield based on the conventional practice with  \nthe knowledge of previous\
    \ experiences, but this approaches alone may not be efficient as the climatic\
    \ \nconditions keep changing drastically due to the overall change in the weather\
    \ forecast at global level. In order \nto address this issue, a more scientific\
    \ methodology with technology advent known as agro based big data \nanalytics\
    \ is essential. Big data analytics provides an opportunity to analyze the significant\
    \ factors that \ncontrols the crop yield and also about the socio, economic and\
    \ political impacts on the success rates of  \nthe various agricultural practices\
    \ [4]. Higher crop yield can be achieved by increasing the overall cultivable\
    \ \nland suitable for the growth of particular crop and also by decreasing the\
    \ crop damage, overall operating cost \nthrough implementation of good agricultural\
    \ practices. The enhanced crop yield can be reported by \ncontrolling the major\
    \ factors of the agricultural practice such as fertilizer type and quantity, water\
    \ resources \nand levels, quality of the seed used for cropping, minimization\
    \ of biotic stress caused by weeds, pests and  \nthe control of abiotic stress\
    \ [5]. Manual and conventional methods such as physical crop inspection and \n\
    manual removal of weeds and contaminants are not very effective approaches and\
    \ do possess significant \nlimitations in supporting the higher crop yield [6].\
    \ On the other hand, the sensor mounted practices can be \neffective in understanding\
    \ the needs of the agricultural conditions of the growing crop in a much scientific\
    \ \nway [4, 7]. The Big data analytics is one such technology, which provides\
    \ an opportunity to analyse  \nthe various crop yield influencing factors to provide\
    \ an optimum condition for the enhanced crop yields and \nalso helps in designing\
    \ the strategies for crop yield marketing [8, 9]. \n \n \n2. \nTECHNOLOGY IN AGRICULTURE\
    \ \n2.1.   Digital agriculture \nDigital agriculture is the use of new and advanced\
    \ technologies, integrated into one system,  \nto enable farmers and other stakeholders\
    \ within the agriculture value chain to improve food production.  \nIn comparison\
    \ with conventional and sensor based approaches, an advanced approach termed as\
    \ digital \nagriculture can help the farmers to understand their agricultural\
    \ practices in a much better and effective way \nin a real time manner. Thus,\
    \ digital agriculture holds profound impact on the crop yield enhancements,  \n\
    by empowering the formers with required scientific knowledge to implement good\
    \ agricultural practices as \nshown in Figure 1.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. The\
    \ concept of digital agriculture [10] \n \n \nThe user interface system used in\
    \ digital agriculture provides opportunity to the formers to share \ntheir ideas.\
    \ This also helps them to get knowledge about different kind of cultivation procedures\
    \ implemented \nin the different parts of the globe for the particular crop and\
    \ equip them with technological advances and \nbusiness skills to make their agricultural\
    \ practices as successful venture. Digital agriculture helps formers in \nmaintaining\
    \ their inherent agricultural practices and at the same time provides useful information\
    \ to update \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng &\
    \ Comp Sci, Vol. 20, No. 2, November 2020 :  1070 - 1077 \n1072 \ntheir knowledge\
    \ and the skills. It also provides an opportunity to review the historical information\
    \ in \nunderstanding the various situations and difficulties to gain an essential\
    \ knowledge in taking the right \ndecisions. The composite agricultural practices\
    \ combined with rigorous and enhanced crop yield require an \nimplementation of\
    \ robust automated systems with less development time at low cost. Agricultural\
    \ safety is \na big concern in current scenario which can be implemented by controlling\
    \ the various contaminants that \npromote crop damage. Agricultural automation\
    \ systems including field machinery, irrigation systems, \ngreenhouse automation,\
    \ animal automation systems, and automation of fruit production systems helps\
    \ in \nachieving enhanced crop yields [11, 12]. \n \n2.2.   Smart farming \nSmart\
    \ Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication\
    \ \ntechnology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle [13]. Smart Farming\
    \ represents the application of \nmodern Information and Communication Technologies\
    \ (ICT) into agriculture, leading to what can be called a \nThird Green Revolution.\
    \ Agricultural based practices in India needs indefinite transition from  \nthe\
    \ conventional methods to the smart farming approaches in order to achieve sustainable\
    \ and profitable \nagricultural practices. Smart forming also termed as Internet\
    \ of Agriculture Technology (IoAT), employs \nInformation and Communication Technologies\
    \ (ICT) in understanding the various aspects of the farming \npractices and help\
    \ the farmers to maintain the optimum conditions with least effort and higher\
    \ cost benefits to \nachieve more proficient, highly productive, cost effective\
    \ and profitable farming enterprises. Smart farming \nmodels are found to be more\
    \ generic, easy to understand and easy to adapt by the farmers as shown in Figure\
    \ 2.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. The concept of smart farming representing the cyber-physical\
    \ system based management cycle [14] \n \n \nAs per the recent survey, the world\
    \ population is going to reach close to 10 billion by the year 2050. \nProviding\
    \ the food for these mammoth populations is considered to be a big challenge for\
    \ the governments, \nand it is highly impossible with less cultivable land available\
    \ and conventional agricultural approaches.  \nThe only way to deal this ample\
    \ task is the implantation of smart agricultural practices and the application\
    \ of \nIoT technology in agriculture to overcome the crop limiting hurdles such\
    \ as biotic and abiotic stress,  \ncrop failure, crop damage, loss of productitivity\
    \ and wastage to achieve progression in the agricultural \npractices. IoAT refer\
    \ to the application of various sensors to monitor the different conditions such\
    \ as light \nintensity, humidity percent, temperature measures, soil moisture\
    \ content etc. in real-time situation and also \nhelps in the automation of irrigation\
    \ system to reduce water wastage. The benefits provided by the IoAT is \nample\
    \ and some of the most important benefits are listed to be sensor based field\
    \ monitoring, effective \nresource mapping, remote crop monitoring, climate monitoring\
    \ & forecasting, controlled usage of fertilizers \nand pesticides and finally\
    \ the accurate prediction of crop yield [15, 16]. \n \n2.3.   Supply chain strategies\
    \ \nFood security is one of the most important, critical and major concerns globally\
    \ today and world is \ngoing to face an immense food crisis in coming years. To\
    \ accommodate future needs of the growing \npopulation with the limited availability\
    \ of cultivable land, it is imperative to decrease product and food losses \n\

    \ agriculture – a review (R S Upendra) \n1073 \nby strengthening the food security\
    \ measures through automated food security supply chain approaches as \nshown\
    \ in Figure 3. Automation is very much essential in all the stages of cultivation\
    \ i.e., selection of quality \nseed, process of planting seeds, growing the young\
    \ plantlets, establishing protection from pets to avoid crop \ndamage, supplying\
    \ the nutrients and water at optimal level to decrease crop failure and increase\
    \ crop \nproductivity. Other applications of automation include controlled and\
    \ effective harvesting method to decrease \ncrop wastage, post harvest collection\
    \ of crop, processing of collected crop and transportation for marketing. \nFood\
    \ safety measure brings confidence and increase acceptability of the consumers\
    \ on products or food \nitems. This can be achieved by denoting the safety measures\
    \ implemented in all the stages i.e process of \ncultivation, harvest and post\
    \ harvest operations, of crop management. Safety measures implanted through \n\
    automated food chain approaches give more business to the industry and also furnish\
    \ reputation to  \nthe formers which increase their confidence and attract more\
    \ people towards agricultural practices.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Models practiced\
    \ in supply chain strategies of agriculture practices, (a) B2B model,  \n(b) B2C\

    \ helps in overcoming the hurdles in food supply chain by \nintegrating with Application\
    \ Programming Interface (API) system. Big data analytics can certainly add value\
    \ \nto the agricultural practice in many regards such as bringing the returns\
    \ from scientific investments, \nestablishing the good agricultural practice,\
    \ implementation of precision agricultural based techniques at field \nlevel,\
    \ efficient food supply chain mechanism and automation of the total process for\
    \ the profitable  \nagriculture [18, 19]. \n \n2.4.   Data mining and analytics\
    \ \nDecision support system (DSS) in the field of agriculture is ably supported\
    \ by data mining tools. \nThe main aim of the processes involved in data mining\
    \ is to extract the information from the currently \navailable data sets and then\
    \ transform the same using specific tools to a unique format that is easily \n\
    understandable and can be used for advanced purposes as shown in Figure 4. Data\
    \ mining helps in soil \nfertility studies and empowers the farmers in making\
    \ a decision to sow specific variety of the crop that results \nin a better yield.\
    \ The main aim of soil classification is to predict the engineering properties\
    \ and fertilizer of \nsoil there by order the choices for use. The currently available\
    \ statistical techniques and the laboratory test \nconsume lot of time, energy\
    \ and money. It is possible to develop more efficient techniques for solving \n\
    complex and large data sets of soil with improved accuracy and effectiveness.\
    \ Data mining techniques based \non GPS, k-means approach, SVMs, K-nearest fertilize\
    \ method are useful to study the soil characteristics, \npollution in atmosphere,\
    \ the factors that influence the crop yield.  \nSoil tests are normally conducted\
    \ to study the fertility of the soil, impurity and other deficiencies if any \n\
    in soil that to be removed. Most of the Soil testing laboratories that are owned\
    \ by either government or private \nsector offer different protocols for analysis\
    \ of the soil and the literature pertaining to the soil characteristics. \nSuitable\
    \ fertilizers are recommended based on the data available with reference to the\
    \ soil composition. This \nhelps the formers to apply a suitable fertilizer for\
    \ specific crops during that season [20-21].  \n \n \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN:\

    \ forecasting techniques \nOne of the greatest challenges for agriculture is climate\
    \ change and its impact on human life.  \nIn contrary to other fields like e-commerce\
    \ and advertising where Big Data has played big role in their \nsuccess, there\
    \ is little impact on advanced understanding of the environment. This inconsistency\
    \ curtails  \nthe climate data with complex nature. Big data analytics has been\
    \ in use to mine large datasets of climate \nwith more focus of differences between\
    \ the traditional big data and mining climate data approaches [23].  \nIn India\
    \ the impact of climate change effects plant growth development and subsequently\
    \ crop yield. Due to \nthe increase in the temperatures, there is a drastic reduction\
    \ in the duration of the crop. Increase in crop \nrespiration rate had resulted\
    \ in pattern change of pest attack. Most of the crops have adjusted to the growing\
    \ \nseason, day lengths of the middle and lower latitudes and with poor response\
    \ to the much longer days of  \nthe summer. Increased temperature accelerates\
    \ the rate of release of CO2 during warmer seasons resulting in \nreduced crop\
    \ yield. By collecting the data of rainfall and temperature of last 5 years one\
    \ can analyze the data \nby using different big data analytics tools to get the\
    \ exact change in the Indian agricultural climate [24]. \nSensors play a vital\
    \ role in predicting the effectiveness of the certain seeds, fertilizer in different\
    \ section of \nthe farm as shown in Figure 5. To achieve an optimum crop yield,\

    \ it can be observed that there are numerous \napproaches that can be used for\
    \ improving the quality and quantity of crops. In contrast to other developed\
    \ \ncountries, in India it is a big challenge to achieve the anticipated growth\
    \ due to non-maintenance of resources \non which the production systems depend.\
    \ Various elements influence the successful use of quality farming. \nThe usage\
    \ of technology in agriculture domain has resulted in digital agriculture, precision\
    \ \nagriculture, analytics for crop yield etc. In India, large numbers of people\
    \ are engaged in agriculture and there \nis a gap between the farmers and technology.\
    \ Governments have introduced various methods into agriculture \nto help the farmers\
    \ to take the advantage of technology. In spite of this, there is a scope for\
    \ user friendly \neasily understandable agro advisory systems to help farmers\
    \ to take decision on crops to be sown. Also at \ndifferent levels of crops growth,\
    \ these technological inventions should help farmers to extract best yield with\
    \ \nreduced expenses. There exists a scope for research in this area. \n \n \n\

    Highlights • Reviews over than two hundred papers, that provide a contribution
    to knowledge by establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies
    and Agri-Food Supply Chain Challenges. • A compressive state of the art of Agri-Food
    4.0 related technologies is covered. • Reviews and contributes on the digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food. • Links to the agri-food
    supply chain challenges. • Presents new trends and models in agri-food supply
    chains. Abstract The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to the term "Industry
    4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the origins of the industrial
    revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later
    the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies
    generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0
    concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest
    developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process
    across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms
    behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex
    networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies,
    especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements.
    In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses
    some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery
    incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing
    their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones,
    support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather,
    geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire
    farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing
    agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of
    Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours
    and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture
    4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to
    save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains
    open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies
    and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand
    the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. Previous article in issue Next article

    to support rural employment and to make a considerable contribution to territorial
    development. Even though they have always been considered a cornerstone of agricultural
    activity in the European Union (EU), this sector most often suffers from very
    low efficiency and effectiveness, sensitivity to weather, market disruptions and
    other external factors, such as poor agriculture supply chain stakeholders’ linkages
    and communication, especially at the food processing level. In fact, and as stablished
    by the FAO,1 under an approach from “field to fork” the agriculture supply chain
    structures can also be named Agri-Food supply chains, where main events coming
    from the agricultural production of food to the food processing events, including
    trading, are linked. Across this Agri-Food Supply Chain, in most of the cases,
    the transferred agriculture knowledge, from generation to generation, is paramount
    from a cultural point of view, but most of the time, it does not answer to the
    needs nor the requirements of the Agri-Food Supply Chains. Furthermore, such delineation
    does not exist also between farms as economic units and farmers who are producing
    food, mostly, for their own consumption. However, no formal delineation to what
    is a “small” and/or a “large” farm formally exists that is holistically accepted,
    it depends on several factors, such as countries, regions, politics, strategies,
    market shares amongst many others. Nonetheless, there are two criteria to classify
    farm size: standard output (in economic terms) and utilised agricultural area
    (UAA), as alternative measure2 . In this same line, Eurostat3 predicts that, by
    2026, an increment of 4%–6% in agriculture cost savings, as well as an increment
    of 3 % in market value, will be regarded to the use and development of smart agriculture.
    Hence, “Agriculture 4.0″ emerges to provide advanced technologies to the famers
    in order to meet agri-food production challenges, hence, to achieve more affordable
    prices for open market and the minimum cost for farmers. Thus, the expectation
    for the further coming years, is that Agri-Food 4.0 should help meeting sustainable
    challenges by increasing the agri-food supply chain stakeholders revenues as well
    as decreasing their pressure for handling complex and external factors they cannot
    control, such as weather, market behaviours and policies, but also to react on
    time by visualising current trends in needs. This paper focus principally on the
    factory farm model issued from the European and north American style. In those
    typologies of farms the Industry 4.0 elements can be introduced and merged with
    the agricultural domain to create the Agri-Food 4.0. The focus is more specialised
    on the industrial farming although the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted
    also to the organic and silvo-pasture paradigms. Thus, this paper, considering
    a review over than two hundred papers, provides a contribution to knowledge by
    establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies and Agri-Food
    Supply Chain Challenges, which opens the 4.0 research field for a multidisciplinary
    work. The choice of the literature review methodology focused firstly on key words
    related to the Agri-food technology, then the second approach was to focus on
    selected journals and at the end we looked for the data-based repository and the
    linked publications. To accomplish this, the structure in this paper is as follows:
    in the first place, a compressive state of the art of Agri-Food 4.0 related technologies
    is covered. In the second place, a review and contribution coming from digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food shows linkages with
    next trends and technologies. Next, and linked to the agri-food supply chain challenges,
    the fourth section presents new trends and models in agri-food supply chains,
    especially in the domain of risk management, collaboration, governance, cold chain
    management, globalization, information and communication technologies, Logistics,
    supply chain structures and sustainable agri-food supply chains. Finally, the
    fifth section covers the main conclusions, visions and perspectives for this novel
    research. 2. Agri-food 4.0 and technologies state-of-the-art The agricultural
    sector has been active in digital innovation for decades already. Especially the
    advances in Precision Agriculture, remote sensing, robots, farm management information
    systems, and (agronomic) decision support systems have paved the way for a broad
    digital transformation in farming and food (Pedro and Gonzalez-Andujar, 2019).
    Recent developments, such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain,
    Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, allow for the integration of so far isolated
    lines of development into smart, connected systems of systems. Those technologies
    will let the agriculture to evolve in a data-driven, intelligent, agile and autonomous
    connected system of systems. The operations of each agricultural process will
    be automatically integrated in the food chain through the semantically active
    technologies up to the end consumer. The 4th industrial revolution is now reaching
    agriculture. The digital platform (DP) concept emerged as an integration of heterogeneous
    mainly open software solutions for ecosystem building (Yablonsky, 2018). The EU
    promote the creation of digital platforms for several application domains as manufacturing
    (i.e. FoF 11 – 2016 projects, DT-ICT-07-2018-2019, etc.), construction (BIM + calls),
    etc. As a concentration of technology enablers, research on DP covers several
    issues such as software engineering (Guertin and Van Benthem, 2016; Wang et al.,
    2006), process simulation and development (Zhao and Yao, 2016; Hu et al., 2016),
    features analysis (Wang et al., 2014), resource performance (Mocnej et al., 2018),
    test algorithms (Santiago et al., 2017) or performance control (Sahota et al.,
    2011). The technological platforms allow access to the different stakeholders
    and provide deployment capabilities for IT solutions. These solutions are exposed
    by service providers or developed by software engineers. Agricultural Data management
    and exploitation is the central node between digital transformation capabilities
    and the agriculture concerns. The main research issues concern the consolidation
    of data repositories with open data (Gumaste and Kadam, 2016) (weather, maps,
    etc.), governance data (policies, local regulation, etc.) and domain specific
    data from end users. Data typology is very rich (land, location, energy, climate,
    climate impact, etc.) and data volume is continually increasing by the integration
    of sensors and IoT platforms in agriculture (Amandeep et al., 2017; Biradar and
    Shabadi, 2017). Data engineering effort covers pattern definition (Laube et al.,
    2011; Spekken et al., 2016), classification algorithms (Narvaez et al., 2018;
    Shi et al., 2015; Yalcin and Razavi, 2016), correlation analysis (Nilsson et al.,
    2016; Xavier et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2017), etc. All those technologies provide
    engineering capabilities for agricultural data. The implementation of these techniques
    will handle farmers data, will integrate new data repositories from external providers,
    will transform data to knowledge and feed decision support systems. The data transparency
    enabler with necessary sharing policies will accelerate data ingestion and ejection
    processes. 2.1. Big data technologies Research activities in Big Data provide
    relevant results in several application domains (healthcare, marketing, maritime,
    urban, manufacturing, etc.). The Big Data Value Association (BDVA)4 promote the
    application of bigdata in different domains (Belaud et al., 2019). The Big Data
    Grapes EU project5 provides data semantic, analytics, integration and exploitation
    solutions as well as a software stack for grapes agriculture. As additional ongoing
    research issues, we identified tools and technology development (Devarakonda et
    al., 2014; Hashem and Ranc, 2016), analytic methods and services (Malhotra et
    al., 2017; Deka and Walczak, 2017), clustering methods (Balan et al., 2015), transformation
    algorithms (Penar and Wilczek, 2016; Hashem and Ranc, 2016) performance and data
    processing technics (Wu and Zhao, 2009), data source and storage management (Cha
    et al., 2018; RubyDinakar and Vagdevi, 2017), etc. The integration of Big Data
    technologies in Agri-Food projects plays an important role in: the extension of
    farmers data to create new knowledge; the creation of innovative services and
    processes by IT providers and software developers as well as the extension and
    the adaptation of ICT and Factories of the Future (FoF)6 related Big Data models
    and patterns for agriculture. There are several Big Data Repositories that guarantee,
    nowadays, the access and the exploitation to Agri-Food data. As example: the “National
    Climatic Data Centre” (about 2,9 Go per day); Satellite Imagery and metrological
    information from Google and the NASA Earth Exchange; Soil, water and geospatial
    data from the National Resources Conservation Service (US); the OpenCorporates
    as the world’s largest open repository of companies (165 million companies around
    the word); etc. 2.2. Internet of things technologies The integration of IoT platforms
    in agriculture provides additional data sources describing agricultural features
    (water, soil, humans, animals, etc.) with more data. The recent research issues
    on IoT highlight the multiplication of IoT platforms. This expansion generates
    new implementation frameworks (Lee et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018) answering
    to different requirement models, new networks of heterogeneous components and
    sensors with different monitoring models (Pflanz et al., 2018; Vergara et al.,
    2017; Prathibha et al., 2017), time processing scheme and misbalanced energy consumption
    (Ruano et al., 2018; Jarolimek et al., 2016). The integration of the IoT platforms
    with the agricultural issues could add additional research challenges, specifically
    when the data are stocked or used in the cloud, in terms of interoperability (Panetto,
    2007; Mocnej et al., 2018; Zarko et al., 2017; Hefnawy et al., 2017; Martinez
    et al., 2016; Leal et al., 2019; Panetto et al., 2016) (protocols, security, etc.),
    performance monitoring (Paulraj et al., 2018; Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017), etc.
    In addition, IoT serves Robotics (Murar and Brad, 2015) and Automated Guided Vehicles
    (AGV) (Sanchez-Hermosilla et al., 2013). An interesting activity might be the
    benchmarking of all the existing IoT platforms and their proposed functionalities
    and mapping them with Agri-Food stakeholders’ requirements. The integration of
    IoT capabilities will support farmers in the harvesting of new data sources to
    create new valuable services. 2.3. Knowledge model approaches The development
    of valuable knowledge models in agriculture aims to transform shared multi-sources
    data repositories to create profitable services and support the decision making
    for different stakeholders. Recent research topics address precise data collection
    and engineering to serve knowledge creation of new farming models (Abdullah et
    al., 2017; Irmak et al., 2006), technology application in farming (Chen and Jin,
    2011; Gerhards et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2013), resource allocation (Garcia
    et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2017; Musacchio and Grant, 2002), assessment frameworks
    (for risk, policies definition and quality management) (Jacxsens et al., 2016;
    Louwagie et al., 2012) as well as the qualification of decision models (Costanzo
    and Faro, 2012; Dragincic et al., 2015) and the identification of decision parameters
    (region, land, climate, plant, time, process, etc.). 2.4. Artificial intelligence
    techniques Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques propose important contributions
    to knowledge model’s identification, service creation and the decision-making
    processes as support for the different Agri-Food’s applications (Solemane et al.,
    2019). AI offers formal general algorithms for prediction (Bhatt and Buch, 2015;
    Soh et al., 2018), accuracy and performance evaluation (Jeon et al., 2017) as
    well as pattern classification (Ott et al., 2003; Pinho et al., 2011; Starr, 2005)
    that might solve knowledge issues in the agricultural domain such as the pest’s
    identifications and the correct treating methods. In addition, AI supports applications
    in farming technics development: land allocation regarding the targeted activity
    (Pokhrel et al., 2018), irrigation process analysis and control (Ait-Mouheb et
    al., 2018; Mohanraj et al., 2017), robot guidance (Tian et al., 2018; Roshanianfard
    et al., 2018; Sheridan, 2016), etc. 2.5. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture emerges
    as a main concept in Agri-Food 4.0. By integrating new technology enablers propelled
    by the Industry 4.0 paradigm (Annosi et al., 2019), smart agriculture addresses
    important farming objectives as water saving (O’Connor and Mehta, 2016), soil
    conservation (Li et al., 2002), limit carbon emission (Ochoa et al., 2014) and
    productivity increasing (Mayer et al., 2015) by doing more with less. The new
    agricultural age aims to harmonize and share better local European policies and
    rules to scale the best farming practices and applications. Smart agriculture
    offers the opportunity to farmers, technology and service providers, governance
    agencies and other impacted stakeholders (financial organization, investors, traders,
    etc.) to share their experiences and preoccupations in the optimization in the
    farming Supply Chain with the close respect of production sustainability (Swisher
    et al., 2018; Oberholster et al., 2015). 2.6. Precision farming techniques and
    robot development The Precision Farming topic is already covered by other H2020
    calls (SFS-05-2017, SFS-06-2018-2020, SFS-08-2018-2019, etc.). The analysis of
    released projects outcomes and related research issues allows to identify new
    technologies, processes and applications in agriculture. Relevant models are proposed
    for land, grain and arable related activities (Gumma et al., 2016). Relevant listed
    results cover harvesting distribution accuracy (Roshanianfard et al., 2018; Kamata
    et al., 2018; Alzahrani, 2018), cost development (Pomar et al., 2010) and distribution
    optimization (Zhou et al., 2018; Tabatabaie et al., 2013; Ruiz-Garcia et al.,
    2010; Eisele et al., 2001). Within the Agri-Food projects is planned to reuse
    available precision farming technologies and results to improve the quality of
    targeted farmers’ processes and applications. Results in the integration of robots
    in agriculture are well mature and already proposed by Agri-Food stakeholders.
    With precision farming enablers, it will be ensured the performance of impacted
    farming processes. Agriculture Robots are already investigated in the precision
    farming topic. Recent research in this area covers the adaptability of robot design
    to the agriculture sector, the improvement of navigation conditions through additional
    sensing (Liu et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2017; Jhonattan et al., 2019) and localization
    capabilities as well as real-time image processing (Xu et al., 2017; Pilli et
    al., 2015) and camera detection (Dworak et al., 2013) to maximize the operational
    capabilities and behaviour of robots and collaborative robots (cobots). Robots
    can assist humans (Chilcanan et al., 2017; Dondeynaz et al., 2013) for difficult
    tasks or replace them for difficult ones. The cost reduction (Pomar et al., 2010)
    effectiveness is demonstrated and research in decision error reduction (Montecinos
    et al., 2018; Shin and Ko, 2017; Brigido et al., 2015) is intensive to improve
    accuracy by simulation (Xu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Latorre-Biel et al.,
    2018) and by more precise path finding (Spekken et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 2017)
    and guidance algorithms (Kviz et al., 2014; Baio, 2012). The new Agri-Food projects
    fund the integration of Agriculture Robots to support the applications since the
    beginning to ensure the maximum results. Building resilient and sustainable farming
    system is the ultimate concept behind Agriculture 4.0. Recent research in this
    topic covers farming processes sustainability analysis (McGuire and Sperling,
    2013; Joly, 2005), farming activity calibration (Suryoputro et al., 2017; Hosseini
    et al., 2014; do Nascimento et al., 2012) (rotation cycles, control of accuracy),
    the development of conservation protocols (Kladivko et al., 2014; Gaspary et al.,
    2002) and the alignment of business development strategies. 3. How the new digital
    technology transforms the agri-food supply chains To achieve robust, resilient
    and sustainable agri-food supply chains is very complex because they face more
    sources of uncertainty and risks in comparison with other supply chains that give
    rise to serious questions and concerns about their economic, environmental and
    social performance. Several studies identify agricultural sources of uncertainty
    (Mundi et al., 2019; Esteso et al., 2017; Esteso et al., 2018) and how to model
    them (Grillo et al., 2019). In Esteso et al. (2018) four types of crop-based uncertainty
    are identified: Product (shelf-life, deterioration rate, lack of homogeneity,
    food quality and food safety), Process (harvesting yield, supply lead time, resource
    needs, production), Market (demand, market prices) and Environment (weather, pests
    & diseases and regulations). Poor management of these sources of uncertainty can
    have a very negative impact on safety, quality, quantity and waste of products
    as well as human, technological and natural resources. Indeed, the agri-food sector
    is one of the economic and political areas worldwide, with key implications in
    sustainability to cover not only the food needs of the population, contribute
    to their employability and economic growth, but also in the impact on the natural
    environment (Iakovou et al., 2014). Therefore, the agri-food supply chains are
    strongly pressured to manage these sources of uncertainty and risks whose precise
    evolution over time is unknown but may jeopardize the future sustainability of
    these type of supply chains. It is necessary to move away from “business as usual”
    developing new solutions and implement innovative technologies (FAO, 2018). Along
    these lines, a digitalized supply chain, allows companies to monitor material
    flows in real time making potential risks visible and develop future plans to
    face them. The main drivers for the digitalization of the processes of SC are
    usually the increase of the flexibility and the speed of reaction of the industrial/logistical
    systems (ten Hompel and Henke, 2017a, ten Hompel and Henke, 2017b) as well as
    the improvement of agri-food supply chain robustness and resilience. In this context,
    data becomes crucial. Data is the lifeblood of any business and the agricultural
    business is not an exception but rather a referent. The new technologies have
    a great impact on the reduction of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise
    data in real time, whose treatment, together with the capacities of autonomous
    and intelligent decision making will help to increase the efficiency, sustainability,
    flexibility, agility, and the resilience along the whole supply chain from the
    farmers to the final customers. In the context of data-driven supply chains, the
    new technologies listed in the previous section, provide different and complementary
    support to the sequence of activities from data chain (Wolfert et al., 2017):
    data capture, storage, transfer, transformation, analytics and marketing. The
    support of each technology to different data chain activities lets envisage that
    the true potential of the data comes from the combination and integration of these
    technologies. Indeed, each one will improve some of the following basic functions
    of agri-food supply chains: sensing, monitoring, control, analysis (descriptive
    capabilities), prediction (predictive capabilities), decision-making (prescriptive
    capabilities) and adaptive learning. Through the sensing, monitoring, control
    and analysis it is possible to the early and accurate detection of problems and
    even predicting them before occurring, making better decisions and learn of them
    improving the sustainability and resilience of agri-food supply chains. In fact,
    the integration of previous technologies allows a more intelligent management
    of the agri-food supply chains, being able to combine multiple models of independent
    data analysis, repositories of historical data and data flows in real time. Real-time
    information and data processing tools provide new opportunities for companies
    to react more quickly to changing conditions in the supply chain. Due to this
    integrated intelligence, the agri-food supply chain management goes from supporting
    decisions to delegating them and, ultimately, to predicting which decisions should
    be taken. From all the above, there is no doubt that these new technologies are
    transforming the way agricultural sector organize and make decisions. In order
    to provide a general overview about how the new digital technology transforms
    the agri-food supply chains, the tables (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) integrate
    and classify the main positive impacts of the most relevant technologies as well
    as the challenges to be faced according to recent studies in the field carried
    by different authors. Table 1. IoT: Impact and Challenges. Internet of Things

    network which requires the buy-in of its users and operators. Technological Challenges:
    • Blockchain integration with other technologies (BDA, IoT, CPS) • Strategize
    the transition: blockchain applications offer solutions that require significant
    changes to, or complete replacement of, existing systems. • Limited storage capacity
    and scalability • Control, security, and privacy: while solutions exist, including
    private or permissioned blockchains and strong encryption, there are still cyber
    security concerns that need to be addressed before the general public will entrust
    their personal data to a blockchain solution. • Throughput and latency issue:
    in the context of agri-food Supply Chain management, due to the original restriction
    of block size and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current
    processing capacity of blockchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing
    millions of transactions in real-time • Infrastructure and capacity development
    challenges: it can only be applied as long as an internet connection is available,
    which can still be a challenge in some developing countries Table 3. Big Data

    agri-food risks, benchmarking) • Predictive analytics allows gain insights about
    what will be happening or likely to happen by exploring patterns in data (forecasting
    of demand, yield, price, weather, consumer behaviour) • Prescriptive analytics

    of data generation and delivery, which can be processed in batch, real-time, nearly
    real-time, or streamlines) • Veracity (data quality and level of trust) • Value

    there are multiple actors involved • Big Data trust, privacy and security among
    actors • Big Data Monetization (transfer of rights on data) Social Challenges:

    and individuals to collect and exchange data • Exploring the ethical implications
    of Big Data in food and agriculture • Availability of skilled human resources
    for big data analysis Technological Challenges: Improving the capability of dealing
    with 5V’s • Volume (data exponentially increased, posing a challenge to the capacity
    of storage devices) • Variety (sustainable integrate and combine data from different

    more value and insights from data) • Valence (support of connectivity in data).
    The potential of connectivity between systems is being constrained by a lack of
    common data standards or easy-to-use ontologies. • Combine the three levels of
    analytics: the performance of prescriptive analytics would heavily rely on those
    of descriptive and predictive analytics since providing the value of input parameters
    in the prescriptive model • Combining different data analytic techniques to develop
    more advanced and adaptive BDA models for DSS • Lack of decision support tools

    al., 2016; Elsayed et al., 2018; Reshma and Pillai, 2018) Impact Functional impact:
    AI techniques enable: • Classification: to predict the categories of input data
    for e.g. weather attributes are sunny, windy, rainy etc. • Regression: to predict
    numeric value e.g. price of stocks. • Clustering: to organize similar items in-to
    groups. • Association Analysis: to find interesting relationships between sets
    of variables. • Graph Analysis: to use graphic structure to find connections between
    entities. • Decision Tree: To predict modelling insights of objective variables
    by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. Above capabilities

    that human experts may overlook. • Reduce human intervention enabling human expert
    to concentrate on more creative activities Business Impact: • Automated decision-making
    • Expert system increases the probability, frequency and consistency of making
    good decisions, additive effect of knowledge of many domain experts, facilitates
    real-time, low-cost expert-level decisions by the non-expert, enhance the utilization
    of most of the available data • Learning ability Artificial Intelligence, goes
    a step further by not simply applying pre-programmed decisions, but instead exhibiting
    some learning capabilities • Data transformation: ML and AI can help create value
    by providing enterprises with intelligent analysis of big data and capturing structured
    interpretations of the wide variety of unstructured data increasingly available.
    Technological Impact: • Advancement of ML with machine vision will make agricultural
    technologies accurate, robust and low cost. • AI can be used to identify and clean
    dirty data or use dirty data as a means of establishing context knowledge for
    the data. • AI contributes to the velocity of data, by facilitating rapid computer-based

    computers and to Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs. • Expert systems developed
    in regional languages to be more accessible Challenges Social Challenges: • Replacement
    of human intervention perceived as a threat Technological Challenges: • AI to
    further facilitate additional developments on visualization • AI algorithms designed
    for single-machine environments might have emergent subproblem structures useful
    for parallelization. • Adding speech interface to the system may be proved to
    be more beneficial for the farmers of the remote area • Expert systems will not
    be able to give the creative responses that human experts can give in unusual
    circumstances. • Lack of flexibility and ability to adapt to changing environments.
    • Not being able to recognize when no answer is available. • Knowledge acquisition
    remains the major bottleneck in applying expert system technology to new domains.
    • Maintenance and extension of a rule base can be difficult for a relatively large
    rule base • Enhance IoT with machine learning techniques to analyse data captured
    by sensors in real time in agriculture. As it can be seen in the above tables,
    some challenges of these digital technologies appear as strengths of others. This
    allows intuiting the suitability of using them as complements with the others.
    Indeed, in the near future, the full potential of data will rely on the combination
    of the different technologies that enhance data-driven agri-food supply chains
    more informed, efficient, secure, sustainable and resilient. For instance, IoT
    and BDA can benefit from blockchain providing data security, anonymity, trust
    and decentralization. Since blockchain exchange information in a distributed network,
    novel IoT applications will be developed for distributed environments. On the
    other side, the valuable data generated from the IoT could enrich transaction
    details that are registered on the blockchain (Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018).
    In turn, the accurate data provided by blockchain technology can be used as input
    for AI applications and to also record their outputs (Rabah et al., 2018). Besides,
    AI can enhance IoT by developing applications to analyse data captured by sensors
    in real time using machine learning algorithms (Reshma and Pillai, 2018). Machine
    learning and other analytic methods can also improve predictive and prescriptive
    capabilities (decision making) of Big Data Analytics. There is a broad consensus
    on the need to strengthen research and innovation in the Agri-food sector, both
    in terms of practices and technologies, through the creation of new products,
    the improvement of processes, services or processes or the integration of digital
    possibilities. Indeed, one of the persisting challenges to take advantage of the
    full potential of the data is to achieve not only the integration of these technologies
    but also their interoperability. Diversity of stakeholders integrating agri-food
    supply chains with different interests and characteristics make difficult to find
    solutions that fit all those involved, so group decision-making tools should be
    developed (Zaraté et al., 2019). Moreover, when these solutions require significant
    investments and there are stakeholders, such as small farmers with a limited budget.
    For this reason, it will be key to demonstrate the value of innovations as compared
    to their companies and to collect and exchange data. Other challenges reside on
    the needs of data standards. The standardization of the fruition data would provide
    equity for all stakeholders because of the possibility to access to the same information
    that might provide financial gain. The fruition data might provide the training
    for ensuring the availability of the required technical skills and definition
    of regulatory actions by governments. Research may be co-financed with partners
    private (e.g., companies or business groups), government (many departments and
    agencies involved) or institutional (e. g. universities). This approach accentuates
    the effect leverage government support and improve the transfer of innovations
    to businesses. It enables the training of highly qualified personnel and a new
    generation of scientists for companies and centres of research. The stability
    of funding agreements with the centres promote the retention of their qualified
    staff and facilitate partnerships with industry for the realization of structuring
    projects. Access to appropriate funding and research tax credits and development
    (R&D) is also a source of funding structuring for the industry to absorb financial
    risks generated by innovation activities (Tuhin et al., 2019). This type of financing
    is particularly important when innovation takes place directly in the company,
    which is often the case in food processing. 4. The new models of the Agri-Food
    supply chains The competitiveness of food processing companies depends on their
    investment capacity, the increase in their production, the development of new
    products and the implementation of processes to stand out from the competition
    (Guoqing et al., 2020). Over the past 30 years, we have seen a significant reduction
    in biodiversity, FAO estimates that we will have a 70 % reduction in biodiversity
    on our planet by 2050 (FAO, 2018). Human activities seem to be the main cause
    of this loss. The agriculture has many cards in hand to slow this process by implementing
    environmental protection practices and reducing the chemicals that have led to
    the destruction of many animals and insects living on land, in the air and in
    the water; creating green corridors and shelters for animals and insects; the
    cultivation of old species or species with high genetic variability, leaving the
    design of hybrid plants and monocultures that lead to significant genetic depletion;
    the reduction of arable land to make way for the replanting of forests, grasslands
    and hedges. The competitiveness is addressed to a new way of thinking the Agriculture
    that will let to optimize the process and respecting the nature. The labour shortage
    in many regions of Europe requires processing companies to automate and robotize
    their processes. In addition, investment in these new technologies allows them
    to improve their productivity and provide better working conditions necessary
    to the attraction and retention of the workforce. In addition, to meet the quality
    standards requirements of large chains and food retailers, they must use recognised
    quality management and traceability systems. Investment in digital technologies
    also promotes automation of operations, data management and access to a new range
    of management tools (Industry 4.0). The industry is particularly requested, as
    shown in the previous section, for the use of digital technologies, which allows
    it to optimize production and the supply chain while ensuring traceability of
    food from more and more pointed (Panetto et al., 2019). It is not new that, nowadays,
    agricultures supply chain practices, especially regarding to food products, are
    currently under public scrutiny. As established by Van Der Vorst (2006), this
    is because several factors, which considers food contamination issues, the new
    consumer healthy requirements, requirements for more precise information about
    the farming, marketing, and distribution practices used to bring the agricultural
    products into the shelves into supermarket, to name a few. In this same context,
    and regarding to Suprem et al. (2013), agricultural industry has been solely dependent
    on human labour with limited application of mechanical equipment and machines.
    Moreover, the applications of advanced technology such as embedded computing,
    robotics, wireless technology, GPS/GIS (Geographical Positioning System/Geographical
    Information System) and DBMS (Database Management System) software are seen to
    be recent developments, where regulations are vaguely considered. Moreover, the
    increasing gap between farmer''s expectations and the ability of the government
    led extension services has created a big business opportunity for private parties
    (Kumar and Ali, 2007). In this context, the information about the geometric properties
    of crops provided by digital based techniques, such as: ultrasound, digital photographic
    techniques, light sensors, high-resolution radar images, high-resolution X-ray
    computed tomography, stereo vision and LIDAR sensors; has innumerable applications
    in agriculture. Some important agricultural tasks that can benefit from these
    plant-geometry characterization techniques are the application of pesticides,
    irrigation, fertilization and crop training, improving the environmental and economic
    impact. But there is still a need to resolve several technological and commercial
    questions (Rosell et al., 2012). In line to this, agriculture technologies are
    focused on how traceability can be performed, in fact, the food industry had developed
    efficient traceability methods for the management of logistics and warehouses,
    based on the balance of costs and benefits of the traceability system level (Dabbene
    et al., 2013). Because of this, several authors are currently reviewing main agriculture
    supply chain technology based methods, and example of this is provided by Ahumada
    and Villalobos (2008), who identified that the use of integrated planning models
    in the agriculture supply chains is still very limited, with a high potential
    to manage perishable agri-food products, especially to deal with complex environments.
    In addition, (Ali and Kumar, 2011a) study the implication of using ICT in agriculture.
    From the authors’ findings it is highly appreciated that there is still a medium
    level of dissemination of information and knowledge sharing in agricultural developments
    (Boshkoska et al., 2019), as well as there is still a need for empirical evidences
    as to how ICT interventions are enabling the farmers to take informed decisions.
    Complementary to this, S. Araba and M. Fellows (Araba and Fellows, 2009) address
    that the majority of current research have not established a clear link between
    public access to ICTs and socioeconomic change/impacts in agriculture. In fact,
    there is a need for researchers to go beyond anecdotal evidence of downstream
    public access impacts on end‐users. Nevertheless, it is also evidenced that there
    is still limited ability on information to make definitive statements about agriculture
    expected impacts, as well as to identify and attribute specific impacts to specific
    ICT usage. Table 5 presents a summary on well-known methods and approached to
    support this, in special the agriculture supply chain decision-making methods.

    Hence, and as depicted from Table 1, as studied and established by Reardon et
    al. (2019), the food system can be thought of as “dendritic,” linking R&D, finance,
    input, and output supply chains. This means (1) the first and “core” supply chain,
    is the output Supply Chain. The second and upstream “feeder” supply chains are
    the farm input supply chains. The third and downstream ‘feeder’ supply chains
    are those supplying inputs to the post-farmgate segments. The fourth “pan-system
    feeder” supply chain is that supplying finance into every segment of every chain
    in the dendritic system. The fifth ‘feeder’ supply chain is a broad set of public
    assets apart from agricultural research institutions. The sixth set of “feeders”
    is the R&D supply chains, which supply technology and product innovations. Moreover,
    the ICT challenges in Agriculture supply chains are still open. Birkel in Birkel
    and Hartmann (2019), studied most of the recent ICT developments in this field,
    and found that most of the technological challenges in agriculture mainly includes
    security issues, lack of standards and interoperability, as well as hardware and
    software limitations are the focus of current research. Hence, the main challenges
    and risks are also in relation to the methodology, where (Ben-Daya et al., 2017)
    has revealed that the design aspect is primarily identified as a technological
    issue, while neglecting social and political challenges. Food processing companies''
    projects must benefit from financial levers that the government makes available
    to all in the manufacturing sector (Hernández et al., 2020). In order to further
    stimulate the investments, particularly in the SMEs and in innovative sectors,
    from financial tools considering the needs of the processing sector are decisive
    for the development of the implementation of development projects (Hernandez et
    al., 2020). In a business environment characterized by technological innovation,
    the consolidation of industries, deregulation and demand for consumers in constant
    evolution, the approaches of the traditional managers can no longer allow for
    companies to remain profitable. They are therefore forced to find new ways to
    stay competitive in agri-food domain, as it is also the case for all other industrial
    sectors (Boehlje, 1999; Senge, 1997; Senge et al., 2006). In the value chain management
    (VCM) domain, the informed decision making to unite resources to improve the competitiveness,
    is proving to be a powerful strategic approach that allows organizations to adapt
    to an environment of business in full motion. (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011;
    Dunne, 2008; Fearne, 2007; Fernandez et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). The concept
    of a continuous observation results in continuous and significant improvement
    of the design and the system performance, this is only possible when the companies
    are able to establish a degree of coordination and integration with their suppliers
    and customers that do not allow them the usual relationships with the latter based
    on the transactional approach buyer-seller (Sparling, 2007). Closer strategic
    relationships with customers and suppliers allow companies to better learn and
    adapt (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Multiple firms that co-invent and work together
    for the same objectives using integrated processes can increase their performance
    in a much more significant way that if they had gone it alone (Bonney et al.,
    2007; Fearne, 2007). Co-innovation allows companies to improve their own practices
    as well as those of all of them, it is a process that gives companies competitive
    forces that are difficult to match by others (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011).
    Several of the cases mentioned below demonstrate the benefits sustainable and
    competitive products obtained by companies who have chosen to co-innovate with
    other members of their supply chain. 5. Conclusions, vision and perspectives For
    this scientific contribution to knowledge, more than two hundred papers support
    the analysis on scientific work on the smart agriculture technology trends, but,
    more importantly, on how they emerge as a main concept in the agriculture domain
    as Agri-Food 4.0. From this reviews and analysis, it is clearly revealed that
    integration across new technologies allows smart agriculture to address important
    farming objectives as water saving, soil conservation, limit carbon emission and
    productivity increasing by doing more with less. In fact, the new technologies
    have a positive impact and at the same time pose new challenges in the management
    of different domains of human knowledge. Hence, two main conceptual pillars impact
    and challenges, arising from the use of various technologies in the world of the
    new conception of agriculture are the fundamental aspects in Agri-Food 4.0. A
    precision is due. This paper focus principally on the factory farm model issued
    from the “western” style. In those farms, the Agri-Food 4.0 started to be applied
    and validated. The focus is more specialised on the industrial farming although
    the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted also to the organic and silvo-pasture
    paradigms. The paper pays attention particularly to four major technologies, the
    Internet of Things, the Blockchain, the Big data and the Artificial Intelligence.
    For each of those technologies is presented some type of impacts: functional,
    economic, environmental, social, related to the business and technological and
    the challenges that come with their introduction. The literature is segmented
    in relation to the functionality of the specific technology and a panoramic view
    gives the possibility to better understand the paths needed to face the new challenges.
    The future of the Agriculture domain is in the creation of a resilient and sustainable
    farming system. On the four types of crop-based uncertainty that have been identified:
    Product, Process, Market and Environment the core problem is the management. Poor
    management of these sources of uncertainty have a negative impact on safety, quality,
    quantity and waste of products as well as human, technological and natural resources.
    Today, and always more in the future, the data is the lifeblood of any business
    and the agricultural business is not an exception but rather a referent. As aforementioned
    in the discussion section, the new technologies have a great impact on the reduction
    of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise data in real time, and real-time
    information tools provide new opportunities for companies to react more quickly
    to changing conditions in the supply chain. Our interest in the next future is
    to use formal methods to extract knowledge from the interrelation of the difference
    technologies impacts and from the existing solutions to the highlighted challenges
    to increase the efficiency, sustainability, flexibility, agility, and the resilience
    along the whole supply chain from the farmers to the final customers, and the
    analysis and outcomes from this paper, will contribute to support that from the
    main research knowledge findings. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors,

    Get rights and content Highlights • Smart Cities are gaining popularity and the
    Internet of Things (IoT) is leading to the generation of massive amounts of Data.
    • Big Data can be better managed through Artificial Intelligence processes and
    render faster and more intelligent systems • Technology must however not be the
    sole focus of Smart Cities as we may lose in human dimensions • Technology must
    support liveability dimensions to ensure Resilience, Safety and Sustainability
    as prescribed by the SDG 11. Abstract Cities are increasingly turning towards
    specialized technologies to address issues related to society, ecology, morphology
    and many others. The emerging concept of Smart Cities highly encourages this prospect
    by promoting the incorporation of sensors and Big Data through the Internet of
    Things (IoT). This surge of data brings new possibilities in the design and management
    of cities just as much as economic prospects. While Big Data processing through
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) can greatly contribute to the urban fabric, sustainability
    and liveability dimensions however must not be overlooked in favour of technological
    ones. This paper reviews the urban potential of AI and proposes a new framework
    binding AI technology and cities while ensuring the integration of key dimensions
    of Culture, Metabolism and Governance; which are known to be primordial in the
    successful integration of Smart Cities for the compliance to the Sustainable Development
    Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda. This paper is aimed towards Policy Makers, Data
    Scientists and Engineers who are looking at enhancing the integration of Artificial
    Intelligence and Big Data in Smart Cities with an aim to increase the liveability
    of the urban fabric while boosting economic growth and opportunities. Previous

    citiesInternet of thingsSustainabilityLiveability 1. Introduction Data generation
    is believed to be possible in almost all sectors of human activity and this promises
    new ways of understanding our world. This availability of data showcases that
    Big Data can be useful in optimal usage of resources while making informed decisions
    (Alam, Sajid, Talib, & Niaz, 2014). The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Machine Learning (Dempsey, Bramley, Power, & Brown, 2009) amongst others
    (Mayer-Schonberger & Cukie, 2013) can contribute greatly to this process. Smart
    Cities have adopted IoT as a means to encourage efficiency and performance of
    urban fabrics. Bhadani (2016) and Batty (2016) supports that increased connectivity
    led to an unprecedented amount of data creation, which created the possibility
    for a platform that allows for gathering, analyzing and distribution of data that
    is useful in different spheres of life (Evans, 2011). IoT encompasses digitization,
    which sparked changes in the way numerous entities work; be it governments, organization,
    businesses or individuals (Miller & Mork, 2013). These changes have resulted into
    a tremendous growth in generated data. A report by the International Data Corporation
    (IDC) shares that available data by 2020 will increase to beyond 35 trillion gigabytes
    (Gu, Li, & Cao, 2014). However, the perception and description of ‘Big Data’ keeps
    evolving. Alam et al. (2014) views Big Data in terms of volume, velocity and variety.
    On a similar line, Chen, Chiang, and Storey (2012) shares an understanding relating
    to volume and the analytical method employed by different individuals and organisations.
    Kitchin & McArdle (2016) added to these characteristics the dimensions of exhaustivity,
    resolution, indexicality, relationality, extensionality and scalability. As those
    dimensions bring numerous advantages, it is believed that cities will be amongst
    the main beneficiaries (Barns, 2016; Bibri, 2018a; Lim, Kim, & Maglio, 2018).
    The analysis of Big Data can be done through Artificial Intelligence; which can
    be interpreted as the way of training computers to mimic thinking patterns and
    can even be done to simulate human behaviours (Tecuci, 2012). The accuracy of
    achieved results is understood to increase with more data and processing as machine
    learning occurs; hence the primordial need for Big Data and the desirability of
    real time data. As cities are increasingly digitized, the role of Information
    Communication and Technology (ICT) in urban fabrics have been widely covered (Aguilera,
    Peña, Belmonte, & López-de-Ipiña, 2017; Allam, 2017a; Allam & Newman, 2018a; Neirotti,
    De Marco, Cagliano, Mangano, & Scorrano, 2014a), and it has been shown that technologies
    have allowed governments, municipalities and decision makers to collect data regarding
    a plethora of issues (Abaker, Hashem, Chang, & Anuar, 2016; Souza, Figueredo,
    Cacho, Araújo, & Prolo, 2016). It''s processing, and analysis allows for better
    urban governance as policy makers can make informed decisions and formulate adequate
    and responsive policies. Such analysis can be performed by Artificial Intelligence.
    While AI has been in fashion since the early 1950''s (Google Books Ngram Viewer,
    2018), its applicability has been slow in adoption. An analysis from Google Trends
    (Fig. 1) on the popularity of Big Data and AI (Google Trends, 2018) interestingly
    reveals a peak in Big Data from 2011 to 2014, while a decline in AI is observed
    from early 2004 to 2008. It can be seen however that the popularity of AI rose
    from 2014 to 2017 which can be interpreted as a result of Big Data, and even can
    even be foreseen to lead towards coupling. Interestingly Allam and Newman (2018a),
    through Fig. 2, shared that the concept of Smart Cities has peaked in almost the
    same time period, highlighting a key correlation with Big Data and AI. Download

    Popularity of Smart Cities from 2004 to 2018 (Allam & Newman, 2018a). However,
    even though the technologies, and the associated benefits of Artificial Intelligence,
    Big Data and Smart Cities have the potential to render numerous positives to an
    urban fabric, Allam (2018a) warns against the blind adoption of technology and
    encourages a further integration to the societal fabric. In this regard, the author
    recommends that careful calibration and contextualisation is key to building truly
    sustainable cities that are in turn resilient just as much as intelligent. This
    paper further explores the opportunities and challenges of ICT through Big Data
    and AI in relation to cities and explores and generates a framework with the potentiality
    of building more sustainable, safe, inclusive and resilient cities as highlighted
    by the Sustainable Goal 11. 2. Big data and cities Numerous researchers support
    that the processing and interpretation of data is an essential step towards enriching
    the urban fabric (Bernabé et al., 2015; Bibri, 2018b; Cheng et al., 2018; Li et
    al., 2016; Neirotti et al., 2014a; Rolf, Pauleit, & Wiggering, 2018). Data can
    now be sourced from numerous neighborhoods to gain a better holistic understanding
    of the urban fabric. This allows planners and policy makers to shift from closed
    systems; where different urban elements such as land plots, open spaces, physical
    buildings and streets are inter-linked to what Levy (1999) calls ‘open fragmented
    peri-urban fabric’. These have tangible impacts on different aspects of the urban
    fabric including density, fragmentation, cohesion, compactness and other variances
    as expressed by Li et al. (2016). A better management of the various dimensions
    and components of the urban fabric is thus crucial. This is becoming increasingly
    possible as cities around the world are becoming digitized through the installation
    of sensors, computational cores and different telecommunication systems (Alvalez,
    2017), as promoted by the contemporary concept of Smart Cities (Allam & Newman,
    2018a). These digital concepts are tied to Artificial Intelligence and machine
    learning technologies, which are making it possible for the collection of near
    real-time data; providing a deeper understanding of how cities evolve, adapt and
    respond to various conditions. Allam and Newman (2018a) support that data analysis
    can allow cities to support socio economic dimensions while ensuring the implementation
    of sustainability features; including liveability components. The processing of
    data through AI can ensure the better provision of liveability dimensions; through
    cleanliness, health and conducive environments for people to live and work without
    the urban challenges of pollution and congestion. It is further believed that,
    through this technology, the built environment can digitally support intelligent
    and responsive services both conveniently and in real time. In addition, cities
    are seen to leverage Big Data from AI to attract higher economic returns since
    their enabling infrastructures such as connectivity, energy and computing capabilities,
    amongst others, allow them to support globally competitive jobs (Davenport & Ronanki,
    2018; Hoske, 2013; Kaplan, 2017; Wilson, Daugherty, & Morini-Bianzino, 2017).
    However Big Data can add to the complexity of data reliance (Bari, 2017; Fan,
    Han, & Liu, 2014; Tole, 2013). For Bari (2017) the availability of Big Data poses
    challenges such as scaling, spanning, preparation, analysis and storage bottleneck.
    Fan et al. (2014) contends that Big Data call for large sample size; hence, the
    problems of noise accumulation, spurious correlation, measurement errors and incidental
    endogeneity, which can delay or impact results. On the other hand, there are advanced
    analytical trends that supports Big Data discovery; hence, quality analysis and
    interpretation. Even though that there are notable challenges, the primary advantage
    of AI in Big Data analysis is that it supports the heterogeneity and commonality
    principles that are part of the Big Data analysis. Through the urban fabric, AI
    could capture hidden structures of urban cells and components and provide a deeper
    understanding of common features. Some of these hidden structures are warranted
    by dynamics and complexities that modern cities are facing due to application
    of technologies in most of their fabrics (Koenig, Miao, Knecht, Bus, & Mei-Chih,
    2017). The adoption of AI, as the source of Big Data analysis, in cities is encouraged
    since it allows for cognitive computing integration; hence, aid in urban design,
    planning processes and governance. 3. Urban governance in the digital era Urban
    governance increases in complexity due to the evolving dynamics of policy. In
    the forefront of these dynamics is the concept of urbanization coupled with digitization.
    In the recent past, the ‘New Public Management’ concept was the blueprint adopted
    by major cities for urban governance (Andersson & Liff, 2012). This is now deemed
    unfit to accommodate numerous institutional and policy complexities; hence, cater
    for social urban problems (Dunleavy, Margetts, Bastow, & Tinkler, 2005). For this
    reason, citizens, especially in developed countries are seen to have leveraged
    on technology to solutions to emerging urban challenges. This triggered the concept
    of urban digitalization, which has seen a widespread adoption in most cities,
    and ultimately changing the ways they operate and governed (Kernaghan, 2000).
    However, according to Lynn (2000), the digitization can be a challenging endeavor
    as older trends continues to play out, and are still active in developed and underdeveloped
    countries. In developed countries, any trend that does not align with the digitization
    is seen as disruptive and only help in delaying the full adoption of digitization.
    This can thus be expected to impact on urban efficiency and performance. Urban
    governance decisions emerging from the reading of data and modern technologies
    has been proven more efficient, citizen-oriented and sustainable. This is because
    data is now available in almost near real-time; hence, facilitating timely and
    quality decisions. Various authors (Allam, 2017a; Allam, 2018b; Allam, Dhunny,
    Siew, & Jones, 2018a; Allam & Jones, 2018a; Allam & Newman, 2018a; Allam & Newman,
    2018b) postulate on the need for increased governance models in regards to Smart
    Cities, and more so with the idea that data can be incremental in enhancing a
    city''s efficiency by rendering it more intelligent. In this regard, data allows
    for knowledge mobilization which in turn aid in planning decisions and designs.
    Buying from Barns, Cosgrave, Acuto, and Mcneill (2016) research, the only way
    to govern the modern cities that are so interlinked and connected is by relying
    on data ‘built between cutting edge research and technological innovation’. The
    researchers acknowledge one area where data played a significant role; that is
    the digitization of urban infrastructure, which, in turn has made it possible
    for information processed from these sources to be integrated into the urban fabric.
    Moreover, governance from data sourced from areas like weather forecast, traffic
    departments and security sources would improve transparency in areas like the
    procurement and structuring of the education sector to benefit an urban population
    (Ubaldi, 2013). A related example is the case of the cholera epidemics that impacted
    on London in the mid-19th century. Data on the location of each diseased victim
    was collected and an analysis showed that high mortality rate in areas supplied
    by water from contaminated systems. With this finding, the city management was
    able to address the problem and adopt even better measures like insulation of
    pipes amongst others (Barkham, Bokhari, & Saiz, 2018). With the means of interconnectivity
    of systems through IoT and the resulting emergence of Big Data, AI can help greatly
    in facilitating this process and providing faster data analysis to identify current,
    emerging, or even future urban issues. To complement Big Data, AI and Machine
    Learning technologies, novel approaches like the Blockchain technology can contribute
    greatly to cities (PwC, 2016). The technology is described as a distributed, replicated
    and secure digital ledger that allows contracting parties to see one system of
    records that are immutable (Swan, 2015). Urban governance entails a myriad of
    transaction that ranges from financial and contractual ones and involve a sizeable
    number of parties. Due to government bureaucracies and policy complexities, transactions
    tend to lag and sometimes are expensive and uncertain. To facilitate this process
    the services of a third party is often warranted, which causes additional issues
    of privacy. Studies (Mik, 2017; Savelyev, 2017; Zyskind, Nathan, & Pentland, 2015)
    showcase that these mishaps can be overcome by the use of smart contracts through
    the Blockchain technology (Reyna, Martín, Chen, Soler, & Díaz, 2018). Tapscott
    and Tapscott (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2015) shares that smart contracts are self-executing
    computer programs that are triggered to allow for transfer of digital assets automatically
    (Al-Saqaf & Seidler, 2017; Hammi, Hammi, Bellot, & Serhrouchni, 2018). The nature
    of immutability, where contracts cannot be altered or manipulated once they are
    initiated (Christidis & Devetsikiotis, 2016), is an interesting characteristic
    for cities. Voto (2017) supports that the Blockchain technology can significantly
    contribute to city management since it allows for enhanced governance and supports
    the establishment of new services built on collaboration between machines, Big
    Data and humans (Muzammal, Qu, & Nasrulin, 2019; Zyskind et al., 2015). With Blockchain,
    Big Data generated by the city stakeholders could be kept permanently and made
    accessible across networks of computer; thus, allowing access to citizens to contribute
    views on urban issues and governance. The key is the use of trustable data that
    provides a clear overview of how different urban fabrics relate. Big Data and
    AI alone cannot guarantee the quality of data due threats like hacking and human
    mistakes and tempering (Maria-Lluïsa & Marsal-Llacuna, 2018; Ølnesa, Ubacht, &
    Janssen, 2017). However, the integrating of these technologies with Blockchain
    technology can enhance trust in data since the technology is encrypted and secure.
    This is enabled by instant verification and distribution of every transaction
    that is made available for use instantly across the network. A PWC report (PWC,
    2018) on Blockchain technology coupled with Big Data, AI and Machine Learning,
    supports this and affirms that the governance of cities will be significantly
    enhanced. The report projects that in the near future, cities will be characterized
    by prosperity, stronger and interconnected communities, healthier people, positive
    growths and unprecedented social mobility. These will be catalyzed by rapid urbanization,
    demographic and social change, advanced technological breakthroughs, increased
    economic opportunities and sustainability drives (Allam, 2012). 4. Urban social
    comfort and big brother Technology has enabled transformation in different spheres
    of life and interconnectedness of people and urban systems have changed how people
    live and interact. As technology has allowed collection, analysis, interpretation
    and storage of data in various forms, there have been many notable benefits for
    the urban fabric. Urban centers have witnessed numerous transformations, geared
    with an increasing demand in land and resources (Al-Kodmany, 2018). The social
    fabric morphed to respond to increasing demands while creating more opportunities
    for jobs, better health care, quality education, quality living standards and
    security services. This has also given rise to economic opportunities (Siew &
    Allam, 2017; Allam et al., 2018a; Allam & Jones, 2018a; Allam & Newman, 2018b).
    These factors, coupled with an increasing population further attract people, seeking
    better and more attractive opportunities, to urban areas. With an enhanced economic
    dimension, the need for liveability standards becomes a necessity to ensure the
    survival of the economic ecosystem. While technology can greatly increase liveability,
    numerous challenges emerge such as insecurity, moral decadency and privacy breach,
    amongst others. The ability to gather, analyze, and share information in real-time
    using different devices adds to the difficult of maintaining privacy, compromising
    on social and psychological comfort that urban dweller seeks (Davey & Tatnall,
    2015; Power, 2016). Hildebrandt & Gutwirth (2008) posit that through different
    technological platforms, individuals can unlawfully access personal data of others
    and could use it in a way that compromise their privacy. Similarly, with the emergence
    of social platforms, the availability of personal data surges in both popularity
    and quantity; hence, exposing new personal threats (Santanen, 2019; Zimet & Jacob,
    2001). What is interesting is that personal data is not sought by individuals,
    but by businesses and government agencies. Access to data must thus be carefully
    sought as privacy is considered a fundamental human right in many democracies,
    and protected legally and constitutionally (Diggelmann & Cleis, 2014). Hough (2009)
    supports that everyone is entitled to privacy in all its facets: solitude, intimacy,
    anonymity and reserve. This argument is further compounded by the legislations
    regarding data protection in different countries (House of Lords, 2009). Legislation
    notwithstanding, it is increasingly difficult to contain these infringements especially
    those not directly related to surveillance. For instance, the case of high rise
    overlooking lower buildings (Moore, 2010) or through the use of drones (Pomeroy,
    2015). The issue with privacy concerns in relation to technological advancement
    is that they do not include the speed of technological change (Sweeney, 2002).
    Concepts such as Smart Cities and technologies like IoT, Blockchain, AI and Machine
    Learning are still in the offing and are anticipated to evolve even more as their
    application gains in popularity and in adoption. However Braun, Fung, Iqbal, and
    Shar (2018) warns that the advancement of these technologies may also mean new
    opportunities for privacy invaders. Therefore, efforts geared towards safeguarding
    the privacy of urban dwellers should anticipate technological change and should
    be at the forefront of concerns for digital scientists and planners. The primary
    key towards this goal is the safeguard of data; hence, collection, interpretation,
    sharing and storage. Incidentally, Rinaldi, Peerenboom, and Kelly (2001) propose
    strictness in identifying, understanding and analyzing the interconnectedness
    of the different components that makes up the city. Similarly, Blockchain technologies
    will have taken shape and will complement the data safety strategies (Ølnesa et
    al., 2017; PWC, 2018). Autonomous devices advocated in Smart Cities such as self-driven
    motor vehicles, smart buildings and other smart devices, adds to the complexity
    of data storage, sharing and communication. An intricate array of devices is expected
    to operate and transfer exclusive personal information to various service providers.
    Data leakage in one node may prove detrimental to individuals or even the entire
    system, thus posing additional risks to the further adoption of Smart City concepts.
    Therefore, part of the task related to data transfer and processing should relate
    to improvement of security and strengthening of networks altogether (Coaffe &
    Fussey, 2015; Karabulut, Aras, & Altinel, 2017). Braun et al. (2018) share that
    AI and other supportive technologies can greatly improve data processing collected
    through various devices across service providers but at the same time, there is
    a need for human oversight. Zoonen (2016) contends that such strategies would
    speed up the uptake of smart city technologies since the greatest hindrance to
    its adoption is the lack of trust demonstrated by citizens. However, the question
    of trust is only one amongst many concerns regarding the application of AI in
    cities. Other questions arise such as: Who owns and controls data? Who controls
    the urban economy? Are smart services inclusive? Are urban decisions geared towards
    humans or machines? Is there political goodwill for the inclusive adoption of
    smart technologies? In respect to the latter, there is a spirited effort in different
    parts of the world by the political class and the governments to boost the concept
    of Smart Cities. Allam, Dhunny, Siew, and Jones (2018b) supports that the concept
    is gaining in popularity and various means may be utilized to further encourage
    its integration. Barns et al. (2016) support this by showing how the wide range
    adoption of Smart Cities by the Australian Government. However, even though there
    has been a rapid adoption, those are believed to be geared towards economic pursuits
    disconnected to the collective good of urban fabrics (Allam & Newman, 2018b).
    In addition, the failure to address the questions raised above could further pose
    threats to the efforts of digitalization of cities. AI, Big Data and Smart Cities
    technologies have not been fully understood by many, thus, qualifying the fear
    of data ownership and the motivation behind these advancements (Montjoye, Farzanehfar,
    Hendrickx, & Rocher, 2017). There are notable fear that automation and digitization
    of services within the city would cause unemployment; thus, compromise individual
    economic status. Pavaloiu and Kose (2017) argued that automation of services would
    lead to employment shift, economic disparity and skewed wealth distribution. The
    issues relating to of privacy infringement are also present, which is increased
    with the implementation of AI technologies (Wallach, 2014). In addition, there
    are fears that smart services will only benefit the digitally savvy and is meant
    to segregate and disadvantage groups that are digitally disconnected (Bonnefon,
    Shariff, & Rahwan, 2016). Pavaloiu & Kose (2017), claimed that these can be addressed
    by public educating on the need for smart services and the potential gains from
    its benefits. Confidence and trust could be further accrued with public participation
    where citizens can share comments on desired urban management models and impact
    on policy decisions. Participatory models are thus seen to be key in the devising
    of inclusive neighborhoods, and this can be enhanced using technology. To add
    to the line of thought of urban inclusivity, urban comfort can be equally shaped
    using technology through the components of sustainability, which is key to increase
    both liveability and economic dimensions. 5. Sustainability and technology The
    impacts of Climate change on cities have been greatly covered in literature, and
    urban leaders, policy makers, and other stakeholders are driven to strategize
    on to mitigate those impacts (OECD, 2014). Cutter, Emrich, Gall, and Reeves (2018)
    highlights that one the most prevalent impact of climate change is that of flooding,
    that tend to occur in cities that were previously relatively deemed as safe. Besides
    flooding, there are increased incidences of bushfires which are impacting on the
    liveability of cities as shelters are at risk, and even rendering entire urban
    areas as uninhabitable (Hales et al., 2007; McDonald, 2017), thus forcing people
    to leave their homes. In certain instances, further accentuates the sad phenomenon
    of ‘climate refugees’. For cities in developing countries where the local governments
    are financially constrained; hence unable to offer alternative lands, infrastructure
    repairs, or housing subsidies, a portion of the population ultimately ends up
    homeless and this leads to the creation of an informal economy; which are even
    more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (UN Habitat, 2015). Emilsson
    and Sang (2017) further shares how cities are seen to experience higher temperatures,
    especially in form of heat waves which result to loss of lives, and in some cities
    it drives a higher energy demand for mechanical cooling (Allam, 2014). Furthermore,
    unlike before, cities are now experiencing shortage of food supplies as climate
    change has also affected the agricultural sector due to the unpredictability of
    climate from conventional farming techniques (Burton et al., 2013). Doherty, Klima,
    and Hellman (2016) and Allam (2012) support that finding solutions to these impacts
    will be key to the survival of cities and that mitigation strategies, potent with
    sustainability consciousness in mind, must be sought at various levels of policy
    making. They peg their argument on results from other researchers (Hughes & Sarzynski,
    2015; OECD, 2014) that established that cities contribute greatly in aggravating
    climate change. On the same line, many city managements have started to fashion
    policies in such a way so as to have as little as negative impacts as possible
    to prevent the compromise of the environment and available resources (George,
    Schillebeeckx, & Liak, 2015; Silva, Khan, & Han, 2018). In this front, many cities
    have managed to leverage on the available advanced technologies such as AI, Big
    data, IoT, Blockchain, amongst others to render sustainable solutions to both
    city planning and management (Allam, 2018b; Allam & Jones, 2018b; Allam & Newman,
    2018a; Lim et al., 2018; Pioletti, Fox, & Goodfellow, 2016). Barns et al. (2016)
    highlights that one such area where technology has been helpful is the implementation
    of the Smart Cities concept, which can be key in helping cities achieve resilience
    and sustainability. Koenig et al. (2017) and Beatley (2011), amongst others, argue
    that analysis, through AI enabled devices and systems, of data from IoT; that
    Smart Cities prone, have allowed the customization of different urban fabrics
    such that they optimize on the available resources. For instance, Smart Cities
    have catalyzed the introduction of autonomous vehicles, and even encouraged sustainability
    passive methods through the creation of bicycle lanes and walking paths; hence,
    contributing to the reduction in fossil fuel consumption (Barns et al., 2016).
    These technologies have encouraged the adoption of construction tools in the building
    sector that can possibly integrate low power and water consumption, allow for
    green spaces and also accommodate green walls and roofs and have smart waste management
    systems (Allam & Jones, 2018a; Conke & Ferreira, 2015). These types of constructions
    also allow for increased conservation of land as there is reduced sprawl; hence,
    the land can be used for other purposes like agriculture, open space and forest
    reserve, amongst other uses that can benefit the local population and users of
    the urban fabric (Gaigné, Riou, & Thisse, 2012). Dengel (2013) succinctly shares
    how, through AI and big data, the agricultural sector is enhanced since information
    on issues like weather patterns, soil types and the best crops to plant at particular
    areas are readily available and this provides informed decisions as to crop management;
    which leads to higher yields and related proportional economic growth. The same
    approach in other sectors, especially in developing countries, through domains
    such as health, business, transport, services, amongst others, can render economic
    benefits while catering for sustainability outcomes by saving resources from these
    sectors (Barns et al., 2016; Beatley, 2011). The same can be used for climate
    change mitigation projects, and benefit cities, countries and regions that need
    it the most; like Small Island Developing States and Low-Income Economies that
    are on the front line of the impacts of Climate Change. 6. A review of current
    applications of artificial intelligence A review of existing applications of AI
    pertaining to the Urban Fabric has proved limited, but this is expanding through
    the increased adoption rate of Smart Cities; which boasts the application of the
    Internet of Things (IoT) which generates Big Data, on which AI sustains. Through
    this limited characteristic, an expanded search to other domains revealed an extended
    focus on 12 fields that brings a direct applicability to Cities. The works of
    various authors bring a valuable contribution to those domains, and this is showcased
    in Table 1 below. Table 1. A summary of current applications of AI by various

    and identified applications of AI in various domains, as shown through Table 1
    above, showcases that the energy sector bomed with the advent of technology and
    industrialisation of the society, which in turns called for a higher energy supply
    to meet with growing demand. The use of AI provides accurate estimates for generating
    energy maps which can be used for energy modelling and planning purposes (Suganthi
    et al., 2015). A mix of renewable energy sources can effectively act as a replacement
    for fossil fuels to meet up with the growing energy demand (Aljicevic et al.,
    2016; Lakshmanan & Pandian, 2012), in a sustainable and efficient fashion. The
    harvest of renewable energy however shows some concern in view of the setting
    up of infrastructures in most suitable locations. Borah et al. (2013), Lakshmanan
    and Pandian (2012) and Aljicevic et al. (2016) made use of the Artificial Intelligence
    tools through the concept of Fuzzy Logic to test the claim of Suganthi et al.
    (2015) and successfully contributed to the identification of energy farms for
    an optimal outputs. As the energy sector is gaining in energy adoption, its increased
    efficiency through AI is helping in the rising adoption rate of renewable energy
    sources, which is in turn helping in mitigating the impacts of climate change.
    Climate Change has been affecting cities, countries and regions and directly impacting
    on the livelihoods of people and the economy; which leads to increased political
    and geopolitical agendas to sustain both economy and the environment. Numerous
    researchers (Borah et al., 2013; Cook et al., 2009; Lakshmanan & Pandian, 2012;
    Suganthi et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2009) showcased how the technical applications
    of AI can effectively render more sustainable environments. However, in line with
    the above, it was noted that the education sector needs to be refined to generate
    more specific and appropriate tools in the shaping of minds and creativity. With
    Data and AI, this renders a unique benefit of providing training in current challenges
    as they unfold (Baker, 2000; McArthur et al., 2005; Santana-Mancilla et al., 2013).
    However, as those benefits directly impact on economy, the efficiency of current
    financial models set to accommodate and catalyse generated economic benefits from
    various sectors, were themselves deemed as obsolete by being slow and cumbersome.
    New recommendations and models making the use of AI were developed to address
    those concerns (Bahrammirzaee, 2010; Fethi & Pasiouras, 2010; Salchenberger et
    al., 1992). The same is being observed for health sector which has been adopting
    Artificial intelligence (Miller, 1986; Patel et al., 2009; Ramesh et al., 2004).
    Health professionals are set to be assisted in: diagnostics (Alkım et al., 2012;
    Amato et al., 2013); probability estimation of diseases (Fryback, 1986); monitoring
    of illness (Coiera, 1993); critical care medicine (Hanson & Marshall, 2001; Holt
    et al., 2006); dyslexia (Reggia & Berndt, 1986); planning treatments and finding
    better solutions for patients (Hanson & Marshall, 2001). As those contribute to
    better livelihoods, the technology used in its assistance is gaining adoption
    in its application in Mobility (Alam et al., 2018; Alazawi et al., 2011; Arfat
    et al., 2017; Arfat et al., 2018; Büscher et al., 2009; Mehmood et al., 2017;
    Mehmood & Graham, 2015; Schlingensiepen et al., 2016), Information Technology
    (IT) and Internet of Things sectors (IoT). Those have given rise to multidisciplinary
    solutions such as smart logistics and transportation systems by ensuring that
    sustainability principles are brought forward from the combination of IT and IoT
    (Ahmad & Mehmood, 2016; Schlingensiepen et al., 2016). The emergence of data provided
    numerous benefits but also highlighted a limitation in current models of storage;
    which is now being addressed through cloud computing (Tawalbeh, Bakheder, & Song,
    2016a). Data through IoT is further being used through mobile applications through
    two way streams in retrieving and transmitting information at a much faster rate
    (Arfat et al., 2017). Progress in this domain further contributes to more efficiency
    and increased performance, but the standardisation of processes need to be supported
    by appropriate policies. As such, to ensure the rapid, and effective, integration
    of AI in various domains, and to ensure its coherent cohabitation with current
    models in use, numerous authors dwell in the policy design, implementation and
    monitoring by underlining the increased benefits of AI in those various stages.
    Even though the authors, as compiled in Table 1, may not have made mention to
    direct applications to Smart Cities, those solutions ultimately generate enhanced
    setups that contribute to the intelligence of networks and systems; which is critical
    and primordial in the development of Smart Systems. However, those need to be
    calibrated to support human life and not with the aim to integrate technology
    for economic benefits. As such, the inclusion of the liveability dimension in
    Smart Cities is paramount of the generation of healthy, safe and sustainable urban
    setups. 7. Urban liveability and smart cities An extensive literature on Smart
    Cities was conveyed by Allam and Newman (2018a), where the authors revealed key
    dimensions (Table 2) that current Smart City Frameworks support. Table 2. Key
    dimensions from smart city frameworks. Adopted from Allam and Newman (2018a).

    and is set to accentuate technological output, Allam and Newman (2018a) argue
    that the liveability dimension was being overlooked. To ensure an inclusive framework,
    the authors support that Smart Cities must encourage technology, but the overarched
    dimensions must be focussed towards people; hence aimed towards improving urban
    liveability. In this regard, the authors proposed three key dimensions: Culture,
    Metabolism and Governance. The Smart City Model as presented by Allam and Newman
    (2018a) is represented in Fig. 3 below. Download : Download high-res image (71KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Sustainable and inclusive smart city
    model as presented by Allam and Newman (2018a). The authors also highlighted that
    an overemphasis on technological dimensions may pose a threat to liveability and
    sustainability levels of cities; thus, the model overlooks the dimensions of technology
    altogether and propose that policy makers dwell into the three key dimensions
    of Culture, Governance and Metabolism first and foremost prior to the integration
    of technology. The present authors thus propose the integration of the same principles
    in a new framework, which looks at how to effectively integrate technology in
    Smart Cities while aligning with the governing principles as laid out by Allam
    and Newman (2018a). 8. A proposed framework The proposed framework by the present
    authors looks at how to effectively integrate the use of technology while encouraging
    the input of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence at the core of Smart Cities.
    By using the careful calibration by the three key dimensions of Culture, Metabolism
    and Governance, as prescribed by Allam and Newman (2018a), the proposed model
    is aimed to ensure that societal liveability is preserved by encouraging the pursuit
    of technological input. The proposed framework is illustrated in Fig. 4. Download

    A proposed framework for the integration of AI and big data in smart cities to
    ensure liveability. A salient feature in the proposed framework is that it does
    not cater for technology as its own dimension. The authors rather propose that
    technology is to be a fundamental core of Smart Cities where Big Data can emerge
    through IoT through various domains Artificial Intelligence is then proposed as
    an underlying feature which can process, analyze and interpret the generated data.
    The fundamental dimensions of Culture, Metabolism and Governance, as prescribed,
    are ensured in this framework to ensure that the inclusion of Big Data and Artificial
    Intelligence is geared towards human liveability rather than the sole purpose
    of technological integration for economic pursuits by corporations alone. The
    following section discusses the implementation of the proposed model and its benefits.
    9. Discussion Cities have undergone various changes caused by the emergence and
    adoption of numerous concepts such as sustainable cities, inclusive cities, resilient
    cities, amongst others. In the current knowledge economy, the focus is on Smart
    and Intelligent Cities. These changes have been prompted by numerous factors ranging
    from population increase, advancement in education, increase in demand for city
    services and products, and above all, technological advancement. Transition from
    traditional to high tech urban centers brought about numerous changes in the way
    cities are governed. Intelligent, or Smart, cities have shown improvements in
    transport infrastructures, health care services, security, communications and,
    amongst others, access to quality social amenities and services. They have also
    been serving as hubs for job opportunities and centers for vibrant economic development.
    The rapid adoption of Smart Cities is thus understood as there is a direct correlation
    with higher economic outputs and urban performance. Despite these positive outsets,
    urban dwellers still face a myriad of challenges characterized by modern urban
    environments: traffic congestion, environmental degradation, insecurity, infringement
    of privacy, inadequate housing, trafficking, urban sprawl and inefficient service
    delivery, just to name a few. The proposal of a new framework thus looks at how
    to integrate the emerging concept of Smart Cities towards a more livable and inclusive
    fabric. This paper showcases that technologies such as Artificial Intelligence
    are gaining traction and its integration in city management is promising. The
    proposed model then supports the use of AI, as through this dimension, it is now
    possible to gather data sourced from different urban components in one central
    location. This is possible due to the interconnectedness of different services
    warranted by availability of numerous smart devices. With this Big Data, city
    managers, governments, businesses and other stakeholders have the possibility
    to customize services appropriately (Parkes & Wellman, 2015; van de Gevel, 2013).
    This is moreover pursued by intelligent marketing campaigns led by big Information
    Communication Technology (ICT) corporations that earn profits from Smart City
    products, including IoT Solutions (Allam, 2018b). As such, IoT is taunted as the
    core technologies in transforming cities to ‘Smart’ Cities through the intelligent
    IoT devices, Smart sensing devices and Big Data mining riding on AI. These devices
    allows for the interlinkage of different urban fabrics through the sharing of
    data (Barns et al., 2016). Through technology, data yielded from a myriad of devices
    are intelligently analyzed, interpreted and distributed in real-time, such that
    appropriate actions are taken efficiently and timely (Guo, Lu, Gao, & Cao, 2018).
    Besides data gathered from smart devices, AI coupled with the IoT has allowed
    for collection of data from virtual objects such as human behavioral data that
    influences economic decisions (Gil, Ferrández, Moramora, & Peral, 2016; He, Wang,
    Huang, & Liu, 2018). Li et al. (2016) support that computational methods can increase
    this capability and Mulgan (2018) further believes that exponential gains are
    to be foreseen if the coupling of human and machine intelligence is achieved,
    and particularly in the harnessing of group intelligence. This type of data supporting
    group intelligence can be achieved through IoT by making use of sensors in urban
    areas; where data sourced from various domains can be made to communicate between
    each other. However, there is a careful calibration to be done as to ensure that
    the pursuit of technology is done at the detriment of liveability levels, which
    is discussed later in this section. Even more so, the calibration to local context
    and economies are equally important (Allam, 2018a). This type of model may seem
    farfetched as the technology that needs to support it may be in embryonic stage,
    but this is far from the truth. Today, city managers are leveraging advanced in
    Big Data technologies as decision making tools in improving the city infrastructure
    (Barns, 2016), which is impacting heavily on the urban economy and having positive
    impacts on an even larger, national and regional level. Blanco, Fuchs, Parsons,
    and Ribeirinho (2018), of McKinsey, contended that AI has become an integral part
    of the engineering and construction sector which has helped stakeholders in costs
    reduction, overcoming challenges of schedule overruns and addressing safety concerns
    ubiquitous with city dwellers. The utilization of AI in the built industry will
    greatly assist in addressing the housing challenges common in cities. When this
    domain is fully linked with others in the infrastructure realm, high costs associated
    with properties will be moderated; hence, allowing more young professions to comfortably
    reside in cities (Allam et al., 2018b), and thus reducing on commuting times.
    In line with this, AI, Big Data and associated technologies are said to be aiding
    in automation, thus, allowing residents to experience quality, efficient and timely
    services (Boenig-Liptsin, 2017). This model thus supports those types of approaches
    through a decentralised fashion, thus not only profiting large ICT corporations,
    but also Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs); which are often the primary users of
    the city. This model thus promotes the creation of economic resilience and a more
    sustainable and healthy urban economy through the empowering of the local population,
    and the creation of wealth locally; rather than its export to foreign agencies
    and corporations. Thus, by ensuring that both Big Data and Artificial Intelligence
    are considered as core elements of Smart Cities, the analysis and exchange of
    data from various fields can thus be greatly enhanced. Schneeweiss (Schneeweiss,
    2018) shares that, in the health sector, there is an unprecedented reliance on
    nonrandomized database and advance technologies such AI, Big Data and Machine
    Learning can automatically optimize methodologies and procedures. With the data
    output, service providers, for example in the health sector, are able to predict
    health outbreaks and thus enforce required mitigation strategies (Pham, Tran,
    Phung, & Venkatesh, 2017), or predict emerging patterns that can render better
    economic opportunities (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018; Parkes & Wellman, 2015). This
    is further enforced by data that encourage both better management and financial
    spending (Capone et al., 2016). Numerous models, including the one of Allam and
    Newman (2018a), warn against the use of technology in the primary applications
    of sustainable urban theories. However, AI and its related technologies such as
    Machine Learning can allow scientists to develop Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
    and algorithms that help in amplifying human cognitive functions (Bini, 2018),
    which can lead to more intelligent urban fabrics. When the concept of AI is integrated
    within Smart Cities, residents'' well-being is bound to improve as explained by
    Obinikpo and Kantarci (2017). These technologies also allow for a better governance
    since data obtained could be used during planning and designing stages and supply
    chains could be aligned to run seamlessly in between related services (Miller
    & Mork, 2013; Wahl, Cossy-Gantner, Germann, & Schwalbe, 2018). On the same note,
    when all these sectors are integrated, there is optimal use of resources and spirited
    effort to conserve the environment; which contributes to increasing liveability
    levels for city dwellers. This model is thus geared to support the key dimensions
    of sustainability, as those technologies can be tailored to better response to
    climate change to reduce its impacts on urban life, as well as early on in the
    urban planning stage. Moreover, the liveability aspect of cities is also directly
    influenced by the security and safety therein. Technology has proven vital in
    ensuring security improvement and the safety of residents, business, visitors
    and infrastructures of the city. Through AI, advanced surveillance technologies
    and devices are in use to combat numerous security threats confronted in cities
    worldwide. An emerging approach is the use of drones and other unmanned devices.
    Besides these, AI has facilitated numerous ways through which governments and
    its agencies are monitoring and gathering information concerning different forms
    of security threats such as terrorism, different forms of trafficking and organized
    crimes et cetera. Even though there have been concerns of privacy and data security,
    enhanced technology, can increased the quality of basic urban infrastructures
    such as health care products and services, water, internet, waste management and
    disposal, amongst others can be greatly influenced (Allam, 2017b; Allam, 2018c;
    Allam & Jones, 2018a). Data must thus be seen as tool that can greatly increase
    the process of urbanism, instead of a threat. Of course, this also creates the
    demand for new networks, protocols, and systems for increased security; as is
    the practice in any other sector. From a macro level perspective, the use of Big
    Data, collectively, from personal, government, businesses and media coupled with
    AI technologies can help to address numerous of urban services and further encourage
    the safety of urban residents just as much as expensive urban infrastructures
    that are vital at safeguarding the liveability of cities (Bini, 2018; Blanco et
    al., 2018; Wahl et al., 2018). Through this means, the key dimensions essential
    to supporting urban life, as prescribed by Allam and Newman (2018a), in the form
    of Culture, Metabolism and Governance, can be greatly enhanced and have a natural
    productive growth through Business and Economy by the help of SMEs at the local
    level (Siew & Allam, 2017; Allam & Jones, 2018b; Allam & Newman, 2018a). By ensuring
    a focus of Liveability through the dimensions of Culture, Metabolism and Governance,
    the proposed framework provides a more inclusive outset on how to encourage smarter
    and healthier cities from both economic and social levels. However, to ensure
    that the proper integration of AI in Smart Cities, there is a number of issues
    that requires attention. Jia et al. (2017) shared that Big Data analytics are
    geared towards business intelligence, machine learning, bio-informatics and ad
    hoc analysis. To ensure that these processes contribute significantly to the economics
    of cities, both large amounts of energy and higher processing power (Coronel,
    Morris, & Rob, 2013; Saravanan, 2018; Wang, Zhan, Shi, & Liang, 2012). Similarly,
    highly specialized labor is required to oversee the complex processes of digitization.
    Notwithstanding, the role of technology must be hailed to improve the urban life
    in terms of performance and efficiency. To do so, factors intricately linked to
    the support of a flourishing environment, which supports life in all its forms,
    must be enforced in cities; as without which, the liveability levels would be
    comprised, which in turn would negatively impact on the urban economy. 10. Conclusion
    An extensive review of literature was performed in this paper, and the present
    authors showcase numerous applications of Artificial Intelligence through the
    emergence of Big Data from various service providers in Smart Cities. Even though
    this emergence of data brings rise to a range of concerns in line with issues
    regarding confidentiality and ethics, the implementation of AI can substantially
    aid in urban governance and urban economic growth. As the world is witnessing
    a rapid adoption of Smart Cities, the technological factor needs to be weighted
    in respect to societal integration. As such, the component of Big Data, promoted
    through the Internet of Things, which is popular in Smart Cities, highlights concerns
    that need to be addressed to ensure an increased popularity and adoption rate
    of the emerging concept. This is shown to be possible through the adoption of
    technology, through the essential dimensions of Culture, Governance and Metabolism;
    which is known to form the basis of liveable Smart Cities. A new Smart City framework
    was introduced that supports the additional use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence
    with a primary focus on urban sustainability and liveability; which are essential
    to building more inclusive and safe environments as supported by the Sustainable
    Development Goal 11. The models thus ensures that, even though technological pursuit
    can bring numerous benefits, human dimensions are not overlooked in the process
    of integration of Smart City concepts in existing urban fabrics, or in greenfields.

    rights and content Precision Agriculture (PA), as the integration of information,
    communication and control technologies in agriculture, is growing day by day.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms offer advances to enhance
    PA connectivity. Nevertheless, their usage in this field is usually limited to
    specific scenarios of high cost, and they are not adapted to semi-arid conditions,
    or do not cover all PA management in an efficient way. For this reason, we propose
    a flexible platform able to cope with soilless culture needs in full recirculation
    greenhouses using moderately saline water. It is based on exchangeable low-cost
    hardware and supported by a three-tier open source software platform at local,
    edge and cloud planes. At the local plane, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) interact
    with crop devices to gather data and perform real-time atomic control actions.
    The edge plane of the platform is in charge of monitoring and managing main PA
    tasks near the access network to increase system reliability against network access
    failures. Finally, the cloud platform collects current and past records and hosts
    data analytics modules in a FIWARE deployment. IoT protocols like Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are used
    to communicate with CPS, while Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI) is employed
    for southbound and northbound access to the cloud. The system has been completely
    instantiated in a real prototype in frames of the EU DrainUse project, allowing
    the control of a real hydroponic closed system through managing software for final
    farmers connected to the platform. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    WSN Wireless Sensor Networks 1. Introduction New trends in agriculture seek to
    manage crops in controlled environments such as greenhouses, which enable the
    recreation of the quasi–optimal parameters that plants need to improve the production
    or duplicate the environmental conditions of specific geographical areas to locally
    obtain products that are usually imported. Moreover, severe weather variations
    that impact on crop production can be avoided with a tight management of temperature,
    humidity and lighting. Modern agriculture aims at increasing crop yield in terms
    of production and quality. One of the advances in modern agriculture is the spread
    of soilless culture Resh (2012), also known as hydroponics, which further increases
    productivity. However, in comparison to open field vegetable crops, the fertiliser
    requirements are eight to ten times higher. For this reason, these agricultural
    systems also require an intense use of water and fertilisers that have to be managed
    in a efficient way. In open hydroponic systems where drainage is released into
    the environment, up to 31% of nitrates and a 48% of potassium applied are discharged,
    implying pollution and eutrophication of land and water. European Union policies
    try to reduce the environmental costs of intense agriculture through different
    instruments and directives (Common Agricultural Policy - CAP, Nitrates Directive
    - 91/676/EEC, Water framework Directive - 2000/60/IEC). As an alternative to open
    hydroponic systems, full re-circulation systems (also known as closed systems)
    were initially developed in The Netherlands, but the percentage of producers that
    use them in their greenhouses in the rest of Europe is very low, mainly because
    these systems need to be designed and adjusted to the specific conditions where
    production is taking place. The adoption of re-circulation using moderately saline
    water, as is the case of Mediterranean areas, requires detailed information of
    crop response to salinity, in order to optimise management of drainage recirculation.
    However, one of the main problems of closed recirculating systems is the build-up
    of salts in the nutrient solution. It is well known that salinity severely limits
    the productivity of crops and, as a difference from Northern European countries,
    the electrical conductivity of the water used for irrigation in Mediterranean
    areas is usually high. In order to avoid discharge of drainage and maintain the
    electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution at optimal levels for plant growth
    in these areas, it is necessary to add low conductivity water, which can be obtained
    from a purification unit based on a reverse osmosis system. However, these sophisticated
    systems requires high degrees of automation. In recent years high monitoring and
    control capacities are obtained in agronomic systems thanks to the use of new
    information and communication technologies. These combine with industrial automation
    to enable Precision Agriculture (PA) (Gebbers & Adamchuk, 2010). Current sensors
    offer highly accurate values of the status of crops, and actuators are able to
    manage irrigation, change climate factors or enrich the soil with the needed nutrients
    (Mulla, 2013). When appropriate, computer intelligence techniques are also put
    into play to further improve production in PA by reducing diseases and the need
    for human intervention in regular activities. This is a must in extreme PA cases
    such as the previously discussed hydroponics one, where natural resources of common
    agriculture are left aside and even more precise control actions must be carried
    out. Hence, automation is, without doubt, the future of agriculture, but new frameworks
    improving the modularity of hardware and software units, and assuring the precise
    management of crops in an efficient way are needed. Recently the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has implied the integration of communication capabilities to sensors and
    actuators (Atzori, Iera, & Morabito, 2010), which is highly relevant in the PA
    domain (Ray, 2017). Now it is possible to obtain hardware solutions powered with
    firmware that interconnects these final devices with gateways through wireless
    channels and using open and/or regulated protocols that avoid proprietary solutions.
    Wireless sensor networks (WSN) further evolve this with communication topologies
    that reduce infrastructure costs and reduce power consumption, hence reducing
    costs in PA exploitation (Riquelme et al., 2009). These novel sensors and actuators
    also need evolved automation nodes potentially acting as IoT gateways. Hence,
    traditional control units installed at the crop side are now considered Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), involving hardware nodes with computing, storing and communications
    capabilities to control and interact with industrial processes (An et al., 2016).
    CPS is now the scientific-agreed term used for networked (distributed) embedded
    systems to gather data from sensors, communicate with actuators and cooperate
    among them to cover automation needs. At the same level of importance as IoT or
    CPS, cloud computing (Voorsluys, Broberg, & Buyya, 2011) has been the last hit
    in PA (Choudhary, Jadoun, & Mandoriya, 2016). Here an extra level of flexibility
    is offered by a remote software platform providing monitoring and control management.
    These software platforms can be easily extended on demand and avoid the installation
    of complex systems at the local level. In cloud computing, crop data are gathered
    through a communication channel offered by local controllers (e.g., CPS nodes)
    that, additionally, can also allow certain control actions. All data are saved
    by a software entity usually virtualised in a data centre that offers Platform
    as a Service (PaaS) resources. The access to crop monitoring and control features
    is finally offered by web services accessible from a number of platforms, including
    desktop computers and smart phones. Lately, a trendy paradigm not exploited in
    agriculture is fog and edge computing. Traditionally, these paradigms are focused
    on improving system reaction by reducing network delay, since computing nodes
    are close to end devices. However, in the PA area, network performance requirements
    are more relaxed, though a critical issue is the reliability of the channel connecting
    the crops with the control modules. The solution proposed here is to move part
    of the data analytics and control features from the cloud to nodes close to end-devices
    in the network path. This implies a reliable management of CPS actions requiring
    high accuracy and, additionally, intermediate data filtering capabilities. In
    this frame, the solution presented in this paper covers the needs for fully automated
    PA scenarios including the mentioned special case of Mediterranean areas, through
    a three-tier open source software platform that distributes computing at CPS,
    edge and cloud planes, according to the needs of each action. IoT communication
    technologies are used to connect sensors and actuators with CPS nodes. Here, atomic
    control actions are executed at CPS level, while greenhouse main control actions
    are orchestrated by an edge layer composed of four control modules for irrigation,
    climate, nutrition and auxiliary tasks. They are powered by Network Function Virtualisation
    (NFV), so they can be instantiated at different nodes along the network path,
    from the crop to the cloud. IoT communication protocols such as Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are used
    to communicate CPS nodes with these subsystems. Finally, the cloud layer is given
    by a FIWARE middleware that stores, processes and enables management web services
    for remote monitoring and control. The cloud module of the platform communicates
    with the rest of system nodes using the Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI),
    in the form of a southbound NGSI to link with edge subsystems, and a northbound
    NGSI to allow access to final applications. According to the state of the art
    presented later, the next novelties are presented in this work: • Highly-flexible
    three-tier architecture for PA that fosters software and hardware modularity across
    the different abstraction levels of the solution. • An NFV-based solution is proposed
    in an edge layer to perform local operation decisions in a PA-based environment,
    which can be deployed opportunistically at different levels of the network. •
    Efficient and reliable PA operations are assured through distributing responsibilities
    between edge and CPS planes, avoiding problems originated from network failures
    when using a remote cloud control. • Full instantiation of the proposal with a
    real field deployment validating the operation of the system in the challenging
    area of hydroponics. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents
    the works in the literature that aim at solving the PA problem using new information
    and communication technologies. The overall proposed platform is described in
    Section 3, while Section 4 gives details about the FIWARE-based cloud and edge
    solution. Then, a real prototype of the system is described in Section 5. Section
    6 focuses on the real operation of the platform, describing main procedures and
    including validation results extracted from the prototype. Finally, conclusions
    and future works are presented in Section 7. 2. State of the art The first steps
    in PA were focused on the automatic control of actuators on the basis of sensor
    data gathered from crops. Usually, in these systems sensors and actuators were
    wired with an automation node. The control area has evolved gradually, as can
    be seen in the rule-based scheme presented by Canadas, Sanchez-Molina, Rodriguez,
    and del Aguila (2017), or the event-driven solution described by Pawlowski, Sanchez-Molina,
    Guzman, Rodriguez, and Dormido (2017). However, the real advance in the last years
    in PA has been in the line of integrating new information and communication technologies
    to support farmers in management and decision making. The first solutions using
    communication networks in controlled agriculture were based on common Internet
    technologies used in common PC applications. Marhaenanto, Soni, and Salokhe (2013),
    for instance, presented a crop management system that uses remote desktop and
    regular client/server applications. Another set of proposals in this line are
    based on using Web connections to directly access crop sensors and control actuation
    nodes, such as by Bajer and Krejcar (2015). Here, a set of Arduino nodes that
    are wired with sensors and actuators are managed through the Internet, accessing
    a Web application available in the firmware. IoT integration in PA has implied
    an evolution in the way actuators and sensors communicate with gateway nodes and
    even the Internet. Regarding communication technologies, new IoT-capable nodes
    integrate new transceivers able to save energy and create network topologies adapted
    to field conditions, where cellular or WiFi-like base stations are rare. As the
    proposal of Akka and Sokullu (2017) shows, multi-hop topologies using wireless
    sensor networks can allow the routing of data messages through the communication
    nodes to reach a gateway with Internet connectivity. Here, the ZigBee technology
    is used, as by Lamprinos and Charalambides (2015), where gathered data is finally
    accessible through a Web server available in the gateway. More recent advances
    in the IoT area include network protocols to connect with remote devices through
    Internet by using application-level messaging optimised for reducing data rates.
    S. Muthupavithran, Akash, and Ranjithkumar (2016) used the MQTT protocol to collect
    data from sensor nodes at greenhouses for monitoring purposes, for instance. These
    protocols allow the collection and analysis of data at intermediate cloud middleware,
    as discussed by Shukla, Panchal, and Patel (2015). Kaloxylos et al. (2014) presented
    a more developed system in this line. Here, data from a real deployment of sensors
    is gathered by a gateway using ZigBee, and then sent to a data cloud powered by
    FIWARE through Web-based protocols. The work exploits the idea of open interfaces
    to create multiple client applications accessing the cloud module. However, IoT
    protocols are not used and a quite preliminary version of FIWARE is employed.
    Martinez, Pastor, Alvarez, and Iborra (2016) presented research on the cloud plane
    to manage crops in PA environments. Here the FIWARE core, together with a set
    of additional enablers, are used to connect with IoT gateways through several
    protocols, such as MQTT or CoAP, and current and historical data are maintained
    in the cloud for analytics purposes. The FIWARE performance is evaluated for PA
    in terms of a set of synthetic tests, but a real development of the proposal is
    not given. The same research group have presented (Lopez-Riquelme, Pavon-Pulido,
    Navarro-Hellin, Soto-Valles, and Torres-Sanchez (2017)) a real system, but it
    is limited by the technologies and functionalities offered. Data is collected
    from the crops through a Web-based protocol over GPRS and only monitoring features
    are included in the system. An evolution of exclusively cloud-based platforms
    is the inclusion of intermediary processing stages in the data path. Liu (2016)
    performed local preprocessing at data collection gateways, before sending monitoring
    information to the cloud. This idea is further exploited by Ferrandez-Pastor,
    Garca-Chamizo, Nieto-Hidalgo, Mora-Pascual, and Mora-Martnez (2016), where a set
    of IoT protocols and technologies are also evaluated in a real hydroponic deployment.
    However, in these works a lack of flexibility is noticeable in the way edge computing
    is implemented, and this layer is exclusively oriented to data fusion. In general,
    these works in the literature partially cover IoT interconnection, data collection
    and access through clouds, and only some initial edge computing approaches are
    found. Realistic systems offering (1) flexibility in the hardware used at crop
    site, (2) edge computing nodes at which to filter data powered by NFV, and (3)
    efficient and reliable execution of both sensing and control tasks, are not common
    in current works. In this line the current paper presents an integral crop management
    system supporting up-to-date IoT technologies and protocols and supported by FIWARE,
    which divides essential PA tasks in control modules instantiated in virtualised
    nodes that orchestrate atomic tasks to be executed at local CPS. 3. System architecture
    The overall control architecture of the solution presented to cover PA management
    needs is depicted in Fig. 1. It is essentially distributed into three main planes:
    crop (local) CPS tier, edge computing tier, and data analytics and smart management
    at the cloud. The CPS and cloud planes are designed to be respectively deployed
    at the local crop premises and remote data servers, respectively. The intermediate
    layer for edge computing comprises a set of virtualised control modules in the
    form of NFV nodes that can be instantiated along the network path, from the field
    facilities to the cloud plane on the Internet. This increases versatility in the
    deployment of the solution, at the same time connectivity performances with the
    CPS layer are met. Download : Download high-res image (426KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Overall architecture of the PA platform. The cloud, edge
    and CPS planes are separated by dotted lines. The edge computing modules are instantiated
    as NFV elements, allowing their placement at the most convenient network level.
    At the crop premises, sensors and actuators for PA automation are deployed and
    connected with CPS nodes. Examples of sensors are solar radiation, humidity, temperature,
    CO2, pH meter, electrical conductivity, liquid consumption (flow meters) or pressure
    sensors, while some of the actuators considered are soil and water nutrition pumps,
    valves and activation of devices (watering and ventilation devices, lighting,
    or automated windows). These are connected with CPS units through wired channels
    using industrial serial (usually RS485) or direct digital/analogue I/O connections.
    For wireless communications, 6LowPAN is used to connect with data-loggers, which
    include several sensors. All the CPS units are interconnected with the Internet
    through an access network using multiple technologies, such as microwave radio
    links, fibre optic or DSL. In this architecture, low level operations that require
    minimum latency and high reliability in the communication with sensors or actuators
    are executed at CPS nodes. These are considered as atomic actions, such as closing
    a window, execute an irrigation mandate for a period of time or ventilating until
    a CO2 level is reached. Additionally, there are emergency reactive actions locally
    implemented in the CPS nodes that require real-time operation and can be launched
    without the human or edge plane supervision. An example of these are the opening
    of windows and turning on ventilation if the greenhouse inner temperature reaches
    a predefined threshold. The second processing and managing level of the layered
    architecture is the edge computing plane, which includes a set of NFV-powered
    control modules in charge of orchestrating the CPS layer. The subsystems of the
    edge layer make up the main operative control of the greenhouse and they are in
    charge of irrigation, climate, nutrition and auxiliary tasks, including alarms
    and energy management. At this layer, data fusion and aggregation is carried out
    to offload analytics functions usually performed in the cloud, given that the
    cloud part of the platform could serve a multitude of crops and users. The edge
    control modules are virtualised through NFV techniques that allow their instantiation
    at different levels in the network path, and they communicate with CPS nodes using
    IoT communication protocols such as MQTT or CoAP. MQTT is especially considered,
    given that it is more addressed to the management of industrial processes, however,
    CoAP is also supported for particular non-critical monitoring tasks not involving
    control. As depicted in Fig. 1, the data cloud serves as the interface between
    users and the core platform. Here is where the current status of the crop and
    configuration parameters are maintained. The NGSI interface is used to send data
    updates and receive notifications upon data changes. A change in configuration
    parameters triggers control actions that are managed by edge subsystems. Moreover,
    as can be seen in the diagram, special analytics coupled with concrete service
    needs are performed using the cloud as data source. For the communication between
    final applications and the analytics module, a REST interface transporting JSON
    data is used. 4. FIWARE-based cloud and edge solution Here we present the details
    of the cloud and edge planes of the instantiated architecture. We have used the
    FIWARE platform to provide the main software modules. In our particular case,
    the ORION Context Broker1 is chosen to provide access to the greenhouse status
    information stored in it, providing different methods to register/update, request
    and subscribe for certain data records; Comet2 is included to provide persistence
    to the data; and the IoT Device Management Generic Enabler (IDAS) is chosen to
    connect with IoT devices. This section discussed how FIWARE is used at edge and
    cloud layers of the architecture illustrated in Fig. 1. 4.1. Edge computing plane
    The edge computing plane can be deployed according to the features and requirements
    of the target PA scenario. This way, it is possible to move the edge computing
    plane next to the cloud or, by contrast, to instantiate this logic next to the
    local deployment. This can be done thanks to virtualisation. Control modules in
    the edge plane are developed as NFV nodes, which allows us to easily move the
    components according to the aforementioned requirements. For this reason, each
    control module provided by our solution is instantiated in a specific virtualised
    image that is launched opportunistically depending on the scenario requirement.
    Images are hosted by a Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) that allows remote
    management through a proper API. As depicted in Fig. 2, each control module comprises
    a Context Broker, two IoT Agents of the IDAS GE for CoAP and MQTT communications,
    and the Comet GE provides persistence to the data. Hence, each IoT Agent acts
    as intermediary between the information provided by the CPS layer and the Context
    Broker. Additionally, a specific software entity (Smart Module in the figure)
    is responsible for managing the tasks related to the specific control module.

    Fig. 2. Edge computing plane. Each NFV-based control module is instantiated as
    a compact FIWARE domain that interconnects the cloud and CPS planes, and performs
    smart control actions offloading the cloud and providing extra reliability. For
    the case of the MQTT support, the MQTT IoT Agent acts as broker to provide the
    meeting point of the publish/subscribe scheme to allow communications with CPSs.
    We have defined the next MQTT topics (the notation is simplified for the sake
    of clarity, but details can be found in the IoT Agent Step by Step guide3): •
    , , … : a specific topic is created for each of the CPSs instantiated in our platform,
    where the corresponding CPS is configured as publisher and the control modules
    at the edge plane are set as subscribers. • , , and : one topic is created for
    each control module virtualised in our architecture. This way, they can manage
    the CPSs involved in their activities by sending concrete instructions. Hence,
    each control module is configured as publisher for its corresponding topic, and
    the CPSs are configured as subscriber for each of them. By using a Context Broker
    per control module, we can perform edge computing tasks without accessing the
    cloud plane. In the concrete case illustrated in Fig. 2, for instance, the software
    unit in charge of irrigation intelligence is subscribed to the information of
    interest in the local Context Broker, being notified this way with changes received
    from the related CPS, including soil moisture and temperature, among others. In
    the same way, each of the decisions made by the smart module provokes changes
    in data records within the Context Broker, which in turn generates the publication
    of MQTT requests through the IoT Agent that finally reaches the related CPS. 4.2.
    Cloud plane Computer intensive tasks or those requiring a global view are undertaken
    at the elements deployed into the Cloud plane, which have been also virtualised
    in high-end servers. Figure 3 describe all the functionality provided by the cloud
    plane. Again, an instance of the Context Broker is used to maintain data records
    and handle NGSI interfaces. As a difference from the Context Broker instances
    included at the edge plane, the one included here maintains high-level data records
    about the status of the crop, including also filtered or preprocessed values coming
    from the edge level. An NGSI subscription is maintained by a Comet instance to
    save historical data, and another one is used to feed Big Data routines. Final
    management services interact with these two components in order to obtain all
    needed information to perform final decisions that are supervised by human operators.

    Fig. 3. Cloud computing plane. A virtual representation of the greenhouse state
    is maintained in a high-end FIWARE deployment, which is complemented with Big
    Data analytics to better support the human intervention. Data analytics are enabled
    by a distributed file-system that saves information among several machines. We
    have employed the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for this purpose. Another
    FIWARE enabler called Cygnus is in charge of taking data records from the Context
    Broker and saving them in Hadoop. Finally, our data analytics component will compute
    all the reasoning processes to assist decisions to be carried out by management
    services. 5. Prototype The target greenhouse of the system is the Experimental
    Greenhouse of CEBAS-CSIC illustrated in Fig. 4, a governmental research facility
    in Murcia, south-east of Spain, with geographical coordinates 38.1079837° N, −1.0355991°
    E and 120 m of elevation. It has a surface of 462.5 m2 (25 m × 18.5 m) and is
    between 5 and 7.5 m in height. Beside the greenhouse, we have built a room of
    60 m2 for the machinery and control systems. Download : Download high-res image

    greenhouse. The growing rows and the raffia thread to maintain the tomato plants
    are visible in the main view, while the humidifier module and climate sensors
    are shown in the small photo. Plants of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are selected
    for the pilot system, one of the most economically important and extended crops
    in south Europe. Tomato is produced in 38% of the European greenhouse surface,
    so this prototype is potentially extensible to many other greenhouses. However,
    thanks to the flexibility of the solution proposed, it can be easily deployed
    for other crop species. Additionally, the software in charge of formulating the
    nutrient solutions, can be easily adapted to the nutritional needs of other crops.
    The tomatoes were transplanted in a soilless system in a first cycle on 17th October
    2016 and were harvested on 26th may 2017 (7 months). Plants were grown in 19 rows,
    54 plants per row, and they were guided with raffia thread to conduce the plant
    growth. A second cycle was carried out between 7th June 2017 and 30th November
    2017, but this time reducing the number of plants to 486. The plants were grown
    in the greenhouse under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity and irrigation.
    The maximum temperature was established to 27°C and the reference humidity was
    60%. The plants were daily irrigated with a nutrient solution containing , , ,
    , and micro-nutrients. Drainage volume, pH and electrical conductivity in the
    greenhouse is daily controlled too. The mineral composition (anions and cations)
    and microbiological control of the irrigation nutrient solution and drainage are
    analysed weekly, to ensure that the calibration of the software is correct. Since
    the idea is to design a system suitable for Mediterranean crops, the substrate
    used in the demonstration is coco peat, which is a challenging material regarding
    turbidity of the drainage and the microbial content. In the following subsections,
    we describe the main parts of the greenhouse facilities and the deployment of
    computing nodes to deal with edge and cloud planes of the architecture. 5.1. Greenhouse
    facilities The greenhouse has a set of equipment mainly deployed inside a machinery
    room beside the crop. These facilities are composed of several hardware units
    described in the following subsections, and all of them are managed by our three-tier
    control system, whose particular implementation is also detailed. 5.1.1. Nutrient
    solution unit The nutrient solution unit is where all nutrients needed for optimal
    plant growth are mixed, and it is controlled by a CPS and finally orchestrated
    by the edge computing nutrition control module. This unit consists of five fertilisers
    tanks and one acid tank used to adjust pH. All of them with a volume of 500 l.
    The unit provides the crops rhizosphere with the 12 essential elements to complete
    their life cycle: nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, iron, copper,
    manganese, boron, zinc, molybdenum. As detailed in Fig. 5, the content of these
    six tanks are mixed with the disinfected drainages, tap water and high quality
    water from the osmosis system, to prepare a nutrient solution in the nutritive
    solution tank of 3000 l. For this, we have installed magnetic pumps for each fertiliser,
    level sensors for the tanks, electrical valves, flow meters, and an electromechanical
    stirrer in the main tank. The nutrition control module (edge computing layer)
    controls the nutrient solution based on the electrical conductivity, pH and temperature
    measured on the impulsion pipe of the pump, which finally irrigates the crop,
    taking the nutrient solution from the tank. Download : Download high-res image

    and irrigation in the greenhouse. Low quantities of water and nutrients are needed
    thanks to a complete automated system that adapts nutrition according to a formula
    tuned at the cloud plane and executed by edge control modules. 5.1.2. Irrigation
    unit Three intermediate tanks are used to work with different nutrient solutions
    to make easier the experiments, as can be seen in Fig. 5. The solution to be used
    is pumped to irrigate the crop during 5 min and several times, with an estimated
    flow of 3000 . Irrigation and drainage flows are measured by flow meters that
    provide digital inputs to the CPS calibrated to . The whole process is controlled
    by the irrigation control module in the edge computing layer. Untreated drainage
    water is collected in a tank with a capacity of 1000 l, which is later pumped
    and pre-filtered to remove impurities of every nature and consistency. 5.1.3.
    Disinfection unit The filtered water is conducted through the disinfection unit
    (lower part of Fig. 5), which was initially based on ultraviolet treatment to
    reduce or eliminate microbial content, and thus reduce the appearance of diseases.
    Lately the system has been replaced by another unit based on a reactor of electrolysis,
    which has shown to be more effective, as the results presented in Section 6.2
    indicate. A precise dimensioning of the process using our system allows the totally
    effective treatment of illnesses that are transmitted by water pathogens. This
    unit is able to treat a maximum of 200 of drainage. The disinfected water is stored
    in a 5000 l tank with control level, where it is analysed. The electrical conductivity,
    pH and temperature are measured on the impulsion pipe of the pump, which sends
    back the water to the main nutritive solution tank. The whole process is controlled
    by a CPS, following the parameters indicated by the nutrition control module in
    the edge layer. 5.1.4. Purification unit The system has a purification unit with
    a reverse osmosis equipment that transforms tap water into low electrical conductivity
    water that can be mixed with drainages and tap water to prepare final nutrient
    solutions. The pilot has a purification unit able to generate 100 of low electric
    conductivity in a 5000 l tank, together with a flow meter, valves and pump needed
    to inject the water, which are connected with a CPS and controlled by the nutrition
    control module in the edge layer. 5.1.5. Climate unit The greenhouse has an IPv6
    over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) deployment, where sensors
    are directly interconnected using Internet protocols, to measure the temperature,
    humidity, solar radiation and CO2. A CPS device is provided with peripherals dedicated
    to manage the different climatic devices. Although the platform is capable of
    managing up to thirteen climatic systems, the physical facilities of the prototype
    greenhouse has currently the following hardware: • Ventilation system with four
    overhead motorised windows. • Thermal-shade screen system on the roof, with an
    electro-mechanical traction system for opening and closing. It gets 48% of shadow
    and 55% of energy saving. • Air cooling system, which consists of a humidifier
    module and three helical extractors. The extractors have a flow of 38,000 . •
    Air fog system, used to humidify and cool the greenhouse through water evaporation.
    It has a pressure pump of 1 HP and 25 l, and an air compressor of 4 HP and 50
    l. • Heating system with a 100,000 kcal boiler, a stainless steel heat exchanger
    and 1 HP pumps for three distribution units. A broad range of sensors from the
    market were considered to fulfil the operation and environmental requirements
    of the platform. They were studied within the DrainUse project4 attending to the
    functionality provided and cost, and the finally selected ones are included in
    Table 1, indicating the model and main operation features. The operation of these
    sensors have been validated through the two cycles of tomato crop, presenting
    correct reads after the initial calibration procedure carried out in the CPS and
    6LoWPAN logger. Table 1. Sensors used in the prototype greenhouse, including relevant

    programmed and supervised by humans using the management services when required,
    with the intelligent support provided by data analytics. New high-level configuration
    parameters in the cloud Context Broker trigger notifications and changes in the
    Context Broker of edge control modules, which in turn are in charge of managing
    the operation of the individual greenhouse areas through mandating their corresponding
    CPSs. 5.2.1. CPS deployment Each control module in the edge computing plane has
    been initially assigned with a master CPS unit, resulting in a fully distributed
    system. The nutrition master CPS unit is in charge of controlling the nutrient
    solution, disinfection and purification hardware units, that is, the complete
    water cycle except for the irrigation action itself, which is carried out by a
    separate master CPS unit (and edge computing module). Unlike many commercial fertigation
    systems, we have decided to separate irrigation from nutrition control in order
    to have more flexibility to implement intelligent irrigation programs, apart from
    simply considering time and volume. Finally, the climate hardware unit is managed
    by the corresponding master CPS unit and control module. The three master CPS
    nodes (and edge control modules) are complemented by an auxiliary CPS and control
    module in charge of energy monitoring, alarms management and other auxiliary tasks
    as access control. Concrete implementations of emergency procedures in the auxiliary
    CPS include the described high temperature case, but also the lack of enough water
    flow from input pipes and additional support for energy cuts. In the first case,
    the human operator is warned of the water flow problem by the application described
    in Section 5.2.3, using the regular communication channel through the edge and
    cloud planes. However, to cover power cuts, the auxiliary CPS is equipped with
    a GSM modem and a backup battery to warn a human technician with an SMS message.
    The contact number can be configured in the user application described later.
    The master CPS consists of an IPex16 controller from Odin Solutions (OdinS), which
    is shown in Fig. 6, with a 32-bit CPU, 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD,
    Ethernet, USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485 and 16 I/O ports, which can be configured
    by software as digital or analogue input/outputs. It supports 3G, 6LowPAN, Sigfox
    and LoRA. Each master CPS is able to manage eight additional slave I/O boards
    using CAN. The configuration of the controllers is done easily through its web
    server, and it permits us to configure atomic reactive (high priority) tasks independently
    from the MQTT commands received from the edge computing layer. In our case the
    communication of the CPSs with the network is through LAN. The communication among
    master and slave CPS nodes is done through CAN bus, allowing distances up to 1
    km. This permits to distribute CPSs along the facilities. Download : Download

    contains the power meters of the installation. Figure 8 presents a diagram with
    the connection of different sensors with an IPex16-based CPS unit, indicating
    as well the MQTT protocol they use to communicate with the edge layer. As it depicts,
    both sensors and actuators use direct I/O lines for connection. Thus, by configuring
    analogue inputs, e.g., measurements such as temperature, humidity or pH can be
    transmitted from the sensor to the corresponding edge control module. Digital
    inputs are used for counters and, digital outputs are used to actuate over the
    elements of the greenhouse. Remote sensors that cannot be easily wired with the
    CPS are interconnected with 6LoWPAN. Download : Download high-res image (206KB)

    with sensors through the IPex16 CPS unit. The prototype system has 134 I/O wired
    signals distributed among all IPex16-based CPSs, and also some wireless signals
    using 6LowPAN. Most of the data collected come from wired digital outputs to solenoid
    valves, pumps, other motors (p.e. windows, screens systems) and analogue inputs
    from sensors (temperature, humidity, radiation, CO2, etc.). We also have a set
    of digital inputs from the different flow meters (liquids consumption). Sensors
    interconnected through 6LoWPAN are wired with Mex06 data loggers from OdinS, which
    are low-power devices especially prepared for remote control and monitoring. They
    include a 16-bit CPU, 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, 1xRS232, 1xSDI-12
    and, what is of relevance, 1xRF 802.15.4 g over which 6LowPAN operates. Mex06
    loggers are especially designed for outdoor settings such as the agricultural
    scenarios, since it is provided with a water and dust-proof enclosure. It is prepared
    to be provided with a battery and a solar panel. The operation of these units
    have been validated connecting sensors deployed along the crop: temperature, humidity
    and solar radiation. Both IPex16 (CPS) and Mex06 (wireless data logger), have
    been adapted by OdinS within the DrainUse project. Hence, the firmware of theses
    units have been improved as a result of this research to serve as generic-purpose
    MQTT units for high-precision automation environments. 5.2.2. Deployment of computing
    nodes In the current deployment, edge control modules are virtualised in a local
    server installed at the crop premises, while the cloud plane is set-up in a high-end
    server at the Computer Science Faculty (University of Murcia). Within the machinery
    room (beside the greenhouse) we have installed a common computer with PC architecture.
    It is comprised by an Intel Core i5-7400 CPU (3.00 GHz and Quad Core architecture),
    16 GB of RAM and a hard disk of 1 TB. The computer runs Centos 7, and LibVirt/KVM
    is used to create four virtual machines, one per control module. Virtual machines
    are provided with 4 GB of RAM and 50 GB of hard disk capacity. This is enough
    to run the local Context Broker instances, which deals with only a part of the
    system, save data, and execute IoT agents. The cloud server is a PowerEdge R200,
    with an Intel Xeon x3360 (2.83 GHz and Quad Core architecture), 32 GB of RAM and
    two hard disks of 500 GB each. It also runs Centos 7 and LibVirt/KVM. A single
    virtual machine is used here for the global Context Broker, data saving, Big Data
    processes and to host management with web services. The virtual machine uses 16
    GB of memory and 200 GB of hard disk capacity. Good performances are obtained
    at the moment, but given the flexibility of our architecture, more resources could
    be added by modifying or moving virtual images. The Context Broker version used
    has been Orion 1.7.0, which is supported by Comet release 6. Exclusively for the
    cloud computing plane, it is also used Cygnus 1.0 and Hadoop 2.8. 5.2.3. User
    management service Regarding the management services identified in Fig. 3, we
    have developed a set of web services in HTML5 with a friendly graphical view to
    monitor and control the main functions of the system. Figure 9 includes a screen
    shot of the application area to manage climate. The view in the image includes
    tools to monitor the status of the climatic equipment of the greenhouse. Green-shaded
    parts indicate that these modules are active, such as the air-fog system, ventilation
    and cooling. Current values for temperature, humidity, radiation and air quality
    are also displayed. Usually all the greenhouse facilities are automatically managed
    by edge control modules according to general configuration parameters dictated
    at the cloud plane, by using this application. In this software it is possible
    to set the range of climatic parameters, or the base components of the nutrition
    solution, among others. Manual management of greenhouse facilities is also possible
    providing the required credentials. Download : Download high-res image (699KB)

    of individual automated modules at the greenhouse. 6. System operation This section
    describes the validation of the architecture and prototype from two different
    perspectives. First, an operation example with a real task is described attending
    to the three tiers of the architecture, with the aim of clarifying the function
    of each part of the system. Second, the platform is used in two cycles of a real
    crop and main results are analysed. 6.1. Reference operation example Given that
    the nutrition management is the most interesting operation from the PA point of
    view, here we include a complete description of the tasks carried out to actuate
    on the greenhouse and assure a proper irrigation with fertilisers. The explanation
    is split into the cloud, edge and CPS planes, following the sequence of tasks
    executed. 6.1.1. Cloud level In this layer, on the basis of a nutrient percentage
    table, the nutrition recipe (mixture) is calculated “theoretically” (there are
    no physical actions). To do this, a set of calculations assure that a final set
    of volumes of water sources and fertilisers comply with the plant needs. The steps
    are: 1. The first time the software presented in Section 5.2.3 is used, the following
    parameters must be defined: (a) Available fertilisers in the facilities. (b) Water
    components based on analysis carried out beforehand in laboratory of each external
    water source. 2. For a new nutrition mixture the next parameters are defined:
    (a) Volume of the mixture. (b) Nutrient percentage table with the cations–anions
    equilibrium concentration. (c) Selection of the fertiliser cubes and water sources
    from the list of available ones. (d) Target irrigation tank. (e) Desired pH and
    maximum electrical conductivity (ECmax). 3. Calculate the volume of different
    waters to be used so that ECmax is not exceeded, maximising the use of drainage
    water and reducing the cost of the mixture. 4. Compensate the excess of nutrients
    with a dilution recalculating the volumes of waters. The excess of nutrients are
    due to the already provided nutrients in the waters used. 5. Recalculate the mixture
    electrical conductivity considering the missing nutrients to be added. If ECmax
    is exceeded, a new dilution is needed in the previous step. 6 Add the missing
    nutrients As a result, the volumes of different water sources and fertilisers
    are sent to the edge level, together with the target pH and irrigation tank. 6.1.2.
    Edge level This layer is in charge of creating the mixture transmitted from the
    cloud level by orchestrating the greenhouse equipment (valves, pumps, sensor readings,
    etc). Hence, after receiving the different volumes it generates a complete set
    of operations to create the mixture. To do so, the next steps are followed: 1.
    Sequential discharge of waters in the nutritive solution tank. 2. Agitator activation.
    3. Sequential discharge of fertilisers in the nutritive solution tank. 4. Water
    recirculation through a pipe with sensors, to analyse the resulting mixture. 5.
    pH adjustment by discharges from the acid tank. 6. Pouring into the irrigation
    tank selected. 7. Cleaning the nutritive solution tank using purified water. After
    these steps have taken place, a set of atomic tasks are generated and transferred
    to the CPS level. For instance, for the first point, the sequential discharge
    of waters will be decomposed in atomic operations where a specific digital output
    is activated until the required volume is discharged. During all this process,
    the CPS will provide updated information by notifying its new status thanks to
    the MQTT protocol. Only after validating the received information, the next step
    will take place following the same procedure. Hence, each control module in the
    edge layer is responsible for orchestrating and managing the operations that are
    executed by the CPS level by sending atomic operations and by subscribing to the
    MQTT topics where the information coming from the CPS nodes will be published.
    6.1.3. CPS level This control layer executes the atomic tasks received from the
    edge layer. CPS nodes are in charge of executing sensor readings and control loops,
    sending these data to the edge layer by using the appropriate topics of the MQTT
    protocol. In this sense, no other complex logic is executed at this level, searching
    for the robustness in this part of the platform. Examples of task executed in
    CPSs are the next ones: • . Activate/deactivate a digital output, such as a valve,
    pump, etc. • . This is also an atomic task with a control loop, which can be used
    to activate a valve associated to a flow meter (irrigation by volume). • . Analogue
    sensor reading for a defined sample time. As previously indicated, the auxiliary
    CPS also includes emergency procedures to perform reactive local tasks without
    supervision. Some examples are: • Send SMS messages when a power cut is detected.
    The auxiliary CPS has a backup battery and a GSM modem to send these messages.
    • Send SMS messages when a lack of water supply from input pipes is detected.
    • Close the valves of water supply when the water consumption exceeds a threshold
    and send an SMS message. Probably the pipe circuit of the greenhouse is damaged.
    • Take reactive actions in case of adverse climatic conditions for the plants,
    such as opening windows or switching on ventilation. 6.2. System validation We
    have collected agronomic results of two cycles of the tomato crop. In the last
    cycle we decided to reduce the plan density to increase ventilation and lighting.
    The main figures of merit are included in Table 2, attending the production per
    m2, ha and the total production in kg. The revenue in market price is also included
    at the end. Table 2. Main numbers of the first and second cycle of the tomato
    crop managed by the PA system. Empty Cell First cycle Second cycle Period 17/10/2016–26/05/2017
    07/06/2017–30/11/2017 Number of plants 1026 486 Plants per m2 2.2 1.2 Plants per
    ha 21.829 10.340 Total production (kg) 3056 3596 Fruit per plant (kg) 3.0 7.4
    Fruit per ha (kg) 65.037 76.511 Revenue (€ ) 58.533 68.860 The results indicate
    that, although the number of plants is lower in the second cycle, the total production
    has been even better than in the first cycle. This fact is clearly visible in
    the amount of fruit per plant. This improvement has been possible thanks to the
    reduction of the plant density, as said above, but also because of the lack of
    diseases, since the new disinfection unit based on a reactor of electrolysis has
    been more effective. Data obtained with the closed-loop hydroponic system (real
    data) have been compared with the needs of a regular open-cycle crop (estimation).
    The main comparative indicators for the two cycles of the crop are included in
    Table 3, including real and estimated values. To obtain the estimated data of
    water consumed in open cycle, we have assumed that the total water spent on irrigation
    (195,647 l and 140,000 l) would come from tap water to prepare the nutrient solution.
    The estimation of these volumes assume that the percentage of drainage reused
    in the close water cycle is added as new water in this case. The nutrients used
    in the open cycle are estimated following the same approach, considering that
    the new water needs extra nutrients as compared with the water gathered from drainages
    in the close cycle. Table 3. Comparison between open water cycle (OC) and close
    water cycle (CC) in terms of water and macronutrient consumption in the two crop

    12.59 19 34% (kg) 25 0 – – – – Micronutrients/Fe (kg) 2.6 4 35% 2.75 2.9 5% As
    can be seen in the results included in Table 3, the closed cycle represents a
    significant economic saving in the volume of water for irrigation, since the greenhouse
    is reusing 39% and 28% of the total water needed in the first and second crop
    cycles, respectively. The closed cycle has also meant a significant saving in
    the amount of fertilisers used in the nutrient solution. The differences in water
    savings between crop cycles are due to the crop periods, since the second one
    was carried out during summer and the plants require more water. Nutrient consumption
    also vary due to this fact, but also because of a variation in the water used
    and a better adaptation of the nutrients to the plant in the second cycle. From
    the results it can be said that good production levels have been obtained, at
    the same time water and nutrient consumption maintain clearly below the needs
    of regular open crops. And this has been obtained even with the target of validating
    the PA operation, with no especial focus on maximising revenues. There are important
    lessons learned after these two crop cycles. Attending to the hardware deployment,
    it has been relevant how well flow meters measure water intakes and detect circuit
    anomalies due to obstructions. Regarding the overall architecture of the control
    system, it is important to indicate that our initial conception was a static solution
    based on a single CPS acting as master unit, with several slave boards. This approach
    is similar to commercial turnkey systems available in the market, where the whole
    management is centralised on a controller or computer. These greenhouse control
    systems tend to be robust and also allow Internet access, but we experienced the
    lack of modularity, delocalisation and, above all, the lack of the flexibility
    provided by virtualisation. Flexibility is, in fact, particularly relevant when
    inserting extra services or moving the control functions to an evolved hardware.
    For this reason, our three-tier control system aims at a modular turnkey system,
    reducing engineering time in setting-up and maintenance. 7. Conclusions The work
    presented in the paper describes the design, development and evaluation of a system
    that covers extreme PA requirements by using automation, IoT technologies, and
    edge and cloud computing through virtualisation. A multi-tier platform has been
    developed, based on: (1) a CPS local layer connected with greenhouse facilities;
    (2) a novel edge computing plane where to insert control modules in virtualised
    nodes near the access network; and (3) a cloud segment provided with higher computing
    and data analytics resources to support crop management decisions. Cloud and edge
    planes are powered by FIWARE, including the use of regulated data formats and
    network interfaces, and a proper connection with local and global data analytics
    modules has been developed. The edge plane is powered with NFV technology to increase
    flexibility in deploying control modules. When deployed under the access network,
    higher levels of system reliability are reached, since sporadic network cuts do
    not affect control decisions. The whole system has been implemented in a real
    greenhouse in the south-east of Spain, including details about the main functional
    units that are controlled by our PA management platform. Moreover, two cycles
    of tomato crop have been used to, first, validate of the good operation of the
    architecture and, second, analyse the improvements of our system as compared with
    a regular open crop. Savings of more than 30% in water consumption have been obtained,
    which is highly relevant in our semi-arid area, and up to 80% in some nutrients.
    As a relevant future result, we are currently porting the platform to a urban
    farming setting in frames of the HIDROLEAF project. In this environment we make
    use of intermodal containers to create portable crops. This implies extreme climatic
    environments that makes the most of our PA platform. Moreover, we expect to continue
    evaluating the system in future crop cycles to further improve operations and
    adapt our decision support capabilities finally offered as management services
    to human operators. Acknowledgements This work has been sponsored by the Spanish

    \ Intelligence (AI) has been \nevident in the agricultural sector recently. The\
    \ sector faces \nnumerous challenges in order to maximize its yield including\
    \ \nimproper soil treatment, disease and pest infestation, big data \nrequirements,\
    \ low output, and knowledge gap between farmers \nand technology. The main concept\
    \ of AI in agriculture is its \nflexibility, high performance, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness.\
    \ \nThis paper presents a review of the applications of AI in soil \nmanagement,\
    \ crop management, weed management and disease \nmanagement. A special focus is\
    \ laid on the strength and \nlimitations of the application and the way in utilizing\
    \ expert \nsystems for higher productivity. \nKeywords-artificial intelligence;\
    \ agriculture; soil management; \ncrop management; disease management; weed management;\
    \ yield \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nAgriculture is the bedrock of sustainability of\
    \ any economy \n[1]. It plays a key part in long term economic growth and \nstructural\
    \ transformation [2-4], though, may vary by countries \n[5]. In the past, agricultural\
    \ activities were limited to food and \ncrop production [6]. But in the last two\
    \ decades, it has evolved \nto processing, production, marketing, and distribution\
    \ of crops \nand livestock products. Currently, agricultural activities serve\
    \ \nas the basic source of livelihood, improving GDP [7], being a \nsource of\
    \ national trade, reducing unemployment, providing \nraw materials for production\
    \ in other industries, and overall \ndevelop the economy [8-10]. With the global\
    \ geometric \npopulation rise it becomes imperative that agricultural practices\
    \ \nare reviewed with the aim of proffering innovative approaches \nto sustaining\
    \ and improving agricultural activities. The \nintroduction of AI to agriculture\
    \ will be enabled by other \ntechnological advances, including big data analytics,\
    \ robotics, \nthe internet of things, the availability of cheap sensors and \n\
    cameras, drone technology, and even wide-scale internet \ncoverage on geographically\
    \ dispersed fields. By analyzing soil \nmanagement data sources such as temperature,\
    \ weather, soil \nanalysis, moisture, and historic crop performance, AI systems\
    \ \nwill be able to provide predictive insights into which crop to \nplant in\
    \ a given year and when the optimal dates to sow and \nharvest are in a specific\
    \ area, thus improving crop yields and \ndecrease the use of water, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Via the \napplication of AI technologies the impact on natural\
    \ \necosystems can be reduced, and worker safety may increase, \nwhich in turn\
    \ will keep food prices down and ensure that the \nfood production will keep pace\
    \ with the increasing population. \nII. \nCONSIDERATION OVERVIEW \nFarming entails\
    \ a great deal of choices and uncertainties. \nFrom season to season the weather\
    \ varies, the prices of farming \nmaterials fluctuate, soil degrades, crops are\
    \ not viable, weeds \nsuffocate crops, pests damage crops, and the climate changes.\
    \ \nFarmers must cope with these uncertainties. Although \nagricultural practice\
    \ is broad, this research considers soil, crop, \ndisease and weeds as major contributors\
    \ to agricultural \nproduction. It is paramount to review the application of AI\
    \ to \nagriculture in respect to soil, crop, diseases and pest \nmanagement. \n\
    • Soil is a critical part of successful agriculture and is the \noriginal source\
    \ of the nutrients used to grow crops. Soil is \nthe basis of all production systems\
    \ in agriculture, forestry \nand fishery. Soil stores water, nutrients and proteins\
    \ in \norder to make them available for proper crop growth and \ndevelopment.\
    \  \n• Crop production plays a crucial role in Nigeria’s economy. \nIt does provide\
    \ food, raw materials, and employment. In \nmodern times, marketing, processing,\
    \ distribution and after-\nsales service are also accepted as parts of crop production.\
    \ \nIn places where the real income per capital is low, emphasis \nis being laid\
    \ on crop production and other primary \nindustries. It is seen that increased\
    \ crop production output \nand productivity tend to contribute substantially to\
    \ the \noverall economic development of a country. It will hence be \nappropriate\
    \ to place greater emphasis on further crop \nproduction development. \n• As agriculture\
    \ struggles to support the rapidly growing \npopulation, plant diseases reduce\
    \ crop production quantity \nand quality. Agricultural losses due to post-harvest\
    \ diseases \ncan be disastrous. \n• Weeds consist one of the major threats to\
    \ all agricultural \nactivities. Weeds reduce farm and forest productivity, \n\
    invade crops, smother pastures, and in some cases harm \nlivestock. They aggressively\
    \ compete with the crops for \nwater, nutrients and sunlight, resulting in reduced\
    \ crop yield \nand poor crop quality. \nCorresponding author: Ngozi Clara Eli-Chukwu\

    \ Intelligence in Agriculture \n \nIII. \nSOIL MANAGEMENT  \nSoil management is\
    \ an integral part of agricultural \nactivities. A sound knowledge of various\
    \ soil types and \nconditions will enhance crop yield and conserve soil resources.\
    \ \nIt is the use of operations, practices and treatments to improve \nsoil performance.\
    \ Urban soils may contain pollutants which can \nbe investigated with a traditional\
    \ soil survey approach [11]. \nThe application of compost and manure improve soil\
    \ porosity \nand aggregation. A better aggregation indicates the addition of \n\
    organic materials that play an important role in preventing soil \ncrust formation.\
    \ It is possible to adopt alternative tillage \nsystems to prevent soil physical\
    \ degradation. The application of \norganic materials is essential to improve\
    \ soil quality [12]. \nProduction of vegetables and other edible crops is often\
    \ \nsignificantly affected by several soil-borne pathogens that \nrequire control\
    \ through soil management [13]. Sensitivity to \nsoil degradation is implicit\
    \ in the assessment of the \nsustainability of land management practices, with\
    \ recognition \nof the fact that soils vary in their ability to resist change\
    \ and \nrecover [14]. \nA summary in AI soil management techniques is shown in\
    \ \nTable I. Management-oriented modeling (MOM) minimizes \nnitrate leaching as\
    \ it consists of a set of generated plausible \nmanagement alternatives, a simulator\
    \ that evaluates each \nalternative, and an evaluator that determines which alternative\
    \ \nmeets the user-weighted multiple criteria. MOM uses “hill-\nclimbing” as a\
    \ strategic search method that uses “best-first| as a \ntactical search method\
    \ to find the shortest path from start nodes \nto goals [15]. Knowledge of engineering\
    \ for constructing the \nSoil Risk Characterization Decision Support System (SRC-\n\
    DSS) involves three stages: knowledge acquisition, conceptual \ndesign and system\
    \ implementation [16]. An artificial neural \nnetwork (ANN) model predicts soil\
    \ texture (sand, clay and silt \ncontents) based on attributes obtained from existing\
    \ coarse \nresolution soil maps combined with hydrographic parameters \nderived\
    \ from a digital elevation model (DEM) [21]. The \ndynamics of soil moisture are\
    \ characterized and estimated by a \nremote sensing device embedded in a higher-order\
    \ neural \nnetwork (HONN) [22].  \nIV. \nCROP MANAGEMENT  \nThe crop management\
    \ techniques are summarized in Table \nII. Crop management starts with sowing,\
    \ and continues with \nmonitoring growth, harvesting, and crop storage and \n\
    distribution. It is summarized as the activities that improve the \ngrowth \n\
    and \nyield \nof \nagricultural \nproducts. \nIn-depth \nunderstanding of class\
    \ of crops according to their timing and \nthriving soil type will certainly increase\
    \ crop yield. Precision \ncrop management (PCM) is an agricultural management\
    \ system \ndesigned to target crop and soil inputs according to field \nrequirements\
    \ to optimize profitability and protect the \nenvironment. PCM has been hampered\
    \ by lack of timely, \ndistributed information on crop and soil conditions [26].\
    \ \nFarmers must combine various crop management strategies to \ncope with water\
    \ deficit resulting from soil, weather or limited \nirrigation. Flexible crop\
    \ management systems based on \ndecision rules should be preferred. Timing, intensity,\
    \ and \npredictability of drought are important features for choosing \namong\
    \ cropping alternatives [27]. \nTABLE I.  \nAI IN SOIL MANAGEMENT SUMMARY \nApplication\

    . \n \nProper understanding of weather patterns helps in the \ndecision-making\
    \ process that will result in high and quality \ncrop yield [28]. PROLOG utilizes\
    \ weather data, machinery \ncapacities, labor availability, and information on\
    \ permissible \nand prioritized operators, tractors, and implements for \nevaluating\
    \ the operational behavior of a farm system. It also \nestimates crop production,\
    \ gross revenue, and net profit for \nindividual fields and for the whole farm\
    \ [30]. Crop prediction \nmethodology is used to predict the suitable crop by\
    \ sensing \nvarious soil parameters and parameter related to the \natmosphere.\
    \ Parameters like soil type, PH, nitrogen, phosphate, \npotassium, organic carbon,\
    \ calcium, magnesium, sulfur, \nmanganese, copper, iron, depth, temperature, rainfall,\
    \ humidity \n[31]. Demeter is a computer-controlled speed-rowing \nmachine, equipped\
    \ with a pair of video cameras and a global \npositioning sensor for navigation.\
    \ It is capable of planning \nharvesting operations for an entire field, and then\
    \ executing \nits plan by cutting crop rows, turning to cut successive rows, \n\
    repositioning itself in the field, and detecting unexpected \nobstacles [32].\

    \ \nlimited to a \nparticular climate. \n \nV. \nDISEASE MANAGEMENT \nTo have\
    \ an optimal yield in agricultural harvest, disease \ncontrol is necessary. Plant\
    \ and animal diseases are a major \nlimiting factor regarding the increase of\
    \ yield. Several factors \nplay role in the incubation of these diseases which\
    \ attack plants \nand animals, which include genetic, soil type, rain, dry weather,\
    \ \nwind, temperature, etc. Due to these factors and the unsteady \nnature of\
    \ some diseases causative influence, managing the \neffects is a big challenge,\
    \ especially in large scale farming. \nTable III lists the AI applications in\
    \ disease management \navailable in the literature. To effectively control diseases\
    \ and \nminimize losses, a farmer should adopt an integrated disease \ncontrol\
    \ and management model that includes physical, \nchemical and biological measure\
    \ [39]. To achieve these is time \nconsuming and not at all that cost effective\
    \ [40], hence the need \nfor application of AI approach for disease control and\
    \ \nmanagement. Explanation block (EB) gives a clear view of the \nlogic followed\
    \ by the kernel of the expert system [42]. A novel \napproach of rule promotion\
    \ based on fuzzy logic is used in the \nsystem for drawing intelligent inferences\
    \ for crop disease \nmanagement. A text-to-speech (TTS) converter is used for\
    \ \nproviding capability of text-to-talking user interface. It \nprovides highly-effective\
    \ interactive user interface on web for \nlive interactions [45]. A rule based\
    \ and forward chaining \ninference engine has been used for the development of\
    \ the \nsystem that helps in detecting the diseases and provide \ntreatment suggestion\
    \ in [46]. \nTABLE III.  \nAI IN DISEASE MANAGEMENT SUMMARY \nApplication \nTechnique\

    \ in yield for dried \nbeans and corn crops if weed infestations are not controlled\
    \ \n[51]. There is about 48% loss in wheat yield due to weed \ncompetition [52,\
    \ 53]. These losses may at times rise up to 60% \n[54]. A study on the impact\
    \ of weed on Soybean showed about \n8%-55% reduction in yield [55]. A study on\

    \ length of \nexposure of the crops to the weeds [57, 58] and spatial \nheterogeneity\
    \ of weeds [59]. Beyond these, weed has both \npositive and negative effects to\

    \ \nQuantization \n(LVQ), ANN \nHigh weed \nrecognition rate \nwith short \nprocessing\

    \ \nAn intensive management with herbicides has been \ndeployed over the past\
    \ decades to reduce its effect on crops. \nHowever, even with this management\
    \ pattern, it was predicted \nthat crop losses due to weed in western Canada field\
    \ crops are \nestimated to exceed $500 million annually [60], hence the need \n\
    for a more expert weed management technique to compensate \nfor this loss emerges\
    \ [51]. A system can utilize an unmanned \naerial vehicle (UAV) -imagery to divide\
    \ image, compute and \nconvert to binary the vegetation indexes, detect crop rows,\
    \ \noptimize parameters and learn a classification model. Since \ncrops are usually\
    \ organized in rows, the use of a crop row \ndetection algorithm helps to separate\
    \ properly weed and crop \npixels, which is a common handicap given the spectral\
    \ \nsimilitude of both [64]. Weed control in sugar-beet, maize, \nwinter wheat,\
    \ and winter barley, can be done by applying \nonline weed detection using digital\
    \ image analysis taken by an \nUAV (drone), computer‐based decision making and\
    \ global \npositioning system (GPS)‐controlled patch spraying [67]. The \ndrone\
    \ in [68] travelled at a speed of 1.2km/h, with 58.10ms and \n37.44ms execution\
    \ time to find the tomato and weed locations \nto the spray controller respectively\
    \ \nVII. CURTAILING CHALLENGES OF AI IN AGRICULTURE \nExpert systems are tools\
    \ for agricultural management since \nthey can provide site-specific, integrated,\
    \ and interpreted \nadvices. However, the development of expert systems for \n\
    agriculture is fairly recent, and the use of these systems in \ncommercial agriculture\
    \ is rare to date [70]. Although AI has \nmade some remarkable improvement in\
    \ the agricultural sector, \nit still has a below the average impact on the agricultural\
    \ \nactivities when compared to its potentials and impacts in other \nsectors.\
    \ More still need to be done to improve agricultural \nactivities using AI as\
    \ there are many limitations to its \nimplementation.  \nA. Limitation: Response\
    \ Time and Accuracy \nA major attribute of an intelligent or expert system is\
    \ its \nability to execute tasks accurately in very short time. Most of \nthe\
    \ systems fall short either in response time or accuracy, or \neven both. A system\
    \ delay affects a user's selection of task \nstrategy. Strategy selection is hypothesized\
    \ to be based on a \ncost function combining two factors: (1) the effort required\
    \ to \nsynchronize input system availability, and (2) the accuracy \nlevel afforded.\
    \ People seeking to minimize effort and maximize \naccuracy, \nchoose \namong\
    \ \nthree \nstrategies: \nautomatic \nperformance, pacing, and monitoring [71].\
    \  \nB. Limitation 2: Big Data Required \nThe strength of an intelligent agent\
    \ is also measured on the \nvolume of input data. A real-time AI system needs\
    \ to monitor \nan immense volume of data. The system must filter out much \nof\
    \ the incoming data. However, it must remain responsive to \nimportant or unexpected\
    \ events [72]. An in-depth knowledge of \nthe task of the system is required from\
    \ a field expert and only \nvery relevant data should be used improving the system’s\
    \ speed \nand accuracy. The development of an agricultural expert \nsystem requires\
    \ the combined efforts of specialists from many \nfields of agriculture, and must\
    \ be developed with the \ncooperation of the growers who will use them [70]. \
    \ \nC. Limitation 3: Method of Implementation \nThe beauty of any expert system\
    \ lies on its execution \nmethodology. Since it uses big data, the method of looking-up\
    \ \nand training should be properly defined for speed and accuracy. \nD. Limitation\
    \ 4: High Data Cost \nMost AI systems are internet-based which in turn reduces\
    \ \nor restricts their usage, particularly in remote or rural areas. \nEngineering,\
    \ Technology & Applied Science Research \nVol. 9, No. 4, 2019, 4377-4383 \n4381\
    \  \n  \nwww.etasr.com \nEli-Chukwu: Applications of Artificial Intelligence in\
    \ Agriculture \n \nThe government can support farmers by designing a web \nservice\
    \ enabling device with lower tariff to uniquely work with \nthe AI systems for\
    \ farmers. Also, a form of “how to use” \norientation (training and re-training)\
    \ will really help farmers \nadapt to the use of AI on the farm.  \nE. Limitation\
    \ 5: Flexibility \nFlexibility is a strong attribute of any sound AI system. It\
    \ is \nperceived that much progress has been made in applying AI \ntechniques\
    \ to particular isolated tasks, but the important theme \nat the leading edge\
    \ of the AI-based robotics technology seems \nto be the interfacing of the subsystems\
    \ into an integrated \nenvironment. This requires flexibility of the subsystems\
    \ \nthemselves [73]. It should also have expansive capabilities to \naccommodate\
    \ more user data from the field expert. \nVIII. THE FUTURE OF AI IN AGRICULTURE\
    \ \nGlobal population is expected to reach more than nine \nbillions by 2050 which\
    \ will require an increase in agricultural \nproduction by 70% in order to fulfil\
    \ the demand. Only about \n10% of this increased production may come from unused\
    \ lands \nand the rest should be fulfilled by current production \nintensification.\
    \ In this context, the use of latest technological \nsolutions to make farming\
    \ more efficient remains one great \nnecessity. Present strategies to intensify\
    \ agricultural production \nrequire high energy inputs and market demands high\
    \ quality \nfood. [74]. Robotics and autonomous systems (RAS) are set to \ntransform\
    \ global industries. These technologies will have great \nimpact on large sectors\
    \ of the economy with relatively low \nproductivity such as agro-food (food production\
    \ from the farm \nto the retail shelf). The UK agro-food chain generates over\
    \ \n£108bn p.a., with 3.7m employees in a truly international \nindustry yielding\
    \ £20bn of exports in 2016 [75]. \nREFERENCES \n[1] \nM. A. Kekane, “Indian agriculture-status,\

    revolution, and the same technologies that created the Internet and are transforming
    medicine are now being applied in our farms and on our fields. Overall, this digital
    agricultural revolution is being driven by the low cost of collecting data on
    everything from soil conditions to animal health and crop development along with
    weather station data and data collected by drones and satellites. The promise
    of these technologies is more food, produced on less land, with fewer inputs and
    a smaller environmental footprint. At present, however, barriers to realizing
    this potential include a lack of ability to aggregate and interpret data in such
    a way that it results in useful decision support tools for farmers and the need
    to train farmers in how to use new tools. This article reviews the state of the
    literature on the promise and barriers to realizing the potential for Big Data
    to revolutionize agriculture. Keywords digital revolution, precision agriculture,
    economics, policy, Big Data Keywords JEL Q15, JEL Q16, JEL Q55   1.  INTRODUCTION  Data
    on farm inputs, such as fertilizer application rates, and outputs, such as yields,
    have traditionally been collected by farmers and others involved in agricultural
    production. Similarly, data on the environmental impacts of production have traditionally
    been gathered by government agencies to monitor ecological health. While data
    have always been the basis for making management decisions, the amount of data
    collected on farms through sensors like yield monitors, portable devices, drones,
    and smart phones has increased dramatically over the last decade. Not only are
    there far more data, but their form has also changed, transitioning from simple
    numerical values attached to variables (e.g., yield, water quality) to including
    more qualitative measures (e.g., type of practice, odor). Both types of variables
    are being gathered more precisely and at a highly localized scale. Excitement
    over the potential ability of the upcoming digital agricultural revolution to
    increase productivity while reducing the sector''s environmental impact has coincided
    with increased investment in agricultural data management by multinational corporations—firms
    that are typically involved in other areas of agricultural production. For example,
    Monsanto purchased the hardware and software company Precision Planting in 2012
    and subsequently purchased the weather data and modeling technology company The
    Climate Corporation the following year (Carolan 2017). In addition, DuPont has
    partnered with John Deere to provide a wireless data transfer system and then
    with the DTN company to provide market and weather information. In order to increase
    the machine-learning capabilities of its farm equipment, John Deere has subsequently
    bought Precision Planting from Monsanto and recently bought Blue River Technology
    (Lev-Ram 2017). Broadly speaking, devices for gathering data in agriculture are
    projected to grow from 30 million in 2015 to over 75 million devices by 2020 (Chi
    et al. 2017). Other entrepreneurs have followed this wave of investment into digital
    services for the agricultural sector. Despite the huge amount of interest, this
    much-heralded technological revolution has been slow to actually change agricultural
    practices (Brown 2017). For instance, whereas venture capital investments in agri-food
    have nearly doubled in each of the last two years, there has been a shift away
    from a focus on data (Pitchbook 2017). The potential benefits from Big Data remain,
    particularly if the applications are expanded to include genomics and traceability
    rather than precision agriculture alone. That said, the shift in investment suggests
    the need to take stock and consider the potential role of policy in this space.
    The purpose of this article is to review the opportunities and challenges presented
    by Big Data for the agricultural sector, with a focus on how the natural environment
    is affected by agri-food digitalization. We focus primarily on the policy issues
    arising from the development of Big Data and the associated analysis required
    to help address these policy issues. We begin by defining Big Data and its potential
    application for agriculture in developed countries across three domains: genomics,
    precision farming, and traceability. We do not extend the analysis to include
    developing countries, although their benefits from Big Data are also potentially
    large, such as through the collection of national statistics, enhanced banking
    services, and improved extension delivery (Deichmann et al. 2016, Kshetri 2016).  2. 
    BIG DATA AND AGRICULTURE 4.0  The emerging use of data in agriculture heralds
    a new digital agricultural revolution driven by a number of innovations that have
    affected manufacturing more broadly for decades (Deichmann et al. 2016). First,
    advances in robotics have allowed a far greater degree of automation than has
    previously been possible (Faulkner & Cebul 2014, Wolfert et al. 2017). Second,
    the declining cost of sensor technology has allowed farmers to monitor factors
    such as animal movement, soil health, and soil moisture in almost real-time conditions
    (Faulkner & Cebul 2014). Third, computing power to analyze these data is now sufficiently
    accessible and affordable to allow the creation of decision support tools such
    as on-tractor dashboards and mobile applications that help farmers become more
    precise with their management practices, such as with input applications (Antle
    et al. 2017, Krintz et al. 2016, Rose et al. 2016). All of this is possible because
    of emerging Big Data analytical platforms, such as cloud computing and machine
    learning algorithms, that drive artificial intelligence (Ali et al. 2016, Chen
    et al. 2014, Krintz et al. 2016, Wolfert et al. 2017). Together, these technologies
    have allowed an exponential increase in the volume, velocity, variety, and veracity
    of data generated in agriculture (De Mauro et al. 2016, Sonka 2014, Wolfert et
    al. 2017). In turn, agricultural data are rapidly becoming a major driver not
    only of innovations in output and the food chain but also in environmental management
    (Caron et al. 2014). Often defined under the broad umbrella of precision agriculture,
    agriculture 4.0 technologies refer to production systems that deploy robotics,
    sensors, and Big Data analytics to enable farmers to manage their farms on much
    smaller, and thus more precise, spatial and temporal scales (Lesser 2014, Wolfert
    et al. 2017). Although precision agricultural technologies have been in use for
    approximately a decade and generally take the form of yield monitors in cropping
    systems and robotic milking parlors for dairy, the pace of innovation in this
    field has picked up as the cost of sensors and robotics has fallen. The technological
    innovations associated with Big Data herald a potentially profound change to farming
    that, for 50 years, has been dominated by Green Revolution technologies. The Green
    Revolution was based on the introduction of hybridized seeds, irrigation, mechanization,
    and low-cost fertilizers and pesticides (Tilman 1998). These technologies had
    the effect of increasing the scale of agriculture, in essence giving farmers the
    tools to boost yields by standardizing management practices across large areas
    of land (Duffy 2009, Matson et al. 1997). The same trends occurred in the livestock
    industry where confined animal feeding operations, concentrated feeds, yield-boosting
    genetics, and mechanization have led to economies of size, resulting in significant
    increases in herds or flocks managed in essentially the same way (Weis 2013).
    As noted above, the tools of agriculture 4.0, such as robotics, sensors, and Big
    Data analytics platforms, will, when fully realized, allow farmers to be more
    precise in their application of inputs. Therefore, in many ways, agriculture 4.0
    represents a fundamentally different approach to farming than the Green Revolution.
    In particular, artificial intelligence, decision support systems, sensors, and
    robotics allow farmers the opportunity to tailor management at much finer scales.
    Ultimately, these technologies may even allow farmers to manage the needs of individual
    animals or plants in real time. For instance, smart tractors know where they are
    in the field, plant the right seed in the right place, and give it the correct
    amount of fertilizer (Gebbers & Adamchuk 2010, Ramundo et al. 2016, Wolfert et
    al. 2017). Similarly, smart livestock operations identify each animal as they
    approach a feeding station and deliver a tailor-made ration designed to meet the
    needs of that animal''s genetics, health, and life stage (Busse et al. 2015).
    In essence, the tools of agriculture 4.0 provide the equivalent of personalized
    medicine but applied to crops and livestock. The third component of these technological
    developments—the Big Data analytics platforms—underpin agriculture 4.0 and are
    therefore the most relevant for the purposes of this review. In particular, the
    vast amounts of data being currently generated on farms by the robotic milkers
    and yield monitors currently in use are useless unless those data can be curated
    in ways that can be turned into useful decision support tools for farmers (Janssen
    et al. 2017, Lindblom et al. 2017). As a result, Big Data analytic platforms will
    need to act as the backbone of the new agricultural revolution and will be essential
    to aligning and interpreting data, as well as to creating decision support tools
    that support actors across the agri-food sector.  3.  OPPORTUNITIES FOR BIG DATA
    IN AGRICULTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT  Proponents of agriculture 4.0 suggest that
    it offers the potential for profound advances in agri-food systems in a number
    of key dimensions. ▪  First, it is expected that these technologies will speed
    up and reduce the cost of improving the genetics of our crops and livestock, not
    only by making breeding plants and animals more precise but also through novel
    technologies such as gene editing. Improving the genetics of our crops and livestock
    will have many benefits, such as providing the opportunity to develop genotypes
    that are adapted to changing local conditions. ▪  Second, these technologies will
    likely offer some farmers the opportunity to produce more food on less land with
    fewer environmental impacts, commonly referred to as sustainable intensification
    (Garnett et al. 2013). ▪  Finally, these technologies offer the potential to create
    much greater transparency and traceability in complex global food supply chains
    (Opara 2003). Each of these opportunities is discussed in more detail below. 3.1.   Genomics
    Although farmers have been breeding plants and animals since the dawn of agriculture
    approximately 10,000 years ago, recent advances in genomic technology, and in
    particular, our newfound ability to edit genes, provide us with an exponentially
    greater degree of control over the genotypes that farmers utilize without raising
    the same ethical and environmental concerns as have been common with transgenic
    organisms. In particular, cutting-edge gene editing technologies allow plant and
    animal breeders, once they have identified a plant or animal with a specific trait,
    to determine what alleles are responsible for that trait. Subsequently, by turning
    on or off relevant genes, they use gene editing technology to ensure that the
    specific trait is present or absent in future generations. This process greatly
    speeds up plant and animal breeding for specific traits, such as pest resistance
    or feed efficiency, without introducing novel genetic material into a plant or
    animal''s genotype (Ballenger et al. 2016, Goddard 2012). In essence, gene editing
    allows traditional plant breeding to proceed at a much faster pace and with far
    fewer regulatory, consumer, health, or environmental concerns. In theory, this
    technology is also much cheaper to deploy than more traditional biotechnology
    approaches [such as transgenic or genetic modification (GM)], which may offer
    the opportunity for local biotech companies serving small markets to develop tailor-made
    crop and livestock phenotypes suitable for local environments. Additionally, by
    reducing the amount of time it takes to create new plant and livestock variations,
    gene editing may also offer the ability to adapt crops and livestock more quickly
    to changing environmental conditions (Edwards 2016). In the future, where we expect
    existing farmland to be subjected to more extreme weather conditions, as well
    as changes in temperatures and precipitation, the opportunity to quickly adapt
    crops to local conditions may become extremely important. Other environmental
    benefits from genetic improvements include the possibility of introducing genes
    encoding nitrogenase directly into cereal crops, thereby giving these plants the
    ability to fix their own nitrogen from the air (Beatty & Good 2011). The associated
    reduction in fertilizer use, and thus the potential reductions in nutrient emissions
    into either water bodies or the atmosphere, could also be achieved through understanding
    how genotypic expression interacts with environmental conditions to affect traits
    and impacts such as nitrogen emissions (Ng et al. 2016). 3.2.   Precision Agriculture
    The overarching objective of precision agriculture is to increase agricultural
    management efficiency through identifying ways to tailor planting, fertilizing,
    irrigating, and pesticide applications to the spatial and temporal microclimates
    that exist on each farm. This represents a major departure from recent farm history.
    Nearly all farming systems used to be labor intensive, and farmers managed the
    unique characteristics of their small operations differently according to their
    own assessments. Since the 1940s, however, developments in mechanization, along
    with other Green Revolution technologies such as hybridized seeds and relatively
    low-cost fertilizer and pesticides, drove many farmers to increase farm size by
    replacing labor with capital. One consequence of this was that the management
    of individual farms evolved into one in which the entire farm was treated as a
    single unit with relatively uniform management practices (Sonka 2016). This has
    had the consequence of creating extremely homogenous agricultural landscapes and
    has reduced the biological, crop, and social diversity of rural North America.
    Precision agriculture, which allows for much smaller-scale management, may theoretically
    change this. On one hand, precision agriculture should facilitate a return to
    more intense agro-ecological systems that allow for an increase in heterogeneity
    across space and time on the farm by giving farmers the ability to manage at the
    level of the individual animal or within field variability. This is likely to
    increase both biodiversity and crop diversity. On the other hand, precision agricultural
    technologies tend to be very capital intensive, which may lead to continued farm
    consolidation and socioeconomic homogeneity (Wolfert et al. 2017). Although the
    benefits of the digital agricultural revolution to individual farmers will likely
    be recognized in the future, the promise of using these technologies to improve
    the environmental management of our food system is real. For instance, in livestock
    operations, many animals in any given herd typically have access to more feed
    than they can efficiently metabolize, and this results in nutrients being lost
    to the environment through manure. Similarly, it is estimated that large-scale
    crop systems in North America receive up to 50% more fertilizer than the plants
    can absorb. These surplus nutrients from both crops and livestock operations end
    up either as a source of water pollution or as a greenhouse gas (GHG) that contributes
    to global warming (Tilman et al. 2002). Therefore, one consequence of uniform
    management over a large scale and the subsequent excess input use is that agriculture
    is the world''s largest contributor to global water pollution and is responsible
    for more than 30% of global GHG emissions (IPCC 2014). Precision agriculture should
    be able to address at least some of these issues. For instance, Balafoutis et
    al. (2017) present a review of precision agriculture technologies and conclude
    that global positioning system (GPS) guidance systems combined with variable-rate
    nutrient application can help limit the number of times a tractor drives over
    a field, which will reduce GHG emissions. But despite these obvious benefits,
    it must be noted that the value of the additional information provided from precision
    agriculture relative to its cost is another likely barrier hindering its widespread
    adoption. In particular, the history of how farmers use technologies such as yield
    monitors and variable application rate fertilizers suggests a relatively flat
    payoff function for these technologies that in many cases means there is no real
    financial incentive for farmers to invest. Hence, the existing evidence points
    to extremely varied uptake. In terms of livestock, precision agricultural technologies
    that include robotic milkers and mobility trackers to identify the estrous cycle
    are becoming commonplace in dairy operations. Regarding crop production, studies
    across a number of jurisdictions ranging from Europe ( http://www.cema-agri.org/page/farming-40-future-agriculture
    ), the US Midwest (Erickson & Widmar 2015), Kansas (Griffin et al. 2017), and
    Ontario, Canada (Mitchell et al. 2018) have found widespread adoption of GPS automated
    steering systems, yield monitors, and grid soil sampling. In contrast, these studies
    found that variable-rate technologies that can apply different rates of inputs
    (such as seed or fertilizer) to different management zones across a field have
    not been adopted to the same level. The GPS technologies are referred to as embodied-knowledge
    technologies because no additional skills are required to capture their value.
    Rather, such technologies rely on the knowledge that farmers already possess regarding
    how to operate their machinery (Griffin et al. 2017). These technologies either
    simplify the work (e.g., auto-steer systems) or passively collect data (e.g.,
    yield monitors). In contrast, information-intensive technologies (e.g., variable-rate
    technologies) use data collected from the farm as input into a decision support
    system that generates a prescription for the variable application of inputs to
    reap the benefits (Griffin et al. 2017). The spatial detail captured by yield
    monitors that are now standard equipment on most combines has increased significantly
    over the last two decades. These spatial maps indicate productivity zones across
    a field based on previous years’ yields (hence, zones can vary across years depending
    on microconditions). Identifying high- and low-productivity management zones is
    useful and should help farmers turn parts of their field that are chronically
    underproductive into set-asides, while farming the highest quality zones most
    intensively. To reach such a potential, however, a decision model along with other
    soil and weather data is necessary to determine whether a high- or low-yielding
    area should receive more or less fertilizer than the uniform rate currently applied.
    By contrast, such decision support systems are not required for precision agriculture
    technologies such as GPS systems that increase the accuracy of input application
    by reducing overlap and underlap. The adoption rates of these GPS technologies
    suggest that the benefit of easier operation, in addition to the value of reducing
    input use by only applying inputs where necessary (no overlap) or of ensuring
    that all locations or animals are sufficiently treated (no underlap), is greater
    than the cost of adopting these technologies (Schimmelpfennig 2016). The difficulty
    of generating significant information value from precision technologies is illustrated
    through two conclusions that emerged from a series of studies examining why farmers
    tend to apply more than the recommended rates of fertilizer (Pannell 2006, Rajsic
    & Weersink 2008). First, the response of yield to nitrogen is flat around the
    optimum within a given year, whereas the decline in the yield is small for a large
    range of input levels around the rate that maximizes profit. Thus, while different
    spatial units could receive significantly different rates of an input, the differences
    in profit relative to applying a uniform rate are fairly small. Second, the response
    function shifts depending on the year. The temporal variation in yield to a given
    nitrogen rate is greater than the spatial variation; thus, adjusting rates from
    year to year is more important than adjusting rates within a field or even between
    fields. The value of Big Data for farmers may primarily accrue through the identification
    of problem areas for a given site or through the development of improved analysis
    derived from the integration of data across many production sites (Bennett 2015).
    The information from an individual producer can be integrated with data from other
    farmers to enhance the value of those data through the development of decision
    models such as dashboards, apps, and other software applications. Because the
    production cycles in agriculture tend to be comparatively long, there are not
    enough repeated observations from a single farm to generate a predictive model
    for that farm. However, the inclusion of variables, such as soil quality, weather
    conditions, and management practices, from a number of operations across a broader
    spatial and temporal scale than a single farm allows for a more robust analysis
    of the factors determining yield (Sonka 2016). Achieving such an integration,
    however, requires that numerous farmers use a range of different types of equipment
    to be able to aggregate and pool their data. Currently, such integration is lacking,
    which represents another likely reason why the potential environmental benefits
    of precision agricultural technologies have not been fully realized to date. In
    the future, the core of any such decision model must be derived from the data
    collected across a number of producers and will be a production function relating
    output to inputs and very specific geographic conditions. Most agricultural and
    resource economists are well versed in the importance of this technical relationship
    between inputs and outputs; a decision model would use the estimated production
    function to suggest application rates depending on the specific objectives of
    the producer. Economists are also aware that the production function is not deterministic
    but inherently stochastic. Exogenous variables, such as soil moisture, may not
    have been measured accurately at the appropriate time in the initial collection
    of the data, or they are not known when the input decision has to be made; in
    turn, a forecast must be made. Even if the variables can be observed or determined
    with certainty, the effect of these variables on production often depends on a
    number of unobserved variables. This uncertainty influences the accuracy of the
    decision model and the subsequent value of the information from precision agriculture.
    The ability to derive decision rules in agriculture with high information value
    will be highest for sectors with (a) valuable output (single animal versus single
    plant), (b) a short cycle (daily versus annual), (c) small uncertainty in production,
    (d) high within-field or between-animal heterogeneity, and (e) technologies to
    accurately and reliably measure that heterogeneity. For example, the value of
    precision agriculture will likely be higher for feed use in hog production where
    feed comprises 70% of the costs of raising a hog than for nitrogen use in field
    corn production; hence, it would be expected that the uptake of precision agriculture
    technologies would be faster among hog farmers than corn producers. Within crop
    production, the net benefits of precision agriculture for nutrient decisions will
    likely be higher for intense greenhouse-based systems than for field crop production.
    Overall, the promise of precision agriculture is more food produced on less land
    and with fewer inputs. As such, precision agriculture is one tool that farmers
    will use to sustainably intensify food systems (Garnett et al. 2013). This harkens
    back to debates around agriculture and the fate of wild nature from approximately
    10 years ago when scholars debated whether it was better for the environment to
    intensify agriculture, thereby sparing land from farming, or to adopt agricultural
    management practices that tried to blend ecosystem services and food production
    [also known as the land sharing strategy (Green et al. 2005, Luskin et al. 2018)].
    While there was no specific resolution to this sparing versus sharing debate,
    most scholars writing about sustainable intensification suggest that the emerging
    agricultural technologies associated with precision agriculture will help us intensify
    food production while reducing inputs (Benton et al. 2011, Phalan et al. 2016).
    3.3.   Traceability Another major benefit of the emerging agricultural technologies
    is the opportunity to ensure greater transparency across global food supply chains.
    Food system transparency is emerging as a major issue for a number of reasons
    (Badia-Melis et al. 2015). First, there have been mounting concerns over the past
    decade around issues such as food fraud, where inferior food is intentionally
    mislabeled (Aung & Chang 2014, Van Rijswijk & Frewer 2012). Issues around food
    fraud entered the public''s consciousness in 2013 when it was discovered that
    horsemeat had been mixed into ground beef in the European Union (Walker et al.
    2013). Since then, issues around food fraud have emerged with some regularity.
    For instance, research in Canada suggests that 25% of seafood sold is mislabeled
    as a commercially more expensive product (Van Rijswijk & Frewer 2012, Wong & Hanner
    2008). Similarly, increasingly discriminating middle-class consumers in Asia are
    demanding guarantees about the identity and providence of their food. Finally,
    research in North America suggests that consumers are increasingly demanding to
    know where their food comes from and that the media plays a significant role in
    consumers’ perceptions (McCluskey et al. 2015). As a result, genomic-based technologies,
    such as DNA barcoding, are increasingly used to verify the origins of food within
    global supply chains (Pizzuti & Mirabelli 2015). Similarly, voluntary accounting
    systems are becoming increasingly common as a way to offer the consumer guarantees
    as to the identity of their food. In an increasingly fractured and competitive
    global marketplace, farmers view such systems as a way of guaranteeing to consumers
    the identity and composition of their food. Increasingly, industry players look
    to technologies such as IBM''s blockchain ( https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/ ),
    which refers to a system of bookkeeping that “chains” entries in a computerized
    ledger in such a way that they cannot be tampered with. Therefore, they can be
    used by a range of stakeholders to verify the authenticity of a product that has
    moved from producer to processor to shipper to retailer. Because blockchain ledgers
    are stored on a range of cloud computing servers, and multiple copies exist in
    multiple locations, there are no single points of failure or vulnerability for
    a blockchain. This characteristic has led to the pioneering use of blockchain
    to track cryptocurrency (e.g., bitcoin) transactions. The agri-food sector is
    just now considering how to use blockchain to guarantee transparency; in one of
    the first applications of this to food, blockchain is being pioneered by Walmart
    as a way of tracking pork chops (Popper & Lohr 2017). The digital revolution in
    agriculture also allows expansion of the concept of traceability to include characteristics
    associated with the process by which the food item has been produced (Lusk 2017,
    Marvin et al. 2017). Niche markets have arisen for the delivery of characteristics
    that are often associated with adjectives surrounding the food product, such as
    organic, local, and free range. Economic growth has provided consumers with the
    opportunity to satisfy their concerns about how their food is produced rather
    than just an assurance of low cost (Campbell 2009, Caracciolo et al. 2016). Currid-Halkett
    (2017) describes inconspicuous consumption as a means for the elite to signal
    their difference from others through activities such as buying niche products
    such as pasture-raised eggs and quinoa crackers. Information technology has not
    only fostered the spread of awareness of alternative food products (as well as
    potential misinformation), but it has also allowed producers to verify to consumers
    that the product contains the desired attributes. In many cases, the desired attribute
    of the food is associated with production practices that have relatively low environmental
    impacts, as discussed below.  4.  CHALLENGES FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE AND THE
    ENVIRONMENT  The challenges for Big Data and for achieving the potential benefits
    for agricultural productivity and environmental health are classified by Wolfert
    et al. (2017) as technical or organizational. The technical issues regarding the
    quality, accuracy, and compatibility of the data can be solved if the costs of
    data acquisition continue to fall and value can be generated by innovations (Lesser
    2014). The organizational issues regarding data governance and market power from
    possessing the data are discussed below. 4.1.   Data Governance The development
    of Big Data analytics platforms is extremely challenging. To move data from equipment
    to servers, farms usually need access to the Internet, which is still challenging
    even in many rural parts of North America, let alone across the Global South (Pant
    & Odame 2017). Data must be collected in a consistent fashion and compliant with
    protocols that allow them to be pooled into centralized servers that must be protected
    from cyber security attacks while hiding the identity of individual farm managers
    (Chi et al. 2017). Ownership agreements between farmers, app developers, and equipment
    manufacturers need to be established. There are, therefore, extremely challenging
    issues pertaining to the governance, oversight, ownership, and regulation of agricultural
    and food data along with profound technical challenges to ensure widespread interoperability
    (e.g., ensuring that the data collected from numerous individual operators can
    be pooled consistently) (Banham 2014, Janssen et al. 2017, McAfee et al. 2012,
    Porter et al. 2014). The difficulty in linking data across spatial and temporal
    scales is also a major challenge for using Big Data to address environmental health
    issues (Fleming et al. 2017, Marden et al. 2016). At present, there is a somewhat
    chaotic and fractured data ecosystem as major corporations, government bodies,
    and universities all grapple with the challenge of establishing coherent data
    regulation frameworks or standardized protocols to allow the promise of the technologies
    to be realized. The interest in agricultural technology by large companies, such
    as Monsanto and John Deere, presents both opportunities and challenges in this
    respect. Large vertically integrated multinational enterprises could create much-needed
    integrated data systems to support agriculture and food production. As demonstrated
    by Walmart''s use of blockchain in the pork sector (see above), such companies
    have the resources and connectivity across the food value chain to establish the
    large-scale data analytics framework that is needed. However, there are questions
    of equity, and in particular, whether a corporate-controlled data analytics platform
    for agriculture is the most efficient way of promoting the public good, protecting
    the consumer, and helping the world''s small-scale farmers who have already been
    marginalized and stand to be further disenfranchised by this new wave of data-intensive
    technologies. It is the role of policy, therefore, to proactively identify and
    address such equity issues and potential market failures (Shin & Choi 2015). We
    note that the GODAN (Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition) ( https://www.godan.info
    ) initiative is attempting to create an open data platform for agriculture and
    nutrition based on the partnership of both public and private players. In Canada,
    work is underway between the University of Guelph and a range of government agencies
    along with IBM to provide a Canadian-made solution to the challenge of data integration
    and the need for a Big Data analytics platform for the food and agriculture sector.
    Towards Precision Farming 2.0 is a collaborative effort in the Netherlands involving
    several universities, government, and industry to integrate data collection, management,
    analysis, and decision making at the farm level. Similarly, Woodard (2016) proposes
    a single comprehensive data warehouse that would coordinate the aggregation, sourcing,
    and distribution of the increasing amount of economic and environmental data on
    the agri-food sector. Another barrier that inhibits precision agriculture relates
    to rural connectivity. Across many rural areas of North America and Europe, there
    is a lack of broadband (Pant & Odame 2017). This is particularly pronounced in
    Canada where the government has identified rural connectivity as a major priority
    (Gov. Can. 2016). Additionally, demographic trends may also be a barrier (Pierpaoli
    et al. 2013). In particular, older farmers are less likely than younger farmers
    to utilize the Internet and therefore adopt precision agriculture technologies
    involving accessing the Internet and analyzing data (Tey & Brindal 2012). Given
    that the average age of farmers across North America and Europe is around 55 years
    of age and increasing, an aging farm population may present a barrier to adoption
    (Stat. Can. 2017). 4.2.   Asymmetric Market Information Monsanto''s acquisition
    of The Climate Corporation and John Deere''s purchase of Blue River Technology
    are recent examples of mergers within the realm of Big Data, but these deals are
    part of a bigger trend within the agricultural sector (Clapp & Fuchs 2009, Howard
    2016). In recent years, the chemical company Bayer purchased Monsanto, DuPont
    and Dow Chemical merged, and Syngenta was purchased by ChemChina. Altogether,
    these mergers and acquisitions have led to significant industry concentration,
    with the percentage of global corn and cotton seeds accountable by the largest
    of companies growing from 60% to 85% for corn and 50% to 75% for soybeans (MacDonald
    2016). Increased concentration at both producer and retail ends of the agri-food
    supply chain has led to concern about corporate control over data flows (Bronson
    & Knezevic 2016). For example, Monsanto''s Integrated Farming Systems platform
    collects information for farmers on variables such as soil health and pest pressures,
    but these data could also be used by the company to promote their own pesticides
    and to identify new R&D needs. Similarly, at the other end of the chain, food
    processors and retailers monitor social media to predict consumer trends and attributes
    valued by the marketplace. The information collected on production costs and market
    demand has implications for market power between players in the food system. The
    extent of the asymmetry in market information and its potential impact on the
    distributional impacts of the digital revolution are the impetus for the negotiations
    regarding data ownership alluded to in the previous section.  5.  POLICY ISSUES  5.1.   Agricultural
    Policy Agricultural policy was initially designed to help improve the financial
    well-being of the farm family and subsequently the rural economy (Gardner 1992,
    Schmitz 2010). Given the historic homogeneity of the farm sector, in which a single
    farm tended to be operated by a single farmer and supported a single farm family,
    policies such as extension efforts or commodity price support programs were effective
    at enhancing farm family income (Poon & Weersink 2014). The distribution of farm
    size tended to be normal; for example, the average and median herd size for dairy
    farms in Ontario was approximately 40 cows in the early 1990s. Technical innovations
    including the digital revolution have led to a significant reduction in the number
    of farms, with the decline largely occurring in mid-sized units and resulting
    in farm size distribution (Weersink 2018). In addition to changes in the number
    of farms and their size (horizontal boundaries), the degree of specialization
    (vertical boundaries) and the resulting structure of the sector have also been
    altered by the reductions in the cost of monitoring production. Farms generally
    perform a number of activities internally; for example, many livestock farms have
    grown and harvested their own feed. The gains from specialization, such as harvesting
    feed or raising livestock, have been limited due to the short and infrequent production
    stages in farming and from the greater efficiencies of farmers doing the work
    themselves due to the cost of monitoring hired labor and the stochastic nature
    of farm production (Allen & Lueck 2004). However, the emerging Big Data revolution
    is in the process of reducing measurement cost of operations and, given the associated
    fall in transaction costs, farms have become more specialized. These larger, more
    specialized farms may or may not be selling into niche markets that have arisen
    with developments in information and communication technologies, as discussed
    earlier. The net result is a continuation of the trend from many homogeneous farms
    to fewer that are more heterogeneous (when compared with other farms) but more
    specialized in terms of the specific actions and practices employed in a single
    operation. The growing differentiation of the farm sector fostered by the digital
    revolution complicates the assessment and design of farm policy. In North America,
    the rapidly declining number of mid-sized farms, combined with a growing share
    of farms producing for niche markets as well as the rise of very large farms producing
    for commodity markets, means that it is difficult to define the average farmer
    or an average farm (Weersink 2018). Whereas the average numbers generated through
    statistical databases were representative of the typical producer a generation
    ago, this is less and less true as mid-sized operations decrease (Lyson et al.
    2008). Thus, assessing the economic conditions for farmers, and the consequent
    need for agricultural policy, requires looking beyond the average numbers. Whereas
    one-size-fits-all programs were perhaps more appropriate when farms were similar,
    the growing heterogeneity requires targeting programs to particular producers
    to deliver policies that effectively support farms of all scales. The policy objective
    of improving the livelihood of farmers has shifted toward improving the competitiveness
    of the sector, but for which of its components: the farm or farmer, the small
    or large farm, the owner or operator, or the niche or commodity producer? Traditional
    North American support programs that address commodity production and price risk
    may need to be complemented by other programs that address market and supply chain
    risks associated with farming for niche markets. The growth in niche markets and
    specialization has meant that exchange is now done through contracts between growers
    and processors to ensure the timing and quality of delivery (Adjemian et al. 2016).
    In turn, risk has subsequently shifted from price risk to contract risk. The trend
    toward greater farm-sector heterogeneity is likely to continue and, in turn, so
    will the internal and external support for any policies targeted toward the farm
    sector. Regardless of the objective and subsequent target of the policy, any evaluation
    of that policy will have to extend the traditional welfare analysis approach to
    examine its distributional effects given the growing diversity of the farm sector
    along with the increased concentration through the agri-food sector and the growing
    reliance on vertical coordination to supply products with the desired attributes
    (Sexton 2012). Crop insurance is another policy that helps reduce the risk of
    crop failure for all participating farmers regardless of size. In North America,
    crop insurance programs are financially supported by government through subsidized
    premiums, yet many farmers do not insure despite the inherent uncertainty in crop
    production (Ker et al. 2017). Big Data offers the potential to increase the efficiency
    of the program by reducing adverse selection and moral hazard issues plaguing
    current designs. Improved understanding of the reasons for yield differences and
    better measurement of the actual yields by site will allow premiums to be appropriately
    set for individual producers, thereby either increasing the overall demand for
    crop insurance where governments have not been involved or reducing the financial
    burden of governments where premiums have been subsidized (Coble et al. 2016).
    Enhanced measurement could also potentially reduce moral hazard behavior, such
    as not fully harvesting a crop that yields below the coverage level, thereby further
    improving the financial viability of the risk management program. In this way,
    Big Data and Big Data analytics platforms should also aid the expansion of crop
    and production insurance options available to farmers. An efficient weather insurance
    program requires measurable data on a climatic variable that directly influences
    output. However, spatial differences in the variable, such as rainfall or frost,
    result in significant basis risk using random weather station data. The increased
    ability to measure weather data at a small local scale at relatively low cost
    reduces basis risk and thus increases the efficiency of weather insurance (Castillo
    et al. 2016). Similarly, the feasibility of livestock production insurance increases
    with the ability to measure factors affecting disease and its actual prevalence
    (Koontz et al. 2006). With advances in communication and information technologies,
    government''s role in enhancing human capital will also be increased. Advances
    in automation and artificial intelligence will require a demanding new skill set.
    As a result, education programs will be needed to prepare workers to fill this
    demand (Rainie & Anderson 2017). Disruption in the labor market and the associated
    demand for skills training are occurring in all sectors but are particularly acute
    in agri-food. There is currently a labor shortage within the sector for unskilled
    and skilled workers across developed countries. For instance, there are over 50,000
    unfilled jobs in Canadian agriculture (Conf. Board Can. 2016). 5.2.   Agri-Environmental
    Policy The design of environmental policy to deal with residuals from the agricultural
    sector, such as GHG emissions or nitrates, has been complicated by the nature
    of the production process generating those negative environmental impacts. Like
    many of the environmental problems associated with farming, there are many small
    potential contributors to most environmental problems in agriculture, making it
    costly to measure specific problems such as GHG emissions from each individual
    farm. Confounding these issues is the fact that the environmental impact of everything
    from GHGs to water pollution and antibiotic use depends on site-specific characteristics,
    such as soil type, management practice, and distance to nearby water bodies. Hence,
    the specific relationship between a farm, the farm''s management practices, and
    the environmental impact of those practices is also stochastic and influenced
    by variables such as climate that are outside the farmer''s control. Even if there
    was a direct relationship between actions and emissions, many farming practices,
    such as the timing or rate of nutrient application, are costly for an outside
    policy agency to observe and hence regulate. The net result of these complications
    is that a range of policy options has been implemented with varying degrees of
    success. For instance, in North America, the most common means of encouraging
    farmers to change on-farm practices has been through voluntary cost-share programs
    for a suite of beneficial management practices (BMPs) deemed to reduce the negative
    impacts of agricultural production (see Baumgart-Getz et al. 2012 for a review
    of the drivers of BMP adoption). These design-based programs are common because
    of both their political feasibility and their focus on observable practices, sidestepping
    the often high uncertainty around the correlation between the BMP and the environmental
    objective. Here again, we see the potential for technological developments associated
    with Big Data to create new opportunities for policy, but these have yet to be
    fully realized. For instance, using sensors to monitor GHG emissions or water
    pollution on a sample of farms should make it possible to create predictive algorithms
    that are able to handle the stochasticity of local environmental microniches.
    Such tools will become more widely used and will allow policy makers to stop subsidizing
    BMPs in a more targeted whole-farm approach that focuses on directly reducing
    specific impacts such as GHG emissions. In addition to identifying who should
    be targeted through the agri-environmental policy while also facilitating a shift
    from design-based management (e.g., management governed by the adoption of BMPs)
    to performance-based management (e.g., management driven by emission targets),
    the digital revolution may also alter the choice of mechanism. That said, governments
    must decide on who should bear the cost of any program. Governments have tended
    to provide payments to farmers (hence adoption of a beneficiary-pays principle)
    to change their existing practices, and they generally only use polluter-pays
    mechanisms (such as penalties or taxes) when attempting to prevent farmers from
    using environmentally harmful practices (Weersink & Pannell 2017). Subsidizing
    the adoption of BMPs reflects the political support the farm sector has garnered
    over time. However, the increasing use of robotics in farming systems has shifted
    the public''s view of commodity agriculture from a family-operated traditional
    farm to an anonymously operated industrial business. This shift in community perception
    may also shift the political feasibility of beneficiary-pays programs for agricultural
    producers and cause a shift toward policies based on the polluter-pays principle.
    Advances in traceability further enhance the feasible choice of agri-environmental
    policy options. Labeling allows firms or governments to both signal and create
    a demand for environmental performance. A market is thereby created that allows
    those desiring such an improvement to pay for it. The clearest current example
    is the marketing of organic products. Producer organizations and/or governments
    across many countries have established criteria for products to be sold as organic
    at a price premium. Farmers can then voluntarily decide whether to produce according
    to those standards and thus sell their products for a premium as organic. In order
    for the organic produce market to develop, information and verification systems
    were required to ensure compliance to the organic standard. Part of the externality
    associated with excess pesticide use is internalized, allowing consumers who desire
    a reduction in pesticide use to pay farmers to do so through their purchase of
    organic products. Methods designed to enhance food system traceability also allow
    the certification of goods in terms of either their direct environmental performance
    (i.e., carbon footprint) or the practices used to produce them (i.e., organic,
    free range). Messer et al. (2017) suggest that governments should encourage the
    labeling of food processes but only mandate labeling if the process results in
    a food that could harm human health. It is important to note, however, that the
    ability to use labeling to enhance the ecological benefits of the agri-food sector
    will be greater for those further along the food supply chain (e.g., producers
    selling fruit at a farmers’ market) than for farmers selling a bulk commodity
    farm removed from final consumption. Consumer demand may also be greater for attributes
    that are consumptive (e.g., organic) as opposed to nonconsumptive (e.g., farming
    methods that improve wildlife habitat). For any environmental performance attribute,
    Big Data should reduce the cost of providing enhanced traceability once the tracking
    systems are in place, thereby ensuring that food claiming certain attributes is
    actually delivered by the farmer to the consumer, lowering the transaction costs
    of certification. Thus, the likelihood is that Big Data will allow a growth of
    farms who use self-regulation to meet the consumer demands for improved environmental
    performance increases. Big Data can further extend the list of viable environmental
    policy options to include litigation, which has typically been limited to acute
    polluting events involving significant damages and a small number of parties.
    Moreover, in such cases, the linkages between cause and effect are often well
    understood (Weersink et al. 1998). A potential example of Big Data''s role in
    litigation is the case of the herbicide dicamba. Specifically, Big Data may aid
    in determining who and what is responsible for damages caused to soybeans from
    the drift of dicamba in 2017; official injury investigations are underway on approximately
    2.5 million acres in the US Midwest (Bradley 2017). Using data on the rate and
    timing of dicamba application from farmers and agricultural retailers, combined
    with weather data, scouting reports, and in-season plant tissue maps of soybean
    crops, fields can be linked to postharvest yield maps to help determine responsibility
    for the damage (Janzen 2017). Many farm groups are concerned about environmental
    groups or government regulatory agencies using data collected on farm operations
    against farms who fail to comply with regulations, particularly with regard to
    nutrient management (Coble et al. 2016). However, the digitalization of data may
    also aid farms in demonstrating more clearly and precisely how their management
    plan satisfies external sustainability certifications, thereby reducing litigation
    risk (Coble et al. 2016). For instance, recent studies indicate that nutrient
    loadings are likely caused by a few individuals rather than all producers as a
    group. Accordingly, documentation using data may aid more farmers and groups in
    verifying environmental compliance generally while exposing the small number of
    farmers who are polluting the environment. This would thus create a naming and
    shaming approach to environmental management where peer pressure is an important
    tool in promoting best practices (Leslie et al. 2017). Although the digital revolution
    reduces some of the complexities associated with designing environmental policy
    for the agri-food sector, the use of digital technologies has also fostered the
    growing separation between ownership and management at the farm level, as farmland
    owners can monitor the activities and output of farmer tenants. When combined
    with the growing attractiveness of farmland as an investment by nonfarmers, there
    has been a continual increase in the amount of farmland that is rented: Approximately
    40% of farmland is rented in the United States and Canada, and much of it is on
    a cash rent basis (Bigelow et al. 2016, Bryan et al. 2015). Under this tenure
    relationship, tenants make the management decisions regarding practices for which
    agri-environmental policies are typically applied, but the farmland owners are
    the ones who may receive the payments from policy. The potential disconnect between
    the incentives of the program and the tenant/owner can lead to limited uptake
    of the policy and thus limited agri-environmental accountability (Rotz et al.
    2017). For example, Palm-Forster et al. (2016) found the participation rate in
    a conservation auction to reduce phosphates into Lake Erie to be particularly
    low on rented farmland.  6.  SUMMARY  As documented by Cukier & Mayer-Schoenberger
    (2013), the digital revolution has already transformed how we live, work, and
    think. This is beginning to include the agri-food sector, where there is a huge
    amount of optimism among the industry as well as policy makers and environmental
    activists that, in the future, food will be produced with a smaller environmental
    footprint. Bioinformatics advances are speeding up the processes by which we breed
    plants and animals and are doing so at significantly lower cost. Precision agriculture
    technologies are allowing farmers to better apply inputs by giving them the tools
    to manage the spatial and temporal variation existing on their farm. The developments
    in information and communication technology are creating systems that allow for
    exponentially greater transparency and traceability throughout the food chain,
    which should not only improve environmental and human health but also allow the
    industry to develop markets around those performance attributes that increasingly
    discriminating consumers are demanding. However, the opportunities created by
    digital tools to boost both productivity and environmental improvement are limited
    by a number of issues, including data governance, a lack of skills in how to handle
    and interpret data at the farm level, and an unclear return on investment for
    farmers who may consider investing in new technologies. More specifically, at
    present, our ability to generate data exceeds our ability to manage, analyze,
    and use those data. This is made clear by the relative rate of adoption of GPS
    technologies, which require no additional skills, versus the adoption of variable-rate
    application technologies, which require new skills and decision-making models.
    In effect, the value added from precision agriculture technologies has not, in
    all cases, exceeded the costs. Because the agricultural production process is
    biological and subject to uncertainty, a range of information is necessary to
    understand the underlying science and develop a decision model. These huge amounts
    of data need to be gathered consistently and accurately across a range of scales
    and then analyzed and interpreted using tools such as deep learning and artificial
    intelligence. Finally, the interpreted data must be presented back to producers
    in the form of decision support tools. The difficulty of constructing, maintaining,
    analyzing, and sharing such data limits the opportunity to derive effective decision
    rules with high information value to producers. Thus, these barriers limit the
    potential of Big Data across the entire sector. Relatedly, as data are increasingly
    seen as a significant input to innovation and production, major questions are
    currently being asked about who owns data and who will ultimately benefit from
    the potential of Big Data analysis. The pace of industrial mergers in the past
    few years signals that major industry players are positioning themselves to take
    advantage of these opportunities, which leads many to wonder if a small number
    of tech-savvy companies reap all of the rewards. Or will the benefits of this
    new revolution be widespread and socially inclusive? More critical voices in this
    debate point to lessons from the Green Revolution that provided significant gains
    to consumers and a bonus for farmers who could take advantage of new capital-intensive
    technology but likely marginalized small farmers unable to adapt. Will the same
    thing happen with the digital agricultural revolution? More specifically, because
    many of the technologies discussed in this review require little in the way of
    human labor, will their adoption spell a decline in our rural communities? Although
    these issues are relevant to North America, they take on even greater significance
    in the Global South, where many economies are still structurally dependent on
    agricultural labor. If the urban economy is not sufficiently developed to provide
    meaningful jobs for people, will a decline in rural labor simply spell an increase
    in urban slums? It will partially fall to policy makers to determine the extent
    to which we steer a course toward a greater democratization of technology and
    promote widespread public benefits. There is also a question of training. A recent
    report by the Canadian Government''s Advisory Council on Economic Growth identified
    that investing in agriculture and agricultural technologies is a solid strategy
    to boost middle-class incomes and create jobs ( http://www.budget.gc.ca/aceg-ccce/pdf/key-sectors-secteurs-cles-eng.pdf
    ). But it is important to note that these new jobs do not necessarily look like
    traditional farm jobs. Although animal husbandry and crop science will continue
    to be important, in addition to understanding how to maintain healthy soil, the
    upcoming jobs in the new digital agricultural economy are more related to software
    engineering, database management, and robotics. It will also be important to have
    workers with appropriate legal and policy expertise to develop and adjudicate
    new data-sharing arrangements. Consequently, colleges and universities need to
    quickly revise their training curricula to ensure that the next generation of
    agri-entrepreneurs has the skills it needs to take advantage of the opportunities
    afforded by technology. To close, the digital revolution has accelerated the changes
    in farm structure, with consequences for agricultural policy. The growing heterogeneity
    in the farm sector means that traditional support programs in North America that
    address production and price risk may need to be complemented by other programs
    that address market and supply chain risks associated with farming for niche markets.
    As it stands, the external benefits from the digital revolution may be greater
    than the on-farm benefits, and thus there is a role for public policy, depending
    on the extent of those benefits. The range of agri-environmental policy options
    has increased with the reduction in cost of monitoring and the ability to ensure
    that the use of environmentally beneficial practices is employed.   disclosure

    4787 Abstract Purpose This paper aims to study the antecedents of Internet of
    Things (IoT) adoption among farmers and determine how trust in the technology
    influences its adoption when mediated by perceived value and risk. Through the
    conceptualization of trust and perceived risk, the authors factor in farmers’
    perceptions of agricultural technology providers and discuss different forms of
    perceived value, spanning economic, green and epistemic value. Design/methodology/approach
    This paper develops a distinctive research design, drawing on elements of the
    value-based adoption and technology acceptance models. By linking different elements
    of perceived value with IoT technology, the authors also apply the service-dominant
    logic to this study. They study how trust affects perceived value and risk and
    then determine how perceived value and risk, in turn, affect IoT adoption. The
    authors test the hypotheses by developing a structural equation model to analyze
    the results of a survey, wherein 492 farmers from Iowa, the USA, participated.
    Findings The results show a positive relationship between trust and perceived
    value and a negative relationship between trust and perceived risk. Perceived
    value had a positive impact on IoT adoption, whereas perceived risk had a negative
    impact on IoT adoption. Practical implications The research findings on trust
    and perceived value and risk are timely and relevant for business-to-business
    (B2B) marketing practitioners and agricultural stakeholders, especially in an
    era where farmers are expressing growing concerns about data handling risk posed
    by IoT technology adoption. Originality/value The research findings signal a transition
    in focus from the goods-dominant logic to the service-dominant logic in agriculture,
    whereby farmers are drawn to IoT technology because of perceived economic, green
    and epistemic value and as a result, can differentiate themselves on how well
    they deploy operant resources. This paper not only provides a unique conceptualization
    of perceived value but also pave the way for a richer conceptualization of IoT
    core functions that enable farmers to fulfill green and epistemic goals. This
    is the first B2B marketing paper discussing the antecedents of IoT adoption in
    agriculture, such as farmers’ perceptions of both monetary and non-monetary forms
    of value and perceived data handling risk. Keywords Agriculture Value United States

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    2. Number of occurrences of relevant keywords (at least 50) as they appear in
    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

    • ICTs can contribute to transition towards sustainability in agro-food systems.
    • ICTs have positive environmental, social and economic impacts on agriculture,
    food processing, distribution and consumption. • Many barriers should be overcome
    to increase the use of ICTs in agriculture in the Global South. • Increase of
    ICTs use in agro-food chain encompasses some risks that should be properly handled.
    Abstract Food sustainability transitions refer to transformation processes necessary
    to move towards sustainable food systems. Digitization is one of the most important
    ongoing transformation processes in global agriculture and food chains. The review
    paper explores the contribution of information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) to transition towards sustainability along the food chain (production,
    processing, distribution, consumption). A particular attention is devoted to precision
    agriculture as a food production model that integrates many ICTs. ICTs can contribute
    to agro-food sustainability transition by increasing resource productivity, reducing
    inefficiencies, decreasing management costs, and improving food chain coordination.
    The paper also explores some drawbacks of ICTs as well as the factors limiting
    their uptake in agriculture. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    1. Introduction Information and communication technology (ICT) is a field of work
    and study that “includes technologies such as desktop and laptop computers, software,
    peripherals, and connections to the Internet that are intended to fulfil information
    processing and communications functions” [1]. Another definition for ICT comes
    from UNESCO [2], which states that ICT is “the combination of informatics technology
    with other, related technologies, specifically communication technology”. Thus,
    ICT uses the newest technologies to process and communicate information. For OECD
    [3], the main function of ICT is to “capture, transmit and display data and information
    electronically” (p. 5). According to the World Bank [4], “Information and Communication
    Technologies consist of hardware, software, networks, and media for collection,
    storage, processing, transmission, and presentation of information”. They include
    radios, TVs, telephones, computers, Internet technologies, and databases. Communication,
    information exchange, transactions, knowledge transfer are fundamental in nearly
    every aspect of agriculture. Therefore, digitization of agriculture and food chains
    is high on the political agenda. For instance, there was an entire part dedicated
    to ICT in agriculture in the G20 Agriculture Ministers’ Action Plan 2017. In the
    Action Plan, the ministers renewed their commitment to advance ICT innovation
    to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the agricultural sector [5]. The
    food system is strongly related to many sustainability challenges such as climate
    change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, and food insecurity [6], [7], [8],
    [9], [10], [11]. For that, there were many calls for sustainability transitions
    in food systems [12], [13], [14]. Sustainability transitions can be defined as
    “long-term, multi-dimensional, and fundamental transformation processes through
    which established socio-technical systems shift to more sustainable modes of production
    and consumption” [15](p. 956). In agriculture, the notion of sustainability transition
    applies to a shift from an agri-food system having as a main goal to increase
    productivity, to one built around the wider principles of sustainable agriculture
    [16]. According to Spaargaren et al. [17], food sustainability transitions refer
    to structural changes that give rise to new production and consumption modes and
    practices that are more sustainable. Sustainable agri-food system is a knowledge-intensive
    system that requires a new kind of knowledge. Knowledge and related information,
    skills, technologies, and attitudes will play a key role in sustainable agriculture
    [18]. It is claimed that moving towards sustainability in agriculture and food
    systems call for innovative solutions and appropriate technologies such as ICT
    [19], [20]. ICTs hold the potential to contribute to sustainability transitions
    in agriculture due to their disruptive potential [21]. According to Wolfert [22]
    and Poppe [23] disruptive ICT trends include mobile/cloud computing, Internet
    of Things, location-based monitoring (remote sensing, geo information, drones,
    etc.), social media and Big Data (web of data, linked open data). Sui and Rejeski
    [24] discussed sustainability implications of increasing use of ICTs in the context
    of the digital economy. Other authors highlighted ICT potential for sustainable
    development [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], human well-being [31]. The first
    use of ICTs in agriculture dates back to the 1960s. In 2003, the World Summit
    on the Information Society addressed e-agriculture and highlighted as a priority
    the application of ICT in agricultural development [32], [33]. ICTs are increasingly
    used in modern agri-food sector [34] and they have also been put forward as a
    means to enhance agri-food systems sustainability and to achieve food security.
    Svenfelt and Zapico [35] reviewed the potential of ICT solutions for improved
    sustainability of agri-food systems by increasing efficiency, enhancing transparency
    and traceability, creating network between food chains actors, and improving food
    practices. The same authors argue that the way ICT is used in the solutions to
    improve sustainability in the food chain can be related to the Visible-Actionable-Sustainable
    ideas of Bonanni et al. [36]; ICTs make the food system and its impacts ‘visible’,
    to render it ‘actionable’ (cf. optimization, decision-making, etc.) for making
    it more sustainable. This review provides an analysis of how ICTs helped to move
    towards sustainability in agriculture and food systems. It analyses sustainability
    benefits of ICTs in agriculture/food production, processing, distribution and
    consumption as well as in terms of food chain integration and coordination. It
    also sheds light on some criticalities and drawbacks of increasing use of ICTs
    in agri-food systems. 2. ICT in food production: beyond precision agriculture
    The role of ICTs in increasing system efficiency is a central theme in literature
    on ICT for sustainability [30], [37], [38], [39]. ICTs have been also used for
    a long time to improve resource efficiency and productivity in food systems [21],
    [35], [40]. In fact, ICT can help decreasing the use of agricultural inputs (fertilizers,
    pesticides, energy and water) as well as reducing environmental externalities
    [34]. Many farms across the world are applying big data and data analytics to
    improve productivity of agricultural practices. These so-called ‘AgInformatics’
    systems are being heavily invested in by multinationals such as Dow AgroSciences,
    Deere Co, and Monsanto. They are being applied in a broad variety of farming activities
    such as equipment maintenance, fields mapping and other operational activities
    to optimize irrigation, sowing, etc. These solutions are becoming affordable but
    a key factor in their development will be margins on sales of agricultural produce
    [21]. In fact, the key factor discouraging more widespread adoption of ICTs in
    agriculture is profitability i.e. demonstrating that uptake of ICTs improves farm
    profitability [41]. There are numerous examples of data exchange platforms in
    agriculture. These include Fieldscripts, Farm Business Network, Farm Mobile, Agriplace,
    FIspace [23]. In the developed world, ICTs serve as a basis for other technologies
    such as geographic information systems (GIS) and global positioning systems (GPS)
    in precision and site-specific agriculture [10]. A widely cited example of the
    use of ICT in agriculture in order to increase efficiency is that of precision
    agriculture [42], [43], [44], [45]. Precision agriculture is a modern farming
    model that consists in the utilization of sensors to optimize the use of pesticides,
    fertilizers and water [41]. It came into use in the 1980s as GPS became accessible
    by some farmers especially in developed countries, such as in the European Union
    (Box 1). Modern precision farming makes use of GPS as well as sensors, GIS technology
    and advanced software. The methods of precision farming rely mainly upon a combination
    of satellite navigation and positioning technology, new sensor technologies, and
    the Internet of Things [46]. Box 1 Precision farming in the European Union. Precision
    farming is presented as a means to foster a new 21st century agricultural revolution
    in the European Union (EU). In fact, it is expected that a wide adoption of precision
    farming techniques will allow the EU to ensure agro-food sector sustainability
    whilst increasing agricultural output. The adoption of precision farming has the
    potential to contribute to meeting increasing food demand whilst ensuring food
    production sustainability by promoting a more resource efficient approach to agriculture
    (crop production, animal husbandry), forestry and fisheries. ICTs hold the potential
    to effectively reduce production costs and substantially increase yields, thus
    boosting local economies in rural areas. In addition to these economic benefits,
    precision farming also promises multifaceted environmental benefits by reducing
    the use of agro-chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, as well as decreasing
    contribution of agricultural sector to greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the
    EU has supported cutting-edge research and innovation (cf. FP7 and Horizon 2020
    programs) into the use of ICT in agriculture sector and this promises developing
    exciting solutions. With the explosion in the digital revolution, technologies
    using ‘the Internet of Things’ or Big Data allowed the advancement of numerous
    precision farming techniques. It is estimated that about 70 to 80% of new farm
    equipment in the EU have some form of precision farming component. Technologies
    of precision farming are nowadays not only present in all crop production stages
    (soil preparation, seeding, crop management, harvesting), but are also increasingly
    used in animal husbandry. Source: European Union [48]. Precision agriculture technologies
    (PATs) include Variable rate nutrient application, Variable rate irrigation, Variable
    rate pesticide application, Variable rate planting/seeding, Precision physical
    weeding technology, Machine guidance (driver assistance or auto-guidance), Controlled
    Traffic Farming (a system confining all machinery loads to permanent traffic lanes)
    [43]. In variable rate technologies, data from different sensors allow tailoring
    input amounts to current needs of crops and differences between parts of the same
    field, instead of applying the same amount to the whole areas. This reduction
    of input use has positive environmental [43], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51]
    and economic [43], [48], [49], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59],
    [60], [61] impacts. ICT-based decision-support systems help farmers to maximize
    production efficiency while minimizing production costs and environmental footprint
    of their operations [49]. ICT-based smart irrigation systems can reduce not only
    water usage [50], [62], [63] but also carbon footprint [50] due to reduced use
    of energy. In general, precision agriculture technologies and practices can result
    in lower GHG emissions, thus mitigating climate change, due to enhanced of carbon
    sequestration ability of soils [64] thanks to reduced tillage [65] and nitrogen
    rates [66], [67]; reduced fuel consumption in field operations [43]; and reduced
    inputs use [60]. Technologies of precision farming are nowadays present in all
    crop production stages and increasingly used in livestock production to improve
    both cost effectiveness and overall sustainability of operations [68]. Precision
    farming technologies are currently taking up with an expected annual growth rate
    of 12% till 2020. The European Union [46], [48], [69], [70] and the USA are considered
    the most promising markets. In the conclusions of their foresight exercise on
    precision agriculture and the future of farming in Europe, Schrijver et al. [46]
    highlighted that precision agriculture can actively contribute to food security
    and supports sustainable farming (i.e. environmental sustainability of farming).
    There has been over last decades an increasing attention to precision agriculture
    also in the United States as shown by focus on these new technologies by extension
    services [71], [72], [73], [74], [75]. Nevertheless, precision agriculture technologies
    are still not affordable for many farmers in developing countries. There has been
    in recent years an increasing interest in the use of ICT for development (cf.
    ICT4D). It is widely believed that ICTs hold the potential of contributing to
    agricultural and rural development in developing countries [19], [29], [32], [33],
    [76], [77], [78], [79], [80]. The e-Sourcebook developed by the World Bank, provides
    guiding principles and examples on applying ICT in agriculture in poor rural areas
    [81]. Also the relation between ICTs and food security was the object of many
    publications [19], [32], [33], [82]. Arguing that the failure of the original
    green revolution in Africa was also due to poor access to ICTs [83], infoDev [84]
    assumes that a real hope for a different outcome is offered by the current mobile
    revolution in the continent. In fact, there is a tremendous increase in the use
    of mobile phones also in African countries [85]. ICTs can improve rural livelihoods
    and empower small-scale farmers in developing countries by enhancing their connectivity
    [78], [80] and increasing availability of agricultural and market information
    [84]. ICTs can also contribute to social justice and equity by empowering marginalized
    groups (e.g. women, the elderly, youth) in rural communities of the Global South
    [77]. ICTs empower farmers as innovators by accruing their access to information
    leading to innovation [86], [87]. Agricultural innovation is about timely access
    and application of available information to respond to opportunities and threats
    [88]. In developing countries, ICTs are widely used by extension and advisory
    services to provide farmers with information and advices (e.g. weather forecasts,
    crop and livestock diseases, market information prices), through Short Message
    Service (SMS), web portals and call centers [79], [89], [90]. While before SMS
    dominated, there is nowadays a more varied mix of technological options such as
    SMS, smartphone apps, IVR (Interactive Voice Response) as well as integration
    with social media [32], [91], [92]. Thanks to ICTs, some innovative extension
    models and services – such as the Virtual Extension, Research and Communication
    Network (VERCON) of FAO – were developed [79]. ICTs, especially mobile telephony,
    allow farmers, also in developing countries, to access financial services (e.g.
    savings, credit, insurance, payment facilities and money transfers) that they
    need at low cost [32], [81]. 3. ICT in food processing, distribution and consumption
    While ICT innovation was mainly used in the last decades to improve agriculture
    productivity and efficiency, and they continue to be so, there is also a growing
    interest in ICT solutions for post-harvest, transport and storage stages of the
    agricultural value chain [32], [40]. ICTs can benefit transport systems at various
    levels in terms of cost reductions and efficiency increases [93]. In some situations,
    they can also help to overcome some problems in transport infrastructure. The
    cost of food transportation, and eventually also that of food processing, can
    be reduced if the limited transportation facilities are used more efficiently
    [33]. ICTs and sensor-based applications can be used to enable evaluation of the
    current situation in transport logistics; they can be used to optimize transportation
    and logistics processes by monitoring different parameters such as fuel usage,
    speed and position thus making the supply chain more efficient [34]. Some applications,
    such as Sourcemap, allow visualizing supply chain information in relation to environmental
    impact (cf. carbon footprint, food miles). Sourcemap has been effectively used
    for improving the efficiency and sustainability of ingredient sourcing, by reducing
    distance between ingredient production sites and processing plants thus reducing
    transportation costs [36]. ICT is used for facilitating retailing ways. E-commerce,
    online ordering and deliveries, can potentially substitute traditional retail
    [94] and allow a better coordination of food distribution. While most scholars
    agree that transportation costs can be reduced with use of ICT purchasing systems
    [95], there are divergences with regard to the effect on environmental impact
    of distribution. Siikavirta et al. [96] showed that e-grocery home delivery could
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in Finland. Williams and Tagami [97] found
    that in dense urban areas, traditional retail had lower environmental impact than
    e-commerce. In fact, it seems that the environmental impact of e-commerce depends
    on the efficiency of transportation. Therefore, business-to-consumer and business-to-business
    transportation need to be efficient if e-shopping is to improve environmental
    sustainability [24]. According to Börjesson Rivera et al. [94], food ecommerce,
    particularly e-retailing, can improve food chain sustainability by enhancing transparency
    and knowledge sharing. The use of ICT to change every day behaviour and practices
    towards sustainability is a main research topic in ICT for sustainability (ICT4S).
    Nevertheless, much of research related to this area has focused on energy; although,
    as in the case of sustainability transitions research field, the area of sustainable
    food is receiving an increasing interest [98], [99], [100] with the aim of closing
    the intention-behaviour gap that explains differences between current food consumption
    practices and sustainable food consumption patterns [101], including sustainable
    diets. These include applications that visualize food carbon footprint to consumers
    [102] and food-miles [103]. 4. ICT and food chain: It’s not a panacea! ICTs are
    impacting the organization, integration and coordination of food chains at local,
    regional and global levels. They are reported to reduce transaction costs in the
    food chain. According to Berti and Mulligan [21] “digital technologies may hold
    the key to the successful coordination of a more sustainable food system” (p.
    7). They are useful for both industrialized food supply chains and short ones.
    Different types of farms (industrialized farms, multi-functional farms, urban
    farms) require different types of ICT-enabled coordination mechanisms. Rural farms
    need to coordinate their logistics and take-to-market activities as well as to
    understand where and when to obtain the best market price. Peri-urban farms need
    coordination to deliver their products to the correct market and customers. Urban
    farms need direct coordination with consumers or other small urban producers.
    Modern ICTs are improving access of farmers to information thus giving them multiple
    options for buying inputs and selling outputs [80], [104], [105]. This increased
    bargaining power of farmers (including small-scale ones) represents a clear revolution
    in the food chain and has far-reaching implications in terms of transitions towards
    sustainability in food systems. It implies also new relations between producers
    and consumers that are based on more equity and transparency. Moreover, ICTs,
    such as mobile phones, shorten the distance between food chain actors involved
    in producing, processing, transporting and marketing food [83]. Verdouw et al.
    [106] argue that food system sustainability can be dramatically enhanced through
    the revolutionary potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) perspective that can
    allow visualizing, monitoring, controlling and, thus, optimizing food chain processes
    by self-adaptive, autonomous and smart ICT systems. Furthermore, internet technologies
    and ICTs contributed to the development of new agri-food chain concepts (e.g.
    food webs, urban agriculture) in which regional producers and consumers are connected
    [22]. In fact, ICTs have played an important role in improving communication and
    coordination between the different parts of short supply chains, especially producers
    and consumers [21]. Some scholars [107], [108], [109], [110] argue that ICTs have
    the capability of increasing the transparency of supply chains. ICT and information
    systems can be used to increase the traceability of agro-food products and the
    transparency of the food chains. They make easier, in fact, information management
    and increase information integrity [111]. Traceability systems have become important
    to guarantee food quality and safety. Current traceability systems are mainly
    used to find the origin of problems and facilitating call-backs [108]. ICTs have
    contributed to the emergence of many alternative food networks (e.g. farmers’
    markets, community-supported agriculture) and short supply chains [21]. The internet
    is being used, among others, for creating knowledge networks between producers
    and for re-connecting farmers with consumers. This connecting of different food
    system actors can provide opportunities for increasing sustainability [27], [112].
    Although the main feature of farmers’ markets is face-to-face contact, ICT can
    be used to establish and empower trust relationships between producers and consumers
    in farmers’ market [113]. However, Murphy [114] argues that e-commerce hides the
    real work in the food chain to consumers and this could enlarge the distance between
    producers and consumers. The internet has been also increasingly embraced by community-supported
    agriculture (CSA) operations as a way to organize the distribution and planning
    of their produce [35]. In fact, some CSA operations offer basket schemes that
    imply home deliveries of fresh produce, mainly vegetables and fruit. ICTs have
    been used successfully in many countries and regions for connecting small-scale
    farmers (e.g. communities of practice, networks) [21], [115]. They allow creating
    interaction space to share knowledge and expertise among the members of communities
    of practice [116]. Communities of practice range from local to global. For instance,
    the e-Agriculture community (http://www.e-agriculture.org) is a global community
    of practice – launched by FAO and other organizations in 2006, after the World
    Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) held in 2003 and 2005 – that allows exchange
    of ideas, information, and resources on the use of ICT for improving rural livelihoods,
    empowering rural communities, and creating enabling conditions for developing
    sustainable agriculture and achieving food security [32]. ICT has been crucial
    also for the development of urban gardening, which is another alternative food
    production method that connects producers and consumers. For instance, different
    internet services provide access to land by urban gardeners by connecting them
    with landowners that are interested in sharing part of their land. Furthermore,
    some ICT applications allowed creating peer food networks that provide solutions
    for dealing with produce surpluses to avoid food waste, which represents a waste
    of resources such as freshwater, cropland and inputs (e.g. fertilizers) [117].
    This is the case of food banks that developed in many countries [118]. Despite
    their well-documented positive implications in terms of food chain sustainability,
    the use of ICT can also bring about some negative impacts (Table 1). Davies [99]
    pointed out that ICT solutions that are developed in isolation from realities
    and practices of producers and consumers run the risk of hampering rather than
    advancing possibilities for sustainability transitions in the food system. Svenfelt
    and Zapico [35] highlighted the need to adopt a holistic approach that takes into
    consideration links in the food chain; otherwise, sustainability gains in one
    part of the food chain may induces offsetting changes in another part. Therefore,
    ICT solutions should consider production practices, communication in food chain,
    consumer behaviour [35]. The ownership of data is a key concern with the use of
    digital technologies in the food chain both on the supply-side (cf. producers)
    and the demand side (cf. consumers) [21]. For instance, large companies are able,
    thanks to feedback loops on equipment they sell, to collect a large amount of
    data about farms and this represents a big concern for farmers. Agro-chemical
    multinationals that possess data on a large number of farms in different countries
    may use them to create a monopoly on market of staple crops with implications
    in terms of food security and farmers’ livelihoods in developing countries. Table
    1. Impacts of ICT use on agro-food chain sustainability. Sustainability dimension
    Expected positive impacts Potential negative impacts Environmental Increasing
    efficiency of the use of resources (water, land, energy) and inputs (fertilizers,
    pesticides) Reducing footprint and negative environmental externalities of agriculture
    and agro-food processing (e.g. water pollution) Decreasing contribution of agricultural
    sector to greenhouse gas emissions Reducing of food losses and waste Generating
    e-waste and disposal of ICT equipment in rural areas Economic Reducing production,
    transport and distribution costs Increasing productivity and profitability Reducing
    transaction costs in the food chain Connecting small-scale producers to markets
    Initial increase of production costs because of investment Increasing risk of
    agro-food market dominance by few multinationals Social Increasing transparency
    of food supply chains Making easier access to information by all food chain actors
    Improving product traceability / food safety (cf. consumer health) Fostering networking
    among food chains actors Empowering small-scale farmers by enhancing their connectivity
    Improving food practices Disconnecting producers and consumers through virtual
    relations Increasing dependency on technology Increasing the power of globalisation
    Risk of increasing exclusion of small-scale and computer illiterate producers
    5. Challenges to ICT use in the food chain There are many challenges that should
    be addressed in order to increase the use of ICTs in agriculture and food system
    [79], [80]. Wolfert et al. [119] identified some bottlenecks of development of
    ICTs in agriculture such as small-scaled and isolated software development, regional
    focus and cultural differences, difficult or impossible interoperability between
    various systems in the supply chain or at farm level, complicated handling and
    integration of large amounts of data (e.g. data from agricultural equipment).
    Schrijver et al. [46] pointed out that the use of ICTs, especially in the context
    of precision agriculture, will trigger societal changes, especially in rural areas.
    Moreover, uptake of precision farming technologies can represent a challenge for
    farmers that may need to learn new skills. In the Global South, several factors
    such as connectivity, content (e.g. cultural appropriateness, language), capacity,
    and cost can challenge the integration of ICTs in agriculture and rural economy
    [77]. Therefore, ICTs, such as mobile technologies, need to be tailored to individual
    contexts and be developed in collaboration with end-users and beneficiaries to
    ensure that they are adequate, relevant and accessible [77], [81]. FAO [32] identified
    seven critical factors of success and challenges in making ICTs available and
    accessible for farmers and rural communities: • Content (adaptation of content
    to farmers’ needs in terms of format and relevance); • Capacity development (ability
    to effectively use technologies and information at individual, organizational
    and institutional levels); • Gender and diversity (difficult and limited access
    for women, older and poor farmers, and people living in remote areas); • Access
    and participation (gender-based and rural-urban digital divides persist); • Partnerships
    (few and mostly ineffective public-private partnerships); • Technologies (challenge
    of identifying the right technologies mix that is suitable to local contexts);
    • Economic, social and environmental sustainability (difficult scaling up of pilot
    ICT projects and initiatives). 6. Conclusions Food systems need a radical transformation
    to become sustainable. ICTs can contribute to this food sustainability transition
    by providing new ways of visualizing and measuring impacts, communicating necessary
    changes and connecting food chain actors. New ICT technologies and services help
    food operators deliver greater efficiency in resource use. Therefore, digital
    technologies hold potential of reducing inefficiencies within food supply chains.
    They are also critical in helping to bring about the changes in food consumption
    patterns and practices needed to move towards sustainability in the food chain.
    In order to maximize the benefits of ICTs in food chains, also in developing countries,
    it is necessary to develop applications and services that are user-friendly, relevant,
    localized and affordable. Actions in policy, science and innovation are necessary
    to encourage the development of affordable, locally appropriate, and sustainable
    ICT infrastructure, applications, services and tools for agriculture and the rural
    economy. ICTs can have both positive and negative impacts related to sustainability
    in agro-food systems. In fact, ICTs deployment induces far-reaching changes that
    impact individuals, societies and the environment. Agriculture is changing significantly
    with the multiplication of devices and their increased connectivity. Aside from
    the benefits of digital innovations, there are also challenges and threats that
    need to be addressed. Therefore, more research is needed on the impacts of ICT
    solutions and applications in terms of agriculture and food systems sustainability.
    Such a research should adopt a holistic approach and consider the complexity of
    food system as well as interaction between its different components and actors.
    Nevertheless, it is also important to first define how a sustainable food system
    should look like in each specific context, then to see how ICT can support the
    journey towards sustainability. In fact, there is the risk with ICT to increase
    the power of globalization, which can lead to uniformity of food systems worldwide.

    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\

    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\
    \ can illustrate dynamic processing of the object, (III) in-\ntegration of geometric,\
    \ physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin approaches \nmake it possible\
    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the specific conditions of the farm. It has also\
    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\
    \ of unskilled har-\nvester operators and lead to high macro-economic benefits\
    \ [63].  \nWithin the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important\
    \ technology in crop \nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization\
    \ and has been drawing more at-\ntention in recent years. To optimize the robotic\
    \ application process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efficiency\
    \ of the product, the digital twin concepts can be used for \nvirtualization of\
    \ the robot environment by introducing a remote operating system [64]. By \nproviding\
    \ simulation and remote operation possibilities and modeling various interac-\n\
    tions between robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\
    \ \nand flexibility may enhance, and the final product cost may decline. Ref.\
    \ [65] analyzed the \nhuman-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform.\
    \ Their developed digital \ntwin helps to improve operational productivity and\
    \ comfort. In another study, a digital \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital\
    \ twin concept for crop production technology.\nDigital twin in design and manufacturing\

    \ and physical properties of an object, (II) in the\ndetailed information of the\
    \ product which can illustrate dynamic processing of the object,\n(III) integration\
    \ of geometric, physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin ap-\nproaches\
    \ make it possible to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery\n\
    that would yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efﬁciencies.\n\
    For instance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be mod-\neled in digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors\
    \ on energy consumption can\nalso be explored there [62]. In the agricultural\
    \ context, ref. [40] reported that a commercially\navailable digital twin platform\
    \ for agricultural machinery is able to track the machines\nin real-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efﬁciency of crop management,\nand trajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the speciﬁc conditions of the farm. It has also\n\
    been reported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training of\
    \ unskilled\nharvester operators and lead to high macro-economic beneﬁts [63].\n\
    Within the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important technology\
    \ in crop\nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization and has\
    \ been drawing more\nattention in recent years. To optimize the robotic application\
    \ process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efﬁciency of the product,\
    \ the digital twin concepts can be used for\nvirtualization of the robot environment\
    \ by introducing a remote operating system [64].\nBy providing simulation and\
    \ remote operation possibilities and modeling various inter-\nactions between\
    \ robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\nand\
    \ ﬂexibility may enhance, and the ﬁnal product cost may decline. Ref. [65] analyzed\n\
    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\
    \ in the agricultural context,\nand future studies in terms of knowledge, technological,\
    \ system development, and application\naspects of digital twin concepts in different\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    [66] 4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of
    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    • Data limitations exist for all components of agricultural systems. • Model limitations
    also exist, more severely in constrained, complex systems. • Knowledge products
    for informing decisions and policy remain very limited. • Use cases provide an
    important context for model evaluation and improvement. • More emphasis is needed
    on models, systems analyses of agricultural systems. Abstract We review the current
    state of agricultural systems science, focusing in particular on the capabilities
    and limitations of agricultural systems models. We discuss the state of models
    relative to five different Use Cases spanning field, farm, landscape, regional,
    and global spatial scales and engaging questions in past, current, and future
    time periods. Contributions from multiple disciplines have made major advances
    relevant to a wide range of agricultural system model applications at various
    spatial and temporal scales. Although current agricultural systems models have
    features that are needed for the Use Cases, we found that all of them have limitations
    and need to be improved. We identified common limitations across all Use Cases,
    namely 1) a scarcity of data for developing, evaluating, and applying agricultural
    system models and 2) inadequate knowledge systems that effectively communicate
    model results to society. We argue that these limitations are greater obstacles
    to progress than gaps in conceptual theory or available methods for using system
    models. New initiatives on open data show promise for addressing the data problem,
    but there also needs to be a cultural change among agricultural researchers to
    ensure that data for addressing the range of Use Cases are available for future
    model improvements and applications. We conclude that multiple platforms and multiple
    models are needed for model applications for different purposes. The Use Cases
    provide a useful framework for considering capabilities and limitations of existing
    models and data. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Integrated

    data 1. Introduction Agricultural systems science as we know it today has evolved
    over the last 50 or more years with contributions from a wide range of disciplines
    (Jones et al., this issue). Generally during this same time period, appreciation
    for and acceptance of agricultural systems science has increased as more scientists,
    engineers, and economists graduate from universities with training in systems
    modeling, analytical approaches, and information technology (IT) tools. Over this
    time period, there has also been a corresponding increase in demands for agricultural
    systems science to address questions faced by society that transcend agriculture.
    Relevant questions range from how to better manage systems for higher and more
    efficient production, what changes are needed in a farming system for higher profitability
    without harming the environment, what policies are needed to help farming systems
    evolve to meet broader societal goals, and what systems are needed to adapt to
    the continual changes that agriculture faces, including climate change, changes
    in demand for agricultural products, volatile energy prices, and limitations of
    land, water, and other natural resources. Agricultural systems models are being
    challenged to move beyond just including economic and sustainability issues. There
    is a strong agenda of new Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., FAO, 2016), which
    will require models of nutritional quality of food beyond bulk yields and multifunctional
    landscape models for policy analyses. Sustainable solutions that address multiple
    goals will likely benefit from a convergence of science and technologies that
    make use of information and cognitive sciences (Scott et al., 2015, Wolfe et al.,
    2016). In order to analyze these different dimensions of agriculture and food
    systems, ideally we would have a virtual laboratory containing models, data, analytical
    tools and IT tools to conduct studies that evaluate outcomes and tradeoffs among
    alternative technologies, policies, or scenarios. The virtual laboratory would
    allow users to define scenarios, specify analyses covering different social, political,
    and resource situations and different spatial and temporal scales, and produce
    outputs suitable for interpretation and use by decision makers. Clearly, that
    virtual laboratory does not exist. But where are we currently relative to this
    ideal situation? The purpose of this paper is to address that question by reviewing
    the state of agricultural systems science and its capabilities for the Use Cases
    described by Antle, Jones and Rosenzweig (this issue) that represent two important
    areas of agricultural systems model applications: for smallholder agriculture
    in developing countries and for commercial agriculture in industrialized countries.
    This paper builds on earlier reviews of specific components. In the concluding
    article of this Special Issue, Antle, Jones and Rosenzweig (this issue) discuss
    the implications of NextGen for global change research, another major area of
    agricultural systems model applications. 2. Component agricultural system models
    Here, we address models as components of integrated agricultural systems models,
    focusing on applicability of models for selected Use Cases. Janssen et al. (this
    issue) discuss the capabilities and limitations of various data and information
    tools for the different Use Cases as well as what is needed for the next generation
    of models and knowledge systems. 2.1. Cropping system and grassland models Several
    crop modeling review papers have recently been published (e.g., Holzworth et al.,
    2015, Boote et al., 2013, Basso et al., 2016), summarizing model capabilities
    and uses. For example, Rivington and Koo (2010) surveyed crop model developers
    and users to assess the state of crop models for use in research and decision
    making related to climate change. They emphasized the need for additional model
    development as well as the need for more and better quality data. Ewert et al.
    (2014) reviewed crop models relative to their adequacy in performing integrated
    assessments of climate change impacts, and pointed out important limitations in
    most crop models. Holzworth et al. (2015) discussed advances in capabilities and
    applications over time. Basso et al. (2016) reviewed the performance of CERES
    maize (Ritchie, 1986), wheat (Otter and Ritchie, 1985) and rice models (Ritchie
    et al., 1986a) compared to measured data over the last 30 years in 43 countries.
    They reported that model performance, using site-specific inputs, was outstanding
    for the variables compared (e.g., average relative error for grain yield of 13%).
    Models of cropping and grassland systems share the same fundament characteristics:
    both describe crop or grassland agro-ecosystem growth and yield responses to climate,
    soil, plant species characteristics, and management. However, several aspects
    of grassland/rangeland modeling present unique challenges. Many of these challenges
    stem from the requirement that grassland models represent several interacting
    species, including perennial and woody species of grasses. Persistence of plants
    over multiple years forces the models to consider residual effects over time.
    Dependency on soil-derived nutrients or human-induced disturbances like fire reinforce
    the longer-term perspective needed for grassland modeling. Thus, although most
    biophysical processes are similar (e.g., relative to photosynthesis, growth, water
    and nutrient uptake from soil, etc.) additional factors are considered when modeling
    grasslands. 2.1.1. Model-simulated responses of interest to users The most common
    response variable modeled for cropping systems is yield, whether of grain, tuber,
    or forage biomass yield. This yield is harvested at a single point in time for
    determinate annual crops, while indeterminate crops and grasslands may be harvested
    multiple times. Although statistical models may be useful for predicting these
    biological yields in response to some combination of weather conditions, nutrient
    levels, irrigation amounts, etc. (e.g., Schlenker and Lobell, 2010, Lobell et
    al., 2011), they do not predict responses to nonlinearities and threshold effects
    outside the range of conditions in data used to develop them. In contrast, dynamic
    cropping and grassland system models may simulate these biological yields and
    other responses important to analysts, such as crop water use, nitrogen uptake,
    nitrate leaching, soil erosion, soil carbon, greenhouse gas emissions, and residual
    soil nutrients. Dynamic models can also be used to estimate responses in places
    and for time periods and conditions for which there are no prior experiments.
    They can be used to simulate experiments and estimate responses that allow users
    to evaluate economic and environmental tradeoffs among alternative systems. Simulation
    experiments can predict responses to various climate and soil conditions, genetics,
    and management factors that are represented in the model. “Hybrid” agricultural
    system models that combine dynamic crop simulations with appropriate economic
    models can simulate policy-relevant “treatment effects” in an experimental design
    of climate impact and adaptation (Antle and Stockle, 2015). 2.1.2. Factors to
    which cropping and grassland systems respond Many factors affect crop growth and
    yield in agricultural fields and pastures. One innovation of early crop modeling
    pioneers was to categorize the crop production situation being modeled to narrow
    down the many factors that are needed by crop models (Bouman et al., 1996, van
    Ittersum et al., 2003). Fig. 1 summarizes three crop production levels and factors
    that influence each. Potential production is defined as crop production that is
    determined completely by defining factors of CO2, radiation, temperature, and
    crop characteristics (e.g., genetic control of physiology and canopy architecture).
    Potential production models also include partitioning of biomass growth into grain
    and other plant parts, with defining factors modeled to affect these processes.
    This potential production level is rarely achieved in real production situations,
    although under highly intensive management (supply of adequate water and nutrients
    and control of insects, weeds, and diseases), production approximates the potential
    level for the specific CO2, temperature, radiation, genetics, and canopy architecture
    used. For example, crops grown in greenhouses or in intensively managed fields
    in some regions produce yields that are at or near potential levels. Download

    from cropping system models to help guide their development and inform users of
    their applicability to address different questions. Adapted from van Ittersum
    et al. (2003). The next production situation is referred to as water-limited and/or
    nutrient-limited production (Fig. 1). At this level, the defining factors are
    still important, but there may also be limitations in the water and/or nutrients
    needed to achieve full growth potential. Crop models that simulate water and/or
    nutrient-limitations must include soil water and nutrient component modules to
    simulate the time-varying availability of water and nutrients, the uptake of these
    resources, and reductions in growth and development if they are not adequate to
    meet potential growth demands. Most cropping and grassland system models contain
    component modules that simulate soil water, nitrogen, and carbon dynamics because
    of the global importance of these resources in determining yield. Although some
    models include phosphorus, most of them do not simulate responses to phosphorus,
    potassium, or micro-nutrients. Models that represent soil water, nitrogen and
    carbon dynamics are complicated not only because of the physical and chemical
    processes that occur in soils, but also because of the complexities in management
    practices used for these resources (e.g., water-harvesting, drip irrigation, types
    of inorganic or organic fertilizer applied, fertilizer micro-dosing, etc.). Finally,
    actual production (Fig. 1) includes additional factors that may reduce growth
    and yield (insects, diseases, weeds, and pollutants). Whereas some crop models
    have capabilities to introduce damage by diseases and insects (e.g., Boote et
    al., 1983, Pinnschmidt et al., 1995), the modeling of these reducing factors has
    not kept up with other advances in crop modeling (see below and Donatelli et al.,
    this issue) for a review of recent progress). Most groups modeling cropping and
    grassland systems do not include these factors. Thus, few current models simulate
    responses to pest or disease damage or to their management using resistant varieties,
    agro-chemicals, or other approaches. This is a major limitation for some applications.
    2.1.3. Components of cropping system models – crop, soil, atmosphere, management
    Dynamic crop models generally include factors at the potential yield level (shown
    in Fig. 1) in addition to water- and nitrogen-limited production level. However,
    the ways that different models include those factors vary. Fig. 2 shows a schematic
    of the components in the Cropping System Model (CSM) that incorporates the CERES
    (e.g., see Basso et al., 2016), CROPGRO, and other models in DSSAT (Jones et al.,
    2003, Boote et al., 2010, Hoogenboom et al., 2015). The CSM models can include
    soil water, nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus dynamics and can introduce pest and
    disease damage into some crops using the concept of coupling points (Boote et
    al., 1983, Batchelor et al., 1993). It also can simulate multiple seasons so that
    carry-over changes in soil water, N, and P are simulated to represent longer-term
    changes in soil resources in response to different management systems (Porter
    et al., 2010, Basso et al., 2011). Download : Download high-res image (268KB)

    components in the DSSAT Cropping System Model. (CSM, adapted from Jones et al.,
    2003). A number of other cropping and grassland system models have similar components
    and capabilities (e.g., APSIM, Keating et al., 2003a, Keating et al., 2003b and
    Holzworth et al., 2014; CROPSYST, Stöckle et al., 2003, Stöckle et al., 2014;
    EPIC, Williams et al., 1989; STICS, Brisson et al., 2003 and Bergez et al., 2014;
    SALUS, Basso and Ritchie, 2015 and Dzotsi et al., 2013), although most models
    do not simulate impacts of pests and diseases unless coupled externally with time-series
    input data or pest models like in DSSAT CSM (Boote et al., 1983, Batchelor et
    al., 1993). Some models (e.g., APSIM) have an ability to simulate intercropping
    (Thorburn et al., 2014, Holzworth et al., 2014). An unfortunate feature of current
    crop and grassland models is that modules from one set of models are not compatible
    with other models. For example, APSIM''s intercropping capabilities are deeply
    embedded in the system architecture and cannot be simply moved to other models
    like DSSAT CSM. Moving pest and disease damage modules from DSSAT CSM to APSIM
    is possible but requires coding of module “wrappers” to handle inter-model communications
    – a non-trivial task. 2.1.4. Approaches Most “cropping system” models have evolved
    as elaborations of component crop and soil models and the focus has been on modeling
    a single “point” in space (consider this a field or a paddock) over time to explore
    variability in crop responses to soil, management and weather. A typical structure
    for this pedigree is shown in Fig. 2. Most operate on daily or hourly time-steps.
    Some include hourly time steps for computing rates of photosynthesis and other
    processes but also use daily steps to update state variables such as phenological
    development, and biomass of plant organs. These time steps are also used to compute
    changes in soil water, soil nitrogen, and crop biomass that result from soil-water
    processes including rainfall, infiltration, runoff, percolation, redistribution,
    and plant uptake, and changes in soil nitrogen. Details of how different growth,
    hydrology, and soil nutrient processes are represented vary among models. Models
    may be either functional or mechanistic, with the choice of approach depending
    on the modeling team''s knowledge of the system, their purpose, the availability
    of data for parameterization, and their experience in developing and evaluating
    models. These differences lead to different models producing different responses
    when used to simulate the same experiment (e.g., see Asseng et al., 2013, Bassu
    et al., 2014). Most models use simplified functional equations and logic to partition
    simulated biomass into various plant organs. Functional models also primarily
    use “capacity” concepts to describe the amount of water stored in a soil that
    is available to plants; mechanistic models, in contrast, use the potential energy
    of soil water and “instantaneous rate” concepts from soil physics. In capacity-based
    functional models, it is the difference between the upper and lower limits of
    soil water-holding capacity that determine the amount of water available to plants.
    In this type of soil water model, water movement and its availability for crop
    growth are represented by functional equations on a daily time step, even though
    infiltration and runoff processes may be computed with smaller time steps. Some
    modeling systems can operate with either capacity based or energy based soil water
    modules (e.g. APSIM) and ideally a flexible agro-ecosystem simulation engine or
    platform will be able to work with component modules specified to different degrees
    of “mechanism”. Although some models include input information on plant genetics
    (e.g., White and Hoogenboom, 1996, Hammer et al., 2006, Messina et al., 2006),
    these are few in number and not yet in widespread use. Most models are not genetic-based,
    which is one reason that calibration of models using field data is widely practiced
    to obtain genotype-specific parameters. Some modeling platforms while utilizing
    crop and soil components such as shown in Fig. 2, have focused more strongly on
    “agricultural system” features, with capabilities of instantiation that facilitates
    the simulation of systems features such as multiple paddocks, intercropping, weeds,
    tree – crop interactions, livestock operations and even non-biological features
    of farms such as water storage structures. APSIM (Keating et al., 2003a, Keating
    et al., 2003b) is the best known example of this farming systems “platform”. It
    sits at the interface of the crop-soil systems models typified by Fig. 2 and the
    whole farm optimization models discussed elsewhere in this paper. Holzworth et
    al. (2014) outlines in full these “agricultural systems” features of the APSIM
    approach (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (96KB) Download : Download

    (From Holzworth et al., 2014). 2.1.5. Additional considerations for modeling grasslands
    Grasslands are usually mixed stands comprised of a variety of grasses and forbs,
    including legumes and sometimes woody species (Allen et al., 2011). Unlike croplands,
    the diversity of species generally precludes use of a single-species parameterization,
    since species vary in their ability to compete for space, water, nutrients (most
    commonly nitrogen), and light. Grassland models generally represent plant behavior
    and competition among herbaceous plants using one of: (1) a set of species, each
    independently parameterized; (2) amalgamations of plants into parameters for plant
    functional types (e.g., warm-season grasses, legumes, etc.); or (3) community-averaged
    parameterizations (Taubert et al., 2012). While requiring more effort for parameterization,
    these amalgamated approaches enable representation of changes in plant community
    composition over time, for example in response to climate change, competition
    among plant populations, and mortality. Trees are dynamic components of the world''s
    native grazing lands and can have significant impacts on ecosystem function (Schlesinger
    et al., 1990). Representing tree/grass competition is challenging because trees
    respond differently to various drivers (such as fire, grazing, and CO2 concentration)
    and depend on plant population characteristics (e.g., seed banks). Shifts in plant
    community composition can be self-reinforcing due to co-occurring population and
    biophysical changes (D''Odorico et al., 2012). Dynamic vegetation modeling approaches
    are used to represent competition among herbaceous and woody types for water,
    nitrogen, light, and space. Dynamic rangeland vegetation models and state-and-transition
    models identify a set of plant communities that tend to resist change due to disturbance,
    but also describe drivers (e.g., fire, grazing, climate change) that lead to a
    transition to another quasi-stable plant community (Stringham et al., 2003). Expansion
    of woody species and increases in woody cover are widespread phenomena that under
    many but not all environmental conditions lead to the transition of early successional
    communities dominated by grasses and forbs to forests (Van Auken, 2000). Studying
    woody encroachment and understanding the importance of competing drivers has been
    challenging, in part because of the slow rates of the processes driving changes
    (e.g., Morgan et al., 2007). These slow changes are reflected in the drivers of
    transitions in state-and-transition models and contribute to uncertainty in our
    ability to represent longer-term changes in the tree-grass balance. Ecological
    succession has been studied by plant ecologists since pioneering work before 1945.
    More interactions among agricultural and ecological modelers are likely to be
    mutually beneficial. Grazing animals of all kinds have an impact on plant productivity
    by removing photosynthesizing tissues, altering light transmission through the
    canopy, influencing nutrient cycling and affecting plant allocation patterns and
    differentially influencing species mortality and recruitment rates in grasslands
    (Diaz et al., 2007). Such changes to groups of plants (species, functional groups,
    etc.) can drive changes in the competitive balance and thus plant community composition.
    Whereas grassland models incorporating species or plant functional types can represent
    grazing-induced changes in the competitive balance, such models that represent
    plants with a set of community-wide parameters usually rely on some combination
    of LAI (Leaf Area Index)-driven reduction in production potential along with grazing
    response curves. In grasslands/rangelands, grazing (or cutting for hay) removes
    some plant productive capacity, and thus models cannot rely upon deterministic
    growth curves, but must be able to forecast growth for plants with an amount of
    biomass or leaf area that varies independent of the time of year or climate. There
    can also be significant differences in growth rates among and even within species
    after a grazing event (Milchunas and Lauenroth, 1993, Vesk and Westoby, 2001).
    2.2. Reduced form summary crop models The factors to which models respond vary
    among models and evolve as modelers attempt to make them more comprehensive and
    universally applicable. In contrast, some researchers who want to apply them do
    not have all needed inputs, or they may want to embed a crop model into economic
    or other models for analyzing responses across scales. Some researchers have used
    more comprehensive crop models to create reduced form crop models that have much
    fewer input requirements, run fast, and produce responses needed for specific
    applications (e.g., Jones et al., 1999). For example, Chikowo et al. (2008) used
    the APSIM cropping system model to generate parameters and variables needed to
    operate a much simpler field scale crop model (NUANCES-FIELD, Tittonell et al.,
    2007). The reduced form summary model responds to nitrogen and phosphorus levels
    for different soil characteristics and management inputs. Dzotsi et al. (2013)
    used a similar approach, showing that reduced maize, peanut, and cotton models
    parameterized from the DSSAT CSM model accurately reproduced DSSAT results across
    time and space. Reduced form crop models allow researchers to produce situation-specific
    summary models that approximate the responses of a more comprehensive model for
    use in broader scale analyses that may involve socioeconomic, livestock, and environmental
    sustainability components. Reduced-form crop models can be interpreted as the
    “production function” that is the foundation of economic production models (see
    Section 2.5), and can be linked to economic models to create “hybrid” models for
    policy analysis and impact assessment (Antle and Capalbo, 2001, Antle and Stockle,
    2015). Keating et al., 2003a, Keating et al., 2003b demonstrated a similar process
    of summary model development, building from the foundation of a comprehensive
    set of crop-soil and management system simulations. They developed a summary model
    from thousands of APSIM simulations with three key parameters that captured 88%
    of the variation in space and time of key water balance variables. 2.3. Livestock
    systems Livestock systems are complex and require modeling at several levels:
    the animal, the herd, and its interactions of the herd with its environment via
    consumption of feed, use of land and water, and other resources. Several types
    of models have been used in the past to describe different components of livestock
    systems. (see reviews by Herrero et al., 1998 and Tedeschi et al., 2014). Examples
    of these are DSSAT (Jones, 1993), APSIM (Holsworth et al., 2014), Century (Parton
    et al., 1993), SAVANNA (Coughenhour, 1992), The Hurley Pasture Model (Thornley,
    1997), PHYGROW (Stuth et al., 2003). Table 1 summarizes the most commonly used
    types. Table 1. Livestock models and some types of questions they can help answer.

    to herd dynamics 2.3.1. Animal performance models A central element driving production,
    profitability, and efficiency in livestock systems is animal performance. Hence,
    the most commonly used livestock models are those that predict animal meat and
    milk productivity. Precursors to performance models have existed since the 1940s
    when the first feed requirements for livestock were developed (NRC, 1945). Since
    then, many have been built and refined regularly across the US and Europe (AFRC,
    1993, NRC, 2001). Nutrient requirements models are the workhorse of the feed industry
    for ration formulation (linked to linear programming models for least-cost ration
    formulation) and for recommending changes in feed management to farm advisors.
    These models are often based on a mixture of statistical regressions derived from
    experimental data plus mechanistic principles of the energetics and protein metabolism
    of mammals. Animal performance models usually require information on the animal
    (i.e., bodyweight, target milk production, milk composition, breed, days pregnant)
    and the feeds (digestibility and crude protein at the minimum, but increasingly
    several parameters related to the fiber, mineral and/or amino acid composition
    of feeds are also used). They also need an estimate of feed intake, perhaps the
    most important parameter. While these models are good for calculating feed requirements,
    dynamic models of digestion are more accurate at predicting the nutrient supply
    to animals under a wide range of conditions from the high-yielding dairy cow to
    the smallholder goat (Tedeschi et al., 2014, Herrero et al., 2013, Illius and
    Allen, 1994), because they predict intake more accurately, and they can deal with
    more complex diets and their interactions. Some models also predict methane production
    by ruminants and manure quantity and quality, which are important for estimating
    GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and the role of livestock in nutrient cycles. These
    models are typically used to answer ‘what if’ questions around the impacts of
    different feeding practices (different feeds and/or different quantities) or changes
    of animal types (breeds, different production potential) on animal performance
    (meat and/or milk output, GHG emissions, manure output). Herd dynamics models
    follow herd evolution over time in terms of animal numbers and herd structure.
    Herd dynamics models usually start by splitting a herd into cohorts of different
    ages or weight, and sex. These cohorts are specified with different mortality,
    reproductive, selling and replacement rates. Adult females produce offspring at
    specified reproductive rates, which grow or die, become part of the next cohort,
    and get sold, and the cycle continues. The best of these models include interactions
    between animal nutrition and reproduction to drive reproductive and mortality
    parameters stochastically (Konandreas and Anderson, 1982, Rufino et al., 2009).
    This feature is important as feed availability or supplementation strategies have
    significant impacts on herd reproduction and performance. Some applications of
    herd dynamics models include estimating optimal stocking rates and carrying capacities,
    assessing the impacts of reproductive technologies and/or reductions in mortality,
    and predicting removal of biomass from crop or pasture systems. These models are
    also widely used by livestock epidemiologists for estimating impacts of diseases
    on herd mortality and morbidity. They have also been used with dynamic programming
    for optimizing replacement decisions in commercial dairy herds (Van Arendonk and
    Dijkhuizen, 1985), or in linear programming applications for studying optimal
    sales policies, herd sizes, etc. Biological simulation models are sometimes used
    as input-output coefficient generators for linear programming models to aid in
    the selection of management strategies in livestock systems (Woodward, 1998, Nicholson
    et al., 1994, Herrero et al., 1999). 2.3.2. Integrated livestock systems models
    These models represent whole livestock farms and their key components (Fig. 4).
    The complexity of some livestock systems justifies the need to build whole-system
    models using simulation and optimization techniques to represent different components
    and their interactions (Herrero et al., 1996, Herrero et al., 2007, Thornton and
    Herrero, 2001). For example, grazing management strategies cannot be defined without
    also considering herd and nutritional management, since herd dynamics or feed
    supplementation practices determine the grazing intensity, use of forage, and
    subsequently animal performance. Thus, simulations of the biology of livestock
    enterprises include flexible models representing pasture growth, structure and
    quality; individual animal performance to test nutritional strategies; and population
    dynamics describing management practices at herd or flock level (i.e., stocking
    rates; sales of animals; mortality or replacement rates; calving intervals), which
    subsequently determine animal numbers and their age or physiological state (lactating
    vs. pregnant cows, heifers, calves, etc.) classes (Freer et al., 1970, Freer et
    al., 1997, Loewer, 1998, Johnson, 2002). Download : Download high-res image (509KB)

    (Adapted from Herrero et al., 1996). 2.4. Modeling pests and diseases of crops
    and livestock Biologists have been building mathematical models to describe the
    population dynamics of agricultural weeds, pests and diseases for more than a
    hundred years. Recent progress in modeling these components is discussed by Donatelli
    et al. (this issue); here we focus more on broad concepts and general state of
    progress. The diversity of modeling approaches that constitute the current state
    of science can be categorized in different ways. The first and most obvious is
    by production type and threat. Thus there are models that describe the dynamics
    of weeds, diseases and pests that are threats to arable crops, the diseases of
    livestock, and the diseases of fish used in aquaculture. While threats such as
    pests and diseases have been recognized since pre-history, the complexities of
    the microbial communities on the crop surface and in the soil around plants, and
    in the gut and rumen, are only just becoming more fully understood. Models of
    the mixture of beneficial and pathogenic organisms that these systems contain
    have not yet been developed. A broad distinction can be made between mechanistic
    (or process-based) and non-process-based pest and disease models. The former include
    explicit biology while the latter use a purely statistical approach. The choice
    of modeling approach depends greatly on the intended application. For example,
    a farm manager may want to know when to apply a prophylactic insecticide against
    a common insect pest. For this purpose, future insect population density may be
    best predicted by a statistical model containing independent biological variables
    such as crop stage, and dependent weather variables such as temperature and rainfall.
    In some cases, information about the pest itself may be included in the model,
    for example from pheromone or other traps monitored by the farmer or in the case
    of mobile insects from publicly-operated monitoring networks. A different statistical
    application is the use of climate-matching models to predict future pest problems.
    The current distribution of an organism is modeled using a set of predictors including
    climate. The distribution of the organism after climate change is then estimated
    by mapping the “climate envelope” using scenarios developed from global climate
    models. There is now a broad literature on the strengths and weaknesses of this
    approach, particularly challenging the assumption that organisms are able to move
    easily to track climate. Important recent advances in statistical models of pest
    dynamics have included the application of modern spline and neural net estimation
    techniques, and in the use of personal computers and mobile devices. Mechanistic
    models incorporate at least some information about the biology of the crop and
    pest species concerned. The models may be highly abstract – summarizing, for example,
    a pest population by a single state variable such as density – or, alternatively,
    highly complex with individual pests each represented by numerous attributes.
    The simplest models sacrifice realism for mathematical tractability and general
    insights, while models of intermediate complexity include more biological detail
    but are constructed in such a way that simpler analytical models can be recovered
    as limiting cases to help interpretation. Pest and disease models also vary in
    the degree to which they explicitly incorporate stochastic processes (often critical
    in epidemiological models) and in whether they treat a population as homogeneous
    or spatially variable. An important area is the coupling of pest and disease models
    with crop models (Boote et al., 1983, Willocquet et al., 2004, Savary et al.,
    2006, Whish et al., 2015). Donatelli et al. (this issue) review issues involved
    and existing major projects that have attempted to bridge this gap. They also
    propose a roadmap to improve pest and disease modeling focusing on improving the
    data resources available for parameterization and validation, bettering the coupling
    of crop to antagonist models, and creating a community of researchers that can
    collaborate to share expertise and produce community tools. 2.4.1. Near-future
    pest and disease threats Mechanistic models can be used to predict near-future
    pest and disease threats in similar ways to statistical models. As was discussed
    with crop models, they may be more successful than statistical models if biological
    insights can substitute for missing data or if they can aid prediction by suggesting
    a model structure that simple statistical fitting would miss. Consider, for example,
    the response of an insect to daily temperature. Higher temperatures may elevate
    growth and reproduction, and thus result in more pests, a pattern that could be
    derived with sufficient weather and population data. Alternatively, the physiological
    response of the insect could be modeled, which might improve the model''s predictive
    power or allow insect dynamics to be predicted in data-poor systems (or under
    future climate). Several schools of physiological modeling exist. However, we
    are not aware of any formal comparison of different process and statistical approaches
    to the same problem. An area where biological insights have proven fruitful has
    been in disease spread through commercial livestock populations. An understanding
    of how animals interact, and more importantly how they are moved around, can provide
    critical advice to policy-makers. Current state-of-the-art livestock models incorporate
    data on movements of animals between individual farms coupled with modern Bayesian
    parameter estimation. However, the type of data needed for such approaches is
    prohibitively expensive to obtain or politically unacceptable for many countries
    to collect (Brooks-Pollock et al., 2014). Modeling has also proved valuable in
    assessing possible pest risks and in guiding general policy development. The basic
    epidemiological number (R0) is the number of secondary cases of a disease that
    are expected to happen when a primary case occurs in a susceptible population.
    Calculation of R0 for prevalent human diseases has proved useful in prioritizing
    investment in control strategies and vaccine development. Today, sophisticated
    mathematical tools are available for calculating R0 for complex structured populations,
    for spatially extended populations, and in the presence of stochastic effects
    (Diekman et al., 2012). Probably the most sophisticated applications of population
    genetics to weed, pest and disease issues in agriculture are models of the evolution
    of resistance to pesticides, and of the dynamics of plant diseases. Evolutionary
    models can be broadly categorized as genetic or phenotypic. Although phenotypic
    models have been explored in agriculture (e.g., Denisen, 2012), the vast majority
    of evolutionary models have been genetic. Based on theoretical analyses, areas
    of fields have been set aside unsprayed or not planted with modified crops that
    express an insecticide in order to slow the rate of spread of resistance (Bates
    et al., 2005). The genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions have been resolved
    for a number of major systems, which has allowed detailed analysis of strain dynamics
    and how disease spread may be slowed by judicious use of a range of different
    crop varieties. State-of-the-art work in genetic models of weeds, pests and diseases
    includes using the avalanche of data that modern high-throughput DNA measurement
    technologies are providing, and modeling how novel genetic interventions may be
    used to suppress pest populations. Some of the most sophisticated pest monitoring
    software (typically based on statistical rather than on process models) now includes
    specific economic variables with parameters such as commodity prices that can
    be updated dynamically. The farmer may make different decisions about pest management
    depending on current market conditions. More generally, a goal of many people
    working to increase the sustainability of agriculture is to reduce chemical inputs
    by practicing “integrated pest (or disease) management”. The models required to
    support such work are challenging to construct, but some of the most advanced
    incorporate economic elements as well as various biological processes. 2.5. Economic
    models A number of approaches have been developed to model the economic implications
    of decisions and policies for a range of scales and purposes. Here, we summarize
    the most important approaches that have been developed and present important limitations
    of each. 2.5.1. Farm management linear programming models Linear economic optimization
    models of farm systems, developed in the 1950–60s, provide a basis for prescriptive
    farm management advice (Heady and Dillon, 1964). These models are characterized
    by a complex set of linear inequality constraints that represent the production
    possibilities available to a farmer. The simplex optimization algorithm is used
    to select the optimum production possibilities. One disadvantage of this approach
    is that the solutions are restricted to extreme points in the multidimensional
    decision variable space and thus it is unable to explore intermediate solutions.
    A major problem with linear programming models is that they need complex constraint
    structures to achieve some degree of calibration to base data; those constraint
    structures restrict alternative solutions and are difficult to implement for applications
    such as adoption and impact of new technologies. 2.5.2. Econometric production
    models Econometric methods have been developed and used for single crop production
    function models as well as single-equation and simultaneous system models that
    represent input demand and output supply behavior. Early work focused on primal
    representations and statistical estimation (Mundlak, 1961), but many efforts shifted
    to dual representations in the 1970s and later (Lau and Yotopolous, 1971, Chambers,
    1988). Both static and dynamic models have been developed. Single crop production
    functions are estimated directly from data on the physical quantities of inputs
    and outputs observed from experimental plots, or, in later stages, from comprehensive
    farm production surveys. Heady (1957) was an early proponent and researcher in
    this area. In many cases the functional form for the production functions is a
    quadratic or Cobb Douglas specification, both of which have implicit restrictive
    assumptions on the production technology. Later work emphasized various more flexible
    technology representations (Carter, 1984). Econometric estimation of agricultural
    systems was expanded to represent both multi-crop production with its associated
    interdependencies, the endogenous nature of agricultural supply response, and
    the imputed value of some key agricultural inputs that are often incompletely
    priced. A landmark article in this literature (Just et al., 1983) noted that multi-crop
    farm businesses responded to changes in prices or technology by adjusting both
    the intensity of input use per acre, the intensive margin (i.e., fertilizer amount
    per land area); and also the allocation of land to crops, the extensive margin.
    This distinction is important for modeling optimal input allocation in multi-crop
    farming systems. The importance of the interaction of multi-crops in a farm unit
    was a significant step forward in realistic economic models of farming systems.
    However, the approach did not include formal linkage to biophysical models of
    agricultural processes. The econometric approach has limitations in its ability
    to extrapolate responses that are outside the estimation sample, or those that
    employ systems that are not present in the data sample. These limitations were
    emphasized by Antle and Capalbo (2001) in their development of economic simulation
    models that combine econometric and other disciplinary simulation models into
    an integrated assessment framework. 2.5.3. Risk behavior models The importance
    of risk on farm decisions was recognized early in the development of linear optimization
    models of farming systems. Early articles on this linear approach to risk analysis
    are by Lin et al., 1974, Hazell and Scandizzo, 1975. As improved algorithms to
    solve quadratic optimization problems were developed, specification of risk expanded
    to a mean-variance measure of risk and imputed a risk-aversion value based on
    observed farmer actions or primary surveys (see Hazell and Norton, 1986). Just
    and Pope (1978) introduced a widely-used econometric risk model. Antle (1983)
    introduced a general moment-based representation of output distributions that
    has been widely used to study production risk behavior, including downside risk.
    Recent research has extended this approach to investigate impacts of climate change
    (Tack et al., 2012). 2.5.4. Spatial equilibrium models The importance of space
    in agricultural production and modeling agricultural systems was first introduced
    in terms of trade between regions of different comparative advantages. Takayama
    and Judge (1964) showed that spatial equilibrium conditions and transport cost
    between different production locations could be characterized as a quadratic optimization
    problem. Spatial econometrics advanced to include rates of development and specialization
    of production (Anselin, 1988). Only recently has the availability of remotely
    sensed measures of agricultural land and water use led to the use of spatial econometrics
    methods to address spatially varying farm production (Anselin et al., 2004, Staal
    S. et al., 2002). Techniques are emerging that use both remotely sensed data and
    spatial econometrics to draw conclusions about resource use or the effect of spatial
    variation on agricultural supply response. 2.5.5. Structural simulation models
    Complex simulation models have been used for the past 45 years to describe dynamic
    agricultural systems. Early examples were often based on Forrester''s (1968) concept
    of system dynamics that uses storage and flow variables to describe the system.
    However the underlying philosophy that a comprehensive and complex feedback system
    is stable and reproducible has never been convincingly demonstrated. Structural
    simulation models can be useful for representing a combination of consistent behavioral
    relationships (i.e., that the quantities of product supplied by farmers can be
    sold at a price that recovers the costs of production inputs) based on theory
    and empirical measurement. They are however, subject to interpretation in the
    absence of robustly estimated relationships describing system behavior. Various
    micro-economic models have been developed to simulate the economic behavior of
    agricultural systems and link behavior to environmental processes and economic
    sustainability indicators. van Wijk et al. (2014) document the large number and
    diversity of such models, that include: applications of various types of linear
    or non-linear programming models; household models (i.e., models that combine
    production systems with household behavior such as food consumption and labor
    supply); agent-based models that incorporate spatial and temporal interactions
    among households; and models that link economic models with bio-physical crop,
    livestock, and environmental models. Recently, agent-based modeling (Billari et
    al., 2006, Berger and Troost, 2014) has been widely used as a way of modeling
    interactive human behavior and natural systems. Some agent-based models have a
    more formal dynamic and calibration structure and use mixed-integer optimization
    approaches for solutions. However, the generality of the approach makes it susceptible
    to the same difficulties of empirical verification and reproducibility that earlier
    complex structural simulation models had. The population-based modeling approach
    of Antle et al. (2014) is a more parsimonious, generic approach designed to represent
    agricultural system heterogeneity. It links economic simulation models to bio-physical
    models to evaluate impacts of technology, policy and environmental changes on
    sustainability. 2.5.6. Calibrating optimization models Along with more complex
    constrained models, researchers have developed optimization models that utilize
    shadow values of resources and calibration constraints to derive nonlinear calibrating
    functions, which are termed positive mathematical programming (PMP, Howitt, 1995).
    In the past 10 years PMP has developed from formal calibration methods that reproduce
    the observed cropping pattern (first-order calibration) to those that calibrate
    crop supplies to prior estimates of supply elasticities (second-order calibration),
    and more complex production functions that calibrate against elasticities of substitution
    and returns to scale. In addition, PMP models are now being formally linked with
    biophysical models (see Mérel and Howitt, 2014 for a survey of recent developments).
    2.5.7. Computable general equilibrium models These macroeconomic models (e.g.,
    computable general equilibrium, or CGE models) spawned a series of smaller-scale
    models which are usually called village or household models. General equilibrium
    village models account for all flows in the village economy and remittances within
    the village to different workers and landowners. In addition, they include flows
    of revenue in and out of the village boundary. This is particularly useful in
    developing country farm economies where much of the labor is supplied by family
    members with little or no pay. Another advantage of village-level equilibrium
    models is that they account for the utility gained from subsistence food grown
    in a village. These CGE models are anchored by a social accounting matrix that
    accounts for flows within and outside the economy. Moreover, it is common practice
    to fit the standard functional form such as a constant elasticity of substitution
    production, supply, or transformation function that is calibrated against exogenously
    estimated elasticities (Taylor and Adelman, 2006). CGE models have the disadvantage
    of being data and computationally intensive due to their more general specification,
    and for the quite restrictive assumptions required for their solution. Compared
    with more detailed partial equilibrium models, general equilibrium models are
    harder to incorporate detailed process models. 2.5.8. Integrated bio-economic
    models Flichman (2012) describes recent studies on application of models that
    combine bio-physical and economic models to represent agricultural systems. Flichman
    and Allen (2012) and van Wijk et al., 2009, van Wijk et al., 2014 also survey
    economic agricultural system models. They characterize bio-economic models into
    farm, landscape, regional, and national models. Systems in each of these scales
    include crops, livestock, and socioeconomics components that interact in complex
    ways. For example, Fig. 5 shows components that need to be included in system
    models at the farm scale. These components and processes encompass the crop and
    livestock production enterprises of a farm, the household decision and production
    processes, and the interactions among the household and production systems of
    the farm. Download : Download high-res image (250KB) Download : Download full-size

    system components and interactions that need to be included in models. Within
    these scales the cited authors address both static and dynamic specifications.
    In his introduction Flichman (2012) attributes growth of bio-economic modeling
    to two developments: improvement of biophysical agricultural simulation models,
    and evolution of agricultural policies that demand integrated assessments that
    conventional economic models cannot provide. We briefly address three prominent
    areas of application of integrated bio-economic models. i. Climate Change Impact
    Assessment Models. Economic modeling approaches on impact of climate change on
    agricultural systems have been addressed in very different ways. The first method
    links optimization models of agricultural production to climate models using agronomic
    models which map climate change variables into crop yields effects. An early example
    of this type of modeling on a national basis for the United States is by Adams
    et al. (1990); results from this type of model were widely used (e.g., IPCC, 1990,
    Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994). Since then, this same approach has been used in different
    types of optimization models over smaller geographic areas and driven by downscaled
    climate data. One advantage of using formal economic models to estimate impacts
    of climate change is that they can incorporate effects of both adaptation and
    mitigation that result from economically optimal adjustments to agricultural production
    under both changed growing conditions and a carbon tax. An alternative econometric
    approach to measuring the impact of climate change both on agricultural crop yields
    and on economic variables such as land values and economic returns is to estimate
    statistical models based on observed behavior. These statistical models are then
    simulated with data from future climate projections. A justification for this
    approach is that it can embed realistic adaptive behavior into the model (Mendelsohn
    et al., 1994). However, this type of model also has significant weaknesses. For
    example, it does not incorporate effects of CO2 fertilization on crop productivity,
    cannot represent changes in socio-economic conditions, and cannot be used to identify
    technological adaptations distinct from climate impacts. Various researchers have
    used statistical econometric methods to model the effects of climate on yields
    and other variables (Schlenker et al., 2013). ii. Hydro-Agricultural Economic
    System Models. There is a long history of modeling hydro-economics of agricultural
    systems, since irrigated agriculture is the largest user of water in many parts
    of the world. The tradition of integrating hydrology models with economic models
    stretches back 35 years since it was recognized early that the motivation for
    water use is strictly economic in agriculture, but that the equations associated
    with water use had to be modeled by physical hydrologic models. Accordingly, hydro-economic
    models were developed as coupled individual modeling systems. Two approaches are
    used. In the first one, economic models provide benefit-response functions, which
    are then embedded in a hydrologic policy model (e.g., the Calvin water allocation
    model, Jenkins et al., 2004). A second hydro-economic modeling approach is to
    characterize the response in the hydrologic models by statistically fitting a
    simplified function to results from complex simulations over a range of hydrologic
    and climatological parameters. These response functions can then be included in
    an economic policy model. This approach has often been used to analyze the optimal
    management of common property resources used in agriculture, such as groundwater
    (e.g., Knapp and Olson, 1996). A review of concepts and applications of hydro-economic
    models from an economic perspective can be found in Booker et al. (2012), while
    Harou et al. (2009) published a similar survey from a hydrologic perspective.
    iii. Integrated Economic Livestock Models. These models usually fall into one
    of two combinations; namely biological process models with an economic component,
    or an economic model with livestock equations and response functions. Several
    models in developing countries take into account household linkages and village-level
    interactions where there is some degree of subsistence consumption of livestock
    products, most commonly milk. Havlik et al. (2014) provides an overview of integrated
    livestock modeling and its use in mitigating climate change. Their analysis is
    driven by a large-scale economic optimization model that assesses crop bioenergy
    production, land-use changes, water requirements, and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Their results show that improvements in livestock production systems can significantly
    reduce impacts on fragile land use and improve the effectiveness of climate mitigation
    policies. In another approach, Kobayashi et al. (2007) analyzed stocking density
    impacts on Kazakhstan''s extensive rangelands using a stochastic dynamic programming
    model for multiple livestock systems with stochastic forage production. They showed
    that cost of capital strongly affects herd size and productivity. 2.6. Landscape/watershed;
    water and environmental quality There is a rich history of modeling watershed
    and environmental quality, however much of this has not incorporated goals related
    to agricultural systems and only a few efforts incorporate crop and livestock
    models. There are at least two different perspectives about modeling across space,
    including the interconnectedness of agricultural and ecological systems across
    the landscape. The first perspective is that human systems, including the farm,
    communities, and administrative and political areas in which agricultural systems
    interact through decisions and policies, affect production systems, markets, and
    trade. The other perspective is that the interconnectedness among hydrological
    and biophysical processes establishes the underlying behavior of agricultural
    systems over the landscape. This perspective leads to an emphasis on understanding
    physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur in watersheds. Both perspectives
    are important, yet agricultural models rarely consider both in the same assessments
    or models. There are many applications of watershed hydrology models, in particular
    using the SWAT model as discussed by Gassman et al. (2014), mainly focusing on
    environmental quality and water resource issues. Fig. 6 shows the regional integrated
    assessment approach developed by AgMIP that emphasizes linkages of agricultural
    systems across space using the first perspective noted above (A. farm household;
    B. heterogeneous farms in one or more communities across the landscape; C. farm
    population heterogeneity; and D. national/global scale). In this perspective,
    based in part on the impact assessment approach developed by Antle (2011), the
    focus is on the economic, environmental, and social impacts of alternative systems
    within heterogeneous household populations. However, this framework also illustrates
    the feedbacks from farms to agro-ecological regions to national and global scales.

    Fig. 6. The AgMIP Regional Integrated Assessment framework emphasizing linkages
    across scales and analysis of distributional impacts in heterogeneous populations
    of farm households (Antle et al., 2014). We often use the term “scaling up” of
    model results to refer to the aggregation of model results from finer spatial
    resolutions to a larger area. If the areas of interest are defined by hydrologists,
    they tend to be watersheds. In contrast, if the areas are defined by economists,
    they tend to be administrative and political units (e.g., urban areas, districts,
    countries) or socio-economic stratifications (e.g., small and large farms). These
    perspectives are not mutually exclusive, however. In fact, they lend themselves
    to include both human and biophysical/hydrological processes. A challenge for
    next generation agricultural models is to include the technical aspects of integrated
    modeling and a transdisciplinary approach in which scientists recognize the need
    for collaboration, not only on specific projects, but also in designing models
    and decision support tools to achieve their goals. Many current agricultural system
    models have been developed to evaluate practices and policies associated with
    environmental quality. Biophysical models (e.g., crop or nutrient models) typically
    operate at the point/field scales with an emphasis on vertical fluxes of energy,
    water, C, N and nutrients throughout the atmosphere, plant, and soil root-zone
    continuum. Upscaling from point to the landscape scale requires estimation of
    surface and subsurface fluxes and ecological transitions along the lateral scale.
    Coupling with landscape microclimate models provides not only the vertical inputs
    used by agricultural models, but also gradients (precipitation, temperature, wind,
    vapor pressure deficit) along the landscape. Coupling with hydrological models
    provides water flow paths such as surface runoff, vertical and lateral groundwater
    flow, and interactions between shallow soil and groundwater zones and with adjacent
    surface water bodies (channels, rivers, lakes and coastal waters). Water quality
    models provide sediment and solute transport along the landscape controlled by
    water flows, and other effects such as wind erosion. Integration and upscaling
    of landscapes into the watershed scale requires three-dimensional coupling of
    the surface and subsurface water, energy and mass transfers. Condon and Maxwell
    (2013) and Maxwell et al. (2014) provide more details on coupled versus integrated
    models. At this scale, the groundwater aquifer system typically transcends the
    boundaries of the watershed, necessitating regional scale analysis to evaluate
    not only the impacts of cropping and animal production systems on water quantity
    and quality, but also feedbacks from the hydrological system into the agricultural
    system (shallow water table effects and drought or low water availability for
    irrigation (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2006). Further, meso-scale rainfall and evapotranspiration
    distribution models control the local surface and subsurface flow intensities,
    pollution and abatement (Shrivastava et al., 2014). At this scale, human effects
    through land use changes, and ecological (vegetation, wildlife) dynamics and transitions
    on natural or protected lands (riparian zones, conservation areas, etc.) are also
    important components needed to evaluate overall sustainability of agricultural
    systems (Matson et al., 1997). Although some efforts have gone into integrating
    biophysical models (e.g., crop, hydrology, livestock, ecological, and economic),
    more is needed to enable comprehensive assessments of agricultural systems across
    scales and adequately address environmental and economic responses to decisions
    and policies. 2.7. Aggregate agricultural system models (district, country) The
    need to address decisions and policies at scales arises frequently in agricultural
    system modeling. Resolving the time and space scale differences among model components
    is often a major issue, particularly when component models are developed independently
    for different purposes. This problem arises, for example, when one attempts to
    create a model that combines crop and hydrology models, crop and economic models,
    or crop and climate models (Challinor et al., 2004, Osborne et al., 2007a, Elliott
    et al., 2014). There have also been efforts, starting in the early 2000s, in which
    dynamic models have been developed to provide forecasts over aggregated areas
    (e.g., to provide aggregate crop forecasts). Traditionally, climate model output
    for a grid cell is downscaled to produce weather data time series for points that
    are then fed into crop models. However, the land surface also influences climate;
    processes within the atmosphere and oceans, and on the land, are coupled and dynamically
    interact over space on timescales from fractions of seconds to thousands of years.
    Crops are a major component of the land surface of the globe, occupying about
    a quarter of all land area. Regional climate can be sensitive to large-scale changes
    in cropped areas that can result from changes in economic or climate conditions
    (Osborne et al., 2004). Therefore, another direction for agricultural impact assessments
    at a large-scale is to dynamically couple crop simulation with models of land
    and atmospheric processes. Five research groups have succeeded in coupling aggregate
    crop into climate models (Bondeau et al., 2007, Gervois et al., 2008, Kucharik,
    2003, Osborne et al., 2007b and Stehfest et al., 2007). Osborne et al., 2009 showed
    that, in some parts of the world, the impact of changes in cropped area on regional
    surface temperature can be of the same magnitude as regional human-induced climate
    change This result raises the question of whether or not new fully-coupled climate
    change impacts studies will revise our previous estimates of food security impacts.
    It is clear that the full coupling of crop simulations within global climate models
    is opening up new possibilities for studies of the impact of climate change on
    agricultural production – studies that capture some of the complex and important
    feedbacks within the Earth system at a large scale. Limitations in the skill of
    large-area modeling of crop production and yield is dominated by the density of
    data used in the simulation. More data should equate to better skill. However,
    the skill of large-scale modeling is determined by the smallest data set, whether
    this is the grid cell with the shortest run of observed yields, or the data grid
    with the largest resolution (climate, crop, soils or otherwise). We have seen
    recent increases in the resolution of climate input data and global grids of crop
    management and soil information. In this field of agricultural modeling, any future
    increase in data resolution should produce more skillful model simulations. 3.
    Current agricultural system models in context of selected use cases We next discuss
    the state of current agricultural system science relative to its capabilities
    and limitations in providing information to assist a wide range of decision makers
    represented by the five Use Cases. Each Use Case contains a set of interactions
    between systems and users in a particular environment in a systems analysis. The
    Use Cases are for developing and developed country settings, demonstrating a range
    of needs for widely different applications at different scales and levels of intensification.
    Antle et al., 2016a, Antle et al., 2016b indicated that these Use Cases need crop,
    livestock, and farming system models. The question that we address here is whether
    current agricultural system models, existing sources of data, and existing decision
    support systems (DSS) are adequate for providing information needed for these
    Use Cases. 3.1. Farm extension in Africa In this Use Case, the user is Sizani,
    an extension officer providing advice to a small farmer in Southern Africa, to
    help her and her family consistently produce more food and income. 3.1.1. Capabilities
    and limitations 3.1.1.1. Models Can existing crop, livestock, and farming system
    models, data, and ICT tools provide the information that Sizani needs to advise
    the small farmer? The short answer is “No”; there are currently no easily accessible
    and usable applications that would allow her to analyze the particular farmer''s
    situation. Or apps that can connect with models in the “cloud” to make runs needed
    for her to advise the farmer. Although there are models that partially meet her
    needs, and there are well documented examples of using models to develop insights
    on productivity enhancement strategies in the face of resource constraints and
    climate risk (e.g., Keating and McCown, 2001) they have not been integrated or
    are not packaged for use by this type of non-expert user. Models can, for example,
    simulate responses of crops to soil and weather conditions as well as water and
    nitrogen fertilizer input (Fig. 1) but do not generally simulate actual yield
    in production situations where, weeds, pests or diseases are not controlled. Two
    of the most serious limitations of many crop-soil models are their inabilities
    to accurately simulate soil infertility and their failure to represent losses
    associated with the wide range of pest, disease, and weed species that damage
    crops. In many intensive production systems, soil fertility, weeds, pests, and
    diseases are controlled so that responses in those situations can be represented
    by the costs of management inputs and the production responses to climate and
    water management. Typically, cropping system models simulate yields that are higher
    than actual yields in farmers'' fields, which are reduced due to poor management.
    In addition, fields are usually not homogeneous; for example, spacing between
    plants may vary considerably, whereas the models assume homogeneity. However,
    if pest and disease data are observed and available, these data can be input to
    some existing crop models to compute yield loss associated with specific pests
    and to diagnose the reasons for the gap between potential and actual yield (including
    the gap associated with water and some nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus;
    e.g., Boote et al., 1983, Naab et al., 2004, Naab et al., 2015). Keating and McCown
    (2001) have shown, however, that expert application of well adapted models can
    still lead to useful insights on many of the key constraints to productivity enhancement
    in small-holder situations. Generally, farming system models now in use have some
    capabilities needed to analyze this Use Case. However, most farming system models
    are not developed to be easily implemented by non-expert users nor for farms with
    characteristics different from those for which they were developed. An exception
    to this is the TOA-MD farming system model (Antle et al., 2014), although that
    model also needs reliable data from farm surveys to simulate a population of farms
    in contrast to a particular farm. 3.1.1.2. Input data It is impractical for Sizani
    to collect information on a particular farm, go back to her office and work with
    an analyst to evaluate options for the farmer. Instead, data are needed to describe
    a range of farming systems so that she could select the combination of biophysical,
    farming system, and household characteristics from available data. This would
    include information to allow her to tailor inputs to most closely match the conditions
    of specific farms. This includes climate, soil, management practice, labor and
    other inputs available for production and marketing of outputs, typical pest and
    disease pressures, availability and prices for farming inputs, and other farm,
    economic, and environmental information. Generally, sufficient data on the biophysical,
    environmental, and socio-economic conditions of each farm or for a range of farm
    typologies in the regions are not available. Although some data, such as climate
    and soil data, are available, generally these are not organized nor are they sufficiently
    site-specific that agricultural systems models can readily access them for analysis
    of specific farms. Although research has shown that some analyses needed to advise
    a farmer can be made, the availability of input data for agricultural systems
    models remains a major limitation. 3.1.1.3. Decision support tools Most existing
    DSS tools that are available in Apps are focused on relatively narrow issues (e.g.,
    see www.agroclimate.org), such as when to apply a fungicide to a particular crop,
    when to apply the next irrigation, or how much N fertilizer to apply to a particular
    crop that will be grown on a particular type of soil in a specific setting. There
    are few DSS tools that make use of more integrated models to help advisors advise
    farmers in making farming system decisions (but see Keating et al., 1991, Keating
    and McCown, 2001). We envision a DSS platform that will connect various models,
    databases, analysis, and information synthesis tools in an easy-to-use interface
    for Sizani to set up the analyses and outputs to answer questions about the management
    of that particular farms'' biophysical and socioeconomic situation and the uncertainties
    in those estimates. Such DSS platforms are possible, but not yet constructed.
    3.2. Developing and evaluating improved crop and livestock systems for sustainable
    intensification Deborah, a plant breeder who is developing drought- and heat-tolerant
    maize hybrids, would like to evaluate the potential adoption and impacts of new
    hybrids across widely varying conditions in Africa. She would like to evaluate
    the potential of new hybrids in complex mixed crop-livestock farming systems relative
    to sustainable intensification goals (improving productivity, taking into account
    long term impacts on soils, water and greenhouse gases). 3.2.1. Capabilities and
    limitations Models of maize and other crops, livestock, and the farm household
    are also needed for this Use Case. These models are available for at least partially
    performing this type of analysis. Starting in the 1980s, several groups began
    using crop simulation models to evaluate alternative management systems in developing
    countries (Keating et al., 2003a, Keating et al., 2003b, Uehara and Tsuji, 1998,
    Penning de Vries et al., 1991). Models used in those efforts were generally based
    on CERES and other crop models now in DSSAT and on the ORYZA rice model developed
    by IRRI. More recently, the Global Futures and Harvest Choice CGIAR research projects
    led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) have used crop
    and economic models to evaluate the potential benefits of developing new technologies,
    including new crop varieties (e.g., see Singh et al., 2012, Singh et al., 2013,
    Singh et al., 2014, Rosegrant et al., 2014). For example, Singh et al. (2012)
    used the DSSAT CROPGRO groundnut model with climate and soil inputs at six locations
    in India to evaluate different crop traits being targeted by CGIAR plant breeders.
    They found that the effect of combining various traits was beneficial, with estimated
    yield gains varying, depending on location and climate change conditions. Rapid
    advances in biotechnology and molecular plant breeding are helping researchers
    incorporate molecular markers and genes into models so that ultimately genetic
    composition of crops can be used to predict performance of future varieties to
    help target expensive and time consuming plant breeding efforts (e.g., White and
    Hoogenboom, 1996, Hoogenboom and White, 2003, Hammer et al., 2006, Messina et
    al., 2006). The paper by Hwang et al. (this issue) presents some concepts now
    being explored for next generation crop models. Similarly, considerable work has
    been done on farming system models to evaluate options for improving the livelihoods
    of farmers. These include farm simulation models (e.g., Baudron et al., 2014),
    optimization models that attempt to select the best combination of enterprises
    and their management to achieve one or multiple goals of the farmer (usually,
    maximizing profit, for example, or maximizing utility taking into account attitudes
    toward risk; e.g., see Nicholson et al., 1994, Herrero et al., 1999, Castelan-Ortega
    et al., 2003, Waithaka et al., 2006, Gonzalez-Estrada et al., 2008). Also, the
    Tradeoff Analysis (TOA) model (Antle, 2011, Antle et al., 2014) is currently being
    used as the basis for model-based impact assessments (Rosenzweig et al., 2013,
    AgMIP, 2014, Claessens et al., 2012). Furthermore, this approach can incorporate
    results from crop and livestock models, as well as environmental and social outcome
    models, and it can be adapted for smallholder or large commercial farming systems.
    However, there are important limitations in the capabilities of these models,
    similar to those mentions in Use Case 1 (e.g., yield limiting soil nutrients,
    soil physical constraints, and various pest, disease, weed, and other yield reducing
    factors in farmers'' fields not included in current models) Thus, there may be
    large yield gaps between actual yields in farmers'' fields and the potential productivity
    in those fields (e.g. Van Ittersum et al., 2013, Gustafson et al., 2014). When
    water, nitrogen, and climate are the major limitations in crop productivity, current
    models are highly useful, assuming that soil, weather, cultivar, and management
    input data are available for the analyses. In this Use Case, it is likely that
    other factors, including other soil nutrients, pests, diseases, and weeds, need
    to be taken into account. The challenge for next generation models includes not
    only modeling those factors but also collecting data that describe the production
    situation with all of the important yield-limiting and reducing factors. Another
    question is whether existing biophysical models can predict performance of the
    wide range of intensification options that may be used by farmers for this Use
    Case. Some practices would include increased fertilizer, use of disease-resistant
    varieties, agro-chemicals, modified tillage, increased plant population, soil
    additives, changing row geometries, and more precise timing and placement of fertilizers.
    They also could include water harvesting methods (in the field or on the farm),
    use of drip irrigation, and the use of mulches to reduce soil evaporation and
    erosion. Although some of these intensification options are widely used, most
    models do not include this wide range of potential management options. Furthermore,
    most biophysical models lack components that compute metrics needed to assess
    sustainable intensification. Livestock models also have various limitations that
    need to be addressed in NextGen tools. While our understanding of animal feed
    requirements is relatively robust, there are still large errors associated with
    the prediction of feed intake in ruminants, especially under degraded pasture
    conditions and negligible supplementation. Additionally, few of the models have
    the capabilities of predicting methane production, and this is becoming more important
    as assessments of environmental impacts of livestock gain prominence. Gathering
    more experimental information is needed for validation purposes, especially in
    the tropics. Another area that merits more work is understanding how climate change
    is likely to affect livestock systems. We still cannot model the animal and herd
    responses to increased temperatures, climate variability, and more severe feed
    fluctuations. Thus, we have limited ability in designing adaptation strategies
    in livestock systems. There are also few assessments of how feed quality and intake
    are likely to evolve as a result of climate change. The decision-making process
    of livestock farmers needs to be better incorporated in whole farm models, with
    better rules for governing behavioral changes as systems intensify. Livestock
    system models need to integrate both biophysical fluctuations in productivity
    and likely economic responses to these fluctuations in order to get an accurate
    measure of the impact on the well-being of families who rely on livestock for
    a substantial part of their income. The demand for livestock products is relatively
    inelastic, which works in both directions in that a given reduction in the price
    of meat does not lead to the same proportional increase in demand. Similarly,
    if there is a substantial increase in the quantity of meat offered for sale, prices
    will fall by a larger proportion than the quantities offered. The same phenomenon
    tends to occur in the demand and supply for inputs for livestock production, in
    particular those deriving from rangeland. The net effect of these price responses
    to quantity changes is to magnify effect of variations in the supply of livestock
    products, which can further penalize herdsmen in terms of loss of income and access
    to money to rebuild herds after drought or other drivers led to loss of herd size.
    There are also limitations in socioeconomic models used for evaluating benefits
    and tradeoffs among different technologies and management of crops and livestock
    and in managing the farm and its resources. For example, most available economic
    models simulate average responses and use simple economic-behavioral assumptions.
    In this Use Case, uncertainty and economic risks must be taken into account. Many
    economic models can incorporate risk behavior, but doing so adds substantial complexity
    and imposes high data requirements. 3.2.1.1. Data limitations Although some limitations
    are due to models themselves, a basic limitation is in the lack of data for developing,
    evaluating, and applying models for this Use Case. Although there are useful aggregate
    agricultural system data (e.g., http://www.nass.usda.gov/) in some countries,
    those data alone cannot be used to address Deborah''s question about sustainable
    intensification. Data collected by researchers who are studying options for sustainably
    intensified production systems are sometimes used to test and improve models for
    addressing intensification approaches. Limitations discussed in Use Case 1 (Section
    3.1) are also relevant here. In addition, there are various types of input data
    needs for livestock that are difficult to obtain, including species composition
    in rangelands, diet selection by animals, better spatial representation of feeding
    practices, adequate parameterization of feed quality parameters and how they change
    in space and time, improved production systems descriptions, and others. To address
    Deborah''s needs, input data are needed to characterize intensification technologies
    for use in the biophysical models as well as to characterize the fields, farm,
    landscape, hydrology, and ecological components. Some of these limitations are
    beginning to be addressed, in some countries, through systematic data collection
    efforts led by the World Bank in its program on designing and implementing Living
    Standards Measurement Surveys and making those data publicly available. 3.2.1.2.
    Decision support (DSS) tools Some progress has been made on information systems
    that allow one to compute sustainability metrics for specific farming practices.
    Much is being done by the private sector, and more public-private collaboration
    in defining and developing improved metrics of sustainability should be considered.
    However, little has been done to date to produce the types of decision information
    systems needed to help Deborah advise farmers on sustainable intensification options
    tailored for specific regions and farming systems. Additional information on limitations
    in DSS and related knowledge tools is given by Janssen et al. (this issue). 3.3.
    Investment in agricultural development to support sustainable intensification
    Stanley is an investment manager for a prominent Foundation, and he needs to evaluate
    a project for small farms in Kenya that will increase the intensity of production
    by increasing fertilizer use per hectare on cash crops while maintaining the current
    sustainable nutrient balance among pasture grasses, crop residues and animal manure.
    Economists have developed a benefit-cost analysis approach to evaluate research
    investments, in principle taking sustainability considerations into account. In
    this framework, private outcomes (e.g., farm income generated by producing and
    selling crops and livestock) are combined with the value of “non-market” outcomes,
    such as maintaining nutrient balances and avoiding environmental contamination,
    to determine the management strategy that yields the best outcome for farmers
    and society. In principle, if all policy options could be evaluated in this way,
    the best option could be identified. To implement this benefit-cost framework
    however, both quantities and values of marketed goods are needed (e.g., quantity
    and price of corn produced), as well as quantities and values of non-market outputs
    (e.g., nutrient concentration in surface water and the environmental or health
    damages caused by it). While it is straightforward to measure and value market
    outcomes, such as the amount and value of maize produced, it is difficult to quantify
    and value non-market outcomes such as changes in ecosystem services (e.g. water
    quality or greenhouse gas emissions). With adequate scientific understanding,
    spatially-relevant data and suitable measurement technologies, it is possible
    to objectively quantify the non-market outputs (e.g., to track and measure the
    nutrient concentrations and loadings in water). But in many cases valuing non-market
    outputs is exceedingly difficult. For example, contamination of water by nutrients
    such as nitrates may have adverse impacts on human health it may be possible to
    estimate the magnitude of these effects, but it is difficult to attach a monetary
    value to health effects that is accepted by the affected people and society. Similarly,
    ecosystem services such as biodiversity are difficult to quantify and value in
    monetary terms. For these reasons, strict application of the “benefit-cost analysis”
    approach to the design of science-based policies faces serious challenges. An
    alternative to benefit-cost analysis is “policy tradeoff analysis-TOA” (Crissman
    et al., 1998, Antle et al., 2014). Rather than attaching monetary values to ecosystem
    services, the TOA approach defines quantifiable economic, environmental and social
    “indicators” to assess the well-being of farm households as well as the broader
    environmental or social impacts of agricultural systems. Alternative investments
    or policies are evaluated in terms of the interactions among these indicators.
    In this approach, there is no one “solution” or best policy because different
    stakeholders may value tradeoffs between outcomes (indicators) differently. However,
    the TOA approach provides information for stakeholders to make these value judgments.
    3.3.1. Input data Statistically representative data are needed for both bio-physical
    and economic processes. Special purpose surveys can provide this kind of data,
    but are costly and time-consuming to generate for each investment decision that
    Stanley needs to make. As noted in the previous section, a system that combined
    farm-level decision support with data collection and aggregation would provide
    a potentially low-cost solution to this problem, and improve both farm-level decision
    making and the capability for broader investment and policy decision making as
    well (also see the discussion of these ideas for knowledge product developments
    in Antle et al., 2016a, Antle et al., 2016b). The feedback loop between the data
    sensing system and the crop and livestock models based on primary experimental
    data is an important and untested component for assessing the inevitable gap between
    experimental results and field implementation. In addition to the collection of
    farm management data from farm-level decision tools, remote sensing systems from
    satellites and/or drones could provide data for initializing and updating analysis
    of a project as it proceeds. 3.3.2. Decision Support Tools Tools suitable for
    research investment decision making and policy tradeoff analysis already are in
    use in some aspects of agricultural research planning and policy design, primarily
    in industrialized countries such as the United States and the European Union (see
    Antle et al., 2015a, Antle et al., 2015b for review of examples). Many types of
    indicators have been developed for policy analysis (Bates and Scarlett, 2013).
    Various measures of farm household well-being are used, such as farm income and
    its distribution among geographic regions and among different types of farms.
    Measures of environmental outcomes and ecosystem services are available from direct
    measurements and from models, including soil quality and productivity, air and
    water quantity and quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and wildlife habitat. For
    example, the US Department of Agriculture has constructed an “environmental benefits
    index” to assist in the design and implementation of the Conservation Reserve
    Program (CRP) and the Conservation Security Program (CSP) that combines a number
    of different environmental indicators into a summary measure. For analysis in
    a developing country context, the availability of analytical tools for tradeoff
    analysis is growing but still substantially limited by lack of adequate data and
    by the diversity and complexity of small-scale agricultural systems in many parts
    of the worlds. The integration of model components to address this type of decision
    problem is similar to those discussed in Section 5.2, but the analysis needs to
    be extended from the farm to the landscape or regional scale. This type of regional
    integrated modeling has been implemented in a number of studies, but in each case,
    a model was developed with data specific to that case (e.g., Stoorvogel et al.,
    2004, Antle 2008, Antle et al., 2014). These regional integrated assessment models
    pose a number of additional challenges beyond those described above. Two approaches
    have been developed by Antle et al. (2014) for this type of decision support.
    One is the “Tradeoff Analysis Model” which was designed to function as a stand-alone
    tool that could integrate specific crop simulation models, environmental process
    models, and econometric-process simulation models (Stoorvogel et al., 2004). However,
    the hurdles of data requirements and difficulties of tailoring this type of complex
    system integration tool to each application proved to be too high for its widespread
    use. A simpler, generic economic impact assessment approach was subsequently developed
    that is called the Tradeoff Analysis Model for Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment,
    or TOA-MD. This model is a generic framework for integrating data from a number
    of other models, along with economic data, to model the economic, environmental
    and social impacts of technology adoption. It is also being used by the AgMIP
    teams in Africa and South Asia to assess climate impacts (see chapters in Rosenzweig
    and Hillel, 2014). The AgMIP regional integrated assessment approach (see Section
    2.6) utilizes this model in combination with data from climate, crop and livestock
    models to provide analysis of climate impacts and adaptations. These analyses
    are then communicated to decision makers through various knowledge products, such
    as computer-based data visualization tools. Whether this type of regional integrated
    assessment modeling could be linked to mobile devices and other Apps remains a
    topic of current research (also see Antle et al., 2016b). 3.4. Management support
    for precision agriculture in the US for profitability, soil conservation, and
    water quality protection Greg is a farmer in the US, with a large corn/soybean-based
    operation and a high level of mechanization fully equipped with auto-tracking
    system and high-resolution differential GPS. He wants to manage his fields using
    precision management of input resources to increase efficiency and profits and
    to reduce environmental risks. 3.4.1. Capabilities and limitations Strategies
    to overcome spatial resolution in point-based crop models were first addressed
    by Basso et al. (2001) and Batchelor et al. (2002) and more recently in Albarenque
    et al. (2016) and Basso et al. (2016). Such strategies include running point-based
    models at small scales within a field; geospatial technologies (remote sensing,
    electrical resistivity tomography, yield mapping) to target the application of
    models to areas with similar plant responses; and linking point-based models to
    three-dimensional water flow models to better represent water transport across
    the landscape (Basso et al., 2001, Basso et al., 2011). The application of point-based
    models on small homogenous areas within a field has had limited success in the
    past due to difficulties in obtaining critical fine scale soil and management
    information (soil physical and chemical characteristics, including rooting depth,
    plant population and effective tile drain spacing) necessary to run the models.
    A current limitation in most crop models is the assumption of uniform plant distribution.
    Although multiple subfield areas could be simulated, this would require measurements
    of spatial variations in plant populations, which is usually not available. Visual
    observations as well as measurements commonly show that plants are not uniformly
    distributed within fields, and therefore assuming uniformity is unrealistic and
    a significant source of uncertainty in yield simulations (Ritchie and Basso, 2008,
    Basso and Ritchie, 2012). Recent advances on the resolution and availability of
    remote sensing imagery (satellite, airborne, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles – UAVs)
    coupled with a decrease in their associated costs, allow for the collection of
    timely information on soil and crop variability by examining spatial and temporal
    patterns of vegetation indices (Ehmke, 2013). Such information can be used to
    derive inputs for crop models in conjunction with yield mapping analysis to identify
    areas in the field that are stable over space and time. Crop models can be executed
    on those areas to provide insights on the reason of variability as well as estimates
    of potential economic return of variable-rate input prescriptions. Thus, the limitation
    of availability of spatially-variable data is being overcome through new sensors,
    communication technologies, and algorithms for producing spatial inputs for use
    in precision farming as well as statistical and model-based analyses. This is
    in stark contrast to limitations associated with Use Cases in data-poor regions
    as noted in Section 3.2. The assessment of spatial soil water availability is
    crucial for understanding the interaction of water stress and crop yield variability
    in agricultural fields, especially now with increased climate variability and
    extended drought periods. Spatial variation in soil water is often the cause of
    crop yield spatial variability due to its influence on the uniformity of the plant
    stand at emergence and in-season water stress. Soil water content is highly variable
    within a field due to spatial variation in rainfall, topography, soil properties,
    and vegetation. The ability to simulate spatial soil water content over time is
    important for models used for agricultural and hydrological systems assessment
    (i.e. nitrate and pesticide leaching to groundwater, erosion modeling, water logging,
    and Precision Agriculture applications). Process-based crop models have proven
    to be effective in simulating the water balance of soils when the drainage is
    assumed to be vertical. However, this assumption is incorrect in many fields.
    For instance, runoff computed by one-dimensional models is not distributed over
    space, and thus results in inaccurate predictions of surface soil water balance
    in neighboring areas within a field. The automation of terrain analysis and the
    use of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) have made it possible to quantify the topographic
    attributes of the landscape and to use topography as one of the major driving
    variables for many hydrological models (Western et al., 1999, Wilson and Gallant,
    2000). Basso et al. (2001) developed a spatial soil water balance model that simulates
    three-dimensional surface and subsurface water flow. The model requires a digital
    elevation model for partitioning the landscape into a series of interconnected
    irregular elements, daily weather data, and spatial soil information for the soil
    water balance simulation. These aspects are considered a serious limitation in
    crop models and despite their importance have hitherto received limited attention,
    thus warranting additional improvements and testing. An example that combines
    strategic and tactical application of a crop model in a spatial context is described
    by Basso et al. (2011). A dual-criteria optimization through a tested model could
    determine the nitrogen rate that minimizes nitrate leaching and increases net
    revenues for the farmer for three zones within the same field characterized by
    different yield potentials. 3.5. Supplying food products that meet corporate sustainability
    goals Jennifer, an economic analyst in a corporate sustainability group, embraces
    sustainability as the core of their mission: marketing food while conserving resources.
    She needs to help the corporation''s contract farmers with decisions regarding
    when to plant, when to irrigate and when and how much fertilizer to apply to conserve
    energy, save water, minimize waste and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in efforts
    to make these products more sustainable from farm to fork. An example of the application
    of crop models to illustrate how reduced N fertilizer rates result in reductions
    of greenhouse gas emissions (expressed in CO2 equivalents) at the field scale
    are described in Basso et al. (2013) who used the IPCC emission factor approach
    to model N2O emissions. Shcherbak et al. (2014) showed that IPCC emission factor
    approach, despite its simplistic approach, is able to closely reproduced measured
    data of N2O emissions. Also, two important aspects to consider in simulating the
    crop nitrogen uptake and soil nitrogen balance is the initialization of the soil
    carbon pool (Basso et al., 2011), and to run models in a continuous mode without
    annually reinitializing soil conditions like soil water and nitrogen content (Basso
    et al., 2015) in order to properly simulate soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics
    and their impacts on production and environmental outcomes. Models have also been
    used to evaluate the energy efficiency in agronomic management (i.e. tillage practices)
    as reported in Bertocco et al. (2008). The next generation of crop models with
    capability of using real time weather and historical climate conditions will be
    able to identify strategies to optimize the amount of fertilizer used at a particular
    location and time, soil and weather conditions with the goal of increasing yield
    and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Crop models can evaluate the effects of
    unknown weather conditions and help decide the optimal nitrogen to apply to crops
    using different amounts within the field using precision agriculture prescription
    maps. Communication companies have partnered with different high-tech companies
    to deliver solutions for the meteorological, geo-spatial and operational challenges
    facing the agriculture industry. Remote monitoring solutions, as an integral part
    of the Next-Gen model platform, along with advanced cloud services, will help
    farmers with decisions regarding when to plant, when to irrigate and when and
    how much N fertilizer to apply. Some of the large corporate supply chain companies
    have recently set a goal to improve fertilizer-application efficiency of U.S.
    row crop farmers in its food supply chain by 30% by 2020. System models can further
    help these companies by setting emission reduction protocols, benchmarks and baselines
    to compare emissions among different management strategies, and by incorporating
    sustainable agricultural criteria into their future plans validating mechanism,
    including certification to verify that the farmers are meeting sustainability
    criteria. There is a need to provide information on the total greenhouse gas,
    water and other footprints of food systems that are being considered to improve
    sustainability of future supply from field to fork (Roy et al., 2009). There are
    existing life cycle analysis (LCA) models that are being used for this purpose,
    but there are various challenges in providing robust LCA results for complex food
    systems (Notarnicola et al., 2016). Integration of LCA with biophysical and economic
    models would provide enable more comprehensive food system sustainability analyses.
    We are not aware of integrated models or knowledge systems that combine the power
    of agricultural system models with LCA analyses that would provide strategic foresight
    indicators of sustainability for use by the food corporation that Jennifer represents,
    although there have been studies that demonstrate this approach (e.g., Basso et
    al., 2013). 3.5.1. Input data and decision support tools Various farm-level data
    and decision tools are in use, and are evolving rapidly along with innovations
    in computer power, software, mobile information technologies and technologies
    for site-specific management (Antle et al., 2015a). A key feature of these tools
    is that they use both public (e.g., prices, weather forecast and policy information)
    and private (site- and farm-specific input use, farm size, machinery) data to
    generate detailed information and outcome-based data that are useful for farm-level
    management decisions. This information and data can be used to monitor the economic
    and environmental performance of a farm operation over time and space. The value
    of these data for improved farm management performance should motivate producers
    to collect accurate information. In addition, producers increasingly need detailed
    management data for purposes of quality certification, e.g., for organic or sustainable
    certification, or to meet regulatory standards. Various issues need to be addressed
    to advance the use of these tools for management, certification and related purposes.
    One issue is how to make data acquisition and analytical tools appropriate for
    and easy to use by farm-level decision makers (both farmers and organizations
    that provide management services). Another is how to facilitate the use of data
    and management tools through effective outreach programs that communicate the
    value of the tools and the importance of the data for private and public uses.
    The confidentiality, security and appropriate use of private data when it is shared
    is another critical issue. Privacy concerns have been the subject of recent discussions
    among farmers and commodity organizations as they explore the use of new technologies
    and big-data analytics. 4. Discussion This review of agricultural systems modeling
    shows that major contributions have been made by various disciplines, addressing
    different production systems from field to farms, landscapes, and beyond. There
    are good examples of component models from different disciplines being combined
    to produce more comprehensive system models that consider biophysical, socioeconomic,
    and environmental situations to produce a wide range of system responses. For
    example, crop, livestock, and economic models have been combined to study farming
    systems as well as to analyze national and global impacts of climate change, policies,
    or alternative technologies for different purposes. There is a wide range of approaches
    used in agricultural systems modeling and in the application of those models to
    scientific and policy questions. Approaches vary according to objectives of developers,
    their intended uses and data availability. Developers of agricultural systems
    models have made good use of theories and concepts from a wide range of disciplines,
    including agricultural and environmental sciences, ecology, engineering, physics,
    economics, and statistics. The development of agricultural system models continues
    to evolve through efforts of many organizations worldwide. Researchers are increasingly
    interested in contributing to agricultural systems science (e.g., new AgMIP developments,
    www.agmip.org, and various CGIAR–led programs like the Global Futures project
    (http://globalfutures.cgiar.org/) and the CCAFS project, https://ccafs.cgiar.org/).
    Interest in using agricultural system models by the private sector is also increasing.
    The Use Cases examined in this special issue demonstrate that a minimum set of
    component models are needed to develop useful agricultural system models. These
    component models include, in particular, crop models, livestock models, and farming
    system models. Crop models combine weather, soil, genetic, and management components
    to simulate yield, resource use, and outputs of nutrients and chemicals to surrounding
    water, air, and ecological systems, taking into account weed, pest and disease
    pressures. They integrate information to predict performance for a range of inputs
    and practices that apply from subsistence situations to those systems using highly
    controlled, intensive production technologies and modern varieties. Similarly,
    livestock models take into account climate, herd management, feed sources, and
    breeds. Farming system models integrate various livestock and cropping systems,
    including their interactions, with economic models that represent the behavior
    of farm decision makers. These models are needed at the level of the individual
    operation as well as at the population level so that the bio-physical and socio-economic
    heterogeneity of systems and their economic, environmental and social impacts
    can be evaluated by individual farmers as well as policy makers from farm to global
    scales. Based on this review, we conclude that different platforms for combining
    models and data for specific purposes are necessary, and that the design of next
    generation models and data should take into account this need for a range of platforms.
    The Use Cases studied included relevant examples across the spectrum of users
    from small-holder agricultural systems in developing countries to intensive production
    systems, and from systems supported by agricultural industries to those with little
    support from the private sector. They include examples that need models and associated
    data to evaluate technologies at a field or farm scale and others requiring the
    integration of component models to address socioeconomic, food security, and environmental
    issues at different scales. Although the adequacy of available models varied among
    Use Cases, one limitation was common across all of them, namely the scarcity of
    data. Data are the foundation for all agricultural systems analyses. This limitation
    restricts the capabilities of existing models to include factors of importance
    in most Use Cases, limiting researchers'' abilities to evaluate models across
    wide ranges of conditions (which limits user understanding of and confidence in
    the reliability of models) and limiting information that can be used as inputs
    to apply models (Boote et al., 2015, Kersebaum et al., 2014). Data limitations
    are more important than gaps in conceptual theories and approaches. We argue that
    limitations of current agricultural system models and tools are more strongly
    rooted in inadequate data than in knowledge gaps. This limitation restricts users''
    confidence in model abilities to provide reliable results and thus their use for
    decisions or policies. This lack of data is especially severe in less developed
    regions. This is true for production models of crops and animals as well as economic
    models across the Use Cases that addressed issues in data-poor areas in Sub Saharan
    Africa. But it is also clear that many data-rich regions also suffer from lack
    of accessible and usable data. For example, thousands of agricultural researchers
    conduct studies each year, comparing technologies and management under specific
    conditions. Even though those data could be highly useful for developing, evaluating,
    and using models, they are generally not available except to those involved in
    specific studies. There is perhaps one exception to the statement about a common
    limitation across Use Cases. The capabilities and limitations for management support
    for precision agriculture (Section 3.4) are different from the others. Although
    data that characterize spatial variability at a high resolution in individual
    fields has been limited, this situation is rapidly changing as new sensors and
    observation platforms (including those on drones and field-mounted platforms)
    are being developed by the private sector in response to clear business opportunities.
    This interest by the private sector is likely to rapidly increase the use of agricultural
    system models to help farmers like Greg (in our example) use precision farming
    to increase resource use efficiencies, reduce environmental risks, and increase
    profits. Although the same levels of data collection and precision application
    of inputs are not likely to be widely used in resource-poor farming situations,
    advances in technologies are likely to provide additional options in those regions.
    Current national and global initiatives are attempting to improve the overall
    data limitation situation. For example, the Global Open Data for Agriculture and
    Nutrition (GODAN) initiative is promoting global efforts to make agricultural
    and nutritionally relevant data available, accessible, and usable for unrestricted
    use worldwide (http://www.godan.info/). There are over 150 partners in this initiative
    from national governments, non-governmental, international and private sector
    organizations who support this effort. It is clear that there is a need for a
    more focused effort to connect the various agricultural systems modeling, database,
    data harmonization, open-access, and DSS efforts together, so that the scientific
    resources being invested in these different initiatives will contribute to compatible
    set of models, data, and platforms to ensure global public goods. This is critically
    important, considering that these tools are increasingly needed to ensure that
    agriculture will meet the food demands of the next 50 to 100 years and will be
    sustainable environmentally and economically. Efforts are underway to remedy this
    situation by a number of groups (e.g., Porter et al., 2014). Moreover, as detailed
    in Antle et al. (this issue), there is a need for strategies such as private-public
    partnerships to bring together the power of private sector investments with the
    ongoing research to advance models and modeling tools. This is true for production
    models of crops and animals as well as economic models across each of the first
    three Use Cases that address issues in data-poor areas in Sub Saharan Africa.
    Finally, based on the current status of models, data, and knowledge systems, a
    strategy should include the appropriate modification and in some cases re-programming
    of existing component models that already include many needed capabilities. This
    would facilitate extension of components that respond to factors that are not
    currently considered by models, using a range of methods including statistical
    models, reduced form models, extended databases, and modular models that integrate
    component submodules. Seavert et al. (2016) suggested that some data limitations
    could be overcome by integrating farm-level models and knowledge products with
    landscape-scale data and models. Recent experience in AgMIP demonstrated the value
    of multiple models indicating that it would not be useful to pursue a goal of
    producing perfect models for crops, livestock, and farming systems. Although there
    are excellent prospects for considerable advances in agricultural systems data,
    models, and knowledge systems, there are inherent limitations in these tools due
    to irreducible uncertainties in model structures, spatial variability of physical,
    chemical, genetic, and socioeconomic conditions. These limitations will continue
    to vary depending on applications, which suggest that future evaluation of capabilities
    and limitations should be based on well-defined Use Cases. This review indicates
    that the current state of agricultural systems models is sufficient for some contemporary
    applications, but that major advances are needed to achieve the next generation
    of data, models, and knowledge systems to address more complex issues and achieve
    food security during the next century. References Adams et al., 1990 R.M. Adams,

    • There is a growing interest in AI-technologies for sustainability. • Increased
    uses of these technologies could create new types of systemic risks. • We show
    a global uptake of AI-technologies in farming, forestry and marine management.
    • We explore gaps in principles and governance of AI from a sustainability perspective.
    Abstract Automated decision making and predictive analytics through artificial
    intelligence, in combination with rapid progress in technologies such as sensor
    technology and robotics are likely to change the way individuals, communities,
    governments and private actors perceive and respond to climate and ecological
    change. Methods based on various forms of artificial intelligence are already
    today being applied in a number of research fields related to climate change and
    environmental monitoring. Investments into applications of these technologies
    in agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also seem to be
    increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and deployment of AI-technologies
    in domains critical for sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks
    in depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies
    in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry
    and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks
    in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal
    access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs
    between efficiency and resilience. We explore these emerging risks, identify critical
    questions, and discuss the limitations of current governance mechanisms in addressing
    AI sustainability risks in these sectors. Previous article in issue Next article

    Introduction Technological change is a fundamental component of scientific and
    economic breakthroughs [1], and has the potential to dramatically influence global
    efforts toward sustainability [2,3]. As the pressure of human activities increasingly
    shapes the biosphere and the climate system, so does the hope that artificial
    intelligence (AI)1 and associated technologies such as robotics and the Internet
    of Things (IoT), will be able to increase societies’ capacities to detect, adapt
    and respond to climate and environmental change [[4], [5], [6]]. Numerous reports
    highlight how applications of AI and automation may help address climate change
    and biodiversity loss, contribute to more effective monitoring and uses of natural
    resources, and further progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) (e.g. Refs. [4,7,8]. While increased applications of AI and associated
    technologies could lead to more effective uses of land- and seascapes, augmented
    environmental monitoring capacities, and improved transparency in supply chains,
    it could also create new systemic sustainability risks as AI technologies diffuse
    into new social, economic, and ecological contexts. Some recent syntheses have
    discussed these risks briefly (e.g. Refs. [7,9,10], yet their potential allocative
    harms [11] and unexpected social and ecological effects [12] are poorly elaborated,
    and more often than not, overlooked. Prominent agenda-setting reports about the
    social impacts of AI, for example, either ignore sustainability dimensions altogether
    (e.g. Ref. [13], or underemphasize their possible social, economic and ecological
    risks (e.g. Refs. [6,[14], [16]]. In this article, we offer an overview and elaborate
    possible systemic risksfor sustainability2 created by the diffusion of AI and
    associated technologies. Systemic risks – i.e. risks that evolve from networked
    interactions in complex systems [17,18] – are of particular interest since the
    application of AI-technologies in combination with globalization processes, are
    likely to create novel connections between humans, machines and the living planet
    including ecosystems and the climate system. Such poorly understood human-nature-machine
    interactions increase the possibilities for disruptions that propagate through
    contagion in key sectors of society, such as food, energy and commodity production
    systems dependent on resilient ecosystems and associated ecosystem services [19].
    Here, we do not focus on known direct impacts such as the energy consumption or
    the carbon footprint of deep learning and data-mining [20], nor on opportunities
    for AI in helping address climate change [21,22]. Our focus is instead on complementing
    this literature by exploring networked risks that result from an increased connectivity
    between humans, machines and social-ecological systems. Our empirical analysis
    and discussion focus exclusively on early applications of AI and associated technologies
    in domains critical for what some have denoted biosphere-based sustainability
    [23]. That is, we focus on critical ecosystems such as agriculture and forestry
    along with the technical infrastructure underpinning resource management and extraction.
    These living systems are often overlooked in current analyses of the connection
    between AI and sustainability, despite their fundamental importance for the climate
    system and human development [24]. Here, we combine literature from seldom connected
    strands of research, with analysis of new data and ask: a) Where in the world,
    and into which sectors directly relevant for biosphere-based sustainability, is
    AI and associated technologies diffusing? b) Which systemic risks from a sustainability
    perspective could emerge as the result of this diffusion? c) To what extent do
    current notions and principles related to “responsible AI” acknowledge systemic
    risks related to sustainability? d) Which possible governance mechanisms could
    be developed to help mitigate these risks? Our ambition is not to conduct a systematic
    literature review, but to bring together previously disconnected research fields
    (i.e. studies of the wider social and economic implications of AI, research on
    systemic risk, and the sustainability sciences) to help guide future research,
    and inform current policy debates about the governance of AI and its potential
    to help accelerate climate action. We conclude by posing broadly formulated research
    questions as a way lay the foundation for multi- and transdisciplinary work across
    these diverse, and until now poorly connected strands of research. 2. The growing
    importance of artificial intelligence for sustainability AI-based technologies
    are gaining increased interest applied in a number of research fields related
    to the environmental, sustainability and climate sciences. Examples include AI
    applications in climate and Earth system modeling [25,26]; AI-augmented environmental
    monitoring [27]; autonomous underwater marine conservation interventions and data
    collection [28,29]; AI-supported tracking of illegal wildlife trade [30]; and
    “smart” urban planning for sustainable development [[31], [32], [33]]. The Royal
    Society in addition, has identified “digital twins” augmented through AI-analysis
    as key components of potentially planetary digital “control loops” for effective
    climate mitigation action, and more robust farming practices [22]. The ability
    of “digital twins” – that is, advanced digital replications of complex and evolving
    systems using “big” real-time data - has gained increased attention in the sustainability
    domain. Such tools allow its users to simulate, explore, optimize and help identify
    risks in various sectors related to sustainability ambitions, including in infrastructure
    development, and resource consuming systems of various forms (e.g. energy and
    water) in e.g. cities [[34], [35], [36]]. The potential for AI and associated
    technologies also seems to be driving a growing interest from the private sector.
    According to estimates, nearly 12 million IoT sensors will be installed and in
    use on farms around the world by the year 2023 [37]. Agricultural technology (agtech)
    investment reached a new record of $1.5 billion in 2017, and venture capital investment
    in the space has grown 80% annually since 2012 [38]. The precision forestry market
    could grow from USD 3.9 billion in 2019, to reach USD 6.1 billion by 2024 [39].
    With goals to improve urban livability and sustainability, planners could increasingly
    rely on AI for traffic management, smart policing, lighting control, facial recognition,
    and smart waste disposal systems [32,33]. The smart city market is expected to
    reach USD 460 billion by 2027 [40], smart city AI software alone is projected
    to total USD 5 billion annually by 2025 [41], and the market for robotics and
    autonomous systems in cities is expected to grow from 6.2 billion USD in 2018,
    to 17.7 billion USD in 2026 [33]. Applications of AI and other associated technologies
    for sustainability could be viewed as examples of technological “niche-innovations”
    capable of rapid upscaling and diffusion if followed by increased investments,
    enabling legal conditions, and growing public and consumer interest [42]. The
    COVID-19 pandemic seems to have triggered a growing interest from the private
    sector and governments to accelerate digitization and automation in supply chains
    and other parts of the economy [43,44]. The diffusion of AI-technologies unfolds
    not only through increased direct investments however, but also by the much less
    visible infusion of e.g. deep learning systems into existing technologies [45].
    These converging trends suggest that the development and deployment of AI and
    associated technologies are likely to not only have social and economic consequences,
    but will very likely impact climate, biodiversity, and ecosystems around the world
    [46]; Wynsberghe, 2021). Their diffusion hence merits increased attention from
    a sustainability perspective. Fig. 1 shows the geographical distribution of AI
    and associated technologies (here including applications of IoT, robotics and
    analysis supported by artificial intelligence) with a focus on companies and investments
    in sectors linked to the management of the living planet, i.e. land- and seascapes.

    forestry and agriculture. Total number of companies N = 1114. Fig. 1B. Geographical
    distribution of investments in companies listed in 1A. See Supplementary Information
    for details about methods and data. As the data shows, the agricultural sector
    seems to be the most prominent sector for the development and deployment of AI
    and associated technologies through digital farming/precision agriculture. This
    is not surprising considering the very strong push internationally towards increased
    production and reduced uses of scarce resources such as water through the application
    of new technologies and “digitalization” [[47], [48], [49]]. The differences in
    access to funding between different regions in the world is notable, and follows
    the same pattern as other studies of the “digital divide” [[50], [51], [52]].
    The prominent position of China in terms of investments (Fig. 1B) also seems to
    follow AI-investment patterns in general [53]; see also [54] for digital agriculture).
    3. Artificial intelligence, systemic risks and sustainability As we discussed
    in the previous section, there seems to be a growing interest, and increased investment
    in the development and deployment of AI and associated technologies in sectors
    critical for sustainability. The technologies’ effectiveness and broader social,
    economic, and ecological impacts however, unfold within a wider social, technological
    and environmental context [55] making their distributional consequences and sustainability
    risks difficult to predict with specificity [56]. In the following sections, we
    identify and explore four areas where the use of AI and associated technologies
    in the pursuit of sustainability goals could give rise to systemic risks. These
    risks could, if not managed proactively, unravel the progress and even decrease
    elements of sustainability. These are related to a) algorithmic bias and allocative
    harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions;
    and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience. We also identify a number
    of important research questions to help advance our understanding of sustainability
    risks created by AI and associated technologies. While not an exhaustive list
    of the potential systemic risks from AI technologies in this space, we view these
    as important starting points that should be addressed by academia and policy-makers
    alike. 3.1. Algorithmic bias and allocative harms The risks and impacts of possible
    algorithmic biases and their allocative harms (as defined by Ref. [11] has gained
    considerable attention in the last years. As has been shown in other domains such
    as policing and the health sector (e.g. Refs. [57,58], inconsistencies and biases
    in training data, security breaches leading to corrupted data capture and decision-making
    systems, and flawed AI-models can have detrimental impacts as AI-systems are applied.
    Growing volumes of environmental, social and ecological data are a fundamental
    prerequisite for the application of artificial intelligence in, for example, conservation
    and digital farming (e.g. Refs. [10,50]. Environmental and ecological data have
    well known limitations however, both in their temporal coverage, and geographical
    spread [[59], [60], [61]]. While the rapid growth of data from mobiles and satellites
    offer vast opportunities to map and respond to social vulnerabilities such as
    poverty and malnutrition, it has become increasingly clear that solutions supported
    by “big data” and AI-analysis can be strongly skewed since the “most disadvantaged
    people tend to be the least represented in new sources of digital data” [62].
    Algorithmic biases of this sort can have a number of sources [63], and may very
    well emerge in the sustainability domain in the following ways: Training data
    bias could emerge if AI-systems are designed with poor, limited, or biased data
    sets. For example, AI systems developed for precision agriculture in data poor
    contexts could - if not validated properly with local knowledge and expert opinion
    - result in incorrect management recommendations to small-scale farmers who would
    struggle to maintain high, stable yields [64]. Transfer context bias could emerge
    when AI-systems are designed for one ecological, climate, or social-ecological
    context, and then incorrectly transferred to another. While the training data
    and the resulting model may be developed and suitable for the initial social-ecological
    situation (say, a large industrial farm in a data rich context), using it in a
    different setting (e.g. a small farm) could lead to flawed and damaging results.
    Such bias may emerge, for example, as individuals and companies use off-the-shelf
    AI-software for their purposes [65]. The use of simpler forest monitoring and
    carbon sequestration models has already led to controversies partly due to their
    tentative transfer context bias [66]. The fact that ecosystems both on land and
    in the ocean are changing rapidly as the result of climate and ecological change
    [67] also pose serious challenges as AI-models, and lead to a type of concept
    drift [68]. AI-systems built on historical ecological conditions hence are likely
    to fail as the ecosystems on land- and seascapes shift surprisingly and at times
    irreversibly. This latter phenomenon is well-known in ecology as “regimes shifts”
    which may emerge without prior warning with large repercussions on ecosystems
    and those who depend on them [69,70]. Even if both the training data, and the
    context in which the algorithm is used is appropriate, their application can still
    lead to interpretation bias. In this type of bias, an AI-system might be working
    as intended by its designer, but the user does not fully understand its utility,
    or tries to infer different meaning that the system might not support. Developers
    of AI-support systems for digital agriculture, as an example, are still unable
    to convert complex geospatial information into appropriate crop management actions,
    resulting in misinterpretation and misuse of data. For example, many farmers utilize
    precision technology incorrectly to apply more (instead of less) nitrogen (N)
    fertilizer in the hope of increasing yields [49]. A contributing element to these
    bias types is a lack of appropriate data. Data gaps can partly be tackled using
    satellites, drones, mobile devices, sensors and social media, and can be combined
    with various AI-techniques to help overcome challenging scarce or incomplete data
    [31,71]. Increased data collection about systems and individuals result in their
    own challenges however. Urban sustainability scholars have already raised a number
    of issues related to AI and tentative threats to privacy, research ethical challenges,
    and the risk of building decisions on spurious correlations [72]. For example,
    location-tracking systems via smartphones and vehicles make it possible to not
    only extract data that is helpful for urban planning purposes, but can also allow
    for the triangulation of a person''s identity and other personal information,
    even with sparse data. This highlights the need to match data collection for sustainability
    goals with robust and transparent data management policies [31], and responsible
    innovation approaches [32]. Whether from inappropriate training data, unsuitable
    contexts, or user interpretation errors, algorithmic biases are common, and need
    to be thoughtfully considered in the sustainability domain. In the fields of agriculture,
    environment, and sustainability, such biases can result in for example, risks
    to critical elements of food security and ecosystem resilience. Key future questions:
    • To what extent are insights and risk management solutions about algorithmic
    biases from other domains applicable to sectors such as digital farming, digital
    forestry, urban planning and marine extraction and management? • How is the predictive
    potential and efficacy of AI-models affected by the fact that ecosystems such
    as land- and seascapes are changing rapidly due to e.g. climate change? • Which
    social, economic and ecological impacts may result from these biases, and how
    should these be prevented? 3.2. Unequal access, benefits, and impacts Resource
    constraints, and unequal access to information and communication technologies
    [51,52] create additional risks as AI-technologies start to diffuse into new sectors.
    The growing interest in digital, data-driven or precision farming is a good example
    of this. At present, smallholder farmers account for a considerable proportion
    of global food production [73], and especially in less wealthy countries, many
    people depend on small-scale family-farms to meet their nutritional needs [74].
    While applications of AI in combination with increased automation for farming
    have been suggested to contribute to increased yields and resource efficiency
    [47], the equitable distribution of such benefits cannot be taken for granted.
    Even non-AI technologies for intensifying agriculture are often deemed unaffordable
    by members of poor local communities [75]. In addition, there is a clear “digital
    divide” in data-driven farming with small-scale farmers facing serious obstacles
    to access big data and mobile technologies, which is likely to distribute the
    benefits of these technologies in unequal ways [76]. Similar concerns and uncertainties
    about the tentative loss of employment opportunities resulting from increased
    automation [77] are present in these sectors as well of course [78]. While it
    might seem premature to raise this as a possible risk, early studies indicate
    that the economic benefits of AI applications in farming appear to be greatest
    for larger farms that can spread their fixed costs over many acres, and that can
    reduce labor costs through automation [49]. As a result, critics have argued that
    the growing interest in “digital agriculture” by influential international actors
    such as the World Bank and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) overemphasize
    the need to increase aggregate food production for a growing population, while
    ignoring underlying well-known socio-political issues driving food insecurity
    such as poverty and social inequalities [49,79], and the detrimental impacts on
    technological development resulting from corporate concentration in the food sector
    [80]. Equal access to AI-technologies does not guarantee equal or fair outcomes
    however. Even if farmers are able to optimize their specific operations cost-effectively,
    widespread use of AI in farming may still result in concentration of capital and
    deepened inequality. As many traditional input and equipment providers are increasingly
    positioning themselves as data companies, this accumulated information might be
    put to use to extract rents, lock farmers into unfavorable contracts, or price
    discriminate across services [48,81]. There are also concerns about the impacts
    of automation replacing jobs in these sectors, especially as it could prove detrimental
    for vulnerable social groups such as migrant workers [38]. Small-scale fisheries
    and coastal communities (estimated to employ some 37 million people [82], and
    small-scale enterprises in the forestry sector (providing employment for an additional
    estimated 41 million people [82], may face similar challenges related to allocative
    harms, and unequal distribution of benefits as applications of AI-technologies
    make their progress into their domains [28,83]. Key future questions: • What are
    the possible distributional impacts that result from the increased adoption of
    AI-technologies and automation in farming, forestry and other sectors related
    to the extraction of natural capital? • Which legal, economic and/or governance
    mechanisms can help prevent such distributional risks, and support the deployment
    of AI that is of benefit to vulnerable groups in these sectors? 4. Shocks, cascading
    failures and attacks AI and associated technologies create numerous new complex
    interactions not only between humans and machines, and machines and machines [84],
    but also increasingly with machines and ecosystems, and with the Earth system
    as a whole [2,55]. The addition of AI and associated technologies into the worlds
    of agriculture and resource management could be seen as adding more nodes and
    connections to these already complex social-ecological and socio-technical systems.
    The growing interactions between humans, machines, and ecology could be viewed
    through the lens of complex adaptive systems [85]. Such systems may through the
    use of AI and associated technologies, contribute to the emergence of “distributed
    AI” (DAI) - decentralized systems with the ability to bring together information
    and agents across levels and domains, at the same time as they (partly) autonomously
    react, adapt and learn pro-actively to changing circumstances [86]. Applications
    of DAI for industrial purposes are well-known (e.g. Ref. [87], including in technical
    infrastructure such as energy systems [88,89]. These processes of decentralized
    adaptive problem-solving have also been observed for astonishingly complex yet
    resilient indigenous farming systems in Bali [90], and could as proposed by some,
    be augmented and automatized through the extensive use of AI and associated technologies
    to support artificially intelligent curation of wild places and nature (e.g. Ref.
    [91]. DAI could also, at best, help interpret and respond to the complex systems
    properties and the continuous changes that characterize farming, forestry and
    marine systems under rapid change due to human activities and climate change.
    However, increasingly nested and complex systems are also susceptible to unexpected
    shocks, and cascades that develop endogenously, also known as “normal accidents”
    [92]. This implies that internal failures can emerge unexpectedly and ripple and
    amplify across network links (e.g. a regional food supply chain) and create failures
    in the system as a whole (this issue is explored in more detail in the next section),
    especially if the components of the system are optimized and managed properly
    (say, a regional network of IoT-connected farms). Malicious external attacks can
    expose such endogenous vulnerabilities as well, and even the most advanced AI-systems
    based on deep neural networks are vulnerable to sabotage [93]. Connectivity and
    flows of information are prerequisites for the operation of AI-technologies in
    digital farming, forestry, and aquaculture, but also represent potentially serious
    weak points in the system''s security. For example, digital farming systems and
    applications of AI for “smart cities” rely on data transfer, sensor access to
    wireless and other communication networks, remote transmission and system actuation,
    typically in real time [94]. Each of these can be disrupted intentionally and
    thus affect the operation of e.g. semi-automated farming systems with both detrimental
    social and ecological impacts [95,96], some of which may involve serious data-breaches
    [97]. Box 1 elaborates this issue in more detail. Box 1 Cyberattacks in farming,
    food systems and ecosystem management Using sensors and other technologies to
    create increasingly accurate models of farms and ecosystems can produce valuable
    information for management and monitoring. “Virtual farms,” based on data from
    sensors, can be analyzed with AI algorithms for meaningful insights from management
    strategies to yield predictions [98]. These analyses require considerable amounts
    of computational power, which is rarely housed on the farm itself. Instead, valuable
    information is often transmitted, stored, and interpreted offsite using cloud
    storage and data analytics, and can be susceptible to data breaches at multiple
    stages [[95], [99]]. These risks have been raised the last years (e.g. Ref. [100],
    and became highly visible in June 2021 when ransomware cyberattacks forced the
    shutdown of numerous meat plants in the U.S. [101]. The data and algorithms used
    in digital agriculture are also vulnerable to more traditional security risks.
    As recently as November of 2019, for example, an ex-employee of Monsanto with
    plans to sell information to a foreign government was indicted for economic espionage
    after being caught at the airport with copies of a software technology known as
    the “Nutrient Optimizer” [102]. This predictive algorithm is a critical component
    of an online platform, which collects, stores, and visualizes farming data from
    the field to increase productivity. While these productivity increases are important
    to seek out, it is critical to remember that using complex, remote, and potentially
    insecure technological networks can make valuable agricultural information available
    to nefarious actors around the globe. In the wrong hands, this information could
    have significant economic consequences, and the systemic risks of cybersecurity
    need to be managed effectively. These endogenous and exogenous risks created by
    novel human-machine-ecological interactions have gained limited attention so far,
    despite a growing interest and investments in these technologies. Key future questions:
    • What cybersecurity risks could emerge in digital farming, forestry and other
    extractive sectors as AI-enhanced technologies gain prominence in these sectors?
    • What are the most important features of resilient infrastructures that would
    minimize the risks of cyberattacks and “normal accidents”, while also securing
    the integrity of production ecosystems such as agroecosystems? 5. AI, efficiency
    and resilience Technological advances play a key role as societies strive for
    increased control and productivity of ecosystems in both land- and seascapes as
    a means to secure human development [103]. The use of AI and associated technologies
    in farming and other forms of extraction of natural resources such as sea food
    and biomass may very well lead to increased efficiency and productivity, as often
    noted by prominent international organizations and think-tanks such as the World
    Bank [47]; Microsoft and Price Water House Cooper [16]; and the World Economic
    Forum [15]. Such efficiency gains could happen through data-driven temporal and
    site-specific farm management, reduced waste, and the use of autonomous seeding
    or weed control, just to mention a few [104]. While increased efficiency in resource
    use is not dangerous in and of itself, and may well be desirable for engineered
    systems like energy and traffic systems, there are several potential downsides
    for living systems such as agricultural landscapes, forests, and marine ecosystems.
    The key issue is that optimizing system performance to maximize efficient generation
    of a small set of goods (say, a particular crop), often undermines overall system
    functioning and resilience over the long term [105]. As these systems become increasingly
    optimized and efficient, they also become more brittle and vulnerable to undesirable
    so-called “regime shifts”, which are characterized by abrupt, unwanted, and sometimes
    irreversible changes in a given ecosystem [70]. Thus, for example, industrial
    agricultural landscapes around the world now generate high yields of a few crop
    species, but have led to declines in many other ecosystem services also valued
    by societies, including biodiversity, scenic beauty, and climate or flood regulation
    [106]. Biodiversity in particular provides many functions directly relevant for
    the sustainable production of food, fuel and fiber, such as the decomposition
    of organic matter, pest control or pollination. Even when key species are maintained,
    declines in the diversity of crop and wild species reduce the resilience of ecosystems
    making them increasingly vulnerable to shocks such as a drought, or a newly introduced
    pest [19]. Applications of AI and increased automation – including AI-systems
    that prioritize efficiency over redundancy and diversity - could accelerate such
    loss of resilience. Since the economic benefits of automation and associated applications
    of AI and automation seem to be the greatest for larger farms [50], investments
    in these technologies could create strong incentives for both larger and more
    simplified agricultural landscapes [49], despite evidence that smaller farms tend
    to be most productive and biodiverse over longer time periods [107]. The latter
    have proven to be key for the food security of communities in the most fragile
    regions of the world [108]. In addition, local farming strategies, as well as
    social and ecological knowledge are often developed over generations. These contain
    numerous social, cultural and even spiritual practices, some of which have proven
    key to support the resilience of communities and the ecosystems they manage in
    the face of changing social and environmental circumstances [109,110]. Such tacit
    sources of knowledge and are not easily captured by data-driven approaches [111].
    Simplification of ecosystems such as agricultural and forest landscapes has been
    suggested to affect social relationships among people, with the possible loss
    of local knowledge, which could lead to accelerated loss of ecosystems [112,113].
    These processes could undermine the foreseen benefits created by the use of AI-technologies.
    The economic and technological logic of AI and their associated technologies could
    hence be in conflict with the logic of resilient ecosystems. Assessing whether
    AI-applications lead to additional simplification empirically however, will be
    challenging as changes in land-use and forest cover are driven by a number of
    factors, many of which are not related directly to technology [114]. Key future
    questions: • Does the increased adoption of AI and associated technologies lead
    to additional simplification, which may lead to a loss of resilience, of living
    systems such as agricultural landscapes and forest ecosystems? • How are local
    strategies and ecological knowledge likely to be affected by an increased deployment
    of AI-technologies such as predictive analytics and automation? • How can AI and
    associated technologies be developed and deployed in ways that prioritize resilience
    over efficiency and simplification? 6. “Responsible AI”, sustainability and governance
    As we have discussed in previous sections, the development and deployment of AI
    and increased automation entail both opportunities for sustainability, but also
    numerous poorly explored systemic risks as humans, machines and ecosystems interact
    in new ways. Some of these risks could potentially be ameliorated through the
    application of principles defining “ethical AI”, “responsible AI” or “AI for Good”
    that have emerged in the last years [115,116], especially those that address fairness,
    non-discrimination, accountability, transparency, privacy and security. Principles-based
    guidelines have thus become the dominant approach to governing AI systems. However,
    such principles have at least historically consistently overlooked climate, sustainability
    and environmental dimensions. Owe and Baum [117] for example, argue that AI ethics
    in general, have failed to give serious moral consideration to “nonhumans”, i.e.
    nonhuman animals and the environment. Fig. 2 summarizes our analysis of 186 publicly
    available documents exploring principles for the benevolent use of AI (see Supplementary
    Information for details about methodology). The data builds on strategic searches
    of keywords in the documents to assess the frequency of mentions of key dimensions
    of “responsible AI”, and sustainability respectively. We realize that this is
    a rough and imperfect metric, but can still be used as an indication of the strong
    emphasis on social rather than environmental sustainability dimensions of current
    discussions on “responsible” or “ethical AI”. Download : Download high-res image

    of key words found in published “responsible AI” principles. Selected keywords
    are related to core ethical principles (gray columns), compared to key words related
    to sustainability (green columns). Number of documents analyzed N = 186, see Supplementary
    Information for details about methods. (For interpretation of the references to
    colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
    article.) Many of the principles related to algorithmic bias and transparency
    are nevertheless applicable for some of the sustainability risks identified in
    previous sections. If effectively implemented, these principles could help mitigate
    the risks of algorithmic biases such as transfer context bias, by incentivizing
    companies and governments to make sure AI-systems in e.g. forestry are explainable
    and adaptive to changing climate conditions. Some of these principles have come
    to even include environmental and sustainability dimensions, such as the High-Level
    Expert Group on AI (HLEG) and their recommendation that “AI systems should be
    sustainable and benefit all human beings, including future generations” [44].
    The fact that climate and environmental risks and costs tend to systematically
    be externalized and challenging to quantify [118], may very well undermine the
    economic and legal incentives of AI-developers and users to implement such principles
    in practice if they are associated with costs. Critics of the current principles-based
    approach to AI governance have emphasized a number of limits to operationalizing
    fairness, the practical limits of providing algorithmic explainability or transparency,
    and the lack of professional accountability mechanisms needed to ensure their
    consistent implementation [[119], [120], [121]]. We suggest that issues of environmental
    sustainability pose distinctive challenges in what Weernart denotes “high-stake
    settings” (Weernart, 2021) for both people and nature, thus warranting dedicated
    attention and further refinement of existing AI principles-based governance frameworks,
    as well as more precise guidelines for how to implement and continuously monitor
    their performance. These mechanisms could, at least in principle, evolve through
    sectors-specific guidelines, product and process standards, or through new or
    amended legal-regulatory frameworks. Sector-specific guidelines, for example,
    are emerging in areas such as medical technology and digital manufacturing, but
    there have been relatively few guidelines for areas related to sustainability.
    International organizations and the EU have expressed a commitment to responsible
    and trustworthy AI in the context of sustainable development through, for example,
    the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act [122]. These commitments however, are
    related to principles of non-discrimination, diversity, and inclusivity, rather
    than on responding to the specific dynamics between AI-based technologies and
    environmental sustainability. For example, climate change and sustainability are
    only mentioned in passing in the Act, with “environmental sustainability” being
    suggested as one possible and voluntary “additional requirement” by those developing
    AI systems (see p. 36, paragraph 81 in the Artificial Intelligence Act). Standards-making
    organizations have also looked at ways to translate ethical principles into product
    and process standards that ensure the responsible development, deployment, and
    monitoring of AI systems. Recent examples include: ISO/IEC TR 24028:2020 ‘Trustworthiness
    in Artificial Intelligence’; the IEEE ‘Ethics Certification Program for Autonomous
    and Intelligent Systems’; ISO/IEC 24028 ‘Bias in AI systems and AI aided decision-making’;
    or BS 8611:2016 ‘Robots and robotic devices: Guide to the ethical design and application
    of robots and robotic systems.’ Again, these initiatives focus mostly on organizational
    governance mechanisms and procedural guidance for managing known social AI risks
    – such as lack of transparency and accountability – rather than broader systemic
    considerations linked to the impact of these technologies on sustainability. In
    addition, these organizational procedures and considerations need to be further
    incorporated in emerging sectoral standards for smart farming, agricultural electronics
    or greenhouse gas management standards, such as ISO/TC207 - Environmental Standards
    or ISO/TC23 - Tractors and machinery for agriculture and forestry. Thus, systemic
    risk considerations pertaining to the complex dynamics between AI technologies,
    ecological and environmental safety, supply chain resilience and their wider distributional
    consequences for sustainability are rarely featured in current standards packages.
    As AI and associated technologies continue to develop, proposals for their regulation
    have increased in recent years as well. These include either amendments to existing
    legal-regulatory frameworks in data protection, safety and/or cybersecurity, new
    regulations to protect consumers against algorithmic bias and provide transparency
    and accountability, or increased oversight powers for existing or new regulatory
    agencies [123], including independent audits of AI-systems [119]. Until now however,
    these regulatory proposals focus largely on individual risks (e.g. product safety
    regulations protecting the consumer), as opposed to systemic risks [124] that
    characterize the complex human-machine-ecological systems described here. In addition,
    ‘safety’ is consistently viewed from the perspective of individuals rather than
    from a wider environmental sustainability perspective (e.g. Ref. [119]. This creates
    a problematic governance gap that should be addressed. The lack of adoption, enforcement,
    and commitment to govern systemic sustainability risks created by AI becomes particularly
    problematic in the climate and environmental domain where strong regulatory and
    enforcement capacities cannot be taken for granted. Even though a few industrialized
    countries see some reductions in e.g. climate emissions [125], neither the capacities
    of international institutions nor of national governments have been able to address
    the continued erosion of ecosystems, biodiversity and other critical natural capital
    [126]. Existing legal frameworks and governance mechanisms in the environmental
    and sustainability domain hence cannot be assumed to compensate for the lack of
    robust and responsible governance of AI systems and technologies. Key future questions:
    1. How can existing principles of “responsible AI” and similar, be leveraged to
    also advance sustainability ambitions? 2. What governance mechanisms could support
    synergies between environmental and technological regulation in ways that minimizes
    systemic sustainability risks? 3. How can such mechanisms be developed in ways
    that are adaptive to both technological and environmental change, including climate
    disruptions and surprises, at the same time? 7. Conclusion Artificial intelligence,
    digitization and automation seem to be gaining traction in sectors of fundamental
    importance for sustainability. The driving forces behind the diffusion of these
    technologies are the result of both technological advancements, and societal and
    environmental pressures. On the technological side, leaps forward in predictive
    analysis through various forms of AI-methods, IoT-systems, satellite technologies,
    increasing computational capacity, and new developments in robotics industries,
    have paved the way for new approaches to efficiency, productivity, and decision
    making under uncertainty. Secondly, demands from society to better manage scarce
    natural resources and understand the scope and impacts of rapid climate and environmental
    change have also spurred research and development in this promising field. As
    we have discussed here, however, this progress could (and should) be matched with
    a growing recognition of not only opportunities, but also possible systemic risks
    for sustainability. Our analysis shows that the most rapid development of AI and
    associated technologies in the sustainability domain, seem to be unfolding in
    farming, with substantial investments in these technologies in China and the United
    States in particular. As we discuss, such diffusion could lead to new types of
    systemic risks resulting from various forms of algorithmic biases, distributional
    effects, and tentative networked vulnerabilities. These risks can partly be addressed
    through a growing number of principles and standards that govern the deployment
    of AI, but need to be complemented with governance mechanisms that are able to
    integrate sustainability dimensions explicitly. Many of the risks discussed here
    are tentative, and difficult to quantify with precision. System risks that evolve
    out of complexity and poorly understood system interactions between humans, machine,
    and ecology are particularly challenging. In addition, the fact that both the
    development and use of these technologies are nascent makes it difficult to assess
    to what extent the risks identified are intrinsic to AI and associated technologies
    themselves, or the result of “pacing problems” [127] created by novel uses of
    AI-technologies in new social and environmental contexts. Our limited predictive
    abilities as these AI-risks diffuse into the sustainability domain requires what
    Shannon Valor calls “technomoral humility” [128], but also to strike a balance
    between stringent and adaptive modes of governance. We suggest that governing
    AI risks for sustainability due to the limited predictability created by systemic
    risks that emerge through human-nature-machine interactions are likely to require
    hybrid and highly adaptive approaches [129]. These need to be developed with the
    capacity to respond to changes in the climate system, ecological systems, and
    advances in AI-technologies at the same time. Such governance approaches should
    in similar ways, as for other challenges characterized by complexity, bring together
    governmental and private actors, as well as self-regulatory and mandatory regulatory
    interventions to secure polycentric and flexible responses. Investors, governments
    and the private sector should take these issues seriously as AI-augmented technologies
    are increasingly being promoted as a key solution to a turbulent climate future.
    Future discussions about how to best govern these technologies from a sustainability
    perspective need to acknowledge the complex features of ecosystems, their fundamental
    importance for human development, and the pressures they face under accelerating
    climate change. One key issue is the possible negative distributional implications
    of increased applications of AI-technologies on social groups that depend directly
    on the resources and services provided by these ecosystems on land- and seascapes.
    Hopefully this article can contribute to future discussions about how to better
    understand and govern AI risks for sustainability. Acknowledgement We would like

    we use the term “artificial intelligence/AI” to refer to technologies that employ
    machine learning (ML) including “deep learning” (DL) methods (see Ref. [13]. We
    write “AI and associated technologies” in cases where AI is an integrated part
    of a technology, such as a “smart tractor” or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles that employ
    computer vision. Hence our main interest in this paper is in the social and ecological
    impacts of AI and associated technologies, rather than the underlying ML or DL
    technique per se. 2 By risk, we refer to the possibility of harm, commonly quantified
    as the product of the probability and severity of the harm [130]. By ‘sustainability’
    we refer specifically to the importance of the biosphere and a stable Earth system
    for ongoing human development and prosperity [23,131]. © 2021 The Author(s). Published

    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\

    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n2 of 21\nthat by 2050, global food production will have\
    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\

    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\

    \ of ﬁeld, keep a\nhistory of growing crops in the ﬁeld (e.g., planting,\nfertilizing,\
    \ harvesting, warehouses, gas station), and\ntrack the location of objects in\
    \ the ﬁeld (e.g., soil\nsampling for agrochemical laboratory) by eFarmer\nApplication.\n\

    \ it\nmay be used to its full potential. It determines the\noptimal fertilizer\
    \ mixture created to cover the\nneeded nutrient suspension and considers the\n\
    demands of diverse yields. In addition, it considers\nthe cost of fertilizer based\
    \ on current market pricing.\n2.5. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting and Harvesting\n\
    The AWS IoT platform has been proposed for crop prediction using temperature and\n\
    rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring\
    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\
    Table 2. IoT-based sensors in smart agriculture used to increase production.\n\
    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\

    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\
    \ suspension using IoT records. Routine sensor inspections\nof all Internet of\
    \ Things appliances are a maintenance issue while it may be certainly\nharmed\
    \ in the farm area. The mobility problem is related to 4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan,\
    \ LoRa\nnetwork connection, which link sensors spread across a broad region in\
    \ the farm areas.\nSome infrastructural trials are developing and implementing\
    \ Internet of Things-connected\narchitectures that incorporate innovative technologies,\
    \ such as cloud and fog computing\nand network virtualization. Finally, the primary\
    \ issue in advancing smart agriculture based\non IoT is not physical maintenance\
    \ but rather ensuring security and privacy [8].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n12 of\
    \ 21\nThe UAVs that are linked wirelessly are subject to cyber-physical or harmful\
    \ assaults\nto fool the control signals due to open communication lines. Such\
    \ attempts represent a\nsigniﬁcant risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle system\
    \ in terms of private information\ncrash or theft, as well as mission failure.\
    \ Moreover, the faking of control signals may harm\nthe UAV mission and make it\
    \ harder to restore it. As a result, improving UAV wireless\ncommunication’s safety\
    \ and conﬁdentiality element, which necessitates in-depth research\nof security\
    \ concerns covering the entire network protocol layers [40], is an important\n\
    open subject.\nVisual harvesting of robots’ dynamic tracking of objects with great\
    \ precision remains\nan unresolved challenge. Further study should also aim to\
    \ enhance the precision placement\nand operation by merging smart behavior judgment,\
    \ adequate fault tolerance, robot vision\nwith artiﬁcial intelligence technology\
    \ for accurate placement, and function enhancement.\nThe recognition and location\
    \ accuracy are impacted when the crop situation is varied due\nto the lighting\
    \ and unconstrained circumstances of the ﬁeld ecosystem. A robot vision\napproach\
    \ would be efﬁcient in harvesting crops correctly to increase the success rate\
    \ of\nrobotic harvesting in such settings. The researchers used geometric features,\
    \ novel image\nalgorithms, and intelligent decision theory to address the challenges.\
    \ However, because\nmassive datasets are necessary to train efﬁcient deep learning\
    \ algorithms, further study\nis needed [33]. Table 3 presents a comparison of\
    \ the current state of the art on smart\nagriculture obstacles and beneﬁts.\n\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\
    \ The recommended\nmethod’s better performance in terms of a 97.8% accuracy, 97.6%\
    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\
    \ 4 compares the efﬁciency of several smart agricultural techniques.\nAgronomy\

    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\

    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\
    \ speciﬁcally research involving the wireless\nsensor network and Internet of\
    \ Things along with research involving machine learning and\nInternet of Things\
    \ [41,51].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n16 of 21\nFigure 5. Research contribution\
    \ using IoT, WSN, and machine learning.\nImperfect network access, lack of a (or\
    \ no) power supply, and high framework costs\ncompared to an ordinary farmer’s\
    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\
    \ apple\nleaves comprising apple marssonina and alternaria leaf blotch, leaf spot,\
    \ frogeye, rot, cedar,\nand powdery mildew, ﬁre blight, and scab-labeled images.\n\
    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\
    \ brown\nrot, bitter rot, or scab [54]. An Internet of Things-based cost-effective\
    \ monitoring system\nwas developed to address particular crop irrigation, soil\
    \ erosion, and irregular irrigation.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n17 of 21\nThe suggested\
    \ method entails building a distributed WSN (wireless sensor network), with\n\
    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\
    \ random forest regression\nhas a decent accuracy of 81.6%. However, due to harsh\
    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\
    \ state of the art techniques.\nWater monitoring is the most highly measured IoT\

    \ communication technologies and sensors based on\nIoT is necessary to increase\
    \ agricultural productivity. Wireless sensors, unmanned aerial\nvehicles, and\
    \ cloud computing have been shown to be practical tools for guaranteeing\nlong-term\
    \ agricultural productivity. Many processes throughout the production cycle,\n\
    including irrigation, soil sample and mapping, fertilizer or pest control, yield\
    \ monitoring,\nforecasting, and harvesting, may be automated using smart devices,\
    \ allowing for improved\ncrop quality and growth capacity. The key effective features,\
    \ important applications, IoT-\nbased smart agriculture technology and equipment,\
    \ and open barriers and possibilities\nwere all examined in this study. This research\
    \ will be expanded in the future to include\nsecurity and privacy issues in smart\
    \ agriculture using IoT methods.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed\

    Intelligence (AI) have been employed in agriculture over a long \nperiod of time,\
    \ alongside other advanced computing technologies. \nHowever, increased attention\
    \ is currently being paid to the use of \nsuch smart technologies. Agriculture\
    \ has provided an important \nsource of food for human beings over many thousands\
    \ of years, \nincluding the development of appropriate farming methods for \n\
    different types of crops. The emergence of new advanced IoT \ntechnologies has\
    \ the potential to monitor the agricultural \nenvironment to ensure high-quality\
    \ products. However, there \nremains a lack of research and development in relation\
    \ to Smart \nSustainable Agriculture (SSA), accompanied by complex \nobstacles\
    \ arising from the fragmentation of agricultural \nprocesses, i.e. the control\
    \ and operation of IoT/AI machines; data \nsharing and management; interoperability;\
    \ and large amounts of \ndata analysis and storage. This study firstly, explores\
    \ existing \nIoT/AI technologies adopted for SSA and secondly, identifies \nIoT/AI\
    \ technical architecture capable of underpinning the \ndevelopment of SSA platforms.\
    \ As well as contributing to the \ncurrent body of knowledge, this research reviews\
    \ research and \ndevelopment within SSA and provides an IoT/AI architecture to\

    \ Smart Sustainable \nAgriculture solutions \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nAgriculture\
    \ forms a critical activity vital to the survival of \nhumanity for approximately\
    \ many thousands of years [1].This \nrelationship has resulted in the advancement\
    \ of agricultural \nactivities, initially through the time-consuming methods of\
    \ \ntraditional agriculture [2]. The current recent rapid increase in \nin the\
    \ global population (predicted to rise to 8.9 billion by \n2050) has now led to\
    \ an urgent need to balance demand and \nsupply through the use of new technologies\
    \ [3] to increase food \nproduction [4, 5]. This development places pressure on\
    \ natural \nresources, with agriculture now consuming 70% of the world‟s \nfresh\
    \ water supply for the purposes of irrigation. Limited \nresources and the impact\
    \ of climate change will therefore lead \nto considerable challenges in producing\
    \ sufficient high quality \nfood to support the population [6]. Smart Agricultural\
    \ is a \nglobal initiative to preserve resources and maintain sustainable \nagriculture\
    \ [7]. Recently, researchers have adopted the Internet \nof Things (IoT) [8, 9],\
    \ with a number of studies emphasizing \nthe adoption and implementation of IoT\
    \ in agriculture, \nfarming, and irrigation [10]. Around the globe, many private\
    \ \ncompanies and organizations are now focusing on investigating \nnew technologies\
    \ to create a smarter agriculture environment. \nThese include mechanical and\
    \ economic aspects, engineering, \nfood retailers and computing. However, agricultural\
    \ processes \nare fragmented, resulting in a number of issues, i.e. difficulties\
    \ \nin operating and managing smart machines, data sharing and \nmanagement, data\
    \ analysis and storage [11, 12]. It is therefore \nimportant to facilitate cooperation\
    \ when developing standards \nfor smart agriculture, while also enhancing interoperability\
    \ \namong different stakeholders, systems and technologies [13]. \nThe use of\
    \ IoT and AI technologies has the potential to \nresult in a positive transformation\
    \ of traditional agriculture [3], \nincluding: (a) improved use of data collected\
    \ from smart \nagriculture sensors; (b) managing and governing the internal \n\
    processes within the smart agriculture environment (including \nthe management\
    \ of the harvesting and storage of crops); (c) \nwaste reduction and cost saving;\
    \ (d) increasing business \nefficiency by means of automating traditional processes;\
    \ and \n(e) improving the quality and volume of products [14]. A major \nchallenge\
    \ is to provide farmers with the required information in \na rapid manner [15].\
    \ AI therefore has significant potential to \naddress the urgent challenges faced\
    \ by traditional agriculture. \nThere has, over previous decades, been considerable\
    \ research \nand application of AI, including in: (a) smart agriculture; (b) \n\
    robotics; (c) agricultural optimization management; (d) \nautomation; (e) agricultural\
    \ expert systems; (f) agricultural \nknowledge-based systems; and (g) decision\
    \ support systems \n[16]. \nThere remains a lack of research and development in\
    \ \nrelation to Smart Sustainable Agriculture (SSA), accompanied \nby complex\
    \ obstacles arising from the fragmentation of \nagricultural processes, i.e. the\
    \ control and operation of IoT/AI \nmachines; data sharing and management; interoperability;\
    \ and \nlarge amounts of generated data analysis and storage. \nTherefore, this\
    \ study firstly, explores existing IoT/AI \ntechnologies adopted for SSA and secondly,\
    \ establishes an \nIoT/AI technical architecture to underpin SSA platforms, in\
    \ \norder to tackle fragmentation in traditional agriculture \nprocesses and enrich\
    \ the research and development of future \nsmart agriculture worldwide via establishment\
    \ of a Smart, \nSustainable Agriculture platform as a solution. \nThere now follows\
    \ an outline of the methodology \nunderpinning this research, supported by related\
    \ work \nhighlighting the history of smart agriculture, smart and \nadvanced computing\
    \ technologies and examples of IoT/AI \ntechnologies in current agricultural practices.\

    \ \nby an in-depth discussion of Smart Agriculture and IoT/AI \nSSA technical\
    \ architecture, along with the most significant \noutcomes from this study. The\
    \ paper finishes with concluding \nremarks and plans for future work. \nII. BACKGROUND\
    \ \nDue to the lack of literature concerning the development of \nIoT frameworks\
    \ for SSA, this study focuses on: (a) the history \nof smart agriculture, its\
    \ potential and challenges; (b) smart and \nadvanced computing technologies; and\
    \ (c) existing smart, \nsustainable agricultural frameworks. \nA. Smart Sustainable\
    \ Agriculture \nThere has recently been considerable research into SSA, \nemploying\
    \ various different terms, including Precision \nFarming, Smart Irrigation and\
    \ Smart Greenhouse. This paper \ncommences with an examination of these concepts\
    \ to \ndetermine the definition of SSA used in this study. \nPrecision Farming\
    \ refers to a method of managing farms \nand conserving resources through the\
    \ use of IoT and \nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT). It \nobtains\
    \ real-time data concerning the condition of farm \nelements, (i.e. crops, soil\
    \ and air) to protect the environment \nwhile ensuring profits and sustainability\
    \ [15]. Smart Irrigation \nis a method of improving the efficiency of irrigation\
    \ processes \nand reducing water losses, while conserving existing water \nresources\
    \ using IoT-based smart irrigation systems [16]. \nDrones are employed in many\
    \ agricultural applications, \nincluding monitoring field crops and livestock,\
    \ and scanning \nlarge areas, while sensors on the ground collect a huge range\
    \ of \ninformation [13]. Smart greenhouses promote the cultivation of \ncrops\
    \ with the least degree of human intervention possible, \nthrough use of continuously\
    \ monitored climatic conditions (i.e. \nhumidity, \ntemperature, luminosity \n\
    and \nsoil \nmoisture), \ntriggering automated actions based on the evaluated\
    \ changes \nand implementing corrective action to maintain the most \nbeneficial\
    \ conditions for growth [17]. \nFarm Management Systems (FMS) can assist farmers\
    \ with \na variety of collected information, by managing and controlling \nvarious\
    \ \ntracking \ndevices \nand \nsensors. \nThe \ncollected \ninformation is analysed\
    \ for the undertaking of complex \ndecision-making tasks before being placed in\
    \ a storage \nmedium. This enables the use of the most effective agricultural\
    \ \ndata analysis practices [18]. Soil Monitoring Systems help to \ntrack and\
    \ improve the quality of soil through the monitoring of \nits physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological properties. Livestock \nmonitoring systems provide real-time\
    \ assessment of the \nproductivity, health and welfare of livestock, to promote\
    \ the \nhealth of animals [19]. The IoT/AI SSA platform Cloud offers \nreal-time\
    \ information to farmers to facilitate decision-making \nand reduce operational\
    \ costs, while at the same time enhancing \nproductivity. Following a review of\
    \ a considerable amount of \nresearch, we define SSA as the utilization process\
    \ of IoT/AI \ntechnologies to establish, monitor, manage, process and \nanalyse\
    \ data generated from various agricultural resources, \nsuch as field, crops,\
    \ livestock and others to ensure the \nsustainability and quality of agricultural\
    \ products and further \nenrich decision-making taken by stakeholders. \nB. Smart\
    \ and Advanced Computing Technologies \nThis section provides an overview of appropriate\
    \ \ntechnologies \nunderpinning \nthe \ndevelopment \nof \nsmart, \nsustainable\
    \ agriculture platforms, including: IoT; Big Data \nAnalytics (BDA); Cloud Computing\
    \ (CC); Mobile Computing \n(MC); and Artificial Intelligence (AI): \n1) Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT): IoT is a technology aimed at \nconnecting all intelligent objects\
    \ within a single network, i.e. \nthe Internet. It involves all kinds of computer\
    \ technologies, \nboth (a) hardware (i.e. intelligent boards and sensors) and\
    \ \n(b) software (i.e. advanced operating systems and AI \nalgorithms). Its primary\
    \ target is the establishment of \napplications for devices, in order to enable\
    \ the monitoring and \ncontrol of a specific domain. It has been widely adopted\
    \ in \nmany areas, i.e. industrial business processes; home machines; \nhealth\
    \ applications; and smart homes and cities. IoT \nconnectivity encompasses people,\
    \ machines, tools and \nlocations, aiming to achieve different intelligent functions\
    \ from \ndata sharing and information exchange [17]. However, it is \nprimarily\
    \ used in agriculture for management of agricultural \nproducts \nwithin \ngathered\
    \ \nreal-time \ndata, \nalongside: \n(1) searching; (2) tracking; (3) monitoring;\
    \ (4) control; (5) \nmanaging; (6) evaluating; and (7) operations within a supply\
    \ \nchain [1, 9]. \n2) Big Data Analytics (BDA): BDA refers to the large \nvolume\
    \ of data gathered from different datasets sources over a \nlong period of time,\
    \ i.e. sensor, Internet and business data. The \ndatasets used in this technology\
    \ surpass the computational and \nanalytical capabilities of typical software\
    \ applications and \nstandard database infrastructure. Its primary task is to\
    \ capture, \nstore, analyze and search for data, as well as seeking to identify\
    \ \nconcealed patterns in the gathered data. Thus, BDA involved \nthe utilization\
    \ of: (a) tools, (i.e. classification and clustering); \n(b) techniques, (i.e.\
    \ data mining, machine learning and \nstatistical analysis); and (c) technologies\
    \ (i.e. Hadoop and \nspark). These go beyond traditional data analytical approaches,\
    \ \nbeing employed to extract beneficial knowledge from a \nconsiderable amount\
    \ of data, in order to facilitate timely and \naccurate decision–making [17].\
    \ However, the use of BDA in \nagriculture focusses on management of the supply\
    \ chain of \nagricultural products, in order to enhance decision-making and \n\
    minimize the cost of production cost. It is also employed for \nthe analysis of\
    \ the properties of different types of soil for \nclassification and further enhancement.\
    \ Furthermore, it is \nuseful for the improved prediction and production of crops.\
    \ \n3) Cloud Computing (CC): CC has is a recent and rapidly \ngrowing phenomenon\
    \ within IT [18]. The Cloud is not \nrestricted to a particular business domain,\
    \ but has been \nimplemented to underpin and support various software \napplications\
    \ and platforms [19]. It offers easy access to the \nCloud provider‟s high-performance\
    \ and storage infrastructure \nover the Internet, with one of its main benefits\
    \ being to conceal \nfrom users the complexity of IT infrastructure management\
    \ \n[20] [21]. NIST [22] defined CC as “a model for enabling \nconvenient, on-demand\
    \ network access to a shared pool of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n95 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nconfigurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers,\
    \ \nstorage, applications and services) that can be rapidly \nprovisioned and\
    \ released with minimal management effort or \nservice provider interaction”.\
    \ The Cloud can be seen as high \nvirtualization method for datacenter infrastructure\
    \ distributed \nover a wide geographical area, linked by means of high \nbandwidth\
    \ network cables providing a variety of virtualized \nservices. These include\
    \ entire infrastructures, as well as small \nsoftware applications and different\
    \ types of services, i.e. high-\nperformance computing and large scalable storage\
    \ services \nbased on a pay-per-use model. CC can be divided into four \nmain\
    \ layers: (1) hardware; (2) infrastructure; (3) platform; and \n(4) application\
    \ [23]. The delivery of Cloud services can \ngenerally be divided into three different\
    \ models: (1) \nInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS); (2) Platform-as-a-Service\
    \ \n(PaaS); and (3) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) [24, 25]. CC is \nconsidered\
    \ the most effective method of storing agricultural \ndata, along with IoT [1].\
    \ \n4) Mobile Computing (MC): MC refers to infrastructure in \nwhich data processing\
    \ and data storage take place externally to \nthe mobile device [26]. MC applications\
    \ transfer computing \npower, processing and data storage from mobile devices\
    \ in the \nCloud [27, 28]. MC has had a considerable impact on modern \ndaily\
    \ life, due to the availability and low cost of purchasing and \ncommunication.\
    \ It is now widely used in every field, including \nthe agricultural sector [29],\
    \ in which MC systems collect and \nsend daily data to farmers, informing them\
    \ of both the \nproduction status and weather conditions [29]. It is crucial to\
    \ \nuse automatic Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) efficient \ntraceability\
    \ systems to store and access data on electronic data \nchips in a more rapid\
    \ and accurate manner. It has been \nprimarily applied to the logistics of industrial\
    \ products, for the \npurposes of identification and to check delivery processes\
    \ [30]. \n5) Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI has been employed in \nsmart systems\
    \ over a long period of time[31], being the science \nof creating intelligent\
    \ machines to facilitate everyday life [32]. \nAI covers many areas, including\
    \ computer vision, data mining, \ndeep learning, image processing and neural networks\
    \ [16, 33]. \nAI technologies are now emerging to assist and improve \nefficiency\
    \ and tackle many of the challenges facing the \nagricultural industry, including\
    \ soil health, crop yield and \nherbicide-resistance. According to Sennaar [34],\
    \ agricultural \nAI Cloud applications fall into three main categories, as \n\
    discussed below. \na) Robots: these are developed and programmed to \nhandle fundamental\
    \ agricultural tasks (i.e. harvesting crops) \nmore rapidly and with a higher\
    \ capacity than human workers. \nExamples of robotic applications include: (a)\
    \ See and Spray \n(i.e. a weed control robot) and (b) Harvest CROO (i.e. a crop\
    \ \nharvesting robot). Agricultural robots have the potential to \nbecome valuable\
    \ AI applications, i.e. milking robots. \nb) Monitoring Crop and Soil: this employs\
    \ computer \nvision and deep-learning algorithms for processing captured \ndata\
    \ by sensors monitoring crop and soil health, i.e. the PEAT \nmachine for diagnosing\
    \ pests and soil defects, based on deep \nlearning application known as Plantix\
    \ that identifies potential \ndefects and nutrient deficiencies in the soil. A\
    \ further example \nis Trace Genomics, a machine learning based service for \n\
    diagnosing soil defects and providing soil analysis services to \nfarmers. This\
    \ uses machine learning to provide farmers with a \nsense of both the strengths\
    \ and weaknesses of their soil, with \nthe emphasis being on the prevention of\
    \ poor crops and \noptimizing the potential for healthy crop production. A \n\
    SkySquirrel technology is an example of the use of drones and \ncomputer vision\
    \ for crop analysis. \nc) Predictive Analytics: This analysis captured data, \n\
    based on machine learning models capable of tracking and \npredicting various\
    \ environmental impacts on crop harvest, i.e. \nchanges in weather. Examples of\
    \ such AI technologies include \n(a) aWhere (i.e. prediction of weather and crop\
    \ sustainability) \nand (b) Farmshots (i.e. monitoring of crop health and \nsustainability).\
    \ Crop and soil monitoring technologies are \nimportant applications for addressing\
    \ issues related to climate \nchange. IoT/AI technologies (such as drone and satellite)\
    \ that \ngenerate a large amount of data on a daily basis have the \npotential\
    \ to enable agricultural production to forecast changes \nand detect opportunities.\
    \ It is predicted that, over the coming \nyears, IoT and AI applications will\
    \ attract a considerable \ndegree of interest from large industrial agricultural\
    \ enterprises \n[34]. \nThe benefits and advantages of the agricultural use of\
    \ IoT \nare as follows: (a) efficiency of input; (b) cost reduction; \n(c) profitability;\
    \ (d) sustainability; (e) food safety and \nenvironmental protection [35]. However,\
    \ Ferrández-Pastor, et \nal. [36] considered SSA to contain a number of barriers\
    \ \npotentially hindering its adoption: (a) initial expectations and \nadvantages\
    \ remaining unfulfilled; (b) complexity of technology \nand incompatibility of\
    \ components; (c) a lack of products; and \n(d) the high cost involved in the\
    \ establishment and \nmaintenance of such facilities. To ensure the adoption and\
    \ \nimprovement of smart technologies in the agriculture sector, it \nis vital\
    \ for farmers to be trained and given up-to-date \nknowledge of IoT/AI technologies.\
    \ Furthermore, it is crucial to \ntest and validate IoT/AI applications, due to\
    \ the high risk \ninvolved in the adoption of these technologies in a critical\
    \ \nsector, along with the influence of environmental factors. \nC. Examples of\
    \ IoT/AI Technologies in Current Agriculture \nPractices \nThere are many types\
    \ of IoT and AI sensors and \napplications in current agricultural studies and\
    \ development. \nTable 1 provides an overview of the most commonly employed \n\
    IoT/AI platforms/technologies found in smart agriculture. \nD. Examples of an\
    \ Existing AI/IoT Research in Smart \nAgriculture \nThere are a number of specific\
    \ challenges that need to be \nconsidered before investing in smart agriculture,\
    \ primarily \nthose falling into the following categories: (1) hardware; \n(2)\
    \ data analysis; (3) maintenance; (4) mobility; and \n(5) infrastructure [56].\
    \ Nonetheless, there are many research \nefforts in the field of IoT/AI to support\
    \ the creation and \nestablishment of SSA, as shown in Table 2. \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ \nTABLE II. \nIOT/AI RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SMART SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE\
    \ \nResearcher/s \nYear \nSummary \nRay [57] \n2017 \nThe researchers undertook\
    \ a review of various potential IoT applications, including the specific issues\
    \ and challenges associated \nwith IoT deployment to improve farming. They comprehensively\
    \ analyzed the specific requirements the devices and wireless \ncommunication\
    \ technologies associated with agricultural IoT applications. They presented different\
    \ case studies to explore existing \nIoT based solutions operated by various organizations\
    \ and individuals, followed by categorizing them based on their deployment \n\
    parameters. Furthermore, they identified a number of factors for the improvement\
    \ and future road map of work using IoT. \nMekala and \nViswanathan [58] \n2017\
    \ \nThe researchers surveyed a number of conventional applications of Agricultural\
    \ IoT Sensor Monitoring Network technologies \nutilizing CC. Their study aimed\
    \ at understanding the diverse technologies to build smart, sustainable agriculture.\
    \ They addressed a \nsimple IoT agriculture model with a wireless network. \n\
    Kamilaris, et al. \n[59] \n2017 \nThe researchers reviewed work in agriculture\
    \ employing the practice of big data analysis to solve various different problems.\
    \ \nTheir review emphasized the opportunities provided by big data analysis for\
    \ the development of smarter agriculture, the availability of \nhardware and software,\
    \ as well as the techniques and methods for big data analysis. \nRajeswari, et\
    \ al. \n[29] \n2017 \nThe researchers investigated a number of different features,\
    \ i.e. humidity, temperature sensing, server-based remote monitoring \nsystem\
    \ detection and soil moisture sensing. They used sensor networks to measure temperature,\
    \ moisture and humidity in place of \nmanual checking. They deployed several sensors\
    \ in different locations within farms, using a single controller. Their major\
    \ objective \nwas to collect real-time data of the agriculture production environment\
    \ to establish an easy access agricultural advice, in order to \nidentify weather\
    \ or crops patterns. \nAntonacci, et al. \n[5] \n2018 \nThe researchers attempted\
    \ to provide nanotechnology-based (bio) sensors to support farmers in delivering\
    \ an analysis that is \naccurate, fast, cost-effective, and useful in the field\
    \ to identify water and soil nutrients/pesticides, soil humidity, and plant pathogens.\
    \ \nCadavid, et al. \n[60] \n2018 \nThe researchers proposed an extension to a\
    \ popular open-source IoT platform, known as „Thingsboard‟. This formed the core\
    \ of a \nCloud-based Smart Farming platform and deliberate sensors, a decision\
    \ support system, and a configuration of remotely autonomous \nand controlled\
    \ machines (e.g. water dispensers, rovers or drones). \nSoto-Romero, et \nal.\
    \ [61] \n2019 \nThe researchers designed an easily insertable cylindrical sensor\
    \ with internal electronics to offer a low power electronic \narchitecture to\
    \ measure and communicate wirelessly with a LoRa, Sigfox network or mobile phones.\
    \ \nNóbrega, et al. \n[62] \n2019 \nThe researchers reviewed the proposed stack\
    \ and details of the recent developments within smart agriculture, focusing on\
    \ \nIoT/Machine-2-Machine interaction. They described the design and deployment\
    \ of a gateway addressing the requirements of the \nSheepIT service, evaluating\
    \ this gateway using real scenarios in terms of performance, thus demonstrating\
    \ its feasibility and \nscalability. \nIII. METHODOLOGY \nAs well as undertaking\
    \ the literature review, the current \nresearcher enhanced this study by informally\
    \ interviewing \nexperienced farmers. The study aims to establish an IoT/AI \n\
    SSA architecture, as well as exploring the potential of the use \nof IoT and AI\
    \ as a backbone to establish an SSA platform. A \nreview was employed to identify,\
    \ analyze and study key books, \njournals, reports, and white papers, in order\
    \ to achieve the \nabove-noted aim. The lack of existing studies in this area\
    \ \nensures that this current research also contributes to the body of \nknowledge\
    \ by establishing an IoT/AI framework for the \nadoption of smart technologies,\
    \ in order to establish smart \nsustainable \nagricultural \npractices. \nFig.\
    \ \n1 \nshows \nthe \nmethodology adopted for this study. \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\
    \ \nBased on the research aim outlined in the Methodology, \nthis section is divided\
    \ into (A) Domains of Smart Sustainable \nagricultural model; (B) B. Proposed\
    \ IOT/AI SSA platform as a \nsolution; and (C) Proposed IoT/AI technical architecture\
    \ for \nSSA platform. \nA. Domains of Smart Sustainable Agricultural Model \n\
    The results from the literature review revealed that several \ndomains need to\
    \ be considered when adopting the smart \nagricultural model. Fig. 2 demonstrates\
    \ the interrelation and \ncomplexity of data flow between different Smart, Sustainable\
    \ \nAgriculture domains. \n \nFig. 1. IoT/SSA Research Methodology. \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\

    \ Data Flow and Interrelation of SSA Domains. \nThese domains are discussed individually,\
    \ as follows: \n Human resources: This refers to people, policies and \npractices\
    \ within the agricultural environment, which are \nas important as in any other\
    \ domain, as are weather and \ntechnology. Human resources receive careful attention,\
    \ \ndue to their significant impact on production, as well as \nfinancial and\
    \ marketing decisions. Whatever its size, an \nagricultural concern requires effective\
    \ human resources \nmanagement and planning, including hiring and \nkeeping employees\
    \ who are engaged, high-performing \nand effective communicators. Providing up-to-date\
    \ \nknowledge potentially opens the means to adopt smart \ntechnologies in an\
    \ agricultural environment. \n Crops: This refers to a plant that can be grown\
    \ and \nharvested extensively for subsistence or profit: (1) food \ncrops (i.e.\
    \ for human consumption); (2) feed crops (i.e. \nfor livestock consumption); (3)\
    \ fibre crops (i.e. for \ncordage and textiles); and (4) oil crops (i.e. for \n\
    consumption or industrial uses). \n Weather: This plays a major role in determining\
    \ the \nsuccess of agricultural processes. Most field crops and \nlivestock are\
    \ solely dependent on climactic conditions \nto provide life-sustaining water\
    \ and energy. Adverse \nweather can cause losses in agricultural products, \n\
    particularly during critical stages of growth. The \nelements of weather (solar\
    \ radiation, temperature, \nprecipitation, humidity and wind) influence the \n\
    physiology and production of agricultural plants and \nanimals. Severe weather\
    \ (i.e. tornadoes, drought, \nflooding, hail and wind storms) can cause considerable\
    \ \ndamage and destruction to fields and livestock. \n Soil: This forms a critical\
    \ aspect of successful \nagriculture, being the source of nutrients used to grow\
    \ \ncrops, which are subsequently passed into plants and \nthen to humans and\
    \ animals. Healthy soils produce \nhealthy and rich food supplies; however the\
    \ health of \nsoil tends to decline over time, forcing farmers to move \nto new\
    \ fields. Soil health depends on regional \nconditions and climates, with soil\
    \ nutrients more likely \nto deteriorate in dry climates, particularly if irrigated,\
    \ \nwhich, if not managed carefully, can result in \nsalinization, i.e. a build-up\
    \ in the level of salts and \nchemicals contained in water. Healthy and rich soil\
    \ can \nbe achieved through the use of IoT sensors to monitor \nits chemical status,\
    \ using specific sensors (e.g. moisture \nsensors), whose data readings are transferred\
    \ to the data \nmanagement and analysis layer for analysis, assisting \ndecisions\
    \ concerning the need for fertilizer. \n Pests: These consist of any living creature\
    \ that is \ninvasive, or damaging to crops, livestock or human \nstructures. Pests\
    \ often occur in high quantities, to the \ndetriment of agricultural products.\
    \ It is vital to control \nand monitor these creatures by means of IoT/AI \ntechnologies,\
    \ to avoid serious diseases, including \nplague and malaria, as well as plant\
    \ and livestock \ndiseases. \n Fertilization: Soils naturally contain many nutrients,\
    \ \ni.e. nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium and potassium. \nCrops are unable to function\
    \ effectively and produce \nhigh quality food when their nutrient level is low.\
    \ The \nnatural levels of nutrients in the soil need to be \nenhanced by the addition\
    \ of nutrients once crops have \nbeen harvested. Fertilizers have been used since\
    \ the \nbeginning of agriculture, but it is now recognized that \ntheir extensive\
    \ use can, if not correctly controlled, harm \nthe environment. Therefore, farmers\
    \ use IoT sensors to \nread and test soil samples for baseline testing to enable\
    \ \nthem to add fertilizers using correct and appropriate \nmeasurements. Fertilization\
    \ is an important method of \nmaintaining \nsustainable \nagricultural \nproduction\
    \ \nsystems. \n Agricultural Products: These are derived from \ncultivating crops\
    \ or livestock to sustain or enhance \nhuman life. Human beings also use a wide\
    \ collection of \nagricultural products on a daily basis, i.e. food and \nclothing.\
    \ Agricultural products fall into the following \ngroups: (a) grains; (b) foods;\
    \ (c) fuels; (d) fibres; \n(e) livestock; and (f) raw materials. Food is the most\
    \ \nextensively produced agricultural product. \n Irrigation/Water: Water demand\
    \ in agriculture is now \nrising globally and particularly in Mediterranean \n\
    countries, increasing the pressure to preserve available \nfreshwater resources.\
    \ Smart, sustainable agriculture \nprocesses should therefore focus on new and\
    \ efficient \ntechniques to improve agricultural productivity, which \npromote\
    \ considerable savings in terms of food \nconsumption and wasted water. \n Livestock:\
    \ These are animals raised in a domesticated \nagricultural environment, for the\
    \ purposes of labour and \nto produce commodities such as eggs, meat, milk, fur,\
    \ \nwool and leather. Animal husbandry is a component of \ncurrent agriculture\
    \ and refers to the breeding, \nmaintenance and slaughter of livestock. \n Machines:\
    \ Agricultural equipment is any kind of \nmachinery used to assist with farming.\
    \ Such machines \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n99 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \ncan be light or heavy, i.e. tractors. Modern farm \nmachinery is seen as the\
    \ important driver for increased \nagricultural \nsustainability, \nefficiency\
    \ \nand \ncompetitiveness. Smart technologies can reduce the \nimpact of farming\
    \ practices within global agriculture. \nThe current development of agricultural\
    \ machinery \naddresses environmental challenges, while increasing \nproductivity\
    \ and bringing economic benefits. These \nsmart agricultural machines should be:\
    \ (a) fast, \naccurate, versatile and intelligent; (b) produce less CO2 \nemissions\
    \ and (c) make use of bioenergy. \n Fields: This refers to an area of land used\
    \ for \nagricultural purposes, i.e. crops, cultivation or for \nlivestock. Many\
    \ fields have borders composed of a strip \nof bushes used to provide both food\
    \ and cover, in order \nto ensure the survival of wildlife. Monitoring field \n\
    activities using IoT devices can have a significantly \npositive impact on controlling\
    \ objects within the field. \nB. Proposed IOT/AI SSA Platform as a Solution \n\
    This platform would prove a valuable medium to facilitate \ndata flow and sharing\
    \ among SSA domains. Many researchers \nhave developed IoT architectures, but\
    \ their efforts have tended \nto target specific areas of IoT/AI, i.e. sensors\
    \ or weather \nmonitoring systems [58, 60, 61]. This current paper is \nproposing\
    \ a holistic IoT/AI platform to cover all areas within a \nSSA environment, performing\
    \ the following tasks: (a) manage \nand govern data flow between SSA domains;\
    \ (b) facilitate the \nintegration of the different components of SSA architecture;\
    \ \n(c) tackle interoperability issues caused by the utilization of \ndifferent\
    \ tools and software; (d) provide easy-to-use interfaces \nfor interaction; (e)\
    \ provide an ability to generate reports based \non real-time data and keep it\
    \ updated; (f) store generated data \nin sustainable storage place (i.e. the Cloud),\
    \ to enable it to \npermanently recorded for future reuse; (g) isolate different\
    \ \nlayers to improve the development process in the future; and \n(h) the platform\
    \ should consist of several nodes, so that, in the \ncase of any failure, other\
    \ nodes can keep the system up and \nrunning. Fig. 3 shows how the SSA-IoT/AI\
    \ platform would be \nused at the center of the SSA domain to facilitate business\
    \ \nprocess and data flow and to share within a smart, sustainable \nagricultural\
    \ environment. \n \nFig. 3. Proposed SSA-IoT/AI Platform. \nC. Proposed IoT/AI\
    \ Technical Architecture for SSA Platform \nFig. 4 shows the overall AI/IoT technical\
    \ architecture for \nSSA. It consists of two main components: (a) the first \n\
    component: SSA Layers and AI/IoT technologies; and (b) the \nsecond component:\
    \ data lifecycle within SSA architecture and \ndata process location. In order\
    \ to provide additional detail \nconcerning the framework, the following description\
    \ gives \nfurther details about each component: \n1) The First component: Smart\
    \ Sustainable Agriculture \n(SSA) layers and (SSA) AI/IoT technologies \nThe first\
    \ component of smart, sustainable agriculture \n(SSA), AI/IOT framework, consists\
    \ of the following layers: \n(a) Physical Hardware and Storage layer; (b) AI and\
    \ Data \nManagement layer, and Governance layer; (c) Network layer; \n(d) Security\
    \ layer; (e) Application layer; (f) IoT and sensing \nlayer; and (g) SSA domain\
    \ layer. Fig. 4 demonstrates the \nfollowing description of each layer, highlighting\
    \ its primary \nrole: \n Physical hardware and Storage layer: This layer \nconsists\
    \ of powerful hardware to host virtualized \nmachines, as well as dedicated traditional\
    \ storage \nmedium, cloud storage solutions or hybrid storage \nsolutions. It\
    \ contains the supporting hardware for IoT \ndevices that exist in Internet of\
    \ Thins and Sensing layer. \n Artificial Intelligence and Data Management Layer:\
    \ \nThis layer is responsible for managing processes and \ncontrolling the business\
    \ logic, focussing on three main \nactivities: (i) data analysis and processing,\
    \ using data \nmining and intelligence statistical analysis on generated \ndata;\
    \ (ii) data classification and transformation, using \nontologies, and machine\
    \ learning to classify and \ntransform analysed data; and (iii) data interpretation,\
    \ \nrepresenting the transformed data into knowledge to \nmake machines smarter.\
    \ \n Network Layer: This layer contains all the different \ntypes of network\
    \ connections exist, with this cloud \nconsisting \nof \nwired \nor \nwireless\
    \ \nnetwork \nconnections/devices. It is important that this layer uses \nthe\
    \ latest networking technologies to keep up with the \nmost recent developments\
    \ in other sectors. Its main job \nis to facilitate the transaction of all data\
    \ to and from \ndifferent \nlayers \nwithin \nthe \narchitecture. \nThe \ntechnologies\
    \ of IoT in this layer include Internet, WIFI \nand GSM/CMDA. It is responsible\
    \ for data accessibility \nand availability throughout other layers. Further,\
    \ it \nmanages data and its flow within between all layers. \n Security Layer:\
    \ This layer is responsible for data \nsecurity transferred among different layers\
    \ and should \nbe the means of addressing any security concerns and \nvulnerabilities\
    \ within all other IoT/SSA layers, i.e. \nmalware, spyware and viruses. It should\
    \ employ up-to-\ndate security solutions and AI algorithms to block and \nquarantine\
    \ any threat to the platform. \n Applications Layers: This layer gathers different\
    \ \napplications related to smart sustainable agriculture. It \nis built based\
    \ on AI and data management layers. Many \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n100 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nsmart, sustainable agricultural applications could be\
    \ \ndeveloped and integrated into this layer, i.e. crop \nmonitoring \napplications\
    \ \nand \ndrone-controlled \napplications. This layer focuses on the supervision\
    \ \naspect of the data flow and migration between all layers \nand can provide\
    \ an authorized institution with full or \npartial governance on data migration,\
    \ transactions and \naccess. \n Internet of Things (IoT) and Sensing Layer: This\
    \ \nforms the first interaction layer with SSA domains. It \nuses and hosts various\
    \ types of IoT devices (e.g. \nsensors), capable of collecting data from real-world\
    \ \nobjects, sharing it to provide real-time data. Many \nsensors in the Cloud\
    \ are hosted and integrated within \nthis layer, i.e. humidity sensors, moisture\
    \ sensors and \nweather monitoring systems. Furthermore, this layer is \nresponsible\
    \ for operating robotic and drone actuators to \nassist in the mobility of intelligent\
    \ machines within the \nagricultural area. It thus allows intelligent machines\
    \ to \nmove between locations, in order to cover a wide area. \n SSA Domain Layer:\
    \ This layer hosts various different \nSmart Sustainable Architectural domains\
    \ and forms the \nmain source for data generated from various \nagricultural domains,\
    \ including: fields; machines; \nhuman resources; and crops. It forms the basis\
    \ for \nIOT/AI SSA platforms, as it contains various raw data \nformats without\
    \ interference. \n2) The Second component: data lifecycle within SSA \nArchitecture\
    \ and its process location: \nFig. 5 demonstrates that data lifecycle remains\
    \ in line with \nSSA Architecture layers. This commences with the original \n\
    data source, i.e. SSA domain layers. The acquisition and \ncapturing of data is\
    \ undertaken at the layer containing sensors \nand actuators. These captured data\
    \ are then passed to the \napplication layer for business logic and control, following\
    \ \nwhich, the data must be checked for security issues before \nmoving to data\
    \ analysis and processing. This is followed by \ndata classification and transformation\
    \ of the analyzed and \nprocessed data before it moves to data interpretation\
    \ and the \nresulting building decisions. The final stage is to store the data\
    \ \nfor future retrieval. \nThere are two locations for sharing and processing\
    \ of \ngenerated data. Firstly, on-site. Here, the generated data is \nmore likely\
    \ to be shared and processed within the location of \nthe agricultural field,\
    \ covering the four architecture layers: \n(1) SSA; (2) the domain layer; (3)\
    \ the IoT layer; and (4) the \napplication layer. Secondly, off-site: here the\
    \ sharing and \nprocessing of the generated data must be outsourced to the \n\
    physical location „data centre‟, in which data is processed and \nanalyzed away\
    \ from the field. It can cover the four architecture \nlayers: (1) network; (2)\
    \ AI and data management; (3) physical; \nand (4) storage. It is also important\
    \ to highlight that the \nSecurity layer forms a common layer between on-site\
    \ and off-\nsite processing locations. \n \nFig. 4. Overall AI/IoT Platform Technical\
    \ Architecture for SSA. \n \nFig. 5. IoT/AI Data Lifecycle. \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ \n101 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nV. CONCLUSION \nThis paper has established\
    \ the importance of employing \nrecent and advanced computing technologies in\
    \ the agricultural \nsector, in particularly AI and IoT. Agriculture is considered\
    \ \ncentral to the survival of human beings. Supporting the current \npractices\
    \ of traditional agriculture with recent IoT/AI \ntechnologies can improve the\
    \ performance, quality and volume \nof production. This study has reviewed the\
    \ existing IoT/AI \ntechnologies discussed within the main research journals in\
    \ the \narea of agricultural. Furthermore, it categorized the main \ndomains of\
    \ smart, sustainable agriculture, i.e. human resources; \ncrops; weather; soil;\
    \ pests; fertilization; farming products; \nirrigation/water; livestock; machines;\
    \ and fields. The major \ncontribution of this paper concerns the AI/IoT technical\
    \ \narchitecture for SSA, leading to an emphasis on the research \nand development\
    \ of a unified AI/IoT platform for SSA, to \npositively resolve issues resulting\
    \ from the fragmentary nature \nof the agricultural process. Future work will\
    \ include \ninvestigation of the process of implementing AI/IoT \ntechnologies\
    \ for SSA by applying the proposed AI/IoT \ntechnical architecture in the form\
    \ of the prototype of a unified \nplatform on real test cases. This will identify\
    \ the relevant \nstrengthens and weaknesses for further improvement and \nenhancement.\

    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    Keywords: crop management; sustainable agriculture; smart farming; internet-of-things

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    12 of 26

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    17 of 26

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    19 of 26

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access
    to health

    care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    20 of 26

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.

    \ the pressure on the global food \nsystem is mounting [3]. Addressing this challenge\
    \ requires a multifaceted approach that leverages \nadvanced technologies to enhance\
    \ productivity, optimize resource utilization, and minimize \nenvironmental impact.\
    \ Big data, characterized by the collection, storage, and analysis of vast and\
    \ \ndiverse datasets, offers unparalleled opportunities to gain insights into\
    \ complex agricultural \nsystems [4-5], sets the stage for an in-depth exploration\
    \ of how big data innovations are reshaping \nfood and agriculture research, providing\
    \ a roadmap for researchers, practitioners, and \npolicymakers to navigate the\
    \ complexities of the modern agricultural landscape [6-7]. \n \nInternational\

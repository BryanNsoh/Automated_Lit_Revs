    Get rights and content Abstract Today’s wireless networks are characterized by
    a fixed spectrum assignment policy. However, a large portion of the assigned spectrum
    is used sporadically and geographical variations in the utilization of assigned
    spectrum ranges from 15% to 85% with a high variance in time. The limited available
    spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage necessitate a new communication
    paradigm to exploit the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically. This new
    networking paradigm is referred to as NeXt Generation (xG) Networks as well as
    Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and cognitive radio networks. The term xG networks
    is used throughout the paper. The novel functionalities and current research challenges
    of the xG networks are explained in detail. More specifically, a brief overview
    of the cognitive radio technology is provided and the xG network architecture
    is introduced. Moreover, the xG network functions such as spectrum management,
    spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing are explained in detail. The influence
    of these functions on the performance of the upper layer protocols such as routing
    and transport are investigated and open research issues in these areas are also
    outlined. Finally, the cross-layer design challenges in xG networks are discussed.

    by a fixed spectrum assignment policy, i.e. the spectrum is regulated by governmental
    agencies and is assigned to license holders or services on a long term basis for
    large geographical regions. In addition, a large portion of the assigned spectrum
    is used sporadically as illustrated in Fig. 1, where the signal strength distribution
    over a large portion of the wireless spectrum is shown. The spectrum usage is
    concentrated on certain portions of the spectrum while a significant amount of
    the spectrum remains unutilized. According to Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) [20], temporal and geographical variations in the utilization of the assigned
    spectrum range from 15% to 85%. Although the fixed spectrum assignment policy
    generally served well in the past, there is a dramatic increase in the access
    to the limited spectrum for mobile services in the recent years. This increase
    is straining the effectiveness of the traditional spectrum policies. Download

    spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage necessitate a new communication
    paradigm to exploit the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically [3]. Dynamic
    spectrum access is proposed to solve these current spectrum inefficiency problems.
    DARPAs approach on Dynamic Spectrum Access network, the so-called NeXt Generation
    (xG) program aims to implement the policy based intelligent radios known as cognitive
    radios [67], [68]. NeXt Generation (xG) communication networks, also known as
    Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DSANs) as well as cognitive radio networks,
    will provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless architectures
    and dynamic spectrum access techniques. The inefficient usage of the existing
    spectrum can be improved through opportunistic access to the licensed bands without
    interfering with the existing users. xG networks, however, impose several research
    challenges due to the broad range of available spectrum as well as diverse Quality-of-Service
    (QoS) requirements of applications. These heterogeneities must be captured and
    handled dynamically as mobile terminals roam between wireless architectures and
    along the available spectrum pool. The key enabling technology of xG networks
    is the cognitive radio. Cognitive radio techniques provide the capability to use
    or share the spectrum in an opportunistic manner. Dynamic spectrum access techniques
    allow the cognitive radio to operate in the best available channel. More specifically,
    the cognitive radio technology will enable the users to (1) determine which portions
    of the spectrum is available and detect the presence of licensed users when a
    user operates in a licensed band (spectrum sensing), (2) select the best available
    channel (spectrum management), (3) coordinate access to this channel with other
    users (spectrum sharing), and (4) vacate the channel when a licensed user is detected
    (spectrum mobility). Once a cognitive radio supports the capability to select
    the best available channel, the next challenge is to make the network protocols
    adaptive to the available spectrum. Hence, new functionalities are required in
    an xG network to support this adaptivity. In summary, the main functions for cognitive
    radios in xG networks can be summarized as follows: • Spectrum sensing: Detecting
    unused spectrum and sharing the spectrum without harmful interference with other
    users. • Spectrum management: Capturing the best available spectrum to meet user
    communication requirements. • Spectrum mobility: Maintaining seamless communication
    requirements during the transition to better spectrum. • Spectrum sharing: Providing
    the fair spectrum scheduling method among coexisting xG users. These functionalities
    of xG networks enable spectrum-aware communication protocols. However, the dynamic
    use of the spectrum causes adverse effects on the performance of conventional
    communication protocols, which were developed considering a fixed frequency band
    for communication. So far, networking in xG networks is an unexplored topic. In
    this paper, we also capture the intrinsic challenges for networking in xG networks
    and lay out guidelines for further research in this area. More specifically, we
    overview the recent proposals for spectrum sharing and routing in xG networks
    as well as the challenges for transport protocols. Moreover, the effect of cross-layer
    design is addressed for communication in xG networks. The xG network communication
    components and their interactions are illustrated in Fig. 2. It is evident from
    the significant number of interactions that the xG network functionalities necessitate
    a cross-layer design approach. More specifically, spectrum sensing and spectrum
    sharing cooperate with each other to enhance spectrum efficiency. In spectrum
    management and spectrum mobility functions, application, transport, routing, medium
    access and physical layer functionalities are carried out in a cooperative way,
    considering the dynamic nature of the underlying spectrum. Download : Download

    a definition, functions and current research challenges of the xG networks. In
    Section 2, we provide a brief overview of the cognitive radio technology. The
    xG network architectures on licensed band and on unlicensed band are presented

    features influence the performance of the upper layer protocols, i.e., routing
    and transport. Finally, we explain how xG functions can be implemented in a cross-layer
    approach in Section 9 and conclude the paper in Section 10. 2. Cognitive radio
    Cognitive radio technology is the key technology that enables an xG network to
    use spectrum in a dynamic manner. The term, cognitive radio, can formally be defined
    as follows [20]: A “Cognitive Radio” is a radio that can change its transmitter
    parameters based on interaction with the environment in which it operates. From
    this definition, two main characteristics of the cognitive radio can be defined
    [27], [58]: • Cognitive capability: Cognitive capability refers to the ability
    of the radio technology to capture or sense the information from its radio environment.
    This capability cannot simply be realized by monitoring the power in some frequency
    band of interest but more sophisticated techniques are required in order to capture
    the temporal and spatial variations in the radio environment and avoid interference
    to other users. Through this capability, the portions of the spectrum that are
    unused at a specific time or location can be identified. Consequently, the best
    spectrum and appropriate operating parameters can be selected. • Reconfigurability:
    The cognitive capability provides spectrum awareness whereas reconfigurability
    enables the radio to be dynamically programmed according to the radio environment.
    More specifically, the cognitive radio can be programmed to transmit and receive
    on a variety of frequencies and to use different transmission access technologies
    supported by its hardware design [34]. The cognitive radio concept was first introduced
    in [45], [46], where the main focus was on the radio knowledge representation
    language (RKRL) and how the cognitive radio can enhance the flexibility of personal
    wireless services. The cognitive radio is regarded as a small part of the physical
    world to use and provide information from environment. The ultimate objective
    of the cognitive radio is to obtain the best available spectrum through cognitive
    capability and reconfigurability as described before. Since most of the spectrum
    is already assigned, the most important challenge is to share the licensed spectrum
    without interfering with the transmission of other licensed users as illustrated
    in Fig. 3. The cognitive radio enables the usage of temporally unused spectrum,
    which is referred to as spectrum hole or white space [27]. If this band is further
    used by a licensed user, the cognitive radio moves to another spectrum hole or
    stays in the same band, altering its transmission power level or modulation scheme
    to avoid interference as shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. Spectrum hole concept. In the following subsections, we describe the physical
    architecture, cognitive functions and reconfigurability capabilities of the cognitive
    radio technology. 2.1. Physical architecture of the cognitive radio A generic
    architecture of a cognitive radio transceiver is shown in Fig. 4(a) [34]. The
    main components of a cognitive radio transceiver are the radio front-end and the
    baseband processing unit. Each component can be reconfigured via a control bus
    to adapt to the time-varying RF environment. In the RF front-end, the received
    signal is amplified, mixed and A/D converted. In the baseband processing unit,
    the signal is modulated/demodulated and encoded/decoded. The baseband processing
    unit of a cognitive radio is essentially similar to existing transceivers. However,
    the novelty of the cognitive radio is the RF front-end. Hence, next, we focus
    on the RF front-end of the cognitive radios. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 4. Physical architecture of the cognitive radio [12], [34]: (a) Cognitive
    radio transceiver and (b) wideband RF/analog front-end architecture. The novel
    characteristic of cognitive radio transceiver is a wideband sensing capability
    of the RF front-end. This function is mainly related to RF hardware technologies
    such as wideband antenna, power amplifier, and adaptive filter. RF hardware for
    the cognitive radio should be capable of tuning to any part of a large range of
    frequency spectrum. Also such spectrum sensing enables real-time measurements
    of spectrum information from radio environment. Generally, a wideband front-end
    architecture for the cognitive radio has the following structure as shown in Fig.
    4(b) [12]. The components of a cognitive radio RF front-end are as follows: •
    RF filter: The RF filter selects the desired band by bandpass filtering the received
    RF signal. • Low noise amplifier (LNA): The LNA amplifies the desired signal while
    simultaneously minimizing noise component. • Mixer: In the mixer, the received
    signal is mixed with locally generated RF frequency and converted to the baseband
    or the intermediate frequency (IF). • Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO): The
    VCO generates a signal at a specific frequency for a given voltage to mix with
    the incoming signal. This procedure converts the incoming signal to baseband or
    an intermediate frequency. • Phase locked loop (PLL): The PLL ensures that a signal
    is locked on a specific frequency and can also be used to generate precise frequencies
    with fine resolution. • Channel selection filter: The channel selection filter
    is used to select the desired channel and to reject the adjacent channels. There
    are two types of channel selection filters [52]. The direct conversion receiver
    uses a low-pass filter for the channel selection. On the other hand, the superheterodyne
    receiver adopts a bandpass filter. • Automatic gain control (AGC): The AGC maintains
    the gain or output power level of an amplifier constant over a wide range of input
    signal levels. In this architecture, a wideband signal is received through the
    RF front-end, sampled by the high speed analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, and
    measurements are performed for the detection of the licensed user signal. However,
    there exist some limitations on developing the cognitive radio front-end. The
    wideband RF antenna receives signals from various transmitters operating at different
    power levels, bandwidths, and locations. As a result, the RF front-end should
    have the capability to detect a weak signal in a large dynamic range. However,
    this capability requires a multi-GHz speed A/D converter with high resolution,
    which might be infeasible [12], [13]. The requirement of a multi-GHz speed A/D
    converter necessitates the dynamic range of the signal to be reduced before A/D
    conversion. This reduction can be achieved by filtering strong signals. Since
    strong signals can be located anywhere in the wide spectrum range, tunable notch
    filters are required for the reduction [12]. Another approach is to use multiple
    antennas such that signal filtering is performed in the spatial domain rather
    than in the frequency domain. Multiple antennas can receive signals selectively
    using beamforming techniques [13]. As explained previously, the key challenge
    of the physical architecture of the cognitive radio is an accurate detection of
    weak signals of licensed users over a wide spectrum range. Hence, the implementation
    of RF wideband front-end and A/D converter are critical issues in xG networks.
    2.2. Cognitive capability The cognitive capability of a cognitive radio enables
    real time interaction with its environment to determine appropriate communication
    parameters and adapt to the dynamic radio environment. The tasks required for
    adaptive operation in open spectrum are shown in Fig. 5 [27], [46], [58], which
    is referred to as the cognitive cycle. In this section, we provide an overview
    of the three main steps of the cognitive cycle: spectrum sensing, spectrum analysis,
    and spectrum decision. The details and the related work of these functions are
    described in Sections 4 Spectrum sensing, 5 Spectrum management. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Cognitive cycle. The steps of the cognitive cycle as shown
    in Fig. 5 are as follows: 1. Spectrum sensing: A cognitive radio monitors the
    available spectrum bands, captures their information, and then detects the spectrum
    holes. 2. Spectrum analysis: The characteristics of the spectrum holes that are
    detected through spectrum sensing are estimated. 3. Spectrum decision: A cognitive
    radio determines the data rate, the transmission mode, and the bandwidth of the
    transmission. Then, the appropriate spectrum band is chosen according to the spectrum
    characteristics and user requirements. Once the operating spectrum band is determined,
    the communication can be performed over this spectrum band. However, since the
    radio environment changes over time and space, the cognitive radio should keep
    track of the changes of the radio environment. If the current spectrum band in
    use becomes unavailable, the spectrum mobility function that will be explained
    in Section 6, is performed to provide a seamless transmission. Any environmental
    change during the transmission such as primary user appearance, user movement,
    or traffic variation can trigger this adjustment. 2.3. Reconfigurability Reconfigurability
    is the capability of adjusting operating parameters for the transmission on the
    fly without any modifications on the hardware components. This capability enables
    the cognitive radio to adapt easily to the dynamic radio environment. There are
    several reconfigurable parameters that can be incorporated into the cognitive
    radio [20] as explained below: • Operating frequency: A cognitive radio is capable
    of changing the operating frequency. Based on the information about the radio
    environment, the most suitable operating frequency can be determined and the communication
    can be dynamically performed on this appropriate operating frequency. • Modulation:
    A cognitive radio should reconfigure the modulation scheme adaptive to the user
    requirements and channel conditions. For example, in the case of delay sensitive
    applications, the data rate is more important than the error rate. Thus, the modulation
    scheme that enables the higher spectral efficiency should be selected. Conversely,
    the loss-sensitive applications focus on the error rate, which necessitate modulation
    schemes with low bit error rate. • Transmission power: Transmission power can
    be reconfigured within the power constraints. Power control enables dynamic transmission
    power configuration within the permissible power limit. If higher power operation
    is not necessary, the cognitive radio reduces the transmitter power to a lower
    level to allow more users to share the spectrum and to decrease the interference.
    • Communication technology: A cognitive radio can also be used to provide interoperability
    among different communication systems. The transmission parameters of a cognitive
    radio can be reconfigured not only at the beginning of a transmission but also
    during the transmission. According to the spectrum characteristics, these parameters
    can be reconfigured such that the cognitive radio is switched to a different spectrum
    band, the transmitter and receiver parameters are reconfigured and the appropriate
    communication protocol parameters and modulation schemes are used. 3. The xG network
    architecture Existing wireless network architectures employ heterogeneity in terms
    of both spectrum policies and communication technologies [3]. Moreover, some portion
    of the wireless spectrum is already licensed to different purposes while some
    bands remain unlicensed. For the development of communication protocols, a clear
    description of the xG network architecture is essential. In this section, the
    xG network architecture is presented such that all possible scenarios are considered.
    The components of the xG network architecture, as shown in Fig. 6, can be classified
    in two groups as the primary network and the xG network. The basic elements of
    the primary and the xG network are defined as follows: • Primary network: An existing
    network infrastructure is generally referred to as the primary network, which
    has an exclusive right to a certain spectrum band. Examples include the common
    cellular and TV broadcast networks. The components of the primary network are
    as follows: – Primary user: Primary user (or licensed user) has a license to operate
    in a certain spectrum band. This access can only be controlled by the primary
    base-station and should not be affected by the operations of any other unlicensed
    users. Primary users do not need any modification or additional functions for
    coexistence with xG base-stations and xG users. – Primary base-station: Primary
    base-station (or licensed base-station) is a fixed infrastructure network component
    which has a spectrum license such as base-station transceiver system (BTS) in
    a cellular system. In principle, the primary base-station does not have any xG
    capability for sharing spectrum with xG users. However, the primary base-station
    may be requested to have both legacy and xG protocols for the primary network
    access of xG users, which is explained below. • xG network: xG network (or cognitive
    radio network, Dynamic Spectrum Access network, secondary network, unlicensed
    network) does not have license to operate in a desired band. Hence, the spectrum
    access is allowed only in an opportunistic manner. xG networks can be deployed
    both as an infrastructure network and an ad hoc network as shown in Fig. 6. The
    components of an xG network are as follows: – xG user: xG user (or unlicensed
    user, cognitive radio user, secondary user) has no spectrum license. Hence, additional
    functionalities are required to share the licensed spectrum band. – xG base-station:
    xG base-station (or unlicensed base-station, secondary base-station) is a fixed
    infrastructure component with xG capabilities. xG base-station provides single
    hop connection to xG users without spectrum access license. Through this connection,
    an xG user can access other networks. – Spectrum broker: Spectrum broker (or scheduling
    server) is a central network entity that plays a role in sharing the spectrum
    resources among different xG networks. Spectrum broker can be connected to each
    network and can serve as a spectrum information manager to enable coexistence
    of multiple xG networks [10], [32], [70]. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 6. xG network architecture. The reference xG network architecture is shown
    in Fig. 6, which consists of different types of networks: a primary network, an
    infrastructure based xG network, and an ad-hoc xG network. xG networks are operated
    under the mixed spectrum environment that consists of both licensed and unlicensed
    bands. Also, xG users can either communicate with each other in a multihop manner
    or access the base-station. Thus, in xG networks, there are three different access
    types as explained next: • xG network access: xG users can access their own xG
    base-station both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands. • xG ad hoc access:
    xG users can communicate with other xG users through ad hoc connection on both
    licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands. • Primary network access: The xG users
    can also access the primary base-station through the licensed band. According
    to the reference architecture shown in Fig. 6, various functionalities are required
    to support the heterogeneity in xG networks. In Section 3.1, we describe the xG
    network functions to support the heterogeneity of the network environment. Moreover,
    in Sections 3.2 xG network applications, 3.3 Existing architectures, we overview
    xG network applications and existing architectures. 3.1. xG network functions
    As explained before, xG network can operate in both licensed and unlicensed bands.
    Hence, the functionalities required for xG networks vary according to whether
    the spectrum is licensed or unlicensed. Accordingly, in this section, we classify
    the xG network operations as xG network on licensed band and xG network on unlicensed
    band. The xG network functions are explained in the following sections according
    to this classification. 3.1.1. xG network on licensed band As shown in Fig. 1,
    there exist temporally unused spectrum holes in the licensed spectrum band. Hence,
    xG networks can be deployed to exploit these spectrum holes through cognitive
    communication techniques. This architecture is depicted in Fig. 7, where the xG
    network coexists with the primary network at the same location and on the same
    spectrum band. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. xG network on licensed
    band. There are various challenges for xG networks on licensed band due to the
    existence of the primary users. Although the main purpose of the xG network is
    to determine the best available spectrum, xG functions in the licensed band are
    mainly aimed at the detection of the presence of primary users. The channel capacity
    of the spectrum holes depends on the interference at the nearby primary users.
    Thus, the interference avoidance with primary users is the most important issue
    in this architecture. Furthermore, if primary users appear in the spectrum band
    occupied by xG users, xG users should vacate the current spectrum band and move
    to the new available spectrum immediately, called spectrum handoff. 3.1.2. xG
    network on unlicensed band Open spectrum policy that began in the industrial scientific
    and medical (ISM) band has caused an impressive variety of important technologies
    and innovative uses. However, due to the interference among multiple heterogeneous
    networks, the spectrum efficiency of ISM band is decreasing. Ultimately, the capacity
    of open spectrum access, and the quality of service they can offer, depend on
    the degree to which a radio can be designed to allocate spectrum efficiently.
    xG networks can be designed for operation on unlicensed bands such that the efficiency
    is improved in this portion of the spectrum. The xG network on unlicensed band
    architecture is illustrated in Fig. 8. Since there are no license holders, all
    network entities have the same right to access the spectrum bands. Multiple xG
    networks coexist in the same area and communicate using the same portion of the
    spectrum. Intelligent spectrum sharing algorithms can improve the efficiency of
    spectrum usage and support high QoS. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    8. xG network on unlicensed band. In this architecture, xG users focus on detecting
    the transmissions of other xG users. Unlike the licensed band operations, the
    spectrum handoff is not triggered by the appearance of other primary users. However,
    since all xG users have the same right to access the spectrum, xG users should
    compete with each other for the same unlicensed band. Thus, sophisticated spectrum
    sharing methods among xG users are required in this architecture. If multiple
    xG network operators reside in the same unlicensed band, fair spectrum sharing
    among these networks is also required. 3.2. xG network applications xG networks
    can be applied to the following cases: Leased network: The primary network can
    provide a leased network by allowing opportunistic access to its licensed spectrum
    with the agreement with a third party without sacrificing the service quality
    of the primary user [56]. For example, the primary network can lease its spectrum
    access right to a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). Also the primary network
    can provide its spectrum access rights to a regional community for the purpose
    of broadband access. Cognitive mesh network: Wireless mesh networks are emerging
    as a cost-effective technology for providing broadband connectivity [4]. However,
    as the network density increases and the applications require higher throughput,
    mesh networks require higher capacity to meet the requirements of the applications.
    Since the cognitive radio technology enables the access to larger amount of spectrum,
    xG networks can be used for mesh networks that will be deployed in dense urban
    areas with the possibility of significant contention [38]. For example, the coverage
    area of xG networks can be increased when a meshed wireless backbone network of
    infrastructure links is established based on cognitive access points (CAPs) and
    fixed cognitive relay nodes (CRNs) [6]. The capacity of a CAP, connected via a
    wired broadband access to the Internet, is distributed into a large area with
    the help of a fixed CRN. xG networks have the ability to add temporary or permanent
    spectrum to the infrastructure links used for relaying in case of high traffic
    load. Emergency network: Public safety and emergency networks are another area
    in which xG networks can be implemented [41]. In the case of natural disasters,
    which may temporarily disable or destroy existing communication infrastructure,
    emergency personnel working in the disaster areas need to establish emergency
    networks. Since emergency networks deal with the critical information, reliable
    communication should be guaranteed with minimum latency. In addition, emergency
    communication requires a significant amount of radio spectrum for handling huge
    volume of traffic including voice, video and data. xG networks can enable the
    usage of the existing spectrum without the need for an infrastructure and by maintaining
    communication priority and response time. Military network: One of the most interesting
    potential applications of an xG network is in a military radio environment [47].
    xG networks can enable the military radios choose arbitrary, intermediate frequency
    (IF) bandwidth, modulation schemes, and coding schemes, adapting to the variable
    radio environment of battlefield. Also military networks have a strong need for
    security and protection of the communication in hostile environment. xG networks
    could allow military personnel to perform spectrum handoff to find secure spectrum
    band for themselves and their allies. 3.3. Existing architectures The main representative
    examples of the xG network architectures are described in this section. Spectrum
    pooling: In [61], [62], a centralized spectrum pooling architecture is proposed
    based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This architecture
    consists of an xG base-station and mobile xG users. OFDM has the advantage of
    feeding certain sub-carriers with zeros resulting in no emission of radio power
    on the carriers that are occupied by the licensed users. The licensed user detection
    is performed through detection frames that are periodically broadcast by the base-station.
    During the detection frames, the mobile users perform spectrum sensing. The sensing
    information is then gathered at the base-station. Mobile terminals modulate a
    complex symbol at maximum power in the sub-carriers where a licensed user appears.
    Through this operation, the base-station receives an amplified signal on all sub-carriers
    with new licensed users. Physical and MAC layer issues, such as detection of spectral
    access, scheduling, and handoff are ongoing investigations in this architecture.
    CORVUS: In [8], [14], a cognitive radio approach for usage of virtual unlicensed
    spectrum (CORVUS) system is presented to exploit unoccupied licensed bands. In
    CORVUS, based on the local spectrum sensing, the primary user detection and the
    spectrum allocation are performed in a coordinated manner. This cooperative effort
    greatly increases the system’s ability in identifying and avoiding primary users.
    In CORVUS, a group of users form a secondary user group (SUG) to coordinate their
    communication. Each member of this group senses the spectrum pool, which is divided
    into sub-channels. A universal control channel is used by all groups for coordination
    and separate group control channels are used by the members of a group to exchange
    sensing information and establish secondary user links. The performance of the
    physical and link layers are evaluated through the CORVUS testbed [44]. Moreover,
    recently, a reliable link maintenance protocol is proposed within CORVUS to maintain
    the quality of secondary user communication [64]. IEEE 802.22: IEEE 802.22 is
    the first worldwide standard based on the cognitive radio technology [16], [31]
    and is now in the process of standardization. This project, formally called the
    standard for wireless regional area networks (WRAN), focuses on constructing fixed
    point-to-multipoint WRAN that will utilize UHF/VHF TV bands between 54 and 862
    MHz. Specific TV channels as well as guard bands will be used for communication
    in IEEE 802.22. The IEEE 802.22 system specifies a fixed point-to-multipoint wireless
    air interface whereby a base-station manages its own cell and all associated users,
    which are denoted as consumer premise equipments (CPEs). IEEE 802.22 base-station
    manages a unique feature of distributed sensing. This is needed to ensure proper
    incumbent protection and is managed by the base-station, which instructs the various
    CPEs to perform distributed measurement activities. The IEEE 802.22 system specifies
    spectral efficiencies in the range of 0.5–5 bit/s/Hz. A distinctive feature of
    IEEE 802.22 WRAN as compared to the existing IEEE 802 standards is the base-station
    coverage range, which can go up to 100 km if the power is not an issue. Current
    specified coverage range is 33 km at 4 W CPE effective isotropic radiated power
    (EIRP) [66]. Table 1 depicts the capacity and coverage of IEEE 802.22 WRAN system.
    IEEE 802.22 working group was formed in 2004 and has finalized the specification
    of technical requirements. The first draft of IEEE 802.22 standard will be ready
    around mid 2006. Table 1. IEEE 802.22 WRAN system capacity and coverage [65] RF

    TV channel can provide service to up to 600 subscribers. The area that the Wireless
    Regional Area network (WRAN) operator needs to cover should include enough subscribers
    to make it economically viable early in the process when the take-up rate is low.
    This will define the potential subscriber base and the population density for
    a sustainable business case. DIMSUMnet: The dynamic intelligent management of
    spectrum for ubiquitous mobile network (DIMSUMnet) [10] implements statistically
    multiplexed access (SMA) to spectrum in the coordinated access band (CAB). While
    the CAB improves the spectrum access efficiency and fairness, the SMA is focused
    on improving the spectrum utilization. CAB is a contiguous chunk of spectrum reserved
    by regulating authorities. A spectrum broker permanently owns the CAB and leases
    it according to requests. DIMSUMnet uses a centralized, regional network level
    brokering mechanism that aims to significantly improve spectrum utilization while
    reducing the complexity and the agility requirements of the deployed system. The
    base-station registers with its designated radio access network manager (RANMAN),
    which negotiates a lease with a spectrum information and management (SPIM) broker
    for an appropriate portion of the spectrum. If the lease is successfully obtained,
    the RANMAN configures the leased spectrum in the base-station. The base-station
    sends the spectrum information received from the RANMAN to its users for the configuration
    of client. The spectrum utilization of DIMSUMnet is currently measured in existing
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile communication
    (GSM) cellular networks, aimed at characterizing feasibility of CAB and SMA [35].
    Recent work focuses on the spectrum pricing and allocation functions for spectrum
    brokers [11]. DRiVE/OverDRiVE project: The European Dynamic Radio for IP Services
    in Vehicular Environments (DRiVE) project focuses on dynamic spectrum allocation
    in heterogeneous networks by assuming a common coordinated channel [75]. The follow-up
    project, Spectrum Efficient Uni- and Multicast Over Dynamic Radio Networks in
    Vehicular Environments (OverDRiVE) aims at UMTS enhancements and coordination
    of existing radio networks into a hybrid network to ensure spectrum efficient
    provision of mobile multimedia services [26]. Two aspects of dynamic spectrum
    allocation were investigated in DRiVE/OverDRiVE, i.e., temporal dynamic spectrum
    allocation (DSA), and spatial DSA [39]. In the case of the temporal DSA, a radio
    access network (RAN) can use the spectrum that is not currently being used by
    other RANs, at that time. On the other hand, spatial DSA allows spectrum allocations
    to adapt to regional fluctuations in traffic demands. The efficiency of these
    DSA schemes depends on the ability to predict the traffic load. Although these
    projects have shown significant potential for increasing spectral efficiency,
    the reconfigurable system implementation for temporal and spatial DSA is still
    a major challenge. Nautilus: Nautilus project is designed to emphasize distributed
    coordination enabled spectrum sharing, without relying on centralized control
    [48]. In the Nautilus project, a distributed, scalable and efficient coordination
    framework for open spectrum ad hoc networks is proposed, which accounts for spectrum
    heterogeneity while not relying on the existence of a pre-defined common channel
    for control traffic [73], [74]. Based on this framework, three different collaborative
    spectrum access schemes are presented. In [73], a graph coloring based collaborative
    spectrum access scheme is proposed, where a topology-optimized allocation algorithm
    is used for the fixed topology. In mobile networks, however, the network topology
    changes due to the node mobility. Using this global optimization approach, the
    network needs to completely recompute spectrum assignments for all users after
    each change, resulting in high computational and communication overhead. Thus,
    distributed spectrum allocation based on local bargaining is proposed in [15],
    where mobile users negotiate spectrum assignment within local self-organized groups.
    For the resource constrained networks such as sensor and ad hoc network, rule-based
    device centric spectrum management is proposed, where unlicensed users access
    the spectrum independently according to both local observation and predetermined
    rules. Currently, this project focuses on selecting the best channel for data
    transmission using proposed distributed coordination framework. OCRA network:
    In [5], an OFDM-based cognitive radio (OCRA) network is proposed. OCRA network
    considers all possible deployment scenarios over the heterogeneous xG network
    environment and develops cross-layer operations for the OFDM based dynamic spectrum
    access. OCRA network architecture and its components are shown in Fig. 6. For
    the spectrum decision and the spectrum handoff, OCRA network provides a novel
    concept of an OFDM-based spectrum management over the heterogeneous spectrum environment.
    Based on this physical layer (PHY) structure, a dual-mode spectrum sharing framework
    is proposed, which enables access to existing networks as well as coordination
    between xG users. Furthermore, a new routing paradigm that considers joint re-routing
    and spectrum handoff is proposed. Moreover, OCRA network introduces multi-spectrum
    transport techniques to exploit the available but non-contiguous wireless spectrum
    for high quality communication. In [5], the testbed design for evaluation and
    integration of the OCRA network is proposed. The OCRA testbed is based on IEEE
    802.11a/g technology, which exploits the OFDM technology. Moreover, a standalone
    cognitive sensing unit is developed to emulate the spectrum sensing capabilities
    of the cognitive radio. 4. Spectrum sensing An important requirement of the xG
    network is to sense the spectrum holes. As explained in Section 2, a cognitive
    radio is designed to be aware of and sensitive to the changes in its surrounding.
    The spectrum sensing function enables the cognitive radio to adapt to its environment
    by detecting spectrum holes. The most efficient way to detect spectrum holes is
    to detect the primary users that are receiving data within the communication range
    of an xG user. In reality, however, it is difficult for a cognitive radio to have
    a direct measurement of a channel between a primary receiver and a transmitter.
    Thus, the most recent work focuses on primary transmitter detection based on local
    observations of xG users. Generally, the spectrum sensing techniques can be classified
    as transmitter detection, cooperative detection, and interference-based detection,
    as shown in Fig. 9. In the following sections, we describe these spectrum sensing
    methods for xG networks and discuss the open research topics in this area. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Classification of spectrum sensing techniques.
    4.1. Transmitter detection (non-cooperative detection) The cognitive radio should
    distinguish between used and unused spectrum bands. Thus, the cognitive radio
    should have capability to determine if a signal from primary transmitter is locally
    present in a certain spectrum. Transmitter detection approach is based on the
    detection of the weak signal from a primary transmitter through the local observations
    of xG users. Basic hypothesis model for transmitter detection can be defined as
    follows [25]: (1) where x(t) is the signal received by the xG user, s(t) is the
    transmitted signal of the primary user, n(t) is the AWGN and h is the amplitude
    gain of the channel. H0 is a null hypothesis, which states that there is no licensed
    user signal in a certain spectrum band. On the other hand, H1 is an alternative
    hypothesis, which indicates that there exist some licensed user signal. Three
    schemes are generally used for the transmitter detection according to the hypothesis
    model [53]. In the following subsections, we investigate matched filter detection,
    energy detection and cyclostationary feature detection techniques proposed for
    transmitter detection in xG networks. 4.1.1. Matched filter detection When the
    information of the primary user signal is known to the xG user, the optimal detector
    in stationary Gaussian noise is the matched filter since it maximizes the received
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [53]. While the main advantage of the matched filter
    is that it requires less time to achieve high processing gain due to coherency,
    it requires a priori knowledge of the primary user signal such as the modulation
    type and order, the pulse shape, and the packet format. Hence, if this information
    is not accurate, then the matched filter performs poorly. However, since most
    wireless network systems have pilot, preambles, synchronization word or spreading
    codes, these can be used for the coherent detection. 4.1.2. Energy detection If
    the receiver cannot gather sufficient information about the primary user signal,
    for example, if the power of the random Gaussian noise is only known to the receiver,
    the optimal detector is an energy detector [53]. In order to measure the energy
    of the received signal, the output signal of bandpass filter with bandwidth W
    is squared and integrated over the observation interval T. Finally, the output
    of the integrator, Y, is compared with a threshold, λ, to decide whether a licensed
    user is present or not [17]. If the energy detection can be applied in a non-fading
    environment where h is the amplitude gain of the channel as shown in (1), the
    probability of detection Pd and false alarm Pf are given as follows [17]: (2)
    (3) where γ is the SNR, u = TW is the time bandwidth product, Γ(·) and Γ(·, ·)
    are complete and incomplete gamma functions and Qm( ) is the generalized Marcum
    Q-function. From the above functions, while a low Pd would result in missing the
    presence of the primary user with high probability which in turn increases the
    interference to the primary user, a high Pf would result in low spectrum utilization
    since false alarms increase the number of missed opportunities. Since it is easy
    to implement, the recent work on detection of the primary user has generally adopted
    the energy detector [23], [53]. In [25], the shadowing and the multi-path fading
    factors are considered for the energy detector. In this case, while Pf is independent
    of Γ, when the amplitude gain of the channel, h, varies due to the shadowing/fading,
    Pd gives the probability of the detection conditioned on instantaneous SNR as
    follows: (4) where fγ(x) is the probability distribution function of SNR under
    fading. However, the performance of energy detector is susceptible to uncertainty
    in noise power. In order to solve this problem, a pilot tone from the primary
    transmitter is used to help improve the accuracy of the energy detector in [53].
    Another shortcoming is that the energy detector cannot differentiate signal types
    but can only determine the presence of the signal. Thus, the energy detector is
    prone to the false detection triggered by the unintended signals. 4.1.3. Cyclostationary
    feature detection An alternative detection method is the cyclostationary feature
    detection [12], [22], [57]. Modulated signals are in general coupled with sine
    wave carriers, pulse trains, repeating spreading, hopping sequences, or cyclic
    prefixes, which result in built-in periodicity. These modulated signals are characterized
    as cyclostationarity since their mean and autocorrelation exhibit periodicity.
    These features are detected by analyzing a spectral correlation function. The
    main advantage of the spectral correlation function is that it differentiates
    the noise energy from modulated signal energy, which is a result of the fact that
    the noise is a wide-sense stationary signal with no correlation, while modulated
    signals are cyclostationary with spectral correlation due to the embedded redundancy
    of signal periodicity. Therefore, a cyclostationary feature detector can perform
    better than the energy detector in discriminating against noise due to its robustness
    to the uncertainty in noise power [57]. However, it is computationally complex
    and requires significantly long observation time. For more efficient and reliable
    performance, the enhanced feature detection scheme combining cyclic spectral analysis
    with pattern recognition based on neural networks is proposed in [22]. Distinct
    features of the received signal are extracted using cyclic spectral analysis and
    represented by both spectral coherent function and spectral correlation density
    function. The neural network, then, classifies signals into different modulation
    types. 4.2. Cooperative detection The assumption of the primary transmitter detection
    is that the locations of the primary receivers are unknown due to the absence
    of signalling between primary users and the xG users. Therefore, the cognitive
    radio should rely on only weak primary transmitter signals based on the local
    observation of the xG user [72], [73]. However, in most cases, an xG network is
    physically separated from the primary network so there is no interaction between
    them. Thus, with the transmitter detection, the xG user cannot avoid the interference
    due to the lack of the primary receiver’s information as depicted in Fig. 10(a).
    Moreover, the transmitter detection model cannot prevent the hidden terminal problem.
    An xG transmitter can have a good line-of-sight to a receiver, but may not be
    able to detect the transmitter due to the shadowing as shown in Fig. 10(b). Consequently,
    the sensing information from other users is required for more accurate detection.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Transmitter detection problem: (a)
    Receiver uncertainty and (b) shadowing uncertainty. In the case of non-cooperative
    detection explained in Section 4.1, the xG users detect the primary transmitter
    signal independently through their local observations. Cooperative detection refers
    to spectrum sensing methods where information from multiple xG users are incorporated
    for primary user detection. Cooperative detection can be implemented either in
    a centralized or in a distributed manner [23], [71]. In the centralized method,
    the xG base-station plays a role to gather all sensing information from the xG
    users and detect the spectrum holes. On the other hand, distributed solutions
    require exchange of observations among xG users. Cooperative detection among unlicensed
    users is theoretically more accurate since the uncertainty in a single user’s
    detection can be minimized [25]. Moreover, the multi-path fading and shadowing
    effect are the main factors that degrade the performance of primary user detection
    methods [44]. However, cooperative detection schemes allow to mitigate the multi-path
    fading and shadowing effects, which improves the detection probability in a heavily
    shadowed environment [25]. In [55], the limitation of non-cooperative spectrum
    sensing approaches is investigated. Generally, the data transmission and sensing
    function are co-located in a single xG user device. However, this architecture
    can result in suboptimal spectrum decision due to possible conflicts between data
    transmission and sensing. In order to solve this problem, in [55], two distinct
    networks are deployed separately, i.e., the sensor network for cooperative spectrum
    sensing and the operational network for data transmission. The sensor network
    is deployed in the desired target area and senses the spectrum. A central controller
    processes the spectrum information collected from sensors and makes the spectrum
    occupancy map for the operational network. The operational network uses this information
    to determine the available spectrum. While cooperative approaches provide more
    accurate sensing performance, they cause adverse effects on resource-constrained
    networks due to the additional operations and overhead traffic. Furthermore, the
    primary receiver uncertainty problem caused by the lack of the primary receiver
    location knowledge is still unsolved in the cooperative sensing. In the following
    section, we explain interference-based detection methods, which aim to address
    these problems. 4.3. Interference-based detection Interference is typically regulated
    in a transmitter-centric way, which means interference can be controlled at the
    transmitter through the radiated power, the out-of-band emissions and location
    of individual transmitters. However, interference actually takes place at the
    receivers, as shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b). Therefore recently, a new model for
    measuring interference, referred to as interference temperature shown in Fig.
    11 has been introduced by the FCC [21]. The model shows the signal of a radio
    station designed to operate in a range at which the received power approaches
    the level of the noise floor. As additional interfering signals appear, the noise
    floor increases at various points within the service area, as indicated by the
    peaks above the original noise floor. Unlike the traditional transmitter-centric
    approach, the interference temperature model manages interference at the receiver
    through the interference temperature limit, which is represented by the amount
    of new interference that the receiver could tolerate. In other words, the interference
    temperature model accounts for the cumulative RF energy from multiple transmissions
    and sets a maximum cap on their aggregate level. As long as xG users do not exceed
    this limit by their transmissions, they can use this spectrum band. Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 11. Interference temperature model [21]. However,
    there exist some limitations in measuring the interference temperature. In [9],
    the interference is defined as the expected fraction of primary users with service
    disrupted by the xG operations. This method considers factors such as the type
    of unlicensed signal modulation, antennas, ability to detect active licensed channels,
    power control, and activity levels of the licensed and unlicensed users. However,
    this model describes the interference disrupted by a single xG user and does not
    consider the effect of multiple xG users. In addition, if xG users are unaware
    of the location of the nearby primary users, the actual interference cannot be
    measured using this method. In [63], a direct receiver detection method is presented,
    where the local oscillator (LO) leakage power emitted by the RF front-end of the
    primary receiver is exploited for the detection of primary receivers. In order
    to detect the LO leakage power, low-cost sensor nodes can be mounted close to
    the primary receivers. The sensor nodes detect the leakage LO power to determine
    the channel used by the primary receiver and this information is used by the unlicensed
    users to determine the operation spectrum. 4.4. Spectrum sensing challenges There
    exist several open research challenges that need to be investigated for the development
    of the spectrum sensing function. • Interference temperature measurement: The
    difficulty of this receiver detection model lies in effectively measuring the
    interference temperature. An xG user is naturally aware of its transmit power
    level and its precise location with the help of a positioning system. With this
    ability, however, its transmission could cause significant interference at a neighboring
    receiver on the same frequency. However, currently, there exists no practical
    way for a cognitive radio to measure or estimate the interference temperature
    at nearby primary receivers. Since primary receivers are usually passive devices,
    an xG user cannot be aware of the precise locations of primary receivers. Furthermore,
    if xG users cannot measure the effect of their transmission on all possible receivers,
    a useful interference temperature measurement may not be feasible. • Spectrum
    sensing in multi-user networks: Usually, xG networks reside in a multi-user environment
    which consists of multiple xG users and primary users. Furthermore, the xG networks
    can also be co-located with other xG networks competing for the same spectrum
    band. However, current interference models [9], [21] do not consider the effect
    of multiple xG users. Multi-user environment makes it more difficult to sense
    the primary users and to estimate the actual interference. Hence, spectrum sensing
    functions should be developed considering the possibility of multi-user/network
    environment. In order to solve the multi-user problem, the cooperative detection
    schemes can be considered, which exploit the spatial diversity inherent in a multi-user
    network. • Detection capability: One of the main requirements of xG networks is
    the detection of the primary users in a very short time [24], [53]. OFDM-based
    xG networks are known to be excellent fit for the physical architecture of xG
    networks [5], [57], [62]. Since multi-carrier sensing can be exploited in OFDM-based
    xG networks, the overall sensing time can be reduced. Once a primary user is detected
    in a single carrier, sensing in other carriers is not necessary. In [57], a power-based
    sensing algorithm in OFDM networks is proposed for detecting the presence of a
    primary user. It is shown that the overall detection time is reduced by collecting
    information from each carrier. However, this necessitates the use of a large number
    of carriers, which increases the design complexity. Hence, novel spectrum sensing
    algorithms need to be developed such that the number of samples needed to detect
    the primary user is minimized within a given detection error probability. 5. Spectrum
    management In xG networks, the unused spectrum bands will be spread over wide
    frequency range including both unlicensed and licensed bands. These unused spectrum
    bands detected through spectrum sensing show different characteristics according
    to not only the time varying radio environment but also the spectrum band information
    such as the operating frequency and the bandwidth. Since xG networks should decide
    on the best spectrum band to meet the QoS requirements over all available spectrum
    bands, new spectrum management functions are required for xG networks, considering
    the dynamic spectrum characteristics. We classify these functions as spectrum
    sensing, spectrum analysis, and spectrum decision. While spectrum sensing, which
    is discussed in Section 4, is primarily a PHY layer issue, spectrum analysis and
    spectrum decision are closely related to the upper layers. In this section, spectrum
    analysis and spectrum decision are investigated. 5.1. Spectrum analysis In xG
    networks, the available spectrum holes show different characteristics which vary
    over time. Since the xG users are equipped with the cognitive radio based physical
    layer, it is important to understand the characteristics of different spectrum
    bands. Spectrum analysis enables the characterization of different spectrum bands,
    which can be exploited to get the spectrum band appropriate to the user requirements.
    In order to describe the dynamic nature of xG networks, each spectrum hole should
    be characterized considering not only the time-varying radio environment and but
    also the primary user activity and the spectrum band information such as operating
    frequency and bandwidth. Hence, it is essential to define parameters such as interference
    level, channel error rate, path-loss, link layer delay, and holding time that
    can represent the quality of a particular spectrum band as follows: • Interference:
    Some spectrum bands are more crowded compared to others. Hence, the spectrum band
    in use determines the interference characteristics of the channel. From the amount
    of the interference at the primary receiver, the permissible power of an xG user
    can be derived, which is used for the estimation of the channel capacity. • Path
    loss: The path loss increases as the operating frequency increases. Therefore,
    if the transmission power of an xG user remains the same, then its transmission
    range decreases at higher frequencies. Similarly, if transmission power is increased
    to compensate for the increased path loss, then this results in higher interference
    for other users. • Wireless link errors: Depending on the modulation scheme and
    the interference level of the spectrum band, the error rate of the channel changes.
    • Link layer delay: To address different path loss, wireless link error, and interference,
    different types of link layer protocols are required at different spectrum bands.
    This results in different link layer packet transmission delay. • Holding time:
    The activities of primary users can affect the channel quality in xG networks.
    Holding time refers to the expected time duration that the xG user can occupy
    a licensed band before getting interrupted. Obviously, the longer the holding
    time, the better the quality would be. Since frequent spectrum handoff can decrease
    the holding time, previous statistical patterns of handoff should be considered
    while designing xG networks with large expected holding time. Channel capacity,
    which can be derived from the parameters explained above, is the most important
    factor for spectrum characterization. Usually SNR at the receiver has been used
    for the capacity estimation. However, since SNR considers only local observations
    of xG users, it is not enough to avoid interference at the primary users. Thus,
    spectrum characterization is focused on the capacity estimation based on the interference
    at the licensed receivers. The interference temperature model [21] given in Section
    4.3 can be exploited for this approach. The interference temperature limit indicates
    an upper bound or cap on the potential RF energy that could be introduced into
    the band. Consequently, using the amount of permissible interference, the maximum
    permissible transmission power of an xG user can be determined. In [63], a spectrum
    capacity estimation method has been proposed that considers the bandwidth and
    the permissible transmission power. Accordingly, the spectrum capacity, C, can
    be estimated as follows: (5) where B is the bandwidth, S is the received signal
    power from the xG user, N is the xG receiver noise power, and I is the interference
    power received at the xG receiver due to the primary transmitter. Estimating spectrum
    capacity has also been investigated in the context of OFDM-based cognitive radio
    systems in [57]. Accordingly, the spectrum capacity of the OFDM-based xG networks
    is defined as follows [57]: (6) where Ω is the collection of unused spectrum segments,
    G(f) is the channel power gain at frequency f, S0 and N0 are the signal and noise
    power per unit frequency, respectively. The recent work on spectrum analysis,
    as discussed above, only focuses on spectrum capacity estimation. However, besides
    the capacity, other factors such as delay, link error rate, and holding time also
    have significant influence on the quality of services. Moreover, the capacity
    is closely related to both interference level and path loss. However, a complete
    analysis and modeling of spectrum in xG networks is yet to be developed. In order
    to decide on the appropriate spectrum for different types of applications, it
    is desirable and an open research issue to identify the spectrum bands combining
    all characterization parameters described above. 5.2. Spectrum decision Once all
    available spectrum bands are characterized, appropriate operating spectrum band
    should be selected for the current transmission considering the QoS requirements
    and the spectrum characteristics. Thus, the spectrum management function must
    be aware of user QoS requirements. Based on the user requirements, the data rate,
    acceptable error rate, delay bound, the transmission mode, and the bandwidth of
    the transmission can be determined. Then, according to the decision rule, the
    set of appropriate spectrum bands can be chosen. In [73], five spectrum decision
    rules are presented, which are focused on fairness and communication cost. However,
    this method assumes that all channels have similar throughput capacity. In [36],
    an opportunistic frequency channel skipping protocol is proposed for the search
    of better quality channel, where this channel decision is based on SNR. In order
    to consider the primary user activity, the number of spectrum handoff, which happens
    in a certain spectrum band, is used for spectrum decision [37]. Spectrum decision
    constitutes rather important but yet unexplored issues in xG networks, which are
    presented in the following subsection. 5.3. Spectrum management challenges There
    exist several open research issues that need to be investigated for the development
    of spectrum decision function. • Decision model: Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is
    not sufficient to characterize the spectrum band in xG networks. Besides the SNR,
    many spectrum characterization parameters would affect the quality, as investigated
    in Section 5.1. Thus, how to combine these spectrum characterization parameters
    for the spectrum decision model is still an open issue. Moreover, in OFDM based
    xG networks, multiple spectrum bands can be simultaneously used for the transmission.
    For these reasons, a decision framework for the multiple spectrum bands should
    be provided. • Multiple spectrum band decision: In xG networks, multiple spectrum
    bands can be simultaneously used for the transmission. Moreover, the xG networks
    do not require the selected multiple bands to be contiguous. Thus, an xG user
    can send packets over non-contiguous spectrum bands. This multi-spectrum transmission
    shows less quality degradation during the spectrum handoff compared to the conventional
    transmission on single spectrum band [5]. For example, if a primary user appears
    in a particular spectrum band, the xG user has to vacate this band. However, since
    the rest of spectrum bands will maintain the communication, abrupt service quality
    degradation can be mitigated. In addition, transmission in multiple spectrum bands
    allows lower power to be used in each spectrum band. As a result, less interference
    with primary users is achieved, compared to the transmission on single spectrum
    band [5]. For these reasons, a spectrum management framework should support multiple
    spectrum decision capabilities. For example, how to determine the number of spectrum
    bands and how to select the set of appropriate bands are still open research issues
    in xG networks. • Cooperation with reconfiguration: The cognitive radio technology
    enables the transmission parameters of a radio to be reconfigured for optimal
    operation in a certain spectrum band. For example, if SNR is fixed, the bit error
    rate (BER) can be adjusted to maintain the channel capacity by exploiting adaptive
    modulation techniques, e.g., cdma2000 1x EVDO [1], [18]. Hence, a cooperative
    framework that considers both spectrum decision and reconfiguration is required.
    • Spectrum decision over heterogenous spectrum bands: Currently, certain spectrum
    bands are already assigned to different purposes while some bands remain unlicensed.
    Thus, the spectrum used by xG networks will most likely be a combination of exclusively
    accessed spectrum and unlicensed spectrum. In case of licensed bands, the xG users
    need to consider the activities of primary users in spectrum analysis and decision
    in order not to influence the primary user transmission. Conversely, in unlicensed
    bands, since all the xG users have the same spectrum access rights, sophisticated
    spectrum sharing techniques are necessary. In order to decide the best spectrum
    band over this heterogeneous environment, xG network should support spectrum decision
    operations on both the licensed and the unlicensed bands considering these different
    characteristics. 6. Spectrum mobility xG networks target to use the spectrum in
    a dynamic manner by allowing the radio terminals, known as the cognitive radio,
    to operate in the best available frequency band. This enables “Get the Best Available
    Channel” concept for communication purposes. To realize the “Get the Best Available
    Channel” concept, an xG radio has to capture the best available spectrum. Spectrum
    mobility is defined as the process when an xG user changes its frequency of operation.
    In the following sections, we describe the spectrum handoff concept in xG networks
    and discuss open research issues in this new area. 6.1. Spectrum handoff In xG
    networks, spectrum mobility arises when current channel conditions become worse
    or a primary user appears. Spectrum mobility gives rise to a new type of handoff
    in xG networks that we refer to as spectrum handoff. The protocols for different
    layers of the network stack must adapt to the channel parameters of the operating
    frequency. Moreover, they should be transparent to the spectrum handoff and the
    associated latency. As pointed out in earlier sections, a cognitive radio can
    adapt to the frequency of operation. Therefore, each time an xG user changes its
    frequency of operation, the network protocols are going to shift from one mode
    of operation to another. The purpose of spectrum mobility management in xG networks
    is to make sure that such transitions are made smoothly and as soon as possible
    such that the applications running on an xG user perceive minimum performance
    degradation during a spectrum handoff. It is essential for the mobility management
    protocols to learn in advance about the duration of a spectrum handoff. This information
    should be provided by the sensing algorithm. Once the mobility management protocols
    learn about this latency, their job is to make sure that the ongoing communications
    of an xG user undergo only minimum performance degradation. Consequently, multi-layer
    mobility management protocols are required to accomplish the spectrum mobility
    functionalities. These protocols support mobility management adaptive to different
    types of applications. For example, a TCP connection can be put to a wait state
    until the spectrum handoff is over. Moreover, since the TCP parameters will change
    after a spectrum handoff, it is essential to learn the new parameters and ensure
    that the transition from the old parameters to new parameters are carried out
    rapidly. For a data communication e.g., FTP, the mobility management protocols
    should implement mechanisms to store the packets that are transmitted during a
    spectrum handoff, whereas for a real-time application there is no need to store
    the packets as the stored packets, if delivered later, will be stale packets and
    can not be used by the corresponding application. 6.2. Spectrum mobility challenges
    in xG networks The followings are the open research issues for efficient spectrum
    mobility in xG networks. • At a particular time, several frequency bands may be
    available for an xG user. Algorithms are required to decide the best available
    spectrum based on the channel characteristics of the available spectrum and the
    requirements of the applications that are being used by an xG user. • Once, the
    best available spectrum is selected, the next challenge is to design new mobility
    and connection management approaches to reduce delay and loss during spectrum
    handoff. • When the current operational frequency becomes busy (this may happen
    if a licensed user starts to use this frequency) in the middle of a communication
    by an xG user, then applications running on this node have to be transferred to
    another available frequency band. However, the selection of new operational frequency
    may take time. Novel algorithms are required to ensure that applications do not
    suffer from severe performance degradation during such transitions. • Spectrum
    handoff may occur due to reasons other than the detection of the primary user.
    Thus, there exist various other spectrum handoff schemes in xG networks. If an
    xG user moves from one place to another, spectrum handoff may occur just because
    the available spectrum bands change. Thus the desired spectrum handoff scheme
    should integrate inter-cell handoff. Apart from this, spectrum handoff between
    different networks, referred to as vertical handoff is also likely to occur in
    xG networks. Under such a diverse environment, it is essential that spectrum handoff
    scheme takes all the above mentioned possibilities into consideration. • Spectrum
    mobility in time domain: xG networks adapt to the wireless spectrum based on available
    bands on the spectrum. Since these available channels change over time, enabling
    QoS in this environment is challenging. The physical radio should “move” through
    the spectrum to meet the QoS requirements. • Spectrum mobility in space: The available
    bands also change as a user moves from one place to another. Hence, continuous
    allocation of spectrum is a major challenge. in xG networks. 7. Spectrum sharing
    In xG networks, one of the main challenges in open spectrum usage is the spectrum
    sharing. Spectrum sharing can be regarded to be similar to generic medium access
    control (MAC) problems in existing systems. However, as we will investigate in
    this section, substantially different challenges exist for spectrum sharing in
    xG networks. The coexistence with licensed users and the wide range of available
    spectrum are two of the main reasons for these unique challenges. In this section,
    we delve into the specific challenges for spectrum sharing in xG networks, overview
    the existing solutions and discuss open research areas. In order to provide a
    directory for different challenges during spectrum sharing, we first enumerate
    the steps in spectrum sharing in xG networks. The challenges and the solutions
    proposed for these steps will then be explained in detail. The spectrum sharing
    process consists of five major steps. 1. Spectrum sensing: An xG user can only
    allocate a portion of the spectrum if that portion is not used by an unlicensed
    user. In Section 4, the solutions and the challenges for this problem, i.e., spectrum
    sensing, are described. Accordingly, when an xG node aims to transmit packets,
    it first needs to be aware of the spectrum usage around its vicinity. 2. Spectrum
    allocation: Based on the spectrum availability, the node can then allocate a channel.
    This allocation not only depends on spectrum availability, but it is also determined
    based on internal (and possibly external) policies. Hence, the design of a spectrum
    allocation policy to improve the performance of a node is an important research
    topic. 3. Spectrum access: In this step, another major problem of spectrum sharing
    comes into picture. Since there may be multiple xG nodes trying to access the
    spectrum, this access should also be coordinated in order to prevent multiple
    users colliding in overlapping portions of the spectrum. 4. Transmitter-receiver
    handshake: Once a portion of the spectrum is determined for communication, the
    receiver of this communication should also be indicated about the selected spectrum.
    Hence, a transmitter-receiver handshake protocol is essential for efficient communication
    in xG networks. Note that the term handshake by no means restricts this protocol
    between the transmitter and the receiver. A third party such as a centralized
    station can also be involved. 5. Spectrum mobility: xG nodes are regarded as “visitors”
    to the spectrum they allocate. Hence, if the specific portion of the spectrum
    in use is required by a licensed user, the communication needs to be continued
    in another vacant portion. As a result, spectrum mobility is also important for
    successful communication between xG nodes. The existing work in spectrum sharing
    in xG networks aims to provide solutions for each step explained above. The existing
    solutions constitute a rich literature for spectrum sharing in xG networks. In
    Section 7.1, we classify the spectrum sharing techniques and describe the fundamental
    results about these techniques in xG networks. These work provide insight about
    how a spectrum sharing protocol can be designed. Accordingly, in Sections 7.2
    Inter-network spectrum sharing, 7.3 Intra-network spectrum sharing, we overview
    the solutions for spectrum sharing among multiple coexisting xG networks (inter-network
    spectrum sharing), and inside an xG network (intra-network spectrum sharing),
    respectively. Finally, in Section 7.4, the open research issues for spectrum sharing
    in xG networks are discussed. 7.1. Overview of spectrum sharing techniques The
    existing solutions for spectrum sharing in xG networks can be mainly classified
    in three aspects: i.e., according to their architecture assumption, spectrum allocation
    behavior, and spectrum access technique as shown in Fig. 12. In this section,
    we describe these three classifications and present the fundamental results that
    analyze these classifications. The analysis of xG spectrum sharing techniques
    has been investigated through two major theoretical approaches. While some work
    uses optimization techniques to find the optimal strategies for spectrum sharing,
    game theoretical analysis has also been used in this area. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. Classification of spectrum sharing in xG networks based
    on architecture, spectrum allocation behavior, and spectrum access technique.
    The first classification for spectrum sharing techniques in xG networks is based
    on the architecture, which can be described as follows: • Centralized spectrum
    sharing: In these solutions, a centralized entity controls the spectrum allocation
    and access procedures [7], [51], [70]. With aid to these procedures, generally,
    a distributed sensing procedure is proposed such that each entity in the xG network
    forward their measurements about the spectrum allocation to the central entity
    and this entity constructs a spectrum allocation map. • Distributed spectrum sharing:
    Distributed solutions are mainly proposed for cases where the construction of
    an infrastructure is not preferable [15], [29], [40], [54], [71], [72], [73].
    Accordingly, each node is responsible for the spectrum allocation and access is
    based on local (or possibly global) policies. The second classification for spectrum
    sharing techniques in xG networks is based on the access behavior. More specifically,
    the spectrum access can be cooperative or non-cooperative as explained below:
    • Cooperative spectrum sharing: Cooperative (or collaborative) solutions consider
    the effect of the node’s communication on other nodes [7], [15], [29], [40], [71].
    In other words, the interference measurements of each node are shared among other
    nodes. Furthermore, the spectrum allocation algorithms also consider this information.
    While all the centralized solutions can be regarded as cooperative, there also
    exist distributed cooperative solutions. • Non-cooperative spectrum sharing: Contrary
    to the cooperative solutions, non-cooperative (or non-collaborative, selfish)
    solutions consider only the node at hand [54], [72], [73]. These solutions are
    also referred to as selfish. While non-cooperative solutions may result in reduced
    spectrum utilization, the minimal communication requirements among other nodes
    introduce a tradeoff for practical solutions. These two solutions have generally
    been compared through their spectrum utilization, fairness, and throughput. The
    utilization and fairness in spectrum access has been investigated in [50], where
    the spectrum allocation problem is modeled as a graph coloring problem and both
    centralized and distributed approaches are investigated. Using this model, an
    optimization framework is developed. In this framework, secondary users allocate
    channels according to the interference that will be caused by the transmission.
    Both cooperative and non-cooperative approaches are considered such that cooperative
    approaches also consider the effect of the channel allocation on the potential
    neighbors. The simulation results show that cooperative approaches outperform
    non-cooperative approaches as well as closely approximating the global optimum.
    Moreover, the comparison of centralized and distributed solutions reveals that
    distributed solution closely follows the centralized solution. A similar analysis
    has also been provided in [74], where the effects of collaboration in spectrum
    access is investigated. An important assumption in these work is that secondary
    users know the location and transmit power of primary users so that the interference
    calculations can be performed easily. However, such an assumption may not always
    be valid in xG networks. Game theory has also been exploited for performance evaluation
    of xG spectrum access schemes. Especially, the comparison between cooperative
    and non-cooperative approaches has been presented in [49] through game theoretical
    analysis. In [49], game theory is exploited to analyze the behavior of the cognitive
    radio for distributed adaptive channel allocation. It is assumed that users deploy
    CDMA and determine the operating channel and the coding rate by keeping transmission
    power constant. It is shown that the cooperative case can be modeled as an exact
    potential game, which converges to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium solution.
    However, this framework has been shown not to be applicable for non-cooperative
    spectrum sharing and a learning algorithm has been proposed. The evaluations reveal
    that Nash equilibrium point for cooperative users is reached quickly and results
    in a certain degree of fairness as well as improved throughput. On the other hand,
    the learning algorithm for non-cooperative users converge to a mixed strategy
    allocation. Moreover, the fairness is degraded when non-cooperative approach is
    used. While this approach results in slightly worse performance, the information
    exchange required by selfish users is significantly low. Finally, the third classification
    for spectrum sharing in xG networks is based on the access technology as explained
    below: • Overlay spectrum sharing: Overlay spectrum sharing refers to the spectrum
    access technique used. More specifically, a node accesses the network using a
    portion of the spectrum that has not been used by licensed users [7], [15], [40],
    [54], [71], [72], [73]. As a result, interference to the primary system is minimized.
    • Underlay spectrum sharing: Underlay spectrum sharing exploits the spread spectrum
    techniques developed for cellular networks [29]. Once a spectrum allocation map
    has been acquired, an xG node begins transmission such that its transmit power
    at a certain portion of the spectrum is regarded as noise by the licensed users.
    This technique requires sophisticated spread spectrum techniques and can utilize
    increased bandwidth compared to overlay techniques. The effects of underlay and
    overlay approaches in a cooperative setting are investigated in [19], where non-cooperative
    users are analyzed using a game theoretical framework. Using this framework, it
    is shown that frequency division multiplexing is optimal when interference among
    users is high. As a result, the overlay approach becomes more efficient than underlay
    when interference among users is high. The lack of cooperation among users, however,
    necessitates an overlay approach. The comparative evaluations show that the performance
    loss due to the lack of cooperation is small, and vanishes with increasing SNR.
    However, in this framework, the cost and inaccuracies of information exchange
    between users are not considered. Another comparison of underlay and overlay approaches
    is provided in [42]. The comparison is based on the influence of the secondary
    system on the primary system in terms of outage probability and three spectrum
    sharing techniques have been considered. The first technique (spreading based
    underlay) requires secondary users to spread their transmit power over the full
    spectrum such as CDMA or Ultra Wide Band (UWB). The second technique (interference
    avoidance overlay) requires nodes to choose a frequency band to transmit such
    that the interference at a primary user is minimized. Also an hybrid technique
    (spreading based underlay with interference avoidance) is investigated where a
    node spreads its transmission over the entire spectrum and also null or notch
    frequencies where a primary user is transmitting. Consequently, first, the interference
    statistics for each technique are determined for outage probability analysis.
    Then, the outage probability for each technique is derived assuming no system
    knowledge, perfect system knowledge, and limited system knowledge. Similar to
    other existing work, when perfect system knowledge is assumed, the overlay scheme
    outperforms the underlay scheme in terms of outage probability. However, when
    interference avoidance is incorporated into spectrum sharing, the underlay scheme
    with interference avoidance guarantees smaller outage probability than the pure
    interference avoidance. In a more realistic case, when limited system knowledge
    is considered, the importance of the hybrid technique is exacerbated. The overlay
    schemes result in poor performance due imperfections at spectrum sensing. More
    specifically, a node can transmit at a channel where a primary user is transmitting.
    However, when underlay with interference avoidance is used, the interference caused
    to the primary user is minimized. Another important result is that a higher number
    of secondary users can be accommodated by the hybrid scheme than the pure interference
    avoidance scheme. The theoretical work on spectrum access in xG networks reveals
    important tradeoffs for the design of spectrum access protocols. As expected,
    it has been shown that cooperative settings result in higher utilization of the
    spectrum as well as fairness. However, this advantage may not be so high considering
    the cost of cooperation due to frequent information exchange among users. On the
    other hand, the spectrum access technique, i.e., whether it is overlay or underlay,
    affects the performance in each setting. While an overlay technique focuses on
    the holes in the spectrum, dynamic spreading techniques are required for underlay
    techniques for interference-free operation between primary and secondary systems.
    Considering the tradeoff between system complexity and performance, hybrid techniques
    may be considered for the spectrum technique. In the following two sections, we
    explain the existing spectrum sharing techniques that are combinations of the
    three classifications we have discussed in this section. 7.2. Inter-network spectrum
    sharing xG networks are envisioned to provide opportunistic access to the licensed
    spectrum using unlicensed users. This setting enables multiple systems being deployed
    in overlapping locations and spectrum as shown in Fig. 13. Hence, spectrum sharing
    among these systems is an important research topic in xG networks. Up to date,
    inter-network spectrum sharing has been regulated via static frequency assignment
    among different systems or centralized allocations between different access points
    of a system in cellular networks. In ad-hoc networks, only the interference issues
    in the ISM band has been investigated focusing mostly on the coexistence of WLAN
    and Bluetooth networks. Consequently, intra-network spectrum sharing in xG networks
    poses unique challenges that have not been considered before in wireless communication
    systems. In this section, we overview the recent work in this research area. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Inter-network and intra-network spectrum sharing
    in xG networks. 7.2.1. Centralized inter-network spectrum sharing As a first step
    for the coexistence of open spectrum systems, in [33], the common spectrum coordination
    channel (CSCC) etiquette protocol is proposed for coexistence of IEEE 802.11b
    and 802.16a networks. The reason we do not consider this work as a complete solution
    for xG networks is that it necessitates modifications in users using both of the
    networks. More specifically, each node is assumed to be equipped with a cognitive
    radio and a low bit-rate, narrow-band control radio. The coexistence is maintained
    through the coordination of these nodes with each other by broadcasting CSCC messages.
    Each user determines the channel it can use for data transmission such that interference
    is avoided. In case channel selection is not sufficient to avoid interference,
    power adaptation is also deployed. The evaluations reveal that when there is vacant
    spectrum to use frequency adaptation, CSCC etiquette protocol improves throughput
    by 35–160% via both frequency and power adaptation. Another interesting result
    is that when nodes are clustered around IEEE 802.11b access points, which is a
    realistic assumption, the throughput improvement of CSCC protocol increases. In
    addition to the competition for the spectrum, competition for the users is also
    considered in [32]. In this work, a central spectrum policy server (SPS) is proposed
    to coordinate spectrum demands of multiple xG operators. In this scheme, each
    operator bids for the spectrum indicating the cost it will pay for the duration
    of the usage. The SPS then allocates the spectrum by maximizing its profit from
    these bids. The operators also determine an offer for the users and users select
    which operator to use for a given type of traffic. When compared to a case where
    each operator is assigned an equal share of the spectrum, the operator bidding
    scheme achieves higher throughput leading to higher revenue for the SPS, as well
    as a lower price for the users according to their requirements. This work opens
    a new perspective by incorporating competition for users as well as the spectrum
    in xG networks. 7.2.2. Distributed inter-network spectrum sharing A distributed
    spectrum sharing scheme for wireless Internet service provides (WISPs) that share
    the same spectrum is proposed in [43], where a distributed QoS based dynamic channel
    reservation (D-QDCR) scheme is used. The basic concept behind D-QDCR is that a
    base station (BSs) of a WISP competes with its interferer BSs according to the
    QoS requirements of its users to allocate a portion of the spectrum. Similar to
    the CSCC protocol [33], the control and data channels are separated. The basic
    unit for channel allocation in D-QDCR is called Q-frames. When a BS allocates
    a Q-frame, it uses the control and data channels allocated to it for coordination
    and data communication between the users. The competition between BSs are performed
    according to the priority of each BS depending on a BSs data volume and QoS requirement.
    Moreover, various competition policies are proposed based on the type of traffic
    a user demands. Although thorough evaluations are not provided in [43], the D-QDCR
    scheme serves an important contribution for inter-network spectrum sharing. The
    inter-network spectrum sharing solutions so far provide a broader view of the
    spectrum sharing solution including certain operator policies for the determination
    of the spectrum allocation. A major problem for the existing solutions in the
    xG network architecture is the requirement for a common control channel. We detail
    the potential problems and open research issues in this aspect in Section 7.4.
    7.3. Intra-network spectrum sharing A significant amount of work on spectrum sharing
    focuses on intra-network spectrum sharing, where the users of an xG network try
    to access the available spectrum without causing interference to the primary users.
    In this section, we overview the existing work and the proposed solutions in this
    area while providing a classification of existing protocols in terms of the classification
    provided in Section 7.1. 7.3.1. Cooperative intra-network spectrum sharing A cooperative
    local bargaining (LB) scheme is proposed in [15] to provide both spectrum utilization
    and fairness. The local bargaining framework is formulated based on the framework
    in [50], [74]. Local bargaining is performed by constructing local groups according
    to a poverty line that ensures a minimum spectrum allocation to each user and
    hence focuses on fairness of users. The evaluations reveal that local bargaining
    can closely approximate centralized graph coloring approach at a reduced complexity.
    Moreover, localized operation via grouping provides an efficient operation between
    a fully distributed and a centralized scheme. Another approach that considers
    local groups for spectrum sharing is provided in [71], where a heterogeneous distributed
    MAC (HD-MAC) protocol is proposed. A potential problem in the solution provided
    in LB [15] is that a common control channel may not exist in xG networks or can
    be occupied by a primary user. In [71], it is shown that for a given topology,
    very limited number of common channels exist for each of the users in a network.
    However, when local neighbors are considered, a node shares many channels with
    its neighbors. Based on this observation, a clustering algorithm is proposed such
    that each group selects a common channel for communication, and distributed sensing
    and spectrum sharing is provided through this channel. Moreover, if this channel
    is occupied by a primary user at a specific time, the nodes reorganize themselves
    to use another control channel. The performance evaluations show that the distributed
    grouping approach outperforms common control channel approaches especially when
    the traffic load is high. The notion of busy tones, which are mainly used in some
    ad-hoc network protocols, is extended to the xG networks in [40] with the dynamic
    open spectrum sharing MAC (DOSS-MAC) protocol. As a result, when a node is using
    a specific data channel for communication, both the transmitter and the receiver
    send a busy tone signal through the associated busy tone channel. In order to
    further eliminate control channel communication, FFT-based radio and the noncoherent
    modulation/demodulation-based radio designs are proposed which theoretically enable
    receivers to detect the carrier frequency and the bandwidth of a signal without
    any control information. In addition to spectrum allocation, transmit power determination
    is also included in the spectrum sharing protocol in [29]. In this work both single
    channel and multi-channel asynchronous distributed pricing (SC/MC-ADP) schemes
    are proposed, where each node announces its interference price to other nodes.
    Using this information from its neighbors, a node can first allocate a channel
    and in case there exist users in that channel, then, determine its transmit power.
    As a result, this scheme can be classified as a hybrid of underlay and overlay
    techniques. While there exist users using distinct channels, multiple users can
    share the same channel by adjusting their transmit power. Furthermore, the SC-ADP
    algorithm provides higher rates to users when compared to selfish algorithms where
    users select the best channel without any knowledge about their neighbors’ interference
    levels. Finally, it is shown that under high interference, the proposed algorithm
    outperforms underlay techniques. So far, we have presented distributed solutions
    where a fixed infrastructure is not assumed. In [7], dynamic spectrum access protocol
    (DSAP), which is a centralized solution for spectrum sharing in xG networks, is
    presented. This solution is similar to the SPS approach [32] described in Section
    7.2 with a focus on intra-network spectrum sharing. The dynamic spectrum access
    protocol (DSAP) proposed in this work enables a central entity to lease spectrum
    to users in a limited geographical region. DSAP consists of clients, DSAP server,
    and relays that relay information between server and clients that are not in the
    direct range of the server. Moreover, clients inform the server their channel
    conditions so that a global view of the network can be constructed at the server.
    By exploiting cooperative and distributed sensing, DSAP servers construct a RadioMap.
    This map is used for channel assignments which are leased to clients for a limited
    amount of time. 7.3.2. Non-cooperative intra-network spectrum sharing An opportunistic
    spectrum management scheme is proposed in [73], where users allocate channels
    based on their observations of interference patterns and neighbors. In the device
    centric spectrum management scheme (DCSM), the communication overhead is minimized
    by providing five different system rules for spectrum allocation. As a result,
    users allocate channels according to these rules based on their observations instead
    of collaborating with other users. In case more than one node chooses the same
    channel in close proximity, random access techniques are used to resolve the contention.
    The comparative analysis of this scheme with the cooperative schemes show that
    rule-based spectrum access results in slightly worse performance. However, the
    communication overhead is reduced significantly. A spectrum sharing protocol for
    ad-hoc xG networks, (AS-MAC), is proposed in [54]. AS-MAC exploits the RTS-CTS
    exchange and Network Allocation Vector (NAV) concepts of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol
    [30] in an open spectrum setting. Moreover, a common control channel is used such
    that transmitter receiver handshake is initiated through this channel. In this
    work, the xG network is assumed to coexist with a GSM network. Each node first
    listens to the broadcast channel of the GSM network as well as the control channel
    of the xG network, and each node then constructs its NAV and selects channels
    accordingly. In addition to the spectrum allocation methods, a transmitter receiver
    handshake method is proposed in [72] as a part of a cross-layer decentralized
    cognitive MAC (DC-MAC) protocol. The details of this work is explained in Section
    9. In the transmitter-receiver handshake method, each user is assigned a set of
    channels is continuously monitored by the user. A transmitter selects one of those
    channels and initiates communication. The actual data channel selection is then
    performed through this initial handshake channel. 7.4. Spectrum sharing challenges
    In the previous sections, the theoretical findings and solutions for spectrum
    sharing in xG networks are investigated. Although there already exists a vast
    amount of research in spectrum sharing, there are still many open research issues
    for the realization of efficient and seamless open spectrum operation. In the
    following, we detail the challenges for spectrum sharing in xG networks along
    with some possible solutions. 7.4.1. Common control channel (CCC) Many spectrum
    sharing solutions, either centralized or distributed, assume a CCC for spectrum
    sharing [7], [40], [54]. It is clear that a CCC facilitates many spectrum sharing
    functionalities such as transmitter receiver handshake [40], communication with
    a central entity [7], or sensing information exchange. However, due to the fact
    that xG network users are regarded as visitors to the spectrum they allocate,
    when a primary user chooses a channel, this channel has to be vacated without
    interfering. This is also true for the CCC. As a result, implementation of a fixed
    CCC is infeasible in xG networks. Moreover, in a network with primary users, a
    channel common for all users is shown to be highly dependent on the topology,
    hence, varies over time [71]. Consequently, for protocols requiring a CCC, either
    a CCC mitigation technique needs to be devised or local CCCs need to be exploited
    for clusters of nodes [71]. On the other hand when CCC is not used, the transmitter
    receiver handshake becomes a challenge. For this challenge, receiver driven techniques
    proposed in [72] may be exploited. 7.4.2. Dynamic radio range Radio range changes
    with operating frequency due to attenuation variation. In many solutions, a fixed
    range is assumed to be independent of the operating spectrum [15], [71]. However,
    in xG networks, where a large portion of the wireless spectrum is considered,
    the neighbors of a node may change as the operating frequency changes. This effects
    the interference profile as well as routing decisions. Moreover, due to this property,
    the choice of a control channel needs to be carefully decided. It would be much
    efficient to select control channels in the lower portions of the spectrum where
    the transmission range will be higher and to select data channels in the higher
    portions of the spectrum where a localized operation can be utilized with minimized
    interference. So far, there exists no work addressing this important challenge
    in xG networks and we advocate operation frequency aware spectrum sharing techniques
    due the direct interdependency between interference and radio range. 7.4.3. Spectrum
    unit Almost all spectrum sharing techniques discussed in the previous sections
    consider a channel as the basic spectrum unit for operation. Many algorithms and
    methods have been proposed to select the suitable channel for efficient operation
    in xG networks. However, in some work, the channel is vaguely defined as “orthogonal
    non-interfering” [73], “TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, or a combination of them” [50], or “a
    physical channel as in IEEE 802.11, or a logical channel associated with a spectrum
    region or a radio technology” [71]. In other work, the channel is simply defined
    in the frequency dimension as frequency bands [33], [40], [43], [49], [54]. It
    is clear that the definition of a channel as a spectrum unit for spectrum sharing
    is crucial in further developing algorithms. Since a huge portion of the spectrum
    is of interest, it is clear that properties of a channel may not be constant due
    to the effects of operating frequency. On the contrary, a channel is usually assumed
    to provide the same bandwidth as other channels [15], [29], [42], [50], [73].
    Furthermore, the existence of primary users and the heterogeneity of the networks
    that are available introduce additional challenges to the choice of a spectrum
    unit/channel. Hence, different resource allocation units such as CSMA random access,
    TDMA time slots, CDMA codes, as well as hybrid types can be allocated to the primary
    users. In order to provide seamless operation, these properties need to be considered
    in the choice of a spectrum unit. In [28], the necessity of a spectrum space for
    a spectrum unit is also advocated. The possible dimensions of the spectrum space
    are classified as power, frequency, time, space, and signal. Although not orthogonal,
    these dimensions can be used to distinguish signals [28]. For this purpose, we
    describe a three dimensional space model for modeling network resources that has
    been proposed in [59]. Although this work focuses on heterogeneity in next generation/fourth
    generation (NG/4G) networks, as discussed in [59], it can be easily incorporated
    into xG networks. Based on this three dimensional resource-space, a novel Virtual
    Cube concept has been proposed in order to evaluate the performance of each network.
    The Virtual Cube concept defines a unit structure based on the resource allocation
    techniques used in existing networks. The resource is modeled in a three dimensional
    resource-space with time, rate, and power/code dimensions as shown in Fig. 14.
    The time dimension models the time required to transfer information. The rate
    dimension models the data rate of the network. Thus, the capacity of different
    networks with the same connection durations but different data rates are captured
    in the rate dimension. Furthermore, in the case of CDMA networks, the bandwidth
    increase due to the multi-code transmissions is also captured in this dimension.
    The power/code dimension models the energy consumed for transmitting information
    through the network. Note that, the resource in terms of available bandwidth can
    be modeled using the time and rate dimensions. However, the cost of accessing
    different networks vary in terms of the power consumed by the wireless terminal.
    Hence, a third dimension is required. Each network type requires different power
    levels for transmission of the MAC frames because of various modulation schemes,
    error coding and channel coding techniques. As a result, the resource differences
    in these aspects are captured in the power dimension. Download : Download full-size

    in existing networks as well as xG network spectrum can be modeled based on a
    generic spectrum unit. We advocate that determining a common spectrum unit is
    crucial for efficient utilization of the wireless spectrum and seamless operability
    with existing primary networks. 8. Upper layer issues In addition to the unique
    challenges of xG networks in terms of spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum
    mobility, and spectrum sharing, upper layer issues such as routing, flow control
    and congestion control are also important for the realization of dynamic spectrum
    networks. In this section, we overview the challenges related to these areas.
    8.1. Routing challenges Routing constitutes a rather important but yet unexplored
    problem in xG networks. Especially in xG networks with multi-hop communication
    requirements, the unique characteristics of the open spectrum phenomenon necessitates
    novel routing algorithms to be developed. So far, the research on xG networks
    is primarily on spectrum sensing techniques and spectrum sharing solutions. However,
    we emphasize that the need for routing algorithms in open spectrum environment
    constitutes an important topic in xG network research. In this section, we overview
    two existing solutions for routing and discuss open research topics in this area.
    A major design choice for routing in xG networks is the collaboration between
    routing and spectrum management. The dynamic spectrum that is intermittent in
    terms of both time and space necessitates such an approach [60], [69]. Simulation-based
    comparisons are performed in [60], [69] for cross-layer and decoupled approaches
    for routing and spectrum management. The results in both of these work reveal
    that a cross-layer solution that constructs routes and determines the operating
    spectrum jointly for each hop outperforms a sequential approach where routes are
    selected independent of the spectrum allocation [60], [69]. In [60], the inter-dependence
    between route selection and spectrum management is investigated. First, a decoupled
    route selection and spectrum management methodology is proposed. In this scheme,
    the route selection is performed independent of the spectrum management using
    the shortest-path algorithm. The spectrum sharing is performed using the scheme
    in [71]. In this scheme, routing layer invokes path discovery to select routes.
    The spectrum management is then performed on each hop. A cross-layer solution
    that considers joint route selection and spectrum management is also proposed.
    In this approach, each source node uses DSR to find candidate paths and schedules
    a time and channel for each hop. This source-based routing technique is performed
    centrally using a global view of the network to show the upper bound in achievable
    performance. A similar comparison of layered and cross-layer approach is presented
    in [69] using a novel graph modeling technique, which will be discussed in the
    following. The simulations in both [60], [69] reveal that cross-layer approach
    is advantageous for routing in xG networks since the availability of spectrum
    directly affects the end-to-end performance. These two solutions for routing in
    xG networks clearly show that cross-layer approaches that jointly consider route
    and spectrum selection is necessary for xG networks. Another unique challenge
    for routing in xG networks is the development tools for analytical evaluation
    of routing protocols. Traditionally, routing protocols for ad hoc networks are
    analyzed using graph models. However, in these networks, the communication spectrum
    is fixed and continuous contrary to the dynamic nature of xG networks. Hence,
    a node can use the same set of static channel(s) for communication with all neighbors
    [69]. On the contrary, modeling network topology and connectivity of an xG network
    is challenging. In [69], a layered graph model is proposed for this challenge.
    In this model, each layer corresponds to a channel in the network. In each layer,
    each node is represented by subnodes forming the vertex in each layer. This model
    is exploited in [69] to construct routes. Using different cost functions for each
    edge, required constraints for routes such as interference avoidance can be achieved.
    This model provides an interesting solution for xG network modeling for relatively
    static link properties. However, as will be discussed in the following, time-varying
    nature of available links necessitates time dependent models for a complete analysis
    of xG networks. Although these solutions provide interesting results for routing
    in xG networks, there are still major challenges and open research topics that
    has not been addressed before. Below, we summarize the open research issues for
    routing in xG networks: • Common control channel: It has also been emphasized
    in Section 7.4 that the lack of a common control channel (CCC) in xG networks
    constitutes a major problem. Traditional routing protocols require either local
    or global broadcast messages for specific functionalities such as neighbor discovery,
    route discovery and route establishment. However, even broadcasting in xG networks
    is a major problem due to the lack of a CCC. Hence, solutions considering this
    fact is required in xG networks. • Intermittent connectivity: In xG networks,
    the reachable neighbors of a node may change rapidly. This is due to two reasons.
    First, the available spectrum may change or vanish as licensed users exploit the
    network. Moreover, once a node selects a channel for communication it is no longer
    reachable through other channels. As a result, the connectivity concept used for
    wireless networks is different in xG networks and depends on the spectrum. For
    this purpose channel-based models such as the one in [69] is required as well
    as time-based solutions. • Re-routing: In xG networks, due to the intermittent
    connectivity, a route established for a flow can change due to the available spectrum
    in addition to mobility. Hence, the re-routing algorithms considering the dynamic
    spectrum is necessary for routing in xG networks. A spectrum-aware routing adapts
    route selection to spectrum fluctuations [73]. • Queue management: The queue management
    in xG networks is another challenge which has not been addressed to date. An xG
    terminal may have multiple interfaces for communication with different nodes.
    Since the available spectrum varies over time, these interfaces may become unavailable
    requiring the packets served through that interface moved to other interfaces.
    In addition, the quality of service requirements may deploy various priorities
    on different traffic types. Hence, the implementation of a single queue or multiple
    queues for each traffic type of each interface needs to be investigated. 8.2.
    Transport layer challenges Transport protocols constitute an unexplored area for
    xG networks since there exist no work on this area yet. Several solutions have
    been proposed to improve the performance of TCP and UDP in conventional wireless
    networks in recent years [2]. These studies focus on mechanisms to limit the performance
    degradation of TCP and UDP that arise because of wireless link errors and access
    delays. However, the xG networks impose unique challenges for transport protocols
    as explained below: The performance of TCP depends on the packet loss probability
    and the round trip time (RTT). Wireless link errors and, hence, the packet loss
    probability not only depends on the access technology, but also on the frequency
    in use, interference level, and the available bandwidth. Therefore, the wireless
    TCP and UDP protocols that are designed for existing wireless access technologies
    cannot be used in dynamic spectrum assignment based xG networks. On the other
    hand, RTT of a TCP connection depends indirectly on the frequency of operation.
    For example, if the packet error rate (or equivalently, the frame error rate)
    is higher at a particular frequency band, a higher number of link layer retransmissions
    are required to successfully transport a packet across the wireless channel. Moreover,
    the wireless channel access delay in xG networks depends on the operation frequency,
    the interference level, and the medium access control protocol. These factors
    influence the RTT of a TCP connection. Therefore, based on the frequency of operation,
    RTT and packet loss probability observed by a TCP protocol will vary. Hence, transport
    protocols need to be designed to adapt to these variations. The operation frequency
    of a cognitive radio in xG networks may vary from time to time due to spectrum
    handoff as explained in Section 6. When an xG terminal changes its operating frequency,
    this results in a finite amount of delay before the new frequency can be operational.
    This is referred to as the spectrum handoff latency. The spectrum handoff latency
    can increase the RTT, which leads to retransmission timeout (RTO). Conventional
    transport protocols can perceive this RTO as packet loss and invoke its congestion
    avoidance mechanism resulting in reduced throughput. To eliminate the adverse
    effects of spectrum mobility, transport protocols need to be designed such that
    they are transparent to spectrum handoff. 9. Cross-layer design The communication
    challenges outlined above necessitate new communication protocols to be designed
    for spectrum-aware communication in xG networks. As explained before, the performance
    of xG networking functionalities directly depend on the properties of the spectrum
    band in use. This direct relationship necessitates a cross-layer design in the
    entire xG networking protocol stack. In particular, the effects of the selected
    spectrum band and the changes due to spectrum mobility need to be carefully considered
    in the design of communication protocols. Moreover, the spectrum management functionalities
    such as spectrum sensing and spectrum handoff should work in collaboration with
    the communication protocols. Based on this motivation, in the following sections,
    we overview the challenges for the cross-layer design in xG networks. 9.1. Cross-layer
    challenges in spectrum management The dynamic nature of the underlying spectrum
    in xG networks necessitates communication protocols to adapt to the wireless channel
    parameters. Moreover, the behavior of each protocol affects the performance of
    other protocols. For example, different medium access techniques used in xG networks,
    directly affect the round trip time (RTT) for the transport protocols. Similarly,
    when re-routing is done because of link failures arising from spectrum mobility,
    the RTT and error probability in the communication path change accordingly. The
    change in error probability also affects the performance of the medium access
    protocols. Consequently, all these changes affect the overall quality of the user
    applications. The spectrum management function cooperates with the communication
    layers, as shown in Fig. 2. In order to decide the appropriate spectrum band,
    the spectrum management requires the information regarding QoS requirement, transport,
    routing, scheduling, and sensing. Hence, these interdependencies among functionalities
    of the communication stack, and their close coupling with the physical layer necessitate
    a cross layer spectrum management function which considers medium access, routing,
    and transport, and application requirements as well as available spectrum in the
    selection of the operating spectrum. 9.2. Cross-layer challenges in spectrum handoff
    Spectrum handoff results in latency, which affects the performance of the communication
    protocols. Thus, the main challenge in spectrum handoff is to reduce the latency
    for spectrum sensing. The spectrum handoff latency has adverse effects on the
    performance of transport protocols. Moreover, during spectrum handoff, the channel
    parameters such as path loss, interference, wireless link error, and link layer
    delay are influenced by the dynamic use of the spectrum. On the other hand, the
    changes in the PHY and MAC channel parameters can initiate spectrum handoff. Moreover,
    the user application may request spectrum handoff to find a better quality spectrum
    band. As shown in Fig. 2, the spectrum mobility function cooperates with spectrum
    management function and spectrum sensing to decide on an available spectrum band.
    In order to estimate the effect of the spectrum handoff latency, information about
    the link layer and sensing delays are required. Transport and application layer
    should also be aware of the latency to reduce the abrupt quality degradation.
    In addition, the routing information is also important for the route recovery
    using spectrum handoff. For these reasons, the spectrum handoff is closely related
    to the operations in all communication layers. 9.3. Cross-layer challenges in
    spectrum sharing The performance of spectrum sharing directly depends on the spectrum
    sensing capabilities of the xG users. Spectrum sensing is primarily a PHY layer
    function. However, in the case of cooperative detection, xG users should use ad
    hoc connection for exchanging sensing information, which necessitates a cross-layer
    design between spectrum sharing and spectrum sensing. It is clear that the performance
    of communication protocols depends on spectrum sensing, i.e., getting information
    about the spectrum utilization. Two major challenges exist in this aspect. The
    first challenge is the interference mitigation. While interference occurs at a
    receiver, spectrum scanning alone only provides information about transmitters
    [33]. Hence, cooperative techniques that necessitate transmitters to consider
    both their interference to other users and the interference at their receivers
    are required. The superiority of cooperative techniques in terms of system performance
    has already been demonstrated in many studies [15], [29], [40], [71]. On the other
    hand, such a collaboration increases the communication overhead and may lead to
    overall system performance degradation when channel capacity or energy consumption
    is considered. Consequently, effective spectrum sharing techniques that enable
    efficient collaboration between different xG nodes in terms of spectrum sensing
    information sharing are required. The second challenge about spectrum sensing
    is that the whole spectrum cannot be sensed all the time. More specifically, due
    to the huge range of spectrum foreseen for xG networks, a significant amount of
    time is required to sense the whole spectrum. Since sensing consumes energy this
    process has to be carefully scheduled. As a result, it may not be practical to
    assume that a node has an accurate knowledge about the spectrum at all times.
    Moreover, current radio technologies prevent continuous spectrum sensing if only
    a single radio is deployed on a device. During communication, spectrum sensing
    has to be stopped to switch to the required channel and perform communication.
    Hence, this operation requires cross-layer interaction between the physical layer
    and the upper layers. More specifically, communication attempts need to be coordinated
    with spectrum sensing events. As an alternative, the effect of using multiple
    radios has been investigated in [54], where a two transceiver operation is considered
    such that a transceiver always listens to the control channel for sensing. This
    operation improves the system performance, however, the complexity and device
    costs are high. The spectrum sharing techniques discussed in Section 7 decouples
    spectrum allocation and spectrum sensing. In decentralized cognitive MAC (DC-MAC)
    scheme proposed in [72], a cross-layer approach for spectrum allocation and spectrum
    sensing is considered. Contrary to many work, in [72], limited spectrum sensing
    is addressed, where only a portion of the whole spectrum can be sensed. Moreover,
    spectrum sensing is jointly performed with spectrum allocation and application
    layer such that the node senses a portion of the spectrum only if it will allocate
    a channel due to a request from the application layer. First, an optimal approach
    for channel allocation is provided followed by a greedy suboptimal approach. A
    node is assumed to be able to sense one channel among N possible channels. Through
    performance evaluation, it is shown that the greedy approach closely approximates
    the optimal solution. Moreover, this solution is also robust to inaccuracies in
    spectrum sensing and limited knowledge. 9.4. Cross-layer challenges in upper layers
    Since available spectrum bands in xG networks with multi-hop communication are
    different for each hop, spectrum sensing information is required for topology
    configuration in xG networks. Moreover, a major design choice for routing in xG
    networks is the collaboration between routing and spectrum decision. If the optimal
    route from an xG user to another results in interference to the primary users,
    end-to-end latency or packet losses can be affected along the route due to this
    interaction. To mitigate the degradation, multiple spectrum interfaces at intermediate
    nodes may be selected. Therefore, end-to-end route may consist of multiple hops
    traversing different spectrum bands. Finally, re-routing needs to be performed
    in a cross-layer fashion. If a link failure occurs due to spectrum mobility, the
    routing algorithm needs to differentiate this failure from a node failure. Furthermore,
    intermediate xG users can perform re-routing by exploiting the spectrum information
    available from spectrum sensing functionality select better routes method. Due
    to the dynamic frequency of operation, the RTT and packet loss rates vary in xG
    networks, which leads to variations in packet transmission delay. Moreover, medium
    access schemes introduce access delay. All these factors influence the round trip
    time of a connection, which in turn affect the performance of transport protocols.
    Moreover, the latency associated with a spectrum handoff increases the instantaneous
    RTT of the packet transmission. Consequently, transport protocols for xG networks
    should be designed in a spectrum aware approach that introduces cooperative operation
    with the other communication layers. 10. Conclusions xG networks are being developed
    to solve current wireless network problems resulting from the limited available
    spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage by exploiting the existing
    wireless spectrum opportunistically. xG networks, equipped with the intrinsic
    capabilities of the cognitive radio, will provide an ultimate spectrum-aware communication
    paradigm in wireless communications. In this survey, intrinsic properties and
    current research challenges of the xG networks are presented. We investigate the
    unique challenges in xG networks by a bottom-up approach, starting from the capabilities
    of cognitive radio techniques to the communication protocols that need to be developed
    for efficient communication. Moreover, novel spectrum management functionalities
    such as spectrum sensing, spectrum analysis, and spectrum decision as well as
    spectrum mobility are introduced. The discussions provided in this survey strongly
    advocate spectrum-aware communication protocols that consider the spectrum management
    functionalities. This cross-layer design requirement necessitates a rethinking
    of the existing solutions developed for wireless networks. Many researchers are
    currently engaged in developing the communication technologies and protocols required
    for xG networks. However, to ensure efficient spectrum-aware communication, more
    research is needed along the lines introduced in this survey. References [1] 3GPP2,

    is an emerging communication paradigm to effectively address spectrum scarcity
    challenge. Spectrum sharing enables the secondary unlicensed system to dynamically
    access the licensed frequency bands in the primary system without any modification
    to the devices, terminals, services and networks in the primary system. In this
    paper, we propose and analyze new dynamic spectrum access schemes in the absence
    or presence of buffering mechanism for the cognitive secondary subscriber (SU).
    A Markov approach is developed to analyze the proposed spectrum sharing policies
    with generalized bandwidth size in both primary system and secondary system. Performance
    metrics for SU are developed with respect to blocking probability, interrupted
    probability, forced termination probability, non-completion probability and waiting
    time. Numerical examples are presented to explore the impact of key systems parameters
    like the traffic load on the performance metrics. Comparison results indicate
    that the buffer is able to significantly reduce the SU blocking probability and
    non-completion probability with very minor increased forced termination probability.

    SECTION I. Introduction Cognitive radio, or Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), is
    an emerging communication paradigm to effectively address the spectrum insufficiency
    [1] [2]. Spectrum is a scarce and precious resource in wireless communication
    systems and networks. Cognitive radio refers to the potentiality that systems
    are aware of context and capable of reconfiguring themsel ves based on the surrounding
    environments and their own properties with respect to traffic load, congestion
    situation, network topology, and wireless channel propagation etc. This capability
    is particularly applicable to resolve heterogeneity, robustness, and openness,
    which are inherent challenges in the next-generation wireless communications systems.
    In the same frequency range, there are two coexisting systems: primary system
    and secondary system. Primary system refers to the licensed system with regulatory
    allocated spectrum. This system has the exclusive privilege to access the assigned
    spectrum range. Secondary system refers to the unlicensed cognitive system and
    can only opportunistically access the spectrum hole which is currently not used
    by the primary system. We call the subscriber in the primary system as Primary
    User (PU); and the subscriber in the secondary system as Secondary User (SU).
    Spectrum sharing strategy enables the secondary unlicensed system to dynamically
    access the licensed frequency bands in primary system without any modification
    to the devices, terminals, services, architectures and networks in the primary
    system [3]. In such case, the secondary system performs transparent for the primary
    system. Hence, on detecting the PU appearance in the particular frequency which
    is currently used by an SU, the SU has to vacate this frequency for the PU. At
    the same time, the SU will scan the frequency range and transfer its connection
    to another unused spectrum band, if available. This refers to spectrum handoff
    procedure. Recently, there are few studies on the spectrum assignment [4]–[6].
    In [4], a Markov Chain is presented to study con-trolled/uncontrolled channel
    assignment schemes in a spectrum sharing system. In [5], a model is developed
    to predict the behavior of open spectrum access in unlicensed bands. For the sake
    of analytical simplicity, the bandwidth in primary system and secondary system
    is respectively fixed as one and three. In [6], a channel reservation is reported
    for a spectrum sharing system. In the studies above, the forced termination probability
    and the non-completion probability during SU connection lifetime are not derived.
    In addition, an SU request will be directly blocked if there is no available resource.
    This may not be desirable. In this paper, our contributions include three folds
    to advance the state-of-the-art in DSA networks. These aspects also indicate the
    major difference from the studies mentioned above. Firstly, we propose and analyze
    a new dynamic spectrum access scheme. To provide spectrum access priority, we
    consider the absence or presence of buffering mechanism for the cognitive SU,
    together with spectrum handoff capability. Spectrum handoff can be alternatively
    regarded as a priority policy for ongoing SU in service. Additionally, in stead
    of direct blocking SU requests, we introduce a finite queue to store the SU requests
    on their arrival when all bandwidth are occupied. When there is available spectrum
    later, the SU in the queue can use the freed bandwidth. It is noteworthy that
    performance of spectrum sharing with buffering mechanism is not theoretically
    investigated in the literature. Secondly, a Markov approach is developed to analyze
    the proposed spectrum sharing policy without/with buffering for the cognitive
    SU requests. The proposed model is general in terms of the size of bandwidth in
    the primary system and the secondary system. Performance metrics are developed
    with respect to SU blocking probability, SU interrupted probability, SU forced
    termination probability, SU non-completion probability and SU waiting time. Thirdly,
    numerical examples are presented to explore the interaction between key system
    parameters and performance metrics. It is found that the buffer is able to significantly
    reduce the SU blocking probability and noncompletion probability with minor increased
    SU forced termination probability. The simulation result have been presented to
    validate the analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing literature
    addressing the spectrum sharing in the presence of buffering for cognitive Even
    for the spectrum sharing without buffer, there is no analysis validated by the
    simulation. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
    the analytical model for the case in the absence of buffering for cognitive SU.
    Section III reports the analytic model for the case with buffer for cognitive
    SU. Section IV presents the analysis and simulation results. Section V concludes
    the work. SECTION II. Spectrum Sharing without Buffering Fig. 1. System Model.
    Show All Fig. 2. System state transit for spectrum sharing without buffering.
    Show All Fig. 1 shows the spectrum sharing between the primary system and the
    secondary system. We define the term band as a bandwidth unit in the primary system;
    and the term sub-band as a bandwidth unit in the secondary system. Accordingly,
    a PU needs one band for service and an SU needs one sub-band for service. In the
    figure, M denotes the number of bands. Each band consists of N sub-bands. To avoid
    interference to PU, for a specific band used by a PU, the underlying N sub-bands
    are then unavailable for SU. We assume that the PU and SU arrival processes follow
    Poisson process with the arrival rate λ p and λ s , respectively. The service
    times for PU and SU follow exponential distribution with mean 1/ μ p and 1/ μ
    s , respectively. Let (i,j) represent the system state with i representing the
    number of sub-bands used by SU and j the number of bands used by PU. The state
    space Γ is given by Γ={(i,j)|0≤i≤NM;0≤j≤M;0≤i+jN≤NM} View Source Let the indicator
    function 1 (i,j) be equal to one if the state (i,j) is valid in the state space
    Γ , and zero otherwise. Let π(i,j) be the steady state probability distribution
    for a valid state (i,j)∈Γ . Since a sub-band is unavailable if it is in the range
    of a busy band, for the state (i,j) , the total number of busy sub-bands B t is
    equal to the number of busy sub-bands for SU i plus N times the number of busy
    bands for PU, i.e. B t =i+jN . The system dynamics are triggered by the following
    events: SU request arrival, SU service completion, PU request arrival and PU service
    completion. According to these events, the bandwidth access mechanism is defined
    as follows. 1) SU request arrival For an SU request arrival, if there are free
    sub-bands, the SU is accepted and uses one unoccupied sub-band. If the total number
    of busy sub-bands B t is equal to N M, the SU request is blocked. 2) SU service
    completion When an SU completes its service, a sub-band is released. 3) PU request
    arrival The bandwidth assignment for PU is transparent to the existence of SU.
    For a PU call connection arrival, if the number of PU in service is less than
    M , PU will use one band regardless whether there are SU in service over this
    band. If the total number of busy sub-bands B t is no greater than N(M−1) , there
    is no terminated SU with spectrum handoff mechanism. However, in case the total
    number of busy sub-bands B t is larger than N(M−1) , number of B t −N(M−1) SU
    in service is interrupted. The vacated sub-bands will be allocated to the PU request.
    In addition, in case the total number of busy sub-bands B t is equal to NM and
    there are SU in service, N SU in service is interrupted. The vacated N sub-bands
    will constitute a single band and be allocated to the PU request. If the number
    of PU in service is M , the PU request is blocked. 4) PU service completion When
    a PU completes its service, a band is released. This is equal to N sub-bands.
    Fig. 2 shows the transit rate diagram. On the basis of the transit rate diagram,
    we develop the set of global balance equations. For the states satisfying i+jN≤N(M−1)
    in Fig. 2(a), ( λ s +i μ s + λ p +j μ p )′/r(i,j) = λ s π(i−1,j)+(i+1) μ s π(i+1,j)   +
    λ p π(i,j−1)+(j+1) μ p π(i,j+1) (1) View Source For the states satisfying N(M−1)<i+jN<NM
    in Fig. 2(b), the unique transition is due to a PU arrival and the interrupted
    SU. ( λ s +i μ s + λ p 1 ((M−1−j)N,j+1) +j μ p )π(i,j) = λ s π(i−1,j)+(i+1) μ
    s π(i+1,j) λ p π(i,j−1) (2) View Source For the states satisfying i+jN=NM in Fig.
    2(c), the unique transition is from a number of states (m+r,j)(m=0,⋯,N) directly
    into (i,j) due to a PU arrival. (i μ s + λ p 1 (i−N,j+1) +j μ p )π(i,j) = λ s
    π(i−1,j)+ λ p ∑ m=0 N π(i+m,j−1) (3) View Source In addition, the summation of
    all steady state probabilities satisfies the normalization constraint ∑ (i,j)∈Γ
    π(i,j)=1 . Combining the equations above, we can solve the set of the linear equations
    and consequently the steady state probability distribution. Therefore, the transit
    rate matrix, Y , which governs the evolution of the multidimensional Markov chain,
    can be obtained. Let Π be the stationary state probability vector of the system
    and be in lexicographic order based on the state. Then, Π is the solution of linear
    equation Π=ΠY and Πe=1 with e representing the column vector with all ones. The
    set of linear equations can be solved by using an iterative method SOR [7]. We
    present the SOR algorithm to calculate the steady state probability as follows:

    An SU is blocked when all bands and sub-bands are occupied. Hence, the SU blocking
    probability P b is given by P b = ∑ {(i,j)∈Γ|i+jN=NM} π(i,j) (6) View Source For
    an accepted SU, it may be interrupted during its service owing to a PU arrival.
    Let P Int denote the probability that an SU is interrupted. We suppose the system
    state (i,j) upon the moment of a PU arrival. Two situations are considered to
    calculate P Int . In case the number of total number of sub-bands (i+jN) is greater
    than N(M−1) and less than NM , the number of interrupted SU is equal to i+jN−N(M−1)
    . As a result, the SU interrupted probability in such situation P Int1 is given
    by P Int1 = ∑ {(i,j)∈Γ|N(M−1)<i+jN<NM} i+jN−N(M−1) i π(i,j) (7) View Source In
    another case, when all bands and sub-bands are busy and there are SU in service,
    the number of interrupted SU is N . As a result, the SU interrupted probability
    in such situation P Int2 is given by P Int2 = ∑ {(i,j)∈Γ|i+jN=NM,z>0} N i π(i,j)
    (8) View Source Combining the two situations above and under the condition that
    there are SU in service, we obtain the SU interrupted probability P Int as follows
    P Int = P Int1 + P Int2 ∑ {(i,j)∈Γ|i>0} π(i,j) (9) View Source During an SU lifetime,
    a number of PU may arrive. For each PU arrival event, the SU may be interrupted
    with probability P Int . Hence, during an SU lifetime, it may have a number of
    possibility to be interrupted. Let P ft denote the SU forced termination probability,
    which is defined as the probability that an SU is forced to termination due to
    PU arrival. Let t s denote the service time of an SU. Let t p,1 denote the period
    from the SU service starting moment to the instant of the immediate next PU arrival.
    In addition, let t p,r (r=2,3,⋯) denote the period between PU arrivals after the
    first PU arrival. Then, t p,r follows the exponential distribution with mean 1/
    λ p . The forced termination probability is given by P ft = ∑ r=1 ∞ Pr( t s >
    ∑ u=1 r t p,u )(1− P Int ) r−1 P Int (10) View Source Denote ξ r = ∑ r u=1 t p,u

    of its pdf f ∗ ξ r (s) are given by f ξ r (t)= λ p ( λ p t ) r−1 (r−1)! e − λ
    p t ;   f ∗ ξ r (s)=( λ p s+ λ p ) r View Source In (10), we have Pr( t s > ∑
    u=1 r t p,u ) = ∫ ∞ 0 f ξ r (t)[1− f t s (t)]dt =( λ p μ s + λ p ) r View Source

    important performance metric is the probability that an SU request is not completed,
    i.e.SU non-completion probability P nc . An SU is not completed when it is blocked
    upon the moment of its arrival or when it is forced to termination. P nc = P b
    +(1− P b ) P ft (12) View Source SECTION III. Spectrum Sharing with Buffering
    A finite queue with length Q is introduced to save SU requests in case all sub-bands
    are occupied. Let (i,j,k) represent the system state with i representing the number
    of sub-bands used by SU, j the number of bands used by PU and k the number of
    SU requests saved in the queue. The state space Γ B is given by Γ B ={(i,j,k)|
    0≤i≤NM,0≤j≤M; 0≤i+jN≤NM,0≤k≤Q} (13) View Source Let 1 (i,j,k) be equal to one
    if the state (i,j,k) is a valid state in the state space Γ B , and zero otherwise.
    Let π(i,j,k) be the steady state probability distribution for a valid state (i,j,k)∈
    Γ B . The system dynamics are triggered by the following events: SU request arrival,
    SU service completion, PU request arrival and PU service completion. According
    to these events, the spectrum access mechanism is defined as follows. 1) SU request
    arrival For an SU request arrival, if there are free sub-bands, the SU is accepted
    and uses one unoccupied sub-band. If the total number of busy sub-bands B t is
    equal to NM and the queue is not full, the SU request is inserted into the tail
    of the queue. If the total number of busy sub-bands B t is equal to NM and the
    queue is full, the SU request is blocked. 2) SU service completion When an SU
    completes its service, a sub-band is released. If the queue is not empty, the
    top SU request will use this newly released sub-band. 3) PU request arrival Similarly,
    the bandwidth assignment for PU is transparent to the existence of SU. For a PU
    call connection arrival, if the number of PU in service is less than M , PU will
    use one band regardless whether there are SU in service over this band. If the
    total number of busy sub-bands B t is no greater than N(M−1) , there is no terminated
    SU with the help of spectrum handoff mechanism. However, in case the total number
    of busy sub-bands B t is larger than N(M−1) , number of B t −N(M−1) SU in service
    is interrupted. The vacated sub-bands will be allocated to the PU request. In
    addition, in case the total number of busy sub-bands B t is equal to NM and there
    are SU in service, N SU in service is interrupted. The vacated N sub-bands will
    constitute a single band and be allocated to the PU request. If the number of
    PU in service is M , the PU request is blocked. 4) PU service completion When
    a PU completes its service, a band is released. This is equivalent with N sub-bands.
    If the queue is not empty with length k,min(k,N) SU requests will be deleted from
    the queue and occupy the newly released sub-bands. If the queue is empty, the
    released sub-bands N are kept free. Fig. 3 shows the transit rate diagram. Comparing
    the transit rate diagram without buffering, this diagram indicates significantly
    different system dynamics due to the introduced queue, especially the state transit
    between non-neighboring states. For the states satisfying i+jN≤N(M−1),k=0 , (

    Results To validate the analytical model, a discrete-event simulation program
    in C++ is developed. Illustrative numerical examples are presented to demonstrate
    the interaction between the performance metrics and critical settings. If not
    specified, we choose the following default parameters: M=3, N=6 , \mu_{s}=0.82
    and \mu_{p}=0.06 . Fig. 4 shows the performance metrics in terms of SU request
    arrival rate \lambda_{s} with different queue length Q . In this example, \lambda_{p}=0.2\lambda_{s}
    . In each figure, there are three curves. The solid line represents the result
    without buffer. The dashed line and dash-dot line represent the result with buffer
    length Q=2 and Q=4 , respectively. The simulation results are presented (indicated
    by symbol) to validate the analytical model. It is clear that the simulation and
    analysis match with each other very well. It is observed that the blocking probability,
    forced termination and noncompletion probability increases with higher SU arrival
    rate, which is intuitively understandable. The comparison indicates that the SU
    blocking probability P_{b} and the non-completion probability P_{nc} reduces significantly
    with minor increased forced termination probability P_{ft} . With longer queue,
    the SU blocking probability P_{b} and non-completion probability P_{nc} reduction
    becomes more significant. For the performance tradeoff on waiting time W , an
    advantage is that W almost keeps unchanged with increasing \lambda_{s} due to
    the finite size queue. Fig. 4. Performance metrics in terms of SU arrival rate

    metrics in terms of SU request arrival rate \lambda_{s} with different PU arrival
    rate \lambda_{p} . In this instance, the queue length is fixed as Q=2 . Again,
    the analysis is consistent with the simulation. The blocking probability P_{b}
    increases with greater \lambda_{p} due to heavier traffic load to the primary
    system and consequently higher total traffic load over the limited bandwidth.
    The forced termination probability becomes larger with greater \lambda_{p} . With
    more PU arrivals, SU has the higher possibility to be interrupted and hence higher
    P_{ft} . The increased P_{b} and P_{ft} lead to more non-completed SU, i.e. higher
    P_{nc} . Fig. 5. Performance metrics in terms of SU arrival rate \lambda_{s} .

    . Show All SECTION V. Conclusions New dynamic spectrum access schemes are proposed
    for cognitive radio wireless networks without and with buffering for the cognitive
    SU to avoid direct blocking. A Markov approach is developed to analyze the proposed
    spectrum sharing policies. Performance metrics for SU are developed with respect
    to blocking probability, interrupted probability, forced termination probability,
    non-completion probability and waiting time. The result indicate that the buffer
    is able to significantly reduce the SU blocking probability and noncompletion
    probability with very minor increased forced termination probability. The analytic
    model has been verified by the simulation. Authors Figures References Citations

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio (CR) is
    the enabling technology for supporting dynamic spectrum access: the policy that
    addresses the spectrum scarcity problem that is encountered in many countries.
    Thus, CR is widely regarded as one of the most promising technologies for future
    wireless communications. To make radios and wireless networks truly cognitive,
    however, is by no means a simple task, and it requires collaborative effort from
    various research communities, including communications theory, networking engineering,
    signal processing, game theory, software–hardware joint design, and reconfigurable
    antenna and radio-frequency design. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview
    on CR networking and communications by looking at the key functions of the physical
    (PHY), medium access control (MAC), and network layers involved in a CR design
    and how these layers are crossly related. In particular, for the PHY layer, we
    will address signal processing techniques for spectrum sensing, cooperative spectrum
    sensing, and transceiver design for cognitive spectrum access. For the MAC layer,
    we review sensing scheduling schemes, sensing-access tradeoff design, spectrum-aware
    access MAC, and CR MAC protocols. In the network layer, cognitive radio network
    (CRN) tomography, spectrum-aware routing, and quality-of-service (QoS) control
    will be addressed. Emerging CRNs that are actively developed by various standardization
    committees and spectrum-sharing economics will also be reviewed. Finally, we point
    out several open questions and challenges that are related to the CRN design.

    DOI: 10.1109/TVT.2011.2158673 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction The RADIO
    spectrum, which is needed for wireless communication systems, is a naturally limited
    resource. To support various wireless applications and services in a noninterfering
    basis, the fixed spectrum access (FSA) policy has traditionally been adopted by
    spectrum regulators, which assign each piece of spectrum with certain bandwidth
    to one or more dedicated users. By doing so, only the assigned (licensed) users
    have the right to exploit the allocated spectrum, and other users are not allowed
    to use it, regardless of whether the licensed users are using it. With the proliferation
    of wireless services in the last couple of decades, in several countries, most
    of the available spectrum has fully been allocated, which results in the spectrum
    scarcity problem. On the other hand, recent studies on the actual spectrum utilization
    measurements have revealed that a large portion of the licensed spectrum experiences
    low utilization [1]–[3]. These studies also indicate that it is the inefficient
    and inflexible spectrum allocation policy that strongly contributes to spectrum
    scarcity and, perhaps, even more than the physical shortage of the spectrum. To
    maintain sustainable development of the wireless communication industry, novel
    solutions should be developed to enhance the utilization efficiency of the radio
    spectrum. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been proposed as an alternative policy
    to allow the radio spectrum to more efficiently be used [4], [5]. In DSA, a piece
    of spectrum can be allocated to one or more users, which are called primary users
    (PUs); however, the use of that spectrum is not exclusively granted to these users,
    although they have higher priority in using it. Other users, which are referred
    to as secondary users (SUs), can also access the allocated spectrum as long as
    the PUs are not temporally using it or can share the spectrum with the PUs as
    long as the PUs'' can properly be protected. By doing so, the radio spectrum can
    be reused in an opportunistic manner or shared all the time; thus, the spectrum
    utilization efficiency can significantly be improved. To support DSA, SUs are
    required to capture or sense the radio environment, and a SU with such a capability
    is also called a cognitive radio (CR) [4], [5] or a CR user. There are different
    types of cognitive capabilities with which a CR may be equipped. For example,
    a CR may sense the on/off status of the PUs [4], [6] or can predict the interference
    power level that is received at the primary receiver (Rx) [6]. In an extreme case,
    if a CR is a genie user, it may also acquire the messages that are transmitted
    by the primary Tx [7]. The process of acquiring the radio environment knowledge
    can be complex and expensive, because it may involve spectrum sensing, autonomous
    learning, user cooperation, modeling, and reasoning. With different cognitive
    capabilities, a CR may access the radio spectrum in different ways. In the literature,
    the following two cognitive spectrum access models have received extensive attention:
    1) The opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) model and 2) the concurrent spectrum
    access (CSA) model. The OSA model is illustrated in Fig. 1. In this model, a CR
    user carries out spectrum sensing to detect spectrum holes [8], i.e., portions
    of spectrum allocated (licensed) to some PUs but left unused for a certain time.
    Upon detecting one or multiple spectrum holes, the CR user reconfigures its transmission
    parameters (e.g., carrier frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme) to operate
    in the identified spectrum holes. While doing so, the CR user needs to frequently
    monitor the spectrum on which it operates and quickly vacate it whenever the PUs
    become active. This approach of spectrum access was first proposed by Mitola in
    his pioneering work [4], [5], under the name spectrum pooling. The term opportunistic
    spectrum access was later introduced by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
    (DARPA) in its Next-Generation Communications (XG) Program. We note that some
    authors also refer to this model as spectrum overlay in [9] and [10] and interweave
    paradigm in [11]. Fig. 1. OSA model: CR users opportunistically access the spectrum
    holes. Show All The CSA model is shown in Fig. 2, where a CR user coexists with
    an active PU in a licensed band as long as the CR transmitter (Tx) refrains its
    transmit power such that the interference that is caused to the primary Rx is
    below a tolerable threshold. This model requires the CR Tx to predict the interference
    power level that is received at a particular location, and it is also referred
    to as spectrum sharing in [6] and spectrum underlay in [10]. Fig. 2. CSA model:
    CR users coexist with active PUs under the interference power constraint. Show
    All Fig. 3. Main functions of the PHY, MAC, and network layers in a CR. Show All
    A cognitive radio network (CRN) contains more than one CR node, and similarly
    to conventional wireless networks, it can be classified as either an infrastructure-based
    network or an ad hoc network [12]. In a CRN, each CR node may have the same or
    a different level of cognitive capability. In a more general sense, a CRN can
    be perceived as an intelligent overlay network that contains multiple coexisting
    networks, and each of the CR nodes may belong to different coexisting networks.
    In this case, the CR nodes are likely to have different levels of cognitive capability.
    Thus, building a fully functioning CRN can be a very challenging task. This case
    is due to the difficulties in designing multiple system components, including,
    but not limited to, physical (PHY)-layer signal processing, medium access control
    (MAC)-layer spectrum management, and network-layer routing and statistical control.
    Furthermore, these system components often interact in complex ways, the design
    of which may require cross-layer design and control frameworks. Fig. 3 illustrates
    the key functions of the PHY, MAC, and network layers in a CR. In the PHY layer,
    spectrum sensing is the essential component that enables CR users to identify
    spectrum holes, whereas environmental learning supports the CR users to gain higher
    level of radio environment knowledge, such as the channel-state information or
    channel gain from the CR Tx to the primary Rx. Based on the outputs of these operations,
    cognitive spectrum access is carried out through transceiver optimization and
    reconfiguration. The specific tasks that the MAC layer of a CR must perform include
    sensing scheduling and spectrum-aware access control. The spectrum-sensing scheduler
    controls the sensing operations, whereas the spectrum-aware access control governs
    the spectrum access to the identified spectrum holes. The sensing-access coordinator
    controls the operations of these two functions in a time basis by taking care
    of the tradeoff between the sensing requirement and the spectrum access opportunity
    that the CR user may achieve. With regard to the network layer, three important
    functions are listed as follows: 1) network tomography; 2) quality of service
    (QoS) and error control; and 3) spectrum-aware routing [13]. Finally, the spectrum
    manager links the three layers and supports the access of available spectrum in
    a dynamic and efficient manner. We highlight here that the aforementioned architecture
    is by no means the only architecture that can be designed for CRs; instead, it
    serves as the functional architecture for this overview paper. For other architectures,
    see [12] and [13]. In this paper, our main objective is to provide readers a systematic
    overview on CR communications and networking. We review the key functions of the
    PHY, MAC, and network layers involved in the CR design and explain how these layers
    are crossly related. In particular, for the PHY layer, we address signal-processing
    techniques for spectrum sensing, cooperative spectrum sensing, and transceiver
    design for cognitive spectrum access. For the MAC layer, we review sensing scheduling
    schemes, sensing-access tradeoff design, spectrum-aware access MAC, and selected
    CR MAC protocols. In the network layer, CRN tomography, spectrum-aware routing,
    and QoS and error control will be covered. Emerging CRNs that are actively developed
    for various applications and spectrum-sharing economics and values will also be
    reviewed. Finally, we raise out some design challenges and open questions that
    are related to CR communications and networking. SECTION II. Spectrum-Sensing
    Techniques As aforementioned, a spectrum hole is a frequency band that is assigned
    to the PUs but is not utilized at a certain time and location [6], [8], [14].
    In some portions of the spectrum such as the TV band, the TV program may be predetermined
    in some regions; thus, such spectrum hole information can be broadcast to the
    SUs using geolocation database solutions. When such information is not available
    to the SUs, spectrum sensing [15]–[18] enables CR users to identify the spectrum
    holes, thus protecting the PUs. Therefore, spectrum sensing is considered one
    of the critical elements in CRN design. Fig. 4 shows the basic principle of how
    spectrum sensing can be used to protect the PUs. As shown in the figure, a primary
    Tx sends data to its intended Rx in a certain licensed spectrum band. A pair of
    CR users (CR Tx and CR Rx) intends to access the spectrum holes for secondary
    communication. To guarantee the protection of PUs, the CR Tx needs to perform
    spectrum sensing to find spectrum holes. In particular, the CR Tx is required
    to detect whether there is an active primary Rx inside the coverage of the CR
    Tx. If not, the CR Tx can safely transmit to the CR Rx using the identified spectrum
    hole. Otherwise, the CR users are not allowed to use the band. Therefore, detecting
    the nearby primary Rx''s can directly identify the spectrum hole, which is called
    direct spectrum sensing. Fig. 4. Principle of spectrum sensing. Show All It is
    well known that detecting a Rx is a challenging task, because the Rx does usually
    not transmit signals when it works. Thus, most of the existing spectrum-sensing
    schemes identify spectrum holes by detecting the primary Tx''s [10], [13]. In
    Fig. 4, let D be the transmission range of the primary Tx and R be the interfering
    range of the CR Tx. Then, the CR Tx needs to detect the presence of an active
    primary Tx within a distance D+R . If the distance between the primary and the
    CR Tx''s is larger than D+R , there will be no active primary Rx inside the interfering
    range of the CR Tx, and then, the CR Tx can safely access the spectrum bands.
    Otherwise, the primary Rx may be inside the interfering range of the CR Tx and
    be interfered by its transmission. Therefore, detecting surrounding primary Tx''s
    can also identify the spectrum holes, but in an indirect way, which is called
    indirect spectrum sensing. Compared with direct spectrum sensing, indirect spectrum
    sensing requires a larger detection range from R to R+D . Thus, indirect spectrum
    sensing needs to detect very weak primary signals, which makes spectrum sensing
    more challenging [18], [19]. Furthermore, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
    of the primary signal that is measured at the CR Tx is low enough, e.g., below
    the SNR wall [20], it is impossible for the CR Tx to detect the primary Tx, even
    when the infinity number of samples of the primary signals are used. A. Direct
    Spectrum Sensing The most effective way of spectrum sensing is to directly detect
    the primary Rx, because it is the Rx of a PU system that should be protected.
    In general, the PU systems can be divided into the following two categories: 1)
    one-way communication systems and 2) two-way communication systems. One-way communication
    systems have only one direction communication from the primary Tx to the primary
    Rx, such as TV and radio broadcasts. The only way of detecting this kind of Rx''s
    is to sense the leakage signals from active Rx''s. Two-way communication systems
    have bidirectional communications, and there are interactions between the Tx and
    the Rx, which can be used for spectrum sensing. Next, we will introduce the sensing
    methods for the two kinds of systems, respectively. 1. Local Oscillator Detection
    In most wireless communication systems, Rx''s need to convert the signal from
    carrier frequency to intermediate frequency (IF) for further processing. However,
    during such conversion, some of the local oscillator power couples back through
    the input port and radiates out of the antenna, which leads to inevitable reverse
    leakage. In [21], such leakage signals have been used in spectrum sensing for
    TV Rx detection. When the frequency and phase of the leakage signals are known
    to CR users, matched filter detection is used. When there is no information of
    the leakage signals, energy detection (ED) is used. Because the leakage signal
    is extremely weak, it leads to a short detection range and a long detection time.
    For example, it may take the order of seconds for spectrum sensing when a CR detector
    is 20 m away from a TV Rx. 2. Proactive Detection Closed-loop control schemes,
    such as power control, adaptive modulation/coding, automatic request retransmission,
    have widely been used in wireless systems with feedback channels [22]. This way,
    the primary Rx can report the quality of the received signal back to the primary
    Tx. Then, the Tx can adjust its transmission parameters to maintain the quality
    of the received signals at the primary Rx. Recently, such closed-loop controls
    have independently been used for primary Rx detection in [23] and [24], and the
    proposed scheme is called proactive spectrum sensing in [24] and [25]. Different
    from traditional sensing methods [15] that detect spectrum holes by listening
    to primary signals, the proactive sensing detects primary Rx''s by sending a sounding
    signal and observing the possible response of the primary signal that is caused
    by closed-loop controls. In particular, closed-loop power control (CLPC) has been
    used for proactive sensing [25]. A CR Tx first sends some sounding signals to
    trigger the CLPC. If there is a primary Rx nearby, the interference power will
    temporally grow, which decreases the signal- to-interference- plus-noise ratio
    (SINR) at the primary Rx. Accordingly, the CLPC will adjust the power of the transmit
    signals to compensate for the SINR loss. If there is no primary Rx nearby, the
    power of the primary signal will not change with the sounding signal. Therefore,
    by detecting whether the CLPC is triggered by the sounding signal, the nearby
    primary Rx can be sensed by the CR user. However, because the CR Tx sends sounding
    signals when performing spectrum sensing, it may temporally cause interference
    to the primary Rx''s. Thus, the sounding signal needs to carefully be designed
    to meet interference constraints. Aside from power control, other closed-loop
    control schemes [26] have also been used for proactive spectrum sensing. B. Indirect
    Spectrum Sensing In primary Tx detection, indirect spectrum sensing detects the
    presence or absence of primary signals, which can be regarded as a binary hypothesis
    testing problem. Denote the signal that comes from a primary Tx and is received
    at the CR Rx as s(n) , H 1 and H 0 as the presence and absence of the primary
    signal, respectively. Then, the received signal at the CR Rx can be expressed
    as y(n)={ w(n), s(n)+w(n),  H 0   H 1 (1) View Source where w(n) denotes the additive
    white Gaussian noise (AWGN). According to the level of information of primary
    signals known to the CR users, different kinds of detection schemes can be used
    for spectrum sensing. Here, we introduce matched filter detection, ED, cyclostationary
    detection, and two blind-sensing schemes. For a more complete review on various
    spectrum-sensing schemes and design challenges, see the recent survey papers [15]–[18].
    1. Matched Filter Detection When the received signal of the primary Tx is known
    to the CR users, matched filter detection can be used for spectrum sensing, and
    it is the optimal detector in an AWGN environment [19]. The main advantage of
    matched filter detection is the short sensing time to achieve a good performance,
    because coherence detection is used. In practice, most of the primary systems
    have pilot, preamble, or training sequence for synchronization and channel estimation;
    thus, the CR Rx may estimate the received signal from the primary Tx. However,
    when the SNR is low, the estimation error can be very large. Furthermore, CR users
    usually need to observe a wide spectrum band with multiple primary systems, and
    thus, they need the Rx''s to estimate different types of primary signals, which
    leads to high complexity in implementation. 2. Ed When the primary signals are
    unknown to the CR users, ED can be used for spectrum sensing. It has been shown
    in [19] that ED is the optimal detector if only the noise power is known to the
    CR users. Let Y be the energy output over m sensed samples, i.e., Y= ∑ m i=n |y(n)
    | 2 . The decision of the ED can be made by comparing the energy Y with a threshold
    λ , i.e., D={ H 1 , H 0 ,  if Y>λ   if Y<λ. (2) View Source If both the signal
    and noise are real valued and follow Gaussian distributions with zero mean and
    they are independent from one sample to another, the probability of detection
    and the probability of false alarm can be expressed, respectively, as [27] P d
    = P f = Prob{Y>λ| H 1 }= Γ(m/2,λ/(2+2γ)) Γ(m/2) Prob{Y>λ| H 0 }= Γ(m/2,λ/2) Γ(m/2)
    (3) (4) View Source where γ is the SNR when the primary signal is active, and
    Γ(⋅) and Γ(⋅,⋅) are the complete and incomplete gamma functions, respectively.
    When designing the detection threshold λ , the detection probability should be
    chosen high enough to protect the PUs. Otherwise, a high probability of misdetection
    may result in intolerable interference to the PUs. On the other hand, the probability
    of false alarm represents the ability of finding the spectrum holes, and a high
    probability of false alarm will lead to low utilization of the spectrum holes.
    Although ED is with low implementation complexity, it has several shortcomings
    in practice. First, ED cannot distinguish different types of signals, which increases
    the probability of false alarm when the received signal contains unintended interfering
    signals. Furthermore, ED is susceptible to the uncertainty of noise power [20],
    which makes it challenging to determine the detection threshold. 3. Cyclostationary
    Detection Modulated signals are usually cyclostationary, and such a feature can
    be used for spectrum sensing, which is called cyclostationary detection [28]–[30].
    Mathematically, it can be realized by analyzing a spectrum correlation function
    as R α y (τ)=E[y(n) y ∗ (n−τ) e −j2παn ] (5) View Source where α is called the
    cyclic frequency. Then, the cyclic spectral density (CSD) function of the received
    signal can be expressed as S(f,α)= ∑ τ=−∞ ∞ R α y (τ) e −j2πfτ . (6) View Source
    Because the noise is a stationary process, the main advantage of cyclostationary
    detection is that it can differentiate the primary signal from the noise, as well
    as any interference signals with different cyclic frequencies. Furthermore, the
    cyclostationary feature does not vary with the SNR, which enables the cyclostationary
    detector to work in a very low-SNR region [31]. However, compared with matched
    filter detection and ED, cyclostationary detection involves much higher computational
    complexity. 4. Cbd When the PU signal waveform, the noise power, and the cyclic
    frequency of the PU signal are all unknown to the CR users, none of the aforementioned
    schemes can be used for detecting the PU signal. Blind-spectrum- sensing schemes
    need to be developed for such a purpose. In practice, the received signal s(n)
    from the primary Tx is, in general, temporally correlated, and the noise is AWGN;
    thus, the flatness of the spectrum of the received signal at the CR Rx can be
    used to infer the presence or absence of the primary signal. Covariance-based
    detection (CBD) [32], [33] has been developed as one of the blind-spectrum-sensing
    schemes. The detection decision is made by checking the significance of the correlations
    of the received signals with nonzero lags compared with the correlation with zero
    lag. This method does not require a priori knowledge of noise variance; thus,
    it is robust to noise power uncertainty. 5. Spectrum Sensing Using Multiple Antennas
    When the CR Rx is equipped with multiple antennas, eigenvalue-based detection
    (EBD) can be used for spectrum sensing [34], [35]. By constructing the sample
    covariance matrix of the received signals, EBD simultaneously estimates the noise
    variance and signal power by calculating the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of
    the matrix. When the primary signal is not present, the two eigenvalues are supposed
    to be the same; however, when the primary signal is active and the signal covariance
    matrix is not a scalar of the identity matrix, the difference between these two
    eigenvalues is expected to be larger. Thus, the condition number of the sample
    covariance matrix can be used as the test statistics for signal detection [34],
    [35]. A closed-form formula for the probability density function of the test statistics
    can be derived by using a random matrix theory [35], through which the detection
    threshold can be determined for a target probability of false alarm. Because EBD
    simultaneously estimates the noise variance and signal power, it tends to be robust
    to noise power uncertainty. In [36], it is shown that EBD has a theoretical root
    in generalized likelihood ratio testing, from which other versions of sensing
    algorithms can be developed. For example, the test statistics can be chosen as
    the ratio of the arithmetic mean over the geometric mean of the eigenvalues of
    the sample covariance matrix. On the other hand, if the noise variance is known
    to the CR Rx, the maximum eigenvalue can be used as the test statistics [37].
    SECTION III. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing A. General Principle As aforementioned,
    the spectrum-sensing capability is critical to enable CR features and enhance
    spectrum utilization. Local spectrum-sensing techniques do not always guarantee
    a satisfactory performance due to noise uncertainty and channel fading. For example,
    a CR user cannot detect the signal from a primary Tx behind a high building, and
    it may access the licensed channel and interfere with the primary Rx''s. Through
    the collaboration of multiple users in spectrum sensing, the detection error possibility
    will be reduced by the introduced spatial diversity [38], and the required detection
    time at each individual CR user may also decrease [39], [40]. In cooperative spectrum
    sensing, CR users first send the raw data that they collect to a combining user
    or fusion center. Alternatively, each user may independently perform local spectrum
    sensing and then report either a binary decision or test statistics to a combining
    user. Finally, the combining user makes a decision on the presence or absence
    of the licensed signal based on its received information. B. Combination Schemes
    One straightforward form of cooperative spectrum sensing is to transmit and combine
    the samples received by all the CR users in the local spectrum-sensing phase.
    In [41], a combining scheme is proposed to process all the samples using tools
    from a random matrix theory. Consider K CR users, each taking N samples. Denote
    y k (n) as the sample that is received by the k th (1≤k≤K) user at the n th (1≤n≤N)
    time instant. Then, we can construct the following matrix: Y= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ y
    1 (1) y 2 (1) ⋮ y K (1) y 1 (2) y 2 (2) ⋮ y K (2) ⋯ ⋯ ⋱ ⋯ y 1 (N) y 2 (N) ⋮ y
    K (N) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ . (7) View Source Let λ i ''s be the eigenvalues of (1/N)
    YY H and α=K/N . Denote the noise variance at each CR user as σ 2 . If σ 2 is
    known at the combining user and when K→∞ and N→∞ , the final decision will be
    H 0 if λ i ∈[ σ 2 (1− α − − √ ) 2 , σ 2 (1+ α − − √ ) 2 ] (8) View Source for
    all i ''s, and H 1 if there are eigenvalues outside the aforementioned range.
    If the noise variance is unknown, the final decision will be H 0 if max i λ i
    min i λ i ≤ (1+ α − − √ ) 2 (1− α − − √ ) 2 . (9) View Source Otherwise, the final
    decision will be H 1 . This cooperative spectrum-sensing scheme [41] uses the
    same test statistics as the EBD in [35], and the decision threshold is chosen
    as a fixed value. Assuming that both K and N tend to infinity, the decision threshold
    in [41] is, indeed, not related to the system parameters, because the test statistics
    converge to a deterministic value [42], and the cooperative spectrum-sensing scheme
    can achieve a nearly optimal performance with the utilization of all the samples.
    For practical values of K and N , the performance of the aforementioned scheme
    significantly degrades, because the test statistics are no longer deterministic
    but are a random variable. Near-optimal solutions directly quantify the distribution
    of the test statistics as in the EBD method [35], [43], through which the decision
    threshold can be chosen based on the target probability of false alarm. Combining
    schemes using all the samples require significant bandwidth to report the data
    from the individual users to the combining user, which is usually implemented
    over a wired high-speed backbone, whereas these CR users are, in fact, base stations
    (BSs). If this is not the case, we have to consider communication constraints
    during reporting. One natural idea is that each CR user reports a summary statistic.
    One commonly used statistic is the observed energy that is acquired during ED
    [44]–[46]. In [44], different cooperative ED schemes with low complexity have
    been investigated, where the final decision is based on the weighted summation,
    i.e., y c = ∑ k=1 K ω k y k (10) View Source where y k is the observed energy
    of the k th CR user, and ω k is the associated weight. Based on the instantaneous
    SNR of each CR user, an optimal weighting scheme using the Neyman–Pearson criterion,
    which maximizes the detection probability for a given false-alarm probability,
    has been proposed. Without the knowledge of instantaneous channel information,
    equal-gain combination is also proposed for practical use, which also has a reasonable
    performance. Ideal reporting is assumed in [44], whereas reporting channel noises
    are considered in [45], and the optimal weights under the Neyman–Pearson criterion
    are derived. The optimization of cooperative sensing has been an active research
    topic in recent years. In [46], combination schemes are designed from the sensing-throughput
    tradeoff perspective, i.e., maximizing the throughput of SUs under the PU protection
    constraint. Combining the results from multiple time slots is also considered
    in [46]. Wideband spectrum sensing with cooperation is addressed in [47] using
    ED. If individual CR users use the cyclic detector, the cyclic statistics can
    be reported to the fusion center for cooperation optimization [48]. In case that
    the communication constraints are more strict, hard combination schemes have been
    proposed in [38], [44], and [49]. In these schemes, CR users transmit quantized
    sensing information to the combining user. The counting scheme is the simplest
    approach, in which each CR user makes a binary decision based on its observation,
    e.g., the threshold test in ED, and forwards the 1-b information to the combining
    user. If there are at least n out of K CR users who infer H 1 , the primary signal
    will be declared present [50]. The optimal n is, in general, a design parameter
    and can be optimized based on various criteria [49], [51], [52]. In [44], 1-b
    combination is also extended to 2-b combination, in which three thresholds are
    used to divide the observed energy into four regions. Each CR user reports 2-b
    information to indicate the region of its observed energy. Then, the combining
    user calculates a weighted summation of the numbers of CR users who fall in different
    regions. The optimal partition of the regions and weight allocation have been
    given in [44], and the performance is shown to be comparable with the equal-gain
    combination of the observed energies. C. Limitations and Practical Considerations
    1. Asynchronous Sensing Information In practice, local observations of different
    users may be obtained at different times and sent to the combining user with delay,
    which affects the performance of the aforementioned combination schemes, assuming
    synchronous sensing. In such a case, the combination approach should take asynchronous
    sensing into account. In [53], a probability-based scheme is proposed by utilizing
    the statistics of licensed band occupancy. Assume that there are K cooperative
    users in the CR network and the k th (k=1,2,…,K) CR user sends its sensing information
    u k that is obtained at t k to the combining user. The combining user makes the
    final decision on the absence or presence of the licensed signal at t . The optimum
    decision is based on the following likelihood ratio: ρ= P( u 1 , u 2 ,…, u K |
    H 1 ) P( u 1 , u 2 ,…, u K | H 0 ) (11) View Source which, through licensed band
    occupancy statistics, can be represented as functions of u k ''s, t k ''s, and
    t . Then, the final decision at t can be made by comparing the likelihood ratio
    with a predetermined threshold. 2. Nonideal Reporting Channel Aside from the sensing
    channels from the PU to the CR users, the reporting channels from the CR users
    to the combining user may also experience fading, which limits the performance
    improvement from cooperative spectrum sensing without proper design. In [54],
    space–time block coding (STBC) is proposed to ensure robust reporting. When there
    are two CR users U 1 and U 2 with local information as D 1 and D 2 , respectively,
    they exchange their sensing information and then U 1 send { D 1 , D 2 } , whereas
    U 2 sends {− D 2 , D 1 } . When the interuser channel between the two users is
    good, diversity gain can be achieved. When that channel is poor, there is no diversity
    gain, but there is still a coding gain of around 3 dB. If there are more users,
    they can form pairs, and each pair uses a given slot to apply the same scheme.
    Similarly, space-frequency (SF) coding can be applied for orthogonal frequency-
    division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CR users. 3. Decentralized Network As aforementioned,
    the CR network is assumed to be centralized with a combining user. In a decentralized
    network, it has been shown in [39] that the amplify-and- forward (AF) cooperation
    protocol [55], in which one user acts as a relay for the other user and then amplifies
    and forwards the signal received from its partner without any further processing,
    can be applied. Because AF cooperation improves the performance of spectrum sensing
    only under certain scenarios, appropriate pairing of cooperative CR users is needed
    to optimize the overall detection capability of the CR network. In [40], an efficient
    pairing algorithm has been given for a decentralized CR network with corresponding
    performance analysis. SECTION IV. Cognitive Spectrum Access So far, spectrum-sensing
    techniques for identifying the spectrum holes have been reviewed from the signal
    processing perspective. Based on the sensing results, the CR users can perform
    cognitive spectrum access through the OSA model. Alternatively, if the CR Tx has
    obtained the channel-state information involved for primary Rx protection [56],
    the CSA model can be used for cognitive spectrum access. In this section, transceiver
    design for the OSA and CSA models will be discussed. In particular, transmit signal
    waveform design is considered for the OSA model, and transmit resource allocation
    is studied for the CSA model. The capacity limits of CR channels with genie cognitive
    capability have been considered in [11] and [57] from the information-theoretic
    perspective. The transmit strategies for the CSA model are also reviewed in [58]
    from the convex optimization perspective, as well as in [54], with additional
    considerations of cooperative communications. A. Transmit Signal Design for OSA
    The OSA model allows the CR users to coexist with the PUs in an opportunistic
    way, and most CR transmission schemes fall into this category. As the SUs of a
    licensed spectrum, the CR users in OSA ideally transmit only within the spectrum
    holes. They attempt to avoid interference with the PUs through spectrum-sensing
    results and other knowledge that is acquired before and during their operation.
    In particular, the CR users may access a spectrum band when the PUs are not active,
    which means that the CR and the PUs can be deployed in the same geographic region
    but at different time slots. Furthermore, the CR users may access the spectrum
    band when the CR and PUs are in different geographic regions, where path loss
    and shadowing in wireless channels separate them without interfering with each
    other. Each of the identified spectrum holes may have different bandwidths, and
    they may be either contiguous or discontiguous in the spectrum domain. In PHY-layer
    implementation, the spectrum holes can be bonded together and share the same set
    of modulation schemes as discussed in the following paragraphs, and this approach
    is called channel bonding. Alternatively, the spectrum holes can be classified
    into several subgroups, each of which may contain one or multiple (possibly discontiguous)
    spectrum holes and is realized by the same set of modulation scheme. This scheme
    is called channel aggregation. Using channel aggregation, the bandwidth of the
    modulation scheme for each group is much reduced compared to channel bonding,
    particularly when the spectrum holes are far apart from each other in the spectrum
    domain. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss two PHY-layer schemes for
    designing the signal waveforms suitable for each subgroup. In OSA, multicarrier
    modulation techniques become natural candidates for CR transmission mainly due
    to the flexibility in spectrum usage. As the most popular multicarrier technique,
    OFDM, with its own advantages of combating fading and interference, has been proposed
    for the PHY layer of CR. By properly nulling subcarriers, the CR users can dynamically
    and efficiently avoid interference with active PUs over these subcarriers. OFDM-based
    spectrum pooling has extensively been discussed in [59], where several potential
    problems for realizing the pooling scheme have been identified, among which, the
    mutual interference between the CR users and the PUs is critical for CR users
    to work on a noninterference basis. Windowing and active subcarrier cancelation
    techniques have been proposed to reduce the power leakage in the sidelobes of
    OFDM subcarriers to limit the interference level [60], [61]. The transform-domain
    communication system (TDCS) is another approach for realizing OSA, which was originally
    proposed in [62] for military communications, with the basic idea of using spectrum
    information to avoid jammers. In OSA, similarly, information from spectrum sensing
    can be used to dynamically shape the transmitted waveform such that the interference
    to and from licensed systems can be avoided. It has been shown in [63] that TDCS
    is also a potential candidate for CR transmission. In TDCS, a basic waveform is
    first generated based on the available spectral bands for secondary communications,
    and then, information is transmitted through modulation, which is determined by
    the basic waveform. As shown in Fig. 5, the TDCS Tx first takes samples from the
    surrounding spectrum environment to identify interference-free spectrum bands.
    Spectral estimation may be used for such a purpose. The magnitude of the basic
    waveform is set to be unity for frequency bands with interference less than a
    threshold and is set to zero otherwise, which makes the TDCS symbols similar to
    noise. After scaling and inverse Fourier transform, the resulting basic waveform
    is used to modulate the data with either antipodal signaling, cyclic shift keying,
    or other more complicated and efficient ways. Fig. 5. TDCS transmitter structure.
    Show All Although both OFDM and TDCS are based on Fourier transform and use frequency
    nulling, they are essentially different. Notably, TDCS randomizes the phase of
    the spectral components. Moreover, OFDM is designed to mitigate the interference,
    whereas TDCS is mainly designed to deal with jammers. The basic principle of OFDM
    is to split a wideband spectrum into a number of narrowband subcarriers, whereas
    TDCS uses the entire spectrum band to represent one symbol. In TDCS, symbol orthogonality
    is achieved by randomizing the phases. In OFDM, subcarrier orthogonality is realized
    by properly choosing the subcarrier spacing. B. Transmit Power Allocation for
    Single-Antenna CSA As aforementioned, in CSA, the CR users coexist with the PUs
    at the same time and the same geographic region, as long as they do not cause
    harmful interference to the primary Rx''s [64]. Recalling Fig. 2 in the single-antenna
    CSA model, the CR communication can only be established with a constraint on the
    power received at a third-party (primary) Rx. Therefore, the knowledge of channel
    gain g 0 is of significance to the CR Tx to protect the primary Rx. In [65], the
    channel capacities of the secondary CR link under the interference power constraint
    at the primary Rx for AWGN and fading channels have been analyzed, respectively.
    It is shown that the CR link capacity in the fading channel exceeds the AWGN channel.
    This is because the AWGN channel lacks variation, which leads to fewer opportunities
    for the CR transmission. In [66], both the peak and the average interference power
    constraints are considered, whereas in [67], both the average and the peak power
    constraints on the primary Rx have been studied, together with the transmit power
    constraint. It shows that the capacity under the average power constraint is larger
    than under the peak power constraint. When the channel gain between the secondary
    Tx to the primary Rx is imperfectly known, the effect of such imperfectness on
    the mean capacity of the secondary link has been addressed in [68]. It is shown
    that the interference power limit has to be reduced due to the channel imperfectness,
    by which the secondary link capacity is eventually reduced. The results for multiple-access
    and broadcast channels under interference power constraints can be found in [69]
    and [70]. C. Resource Allocation for Multiantenna CSA The use of multiple antennas
    for wireless transmissions provides us both multiplexing and diversity gains [71],
    [72]. In the following sections, we will review transmit and receive strategies
    for the CSA model when the CR nodes are equipped with multiple antennas. 1. Cognitive
    Multiple-Input–Multiple-Output (MIMO) Channel Let us first consider a secondary
    system where both the CR Tx and the CR Rx are equipped with multiple antennas.
    The received signal at the CR Rx is given by y=Hx+n (12) View Source where x is
    the n T -D signal vector that is transmitted by the CR Tx, H is the n R × n T
    full-rank channel matrix between the Tx and its intended Rx, y is the n R -D vector
    that is received by the CR Rx, and n is the n R -D noise-plus-interference vector
    at the CR Rx. It is proposed to use a set of power and interference constraints
    to realize several practical considerations for the CR, including, but not limited
    to, the following conditions. We have Tr(Q)≤ P t (13) View Source where Q is the
    covariance matrix of the CR Tx, and P t is its own transmit power constraint.
    Null power constraints. We have U H Q=0 (14) View Source where U is a matrix whose
    columns represent the spatial and/or the frequency “directions” the CR Tx is not
    allowed to transmit. Average power constraints. We have Tr( G H QG)≤ P ave (15)
    View Source where the range space of the matrix G identifies the subspace where
    the interference level should be kept under the required power constraint P ave
    . Peak power constraints. We have λ max ( G H QG)≤ P peak (16) View Source where
    λ max (⋅) denotes the maximum eigenvalue of a matrix, and P peak is the corresponding
    maximum peak power constraint. With the aforementioned constraints, different
    transmit schemes can be designed to maximize the achievable rate of the secondary
    link as R= log 2 |I+HQ H H |. (17) View Source For example, standard optimization
    methods are used to design the transmit strategy in [73]. When the CR Rx and the
    primary Rx each have a single antenna, the transmit strategy is termed cognitive
    beamforming [73], which balances the transmissions to the CR Rx and the primary
    Rx. The interference alignment idea has been used in [74], where the secondary
    MIMO transmission operates on the eigenspaces that are unused by the primary MIMO
    link. When the acquired channel-state information is imperfect, a robust criterion
    can be used to design the transmit strategy such that the primary Rx can be protected
    for all its possible channel states, and the solution is called robust cognitive
    beamforming [75], [76]. 2. Cognitive Multiple-Access Channel If multiple CR users
    share the same spectrum with the PUs to transmit independent messages to a common
    BS in the secondary network, this channel is called the cognitive multiple- access
    channel. In this scenario, all the CR Tx''s need to jointly design their transmission
    strategies to achieve the maximum secondary network performance under the transmit
    and interference power constraints. In [77], the CR Tx''s are equipped with single
    antenna each, and the Rx''s are equipped with multiple antennas. Power allocation
    at the CR Tx''s and receive beamforming at the CR Rx are designed either to maximize
    the sum rate of the secondary network using zero-forcing-based decision-feedback
    equalizer or to maximize the achievable SINR targets among all the CR users who
    use linear minimum-mean-square-error Rx. Note that suboptimal Rx''s are considered
    in [77], whereas optimal Rx''s are considered in [78]. 3. Cognitive Broadcast
    Channel If the transmission from a common BS (CR Tx) of the secondary network
    to multiple CR Rx''s in the presence of primary transmissions is of interest,
    this scenario is described as a cognitive broadcast channel. In [79], the secondary
    network is a multiuser MIMO broadcast channel, and the problem of interest is
    to maximize the weighted sum capacity of the SUs under the interference power
    constraints at the primary Rx and the sum power constraint at the CR Tx. The duality
    between the conventional MIMO broadcast channel and the MIMO multiple-access channel
    under the sum power constraint [80] was first extended to a generalized duality
    with an arbitrary linear transmit covariance matrix constraint, through which
    the optimal transmit strategy at the CR Tx was derived. When the number of secondary
    Rx''s is large, opportunistic spectrum sharing is designed in [81] such that a
    group of mutually orthogonal secondary Rx''s are selected for service, yet maintaining
    low interference to the primary Rx. Under the primary Rx protection constraint,
    distributed beamforming and rate control are addressed in [82], and cognitive
    multicast beamforming has been studied in [83], where each secondary Rx intends
    to receive the common information from the multiantenna secondary Tx. 4. Blind
    Channel Estimation Note that, to efficiently utilize spectrum resource with cognitive
    MIMO, the CR user has to acquire the information of different channels, among
    which the interference channel from the CR Tx to the PU is difficult to obtain.
    To alleviate such a requirement, the idea of an effective interference channel
    is introduced in [84], and a practical cognitive beamforming scheme is proposed.
    When two PUs take turns in transmitting to each other, the CR Tx takes samples
    from both users over the frequency band of interest through spectrum sensing.
    Define the covariance matrix due to only signals from PUs as Q s = α 1 G H 1 S
    1 G 1 + α 2 G H 2 S 2 G 2 (18) View Source where G i is the channel matrix from
    the i th PU to the CR Tx, S i is the covariance matrix of the i th PU, and α i
    is the expected value of the portion of instants that the i th PU is transmitting.
    Based on the sample covariance matrix acquired during spectrum sensing, the effective
    channel, which is defined as G H eff =( Q ^ s ) 1/2 (19) View Source where Q ^
    s is the estimated version of Q s , can be obtained. Then, the transmit covariance
    matrix of the CR Tx S CR = A CR A H CR (20) View Source should ideally be designed
    such that G eff A CR =0. (21) View Source This way, the CR transmission will cause
    no adverse effect on the primary communication. In practice, the effective interference
    channel is estimated by the CR Tx using blind-signal-processing techniques [56],
    [85], [86] due to the two-way communications of the PUs. Due to the limited amount
    of time spent for channel learning, however, the obtained effective interference
    channel is usually imperfect; thus, the interference that is caused by the CR
    transmission to the primary Rx will not be zero. Fortunately, this interference
    power to primary Rx''s is predictable by quantifying the subspace estimation errors;
    thus, the CR transmission power can be regulated such that the interference power
    constraint is met. Finally, because blind channel estimation, channel training,
    and secondary transmission all consume time and power resources, there exists
    a tradeoff design among the three operations [56], [85], [86], which is similar
    to the sensing-access tradeoff in the OSA model [46]. SECTION V. Impact of Spectrum
    Sensing on Cognitive Radio Medium Access Control Design Conventionally, the MAC
    layer is responsible for handling the medium access resolution for multiple users
    either in a fixed manner, e.g., through time-division multiple access (TDMA) or
    frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), or using random access mechanisms,
    e.g., carrier sensing multiple access (CSMA). In CRNs with multiple CR users,
    the spectrum holes are opportunistic resources; thus, the CR MAC needs to support
    the identification of spectrum holes and access of multiple frequency channels
    in a dynamic manner. Furthermore, the CR MAC design needs to consider practical
    constraints, e.g., the availability of a common control channel for information
    sharing and the number of transceivers available for sensing and communication
    operations. This condition implies that the CR MAC must be spectrum aware, i.e.,
    providing medium access flexibly in the spatial, time, and frequency domains,
    and at the same time, it must understand the underlying limitations due to practical
    constraints. As aforementioned, spectrum sensing is an important task in CR design.
    Aside from its signal-processing nature, the execution of spectrum sensing needs
    to be scheduled by the MAC layer. In addition, when the spectrum holes are identified
    by more than one CR user, the CR MAC has to decide how the spectrum can effectively
    be accessed. In this section, we review the design considerations for the CR MAC
    related to sensing operation, which include sensing scheduling, sensing-access
    coordination, and cooperative spectrum sensing. The following criteria need to
    be considered when designing the CR MAC. Sensing accuracy. In general, spectrum
    sensing should be carried out to meet certain target probabilities of false alarm
    and detection. This condition, when translating into MAC-layer requirements, means
    that each spectrum sensing must be carried out for a minimum period of time, e.g.,
    T s , and involves a minimum number of nodes with certain sensing signal strength.
    Furthermore, to avoid self interference, which causes false alarms, the MAC layer
    usually needs to ensure that, when spectrum sensing is carried out, all CR (secondary)
    communications are postponed. This case leads to the schedule of the so-called
    quiet sensing periods. Sensing timeliness. At the MAC layer, spectrum-sensing
    tasks should frequently be scheduled to quickly detect PUs when they become active
    on the channels at which a CR user operates. Usually, this case translates into
    the minimum interval between two consecutive sensing activities. This interval
    can be denoted by T i . CR transmission QoS. When quiet periods are scheduled
    for spectrum sensing, all CR communications are suspended, and this case causes
    negative effects on the QoS of various applications, e.g., video streaming or
    voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Therefore, sensing scheduling must be designed
    to minimize negative effects on the system performance while meeting the accuracy
    and timeliness requirements. Because both spectrum sensing and spectrum access
    require time-domain resources, one of the research challenges in MAC design is
    how we can balance the sensing and spectrum access times [87]. For OSA with frame-based
    MAC and periodic spectrum sensing, this challenge is related to the following
    three design issues. Where should the sensing slot be allocated within each frame?
    How much time should be spent for spectrum sensing in each frame? How frequent
    should the sensing operation be carried out? In general, these questions become
    complex when sensing and communication share the same transceiver (antenna and
    RF front end), for which a tradeoff between sensing performance and spectrum access
    opportunity needs to be considered. In fact, if we also taking into account the
    cost that is related to energy consumption for each operation, it is clear that
    the optimization result also depends on the environment, application, and, even,
    user preferences. The first and second questions are related to sensing scheduling
    and sensing-access tradeoff design, respectively. With regard to the third question,
    one study is given in [88], where, assuming that the PU''s short-term traffic
    statistics are known, the frame duration is designed by optimizing CR''s transmission
    throughput under the collision constraint introduced to PUs. A. Spectrum-Sensing
    Scheduling The first question is related to sensing scheduling. If we purely look
    at the sensing requirement, one simple way is to allocate a fixed portion of each
    frame as a sensing period (quiet period), and the duration of the sensing period
    needs to be long enough such that the sensing accuracy requirement is satisfied.
    For stringent sensing requirements such as in IEEE 802.22, the required sensing
    duration can be very long, which may affect the transmission QoS of CR users.
    Thus, one alternative way is to split the whole sensing duration in each frame
    into multiple sensing slots [46]. By doing so, the transmission QoS of CR users
    can be improved, and at the same time, we may achieve better sensing accuracy
    due to the exploitation of sensing diversity under fading environments. A unified
    control framework that jointly considers spectrum sensing and CR data transmission
    is proposed in [89]. The method treats each sensing period as a virtual packet
    transmission. By introducing virtual sensing users and virtual sensing packets,
    the problem of joint scheduling of spectrum sensing and packet transmission can
    be abstracted as a parallel queuing network. This approach allows us to schedule
    the traffic in this parallel queuing system so that the packet loss due to deadline
    violation for data nodes is minimized, whereas all virtual sensing packets meet
    their sensing deadline requirement [90]. B. Sensing-Access Tradeoff For a given
    frame duration, the optimal sensing time design for periodic spectrum sensing
    is studied in [46]. The key design methodology is described as follows. Because
    the spectrum-sensing time affects the two probabilities associated with spectrum
    sensing, by adjusting the detection threshold for a given frame duration, the
    optimal sensing duration is designed by maximizing the achievable throughput of
    the SUs under the constraint that the PUs are sufficiently protected. The achieved
    probability of detection at the worst-case SNR is used to quantify the protection
    to PUs. Using the ED sensing scheme as the basis, one interesting sensing-access
    tradeoff problem is formulated, and it is shown that the formulated problem, indeed,
    has one optimal sensing time, which yields the highest throughput for the SUs.
    The sensing-access tradeoff design in [46] is based on single-band sensing and
    point-to-point communications in the secondary network. In [91], the design methodology
    has been extended to wideband multichannel sensing by designing the optimal common
    sensing time across all the bands. Channel aggregation and power allocation across
    all the bands have been considered. Cooperative spectrum optimization has been
    studied in [92] by considering such sensing-access tradeoff and optimizing the
    fusion schemes in the fusion center. In [93], the tradeoff design idea has also
    been extended to the case when the secondary network makes use of CSMA-based random
    access. By adjusting the sensing time (quiet period) and the probability of false
    alarm, the number of SUs who enter into the CSMA random access is controlled,
    through which the saturated throughput and delay performance can be optimized.
    Note that the tradeoff design in [46] considers the case that the PUs are either
    on or off in a long time scale. In other words, it does not take into account
    the short-term traffic pattern of the primary networks (PNs). In [94], the authors
    consider a spectrum access scenario when the transmission of PUs is slotted and
    evolves in a Markovian manner between active and idle, and the SUs follow the
    same slot structure and independently sense the channels prior to opportunistic
    data transmission. The opportunistic spectrum sensing and access policy is jointly
    designed under the formulation of finite-horizon partially observable Markov decision
    process (POMDP). Interestingly, in [95], the authors show that a separation principle
    exists, which decouples the design of sensing policy from the spectrum access
    policy. A somewhat-similar approach can be also found in [96], which considers
    an unslotted PN. The work in [97] attempts to bridge the gap between [46] and
    [95]. The PN operates in a time-slotted manner and switches between the idle and
    the active states according to a stationary Markovian process. At the beginning
    of each time slot, the instantaneous state of the PN is not directly observable,
    and the SU needs to decide whether to stay idle or to carry out spectrum sensing.
    If the SU chooses to carry out spectrum sensing, it needs to decide the duration
    of the sensing period and to configure related parameters to meet a minimum detection
    probability. Subsequently, if spectrum sensing indicates that the PN is idle,
    the SU proceeds to transmit data during the rest of the time slot. By staying
    idle in a particular time slot, the SU conserves energy but, at the same time,
    suffers increase in delay and reduction in throughput. By carrying out spectrum
    sensing, the SU consumes time and energy to acquire knowledge of the state of
    the PN and stands a chance to transmit data if the PN is idle. Furthermore, there
    are tradeoffs that involve energy consumption, sensing accuracy, and transmission
    time when the duration of sensing periods is varied. For the SU, given the delay
    cost that is associated with staying idle in a time slot, the energy costs that
    are associated with spectrum sensing and data transmission, and the throughput
    gain that is associated with a successful transmission, the authors consider the
    problem of finding an optimal policy that decides the idle and sensing modes,
    together with spectrum-sensing time, to maximize the expected net reward. C. Cooperative
    Spectrum Sensing As pointed out in [29], the following three main questions with
    regard to cooperative spectrum sensing should be considered. How much can be gained
    from cooperation? How can CR users cooperate? What is the overhead that is associated
    with cooperation? In Section III, signal-processing techniques of cooperative
    spectrum sensing have been addressed, and the gain due to cooperation depends
    on the frequency band of interest and channel characteristics [98], [99]. In fact,
    the cooperative spectrum sensing can benefit from the knowledge of the topology
    of primary and secondary networks, particularly information on the locations of
    the sensing Rx''s. This concept has been considered in [100] from a theoretical
    perspective, in [101] and [102] in the context of radio environment maps, and
    in [103] for ad hoc networks. MAC-layer design should address how cooperation
    is achieved and what overhead is involved. One of the works that follows this
    direction is [104], where the tradeoff between the sensing accuracy and overhead
    of exchanging sensing outcomes among distributed CR users is explored. Nodes make
    individual spectrum-sensing decisions, which incurs false alarms and misdetections.
    To improve sensing reliability, nodes can share their sensing outputs with other
    nodes and apply decision fusion. The more the shared information that a node receives,
    the lower the probability of false alarms and misdetections becomes. However,
    sharing information among distributed nodes can take significant time, which,
    in turn, affects communication. It is shown that there is a tradeoff between these
    two activities, which indicates an optimal number of outcomes that a node should
    collect from other nodes. The issue of cooperation overhead has also been considered
    based on the concept of price of anarchy [105], price of ignorance [106], or its
    complementary presentation as a value of perfect information [107]. SECTION VI.
    Cognitive Radio Medium Access Control Protocols CR MAC needs to be spectrum aware
    by taking into account the heterogeneity and dynamics of the available spectrum
    holes while protecting the PUs from harmful interference. The complexity of this
    task depends on the spectrum access model used and whether centralized or distributed
    control can be assumed. In this section, we provide a brief review on CR MAC protocols.
    See two recent and detailed surveys in CR MACs [12], [108], which summarize several
    MAC-layer-related issues and challenges for CR design. A. Classification of CR
    MAC Protocols Cormio and Chowdhury [108] classify CR MAC protocols by considering
    the following two dimensions: 1) one dimension on dividing the access as random
    access, time slotted access, or hybrid access and 2) another dimension on separating
    the protocols between ad hoc and centralized MACs. This classification is interesting
    from the operational and implementation perspective of CR MACs. Here, we consider
    two new dimensions that can be used to further classify the CR MACs. The third
    dimension of CR MAC classification is to consider whether the CR has out-of-band
    signaling capability. The stipulation of specific frequency band for signaling
    has its pros and cons that need to carefully be considered, and this approach
    depends on the deployment scenario. We do not analyze this issue deeply in this
    paper, but clearly, this case is one of the key differentiators that must be considered
    by commercial entities and system engineers when making decisions. The fourth
    dimension of MAC classification is related to the required information on the
    system state and parameters. The blind MAC protocols do not assume any or require
    very little external information about the primary and other secondary networks.
    On the other hand, some CR MACs require detailed information on the system state
    through a specific signaling method. These information-rich MACs may even require
    statistical information on the usage patterns of PUs. To do so, empirical models
    and measurement campaigns of spectrum usage are needed for an effective MAC design
    and a reliable MAC performance analysis. B. Centralized CR MAC Recent works that
    consider centralized channel assignment for multichannel CRN include [109]–[111].
    In [109], the authors consider a problem of opportunistically allocating multiple
    licensed channels to a set of CR users so that the total number of channel usages
    is maximized. In [110], the authors study a similar problem and introduce a reward
    function that is proportional to the coverage areas of BSs. In [111], a local-bargaining
    approach is proposed to support distributed spectrum allocation in mobile ad hoc
    networks. However, power control is not considered in [109]–[111], and interference
    is restricted based on the physical separation of communication entities. The
    disadvantage of this distance-based interference model is that it does not take
    into account the aggregated interference effect when multiple transmissions happen
    on a single channel. A CRN that consists of multiple cells is considered in [112]–[115].
    Within each cell, there is a BS that supports a set of fixed-location wireless
    subscribers commonly called customer premise equipment (CPE) in the referred papers.
    The spectrum of interest is divided into a set of multiple orthogonal channels.
    Each CPE can be either active or idle, and a BS needs one channel to support each
    active CPE. The objective is to maximize the number of active CPEs that can be
    supported, subject to the following two conditions: 1) The total amount of interference
    that is caused by all cognitive transmissions to each PU must not exceed a predefined
    threshold, and 2) for each supported CPE, the received SINR must be above a predefined
    threshold. When global knowledge of active CPEs across all the cells is available
    for making control decisions, a channel/power allocation scheme that maximizes
    the number of CPEs supported can be obtained by solving a mixed-integer linear
    programming (MILP). For a network with a large number of nodes, solving such an
    MILP can be highly complex. A more scalable scheme called dynamic interference
    graph allocation (DIGA) can be used, which is based on a dynamic interference
    graph that captures the aggregated interference effects when multiple transmissions
    simultaneously happen on a channel. When no global knowledge of active CPEs is
    available for making channel/power allocation decisions, a two- phase resource
    allocation (TPRA) scheme is proposed. In the first phase of TPRA, channels and
    power are allocated to BSs, with the aim of maximizing their total coverage. In
    the second phase, each BS allocates channels within its cell so that the number
    of active CPEs supported is maximized. We conclude by referring to a more centralized
    MAC-layer approach that is introduced by Zou and Chigan [116], which is a game-theoretic
    DSA framework. This approach is particularly interesting, because it combines
    several components into the same MAC framework, i.e., the OSA algorithm, clustering
    algorithm, negotiation, and collision avoidance. The OSA algorithm to optimize
    global performance by using the game-theoretic approach. C. Distributed CR MAC
    For a distributed control scenario, one closely related class of control problems
    is the multichannel MAC problems [117]–[120]. One important issue to be addressed
    includes the so-called multichannel hidden terminal problem. For a single-channel
    scenario, the traditional hidden terminal problem can be solved by exchanging
    request-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS) messages. However, for the multichannel
    problem, in which each node is only equipped with a single half-duplex transceiver,
    because nodes can listen on different channels, they may not receive the RTS and
    CTS transmitted by other nodes. This case leads to the so-called multichannel
    hidden terminal problem [119]. This problem is even more complicated when the
    set of available channels dynamically changes in CR networks. As pointed out in
    [121], existing proposals for using multiple channels in wireless networks, e.g.,
    [117]–[120], typically make several assumptions that may fail to hold in DSA networks.
    For example, most proposals assume that the set of available channels is static,
    i.e., the channels that are available for use are fixed at the time of network
    initiation. Because CRs may allow the spectrum available to dynamically change,
    the set of channels may also dynamically change. Furthermore, existing proposals
    often assume that the available channels are homogeneous, i.e., different channels
    have similar range and support similar data rates. The homogeneity assumptions
    are broken when different channels may be located on widely separated slices of
    frequency spectrum with different bandwidths and different propagation characteristics.
    Thus, there is a need to design higher layer protocols that suitably manage the
    dynamically changing/heterogeneous channels supported by a CR. In [122], the authors
    propose a protocol called cognitive medium access control (C-MAC) for supporting
    multichannel distributed CRN under OSA. The protocol is designed to support negotiation/cooperation
    among nodes within each channel and among different channels. This approach is
    based on setting up frame structure for each available channel and allowing nodes
    to exchange messages through beacon transmissions. Through this approach, sensing
    scheduling is also supported. However, it still remains to compare the efficiency
    of the proposed protocol with other protocols, because the major effort was placed
    in enhancing the robustness, and not the efficiency, of the protocol. In [123],
    a framework called a cognitive mesh network (COMNET) is proposed to support OSA
    in wireless mesh networks. Both spectrum sensing and spectrum allocation are taken
    into account. The objective is to allow the setup of a cognitive wireless mesh
    network based on off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11 WLAN cards. In [124], the authors propose
    MAC mechanisms that exploit idle periods between bursty transmissions of PUs for
    multiaccess communication channels. They also discuss approaches for sensing and
    modeling the idle periods of PUs. In [125], the authors consider the problem of
    MAC-layer configuration for CRNs. They propose a distributed algorithm that addresses
    the following two important issues: 1) how nodes identify their neighbors and
    communicate with them and 2) how nodes decide on the set of channel(s) that can
    be used for communication across the entire network. In [126], the authors propose
    a multichannel MAC protocols for OSA. The aim is to incorporate both sensing and
    communication requirements in the design. Unfortunately, spectrum sensing is oversimplified
    by assuming that sensing is perfect (no false alarms and misdetections). The effect
    of carrying sensing activities on communications is also not considered. In [127],
    opportunistic spectrum medium access control (OS-MAC) is proposed, which provides
    adaptive and DSA by coordinating the use of spectrum among CRs. It is based on
    the control information exchange through some common control channel and also
    requires time windows (periodic) to synchronize the coordination. Nevertheless,
    it can support ad hoc network operations. The hardware and PHY-layer constrain
    the spectrum-sensing operations and, generally, the capability with which the
    MAC-layer can be equipped. Hardware-constrained medium access control (HC-MAC)
    [128] emphasizes this fact by specifically considering hardware constraints. This
    contribution is valuable, because it specifically draws the attention to PHY-layer
    limitations and implementation challenges. Another interesting CR MAC protocol
    is dynamic open-spectrum sharing (DOSS) MAC [129], which allows the dynamic combination
    of available spectrum opportunities. It is also one of the MAC studies that specifically
    consider hidden and exposed node problems. Similar to several other proposals,
    it relies on the existence of an out-of-band signaling channel for busy tones
    and control signaling. These assumptions, although making practical MAC design
    easier, limit their applicability, particularly if common a control channel is
    not standardized. This case is one of the areas where standards and regulations
    have a strong impact on the MAC design. The adaptive spectrum band pooling based
    MAC is also proposed in [130] under the name single-radio adaptive channel (SRAC)
    MAC. This MAC protocol seems to be particularly suitable for ad hoc networks,
    and it is based on random access principles. However, the paper does not carefully
    address the issue of signaling overhead and long periods of time, during which
    CR cannot monitor the control packets. Finally, reconfigurable and multipurpose
    MACs have been studied in software-defined radio (SDR)-based CR context [131]–[133].
    SECTION VII. Cognitive Radio Networks As aforementioned, CR users can identify
    the spectrum holes and establish opportunistic communication links on a secondary
    basis. A CRN is composed of multiple CR users, and each CR user may want to access
    the identified spectrum opportunity. One of the critical issues for CRN design
    is to coordinate the transmissions of each CR user based on the identified spectrum
    holes while avoiding interference to the PUs or the PN. In general, CRNs can be
    classified as centralized or ad hoc networks [12], [13], and CRN architectures
    must support the mechanisms for CR operation and primary–secondary network coexistence.
    In a centralized CRN, a central unit, such as a BS in cellular networks, coordinates
    the spectrum sensing and spectrum access operations among the CR users. In this
    case, the whole centralized CRN can be treated as a super-CR user, but in a detailed
    level, different users may be required to carry out different tasks; thus, each
    CR user may have different cognitive capability. In ad hoc CRNs, there is no central
    unit to coordinate the CR users; thus, each CR user is required to have a certain
    level of CR capability to support its communications with other users. In this
    section, we first define three CRN models from the operational perspective and
    then introduce several schemes for CRN tomography, i.e., PN traffic pattern recognition.
    In the next section, spectrum-aware routing and QoS control will be reviewed.
    With regard to some of the important issues that are related to CRNs, including
    spectrum analysis, spectrum decision, and spectrum handoff, see two review papers
    [12], [13]. A. CRN Models There are different operational models for CRNs. One
    model is that all CR nodes have the same level of cognitive capability and execute
    the same set of networking protocols. This model is used in the IEEE 802.22 wireless
    regional area networks [134], [135], where each cell is treated as a centralized
    CRN (a super-CR user) that is requested to carry out spectrum sensing over the
    bands. Another model is that the CRN contains a collection of heterogeneous wireless
    networks in which the CR nodes support the coexistence and facilitate efficient
    exploitation of heterogeneous networks. This model has been used in IEEE P1900.4
    and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute Reconfigurable Radio Systems
    (ETSI RRS) [136]–[138]. By exploiting the cognitive capability, CRNs can overcome
    the problems in conventional networks, including the unawareness of network status
    and the lack of intelligent adaptation, by observing, reacting to, learning, and
    adapting to various environment stimuli [139]. In a more general sense, a CRN
    model can be defined as a collection of CR nodes in the secondary networks and
    the nodes of coexisting multiradio systems, including the PNs that execute the
    same set of CR networking protocols [140]–[145]. The links might adopt primary
    or secondary network protocols. This case means that the nodes of all coexisting
    networks, including both primary and secondary networks, can be interconnected
    and cooperatively internetworked. Within such a CRN, the packets from a source
    node will reach a destination node through multihop/multipath cooperative relay
    networks that are composed of PNs and/or secondary networks. B. CRN Tomography
    In designing CRNs, aside from sensing the presence of the PUs, sometimes, the
    CR nodes should also sense the traffic patterns of the PNs and coexisting networks,
    and this process is referred to as CRN tomography [146]. The traffic patterns
    of the PNs and coexisting networks are important for the routing design and packet-level
    understanding of the utilization of the network. The state of art in this field
    largely relies on Internet tomography [147]–[153]. In [146], the CRN tomography
    acquires the parameters and traffic patterns required for CRN operations through
    the passive monitoring and active probing of the coexisting networks and using
    statistical measuring, processing, and inferring techniques. In [154], schemes
    are proposed to obtain information with regard to connectivity, in general ad
    hoc CRNs, to enable routing algorithms. Finally, the interference and spectrum
    usage pattern information can be derived by analyzing the correlation between
    the packet-level tomography results and the information on measurement, modeling,
    and characterization of radio spectrum [99], [155], [156]. SECTION VIII. Routing
    and Control of Cognitive Radio Networks So far, we have focused on the one-hop
    delivery of packets from a CR node to its immediate neighboring node. The research
    community has also considered the general situation, where multihop or relay communication
    is enabled in the CR context. This case can be considered to be a cognitive and
    cooperative wireless network that creates a new dimension of design challenges
    [11], [154], [143]. Prior to studying the network layer of CRNs, we have to examine
    the properties of an opportunistic CR link. The CR link in CRNs can be characterized
    as a Markov chain model [143] based on the measurement reported in [124]. However,
    another critical property, i.e., the unidirectional feature [140], [143], is generally
    overlooked in the literature. The unidirectional feature of CR links primarily
    comes from the following two factors: 1) the short availability in time duration
    (i.e. opportunistic timing window) in any specific opportunistic CR link and 2)
    an upper layer network operation. A more realistic CR link model for white spaces
    is studied in [157], and a self-similar traffic model is observed in [158]. A
    Bayesian network approach is used in [159] to model link availability in multilink
    CRNs. Another way of characterizing CRNs is to analyze the degree distribution
    of connectivity by considering interference and percolation in random networks
    [160]. Due to the short available timing window for opportunistic links and heterogeneous
    networking in CRNs that consist of multiple-radio systems/networks, a node in
    a CRN may cooperatively relay packet(s) based on trust [145], whereas a security
    mechanism may consume too many radio resources and may not possible to operate
    in such a short time frame. Such a unidirectional nature may not warrant an automatic
    repeat request (ARQ) operation over every link in CRNs, which creates challenges
    in the control of CRNs, in addition to the routing in CRNs. For general-sense
    CRNs, conditions for successful transmissions include communication bandwidth
    available for CR Tx and Rx within the communication range and tolerable interference
    at reception, which relies on successful power control. Together with scheduling
    and routing, the problem leads to a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem,
    which can be solved using linear relaxation and local search [161]. Furthermore,
    to identify relay selection criteria such that cooperation is beneficial to both
    primary and secondary networks, we may properly select relays to reduce power
    consumption in primary transmissions and to simultaneously reduce interference
    from the primary traffic to the secondary network [162]. The performance improvement
    of the secondary network due to the extra spectrum opportunities can be characterized
    by analyzing the extension of its connectivity region through a percolation theory.
    Such self-motivated cooperation leads the way toward self-organizing wireless
    networks. Finally, cognitive relaying in the CSA has been addressed in [163] and
    [164]. A. Spectrum-Aware Routing There are two issues that should be considered
    for spectrum-aware routing. The first issue is that routing algorithms and protocols
    should be aware of the dynamically available spectrum holes and adapt their operations
    to such a changing environment. Second, routing algorithms should interact with
    dynamic spectrum allocation routines to choose the routing paths through which
    the generated interference is minimized. The concept of using different frequencies
    for different links is not completely new. In general, this approach is related
    to the frequency allocation problem, which is also considered in the context of
    dynamic industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM)-band operations [165]–[167].
    However, the use of dynamic spectrum allocation increases the degrees of freedom
    and the need for quick adaptation. Several classical packet routing algorithms,
    particularly algorithms that are developed in the domain of ad hoc networks, take
    into account the fact that links may be unreliable [168]. However, the introduction
    of dynamic spectrum allocation changes the problem. Similar to the case of mobile
    ad hoc networks, we also have to consider the possibility that unidirectional
    links appear in the routing graphs. The difference for CRNs is that unidirectional
    links may become significantly more probable than for ad hoc networks. In the
    case of joint coding or multihop routing, there is also a natural issue on trusts
    and cooperation. However, we leave the trust issue out, because it has been a
    widely studied topic and is slightly out of the scope of this paper [169]–[172].
    Spectrum-aware routing, also called opportunistic spectrum routing, has been considered
    by several authors [173]–[176]. The concept allows a source node to efficiently
    and practically explore the cooperative diversity on the commodity hardware of
    multiradio systems/networks, with the significant throughput performance gain
    advantage. This approach naturally requires a support from intermediate (relay)
    nodes. In other words, opportunistic routing takes advantage of the numerous yet
    unreliable wireless links in a wireless cooperative network in a probabilistic
    manner. It is very similar to the well-known cooperative communications, but this
    time, we exploit the concept at the level of networking structure and routing
    plane. The idea of opportunistic routing and the expected transmission count (ETX)
    metric in the context of ad hoc networks are well-known ideas [177]–[179]. A number
    of elaborate schemes build on this approach and other earlier ideas to enable
    opportunistic spectrum routing. Medium-access-control-independent opportunistic
    routing (MORE) provides opportunistic routing through the network-coding approach
    [174]. Without a global medium access scheduler, the forwarder can exploit spatial
    reuse, and the algorithm is extended to multicast. Spectrum-aware network coding
    has also been studied in [180] by considering interference power constraints to
    the PUs within the service area of the secondary network. The stability-aware
    routing protocol (STRAP) has been developed for multihop DSA networks and can
    utilize unused frequency bands without compromising the stability of the network
    [181]. Another proposal is the spectrum-aware routing protocol (SPEAR), which
    can establish robust paths even in the diverse spectrum environment with rather
    stringent latency conditions [182]. Spectrum-aware on-demand routing for CRNs
    was also considered by Cheng et al., where the on-demand-based approach has been
    adopted with cumulative path delay estimation [183]. The routing and spectrum
    allocation (ROSA) algorithm is one of the recent proposals for enabling throughput
    maximization in this context, taking care of the interference minimization and
    maximizing the weighted sum of differential backlogs so that the system stays
    stable [184]. See a related work in [185] and the references therein. Spectrum-aware
    mesh routing (SAMER) in CRNs is based on a mesh network framework where the routing
    algorithm passes traffic across paths with higher spectrum availability and opportunistic
    performance [186]. In general, the spectrum-aware routing problem is also related
    to interference-minimizing routing; for example, see [187]. Moreover, the problem
    is often considered a part of interference minimizing networks, where frequency
    and also transmission control are parts of the optimization parameters [188],
    [189]. Finally, by incorporating the nature of opportunistic links into the routing
    design, it is shown in [190] that a more effective routing algorithm can be designed
    in terms of delay performance. B. Statistic QoS Control In addition to routing,
    a successful CRN requires QoS control, error control, congestion control, and
    topology control. To handle these mechanisms over CRNs that consist of opportunistic
    links, “statistical control” may be used to serve our purpose. With the statistics
    of the node-to-node availability, the statistical QoS control [191] and the control
    of delay [192] are practical alternatives for end-to-end services in CRN operations.
    We can also apply this scenario to CRN tomography [193] to obtain information
    useful to routing. To infer such prior knowledge or estimation of node-to-node
    availability that is associated with cooperative relay(s), we may observe the
    history and statistics of successful packet transportation over a specific cooperative
    relay path. Because there involves packet transmissions (either implicit traffic
    packets or explicit probing packets) over multiple links, an active CRN tomography
    at the network level can be implemented based on traffic patterns. Considering
    a scenario with a set of possible cooperative relay paths among coexisting systems,
    the source node estimates the success probability of packet transmission according
    to the historical record from the reception of the destination node. The control
    and autonomous adaptation of PHY-layer parameters have also been considered by
    several research groups, typically centering at the concept of cognitive engine
    [194], [195] or a cognitive resource manager framework [196]. Lower level optimization
    and cross-layer operations in the context of QoS control have been considered
    by the same groups. This topic is also the area where Mitola''s original cognitive
    cycle concept with learning capabilities becomes unavoidable. C. Error Control
    Link-level ARQ is difficult to implement over an opportunistic link in CRNs [197].
    To construct an end-to-end hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) by combining
    information from multiple reception paths at the destination may be an attractive
    alternative as a generalization of macroscopic cooperative communications [197].
    Incremental redundancy is generated through cooperative relay to exploit spatial
    diversity [198], although a bidirectional link is assumed. In CRNs, however, there
    exist several unidirectional links due to interference avoidance with the PUs.
    Link-level HARQ based on a feedback channel is generally unavailable. For this
    session-level HARQ, error control is performed at the session level (end-to-end)
    between the source and the destination. We generate a coded packet from a message
    packet at the source and divide the coded packet into several coded subpackets.
    Then, these packets are sent over different paths of CRNs. Decoding is only performed
    at the destination by combining the coded subpackets that it has received, which
    may not receive all transmitted packets. Link-level error control [acknowledgment
    (ACK) between each link] is, therefore, avoided. Each intermediate node amplifies
    and forwards packets to the next hop along its routing path. A session-level ACK/negative
    acknowledgment (NACK) is only generated by the destination node, provided that
    the original message is (not) successfully recovered. According to simulations,
    such HARQ can approach similar-level reliable communication similar to regular
    wireless communications without opportunistic links. SECTION IX. Emerging Cognitive
    Radio Networks CRNs have actively been developed in various standardization committees
    toward commercial applications. In December 2003, the United States Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Order that sets forth
    proposals and seeks comment on the use and applications for CR systems. Following
    this notice, there is a significant upsurge in academic research and industrial
    application initiatives. For example, IEEE Std. 802.22 defines a standard on wireless
    regional area networks, which supports last-mile broadband wireless access over
    unused TV bands (also called TV white spaces) for large areas such as rural environments
    [134], [135]. In 2008, the FCC conducted phase-II tests on spectrum-sensing devices
    that are submitted by several organizations, including Adaptrum, the Institute
    for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A ∗STAR),
    Microsoft, Motorola, and Philips. The performance on detecting the TV and wireless
    microphone signals was evaluated, and the results of the tests somehow helped
    the FCC to obtain firsthand information on how spectrum sensing can be used to
    protect the legacy systems. In November 2008, FCC approved the use of wireless
    devices in TV white spaces. With this approval, the IEEE 802 Executive Committee
    approved the following two study groups to work toward setting up new IEEE standards
    on TV white-space devices: One group is under IEEE 802.11, which standardizes
    wireless local area network (WLAN)-type white-space devices, and the other group
    is under IEEE 802.19.4, which studies the coexistence mechanisms and solutions
    that support all IEEE 802 family white-space devices. There are also activities
    on prototyping WLAN devices over TV white spaces; for example, see [199]. As the
    first CR standard, IEEE 802.22 is a centralized CR system with a frame structure
    that consists of a quiet period for supporting spectrum sensing. In fact, to protect
    the primary systems, such as TV transmission and microphone users, IEEE 802.22
    has defined very stringent sensing requirements. Different sensing schemes discussed
    in Section II can be adopted, as long as they can meet the sensing requirements.
    The sensing-access tradeoff design methodology in Section V can be used to optimize
    the design of a quiet period to maximize the benefit of the IEEE Std. 802.22 system
    while protecting the primary systems. For TV white-space applications, FCC''s
    most recent ruling seems to be in favor of geolocation database solutions. This
    approach is, indeed, a safe scheme for protecting the TV broadcasters if such
    a database can provide the SUs the updated information about the available spectrum
    holes. For other types of PUs such as wireless microphone, it may be difficult
    for the database providers to acquire updated usage information about these PUs
    if these PUs are not required to do so. Therefore, spectrum sensing is still needed
    for the SUs to identify the spectrum holes to protect all types of PUs. Furthermore,
    spectrum sensing may become a service for companies to provide the database providers
    the updated spectrum-hole information. The momentum also increases over the simple
    TV white-space use for considering CRNs as more general overlay networks. For
    example, the IEEE Standards Coordinating Committee (SCC) 41 has developed the
    IEEE 1900 standard on heterogeneous wireless networks [136]. The CR concept can
    be also applied into future cellular systems. For example, channel aggregation
    (also called carrier aggregation) is one of the key techniques that are adopted
    in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Advanced. In [200], CR resource management is also
    applied to the femtocell networks of LTE Advanced. There is also an interest in
    the context of license-free secondary cellular operations that exploit vacant
    TV channels. Although the regulation and standardization in this domain are still
    very preliminary and there has been much speculation on what kind of applications
    and CRN concepts can commercially be built, the future of the field in this domain
    looks promising. SECTION X. Economics of Spectrum Sharing The concepts for enhancing
    spectrum utilization and spectrum management are theoretically promising. However,
    in practice, we have to consider that there are always costs related to exploiting
    spectrum opportunities. Moreover, there exists vulnerable period in spectrum sensing,
    and there is no reason for PUs to give away their spectrum privileges, unless
    some sort of incentives exist. The most straightforward incentives might be profit
    sharing from the spectrum-sharing mechanism. Consequently, the economics of spectrum
    management emerges as a critical issue for realistically deploying CRNs by balancing
    the interests among the PUs and the CR users. It is imperative to understand what
    the true value of spectrum opportunities is and which economic and business boundary
    conditions have to be considered. Initial solutions for the SUs have been developed
    to successfully compete with each other in the limited and time-varying spectrum
    opportunities based on auction, given experienced dynamics in the wireless network
    [201]. Spectrum sharing among a PU and multiple SUs can be formulated as an oligopoly
    market competition and uses a noncooperative game to execute the spectrum allocation
    for the SUs [202]. Operating the SUs in a self-organizing (typically ad hoc) network
    has been considered to adaptively and efficiently allocate transmission powers
    and spectrum among the CR users according to ambient surroundings without disturbing
    the PUs [203]. A pricing-based collusion-resistant dynamic spectrum allocation
    approach has been proposed not only to optimize overall spectrum efficiency but
    to combat the collusion among selfish SUs as well [204]. The collusion behavior
    among the SUs may seriously deteriorate the efficiency for wireless networks.
    Three different pricing models (i.e., market-equilibrium, competitive, and cooperative)
    through the game theory among service providers and the SUs have been investigated
    [205]. The interaction between the PUs (or service providers) and the SUs who
    can adopt the spectrum acquisition by observing the variations in price and QoS
    offered by the PUs (or service providers) can be modeled as an evolutionary game
    [206]. A second-price auction mechanism has been adopted in spectrum pricing among
    the auctioneer (i.e., service provider) and the SUs and to maximize the revenue
    of the service provider while satisfying the QoS requirements of the SUs [207].
    A novel efficient mechanism for multiwinner spectrum auction can efficiently improve
    spectrum utilization with collusion-resistant pricing strategies between the service
    provider and the SUs [208]. Because the collusion behavior among the SUs may decrease
    the revenue of service providers, [205] addresses the spectrum pricing in a CRN
    where multiple service providers compete with each other to offer spectrum access
    opportunities to the SUs under a QoS constraint for the PUs. The initial trial
    for considering all four parties that are involved in CRN operations (i.e. PUs,
    CR users, operators, and regulators to ensure the overall spectrum utilization
    efficiency) is given in [209] to ensure robust operation of CRNs that support
    every party''s practical or economic interests. This mechanism is facilitated
    through the real-time Vickrey auction at the BSs of the PS to warrant gaining
    interests for each party involved in CRN operations. A general framework for truthful
    double spectrum auctions has been proposed to enhance the economical viability
    of OSA [210], and in this context, multiple parties can trade spectrum based on
    their individual needs. The proposed framework is aimed at guaranteeing improved
    spectrum utilization while also making auctions economically robust. Other recent
    papers and references therein include [208] and [211]–[216]. SECTION XI. Challenges
    and Open Questions Overall, effective CR communications should exploit the available
    degrees of freedom in frequency, time, and space as much as possible and react
    to changes in these dimensions as quickly as possible. Incorporated with advanced
    PHY-layer transmission techniques, including multiple antennas and cooperative
    communications, spectrum efficiency can greatly be improved with enhanced system
    capacity. From the CRN perspective, if each node has such a cognitive capability,
    the end-to-end transmission efficiency can greatly be improved. Due to space limitation,
    we have also left out some important topics such as security, trust, policy issues,
    spectrum auctions and CR aspects of cellular applications. The readers may refer
    to other publications in recent reviews [217], [218] and recent special issues,
    e.g., [219]–[222], that may cover some of these topics. Finally, the application
    of artificial intelligence to CR design can be found in [223] and [224]. There
    are still challenges and open problems for realizing effective and efficient spectrum
    sharing for CR communications as follows. Common control channel. There is a pertinent
    question on whether we need a common control channel for CR operations. A common
    control channel will pave the path to an easier way of enabling information exchange
    during spectrum sensing and access in CR networks. However, unlike conventional
    networks, a common control channel may not be available in the initial phase when
    spectrum holes are not sufficiently identified. Furthermore, an identified channel
    may be reoccupied by the PUs at any time, which may interrupt the coordinating
    messages if it is used as a common control channel. How we can set up and maintain
    the common control channel is particularly crucial for proper operations in CRNs.
    Joint spectrum sensing and access. Spectrum sensing and access are usually separately
    designed, because spectrum sensing achieves certain detection performance, whereas
    spectrum access mainly focuses on improving the system capacity based on the identified
    spectrum hole. However, the two aspects are inevitably coupled. For example, different
    transmission power levels of the CR users may require different decision thresholds
    in spectrum sensing, and vice versa. Furthermore, the joint design of multichannel
    sensing and distributed random access will be a challenging issue in CRN. True
    opportunities and economy models. We need to quantify the economic and engineering
    benefits of using CRN-based systems over the traditional wireless communications
    systems. In addition, the underlying network economy models need to be developed
    so that the commercial community can feel comfortable with CRNs. More spectrum
    measurements are required to understand how many of the spectrum holes are commercially
    viable. The low utilization does not necessarily mean that the SUs can use the
    opportunity in any economically sensible way. CRN and CR implementation architectures.
    The actual implementation architecture for supporting fully functioning prototypes
    needs a cross-layer design concept, and it becomes challenging to build. In particular,
    handling the coordination and control of various levels of protocol stack and
    enforcing cooperation among the CRs still require considerable research and development
    work. SECTION XII. Conclusion In this paper, we have provided a systematic overview
    on CR communications and networking. Due to the explosion of research and publications
    in this field, this paper had difficulty in covering all the related topics. Instead,
    our focus has been on the key elements of the PHY, MAC, and network layers of
    a CR user who operates in a CRN, as well as the interrelation among these elements
    across different layers. We hope that this paper can help researchers and practitioners
    have a cross-layer view on designing CRNs. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Recent studies demonstrated that dynamic
    spectrum access can improve spectrum utilization significantly by allowing secondary
    unlicensed users to dynamically share the spectrum that is not used by the primary
    licensed users. Cognitive radio was proposed to promote the spectrum utilization
    by opportunistically exploiting the existence of spectrum "holes." Meanwhile,
    cooperative relay technology is regarded widely as a key technology for increasing
    transmission diversity gain in various types of wireless networks, including cognitive
    radio networks. In this article, we first give a brief overview of the envisioned
    applications of: cooperative relay technology to CRNs, cooperative transmission
    of primary traffic by secondary users, cooperative transmission between secondary
    nodes to improve spatial diversity, and cooperative relay between secondary nodes
    to improve spectrum diversity. As the latter is a new direction, in this article
    we focus on this scenario and investigate a simple wireless network, where a spectrum-rich
    node is selected as the relay node to improve the performance between the source
    and the destination. With the introduction of cooperative relay, many unique problems
    should be considered, especially the issue for relay selection and spectrum allocation.
    To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of cooperative relay for cognitive
    radio, a new MAC protocol was proposed and implemented in a universal software
    radio peripheral-based testbed. Experimental results show that the throughput
    of the whole system is greatly increased by exploiting the benefit of cooperative
    relay. Published in: IEEE Communications Magazine ( Volume: 47, Issue: 2, February

    DOI: 10.1109/MCOM.2009.4785388 Publisher: IEEE Introduction The radio spectrum
    is a limited and valuable resource that is tightly managed by governments. Recent
    reports showed a significantly unbalanced usage of spectrum; with a small portion
    of spectrum (e.g., cellular band, unlicensed band) increasingly crowded, most
    of the rest of the allocated spectrum is underutilized. Spectrum utilization can
    be improved significantly by introducing primary-licensed users and secondary-unlicensed
    users and allowing secondary users to access spectrum holes unoccupied by primary
    users. Cognitive radio [1] was proposed as the means for secondary users to promote
    the efficient utilization of the spectrum by exploiting the existence of spectrum
    holes. The main challenges to the efficient development of cognitive radio networks
    (CRNs) include primary user detection and transmission opportunity exploitation.
    Here we focus only on the latter issue, which means that after a spectral hole
    is identified, secondary users must exploit the transmission opportunity so as
    to maximize their own performance while not interfering with the primary users.
    Secondary users might be competing for the resource or cooperating to improve
    efficiency and fairness of resource sharing [2]. The recent study illustrated
    that large benefits can be gained from cooperation among different terminals.
    In the following, we first provide a brief overview of the application of the
    cooperative technology to CRN and then focus on a specific example that shows
    the advantages of cooperation relay to improve spectrum diversity. Cooperative
    Transmission to Improve Spatial Diversity Cooperative transmission — where the
    original idea comes from the basic relay model that consists of three terminals:
    a source S , a relay R , and a destination D — is well known as a powerful technology
    that combats signal fading due to multipath propagation in a wireless medium.
    By enabling a set of cooperating relays to forward received information, this
    regime exploits spatial diversity through cooperation among distributed antennas
    belonging to multiple terminals in wireless networks [3]. In the context of CRN,
    cooperative transmission can give rise to the following two different but basic
    scenarios. Cooperative transmission between secondary users: In this scenario,
    a secondary user acts as a relay from the transmission of another (source) secondary
    node. General considerations that are valid for cooperative transmission can be
    applied here; the only difference is that secondary nodes continuously must sense
    the spectrum for possible transmissions by the primary users. Cooperative transmission
    between primary and secondary users: In this case, secondary users can relay the
    traffic of a primary transmitter toward the intended destination. The rationale
    behind such a decision is that helping primary users finish their transmissions
    as quickly as possible will, in turn, lead to more transmission opportunities
    for secondary users [4]. We can see that cooperation transmission between secondary
    users aims to increase the secondary throughput for a given spectral hole, whereas
    cooperation transmission between primary users and secondary users aims to increase
    the probability of transmission opportunities. In summary, both of the above cooperation
    transmissions try to improve spatial diversity for the same spectrum frequency
    band. Cooperative Relay to Improve Spectrum Diversity The resource unbalance in
    CRNs is much more severe than in traditional wireless networks. The spectrum availability
    of secondary users is heterogeneous due to the location difference among different
    users, the dynamic traffic of primary users, and the opportunistic nature of the
    spectrum access of secondary users [5]. Moreover, the traffic demands of secondary
    users also can be quite different. Then, a natural yet important question is how
    to handle the unbalanced spectrum usage within the secondary network to fulfill
    the heterogeneous traffic demand from secondary users that has not drawn much
    attention before (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Motivated example for cooperative relay to
    improve spectrum diversity: a) network setup and performance without cooperative
    relay; b) time slot 1 with cooperative relay scheme; c) time slot 2 with cooperative
    relay scheme. Show All Our observation is that some secondary users may not be
    required to use their entire available spectrum because of the low traffic demand.
    Utilizing these nodes as helpers, to relay the other secondary users’ traffic
    with their otherwise wasted spectrum, can significantly improve system performance.
    In particular, suppose a transmission from S (with available channel CH1, CH4)
    to D (with available channel CH1, CH6) has 150 kb/s demand, but their common channel
    CH1 can support only 100 kb/s. Meanwhile, a neighbor R of both S and D has abundant
    channels: channel CH4 common with S and another channel CH6 common with D . We
    can involve R as a helper in this transmission: while S and D still communicate
    on their original link over CH1, S sends additional data on CH4, and D receives
    on CH3, with R switching between CH4 and CH6 to relay data from S to D . In this
    way, the data rate between S and D is increased, and spectrum resources are efficiently
    utilized. Starting from such a simple, yet interesting, observation, in this article
    we propose to use cooperative relay for CRNs with single-radio end users to more
    effectively utilize spectrum resources. However, the realization of this idea
    has several challenges: Traditionally, one radio can transmit or receive only
    at one channel at a specific time. The new relay-involved transmission raises
    a question from the start: how can such three-node, multiple-channel (probably
    discontinuous) transmission be possible? We propose and implement a new relay-assisted
    discontiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (D-OFDM) scheme with
    which the receiver can receive one flow of data from the source directly; at the
    same time, the relay node can decode another flow of data transmitted on another
    channel and shift it to a third channel to forward it to the receiver. The cooperative
    transmission scheme brings in new issues of resource allocation. For a network
    of secondary users, we must address how to select the proper node as relay node
    and also how to allocate the proper spectrum for secondary users. These problems
    are coupled together. In the following section, we formalize the joint-relay-selection
    and spectrum-allocation problem and propose a heuristic algorithm to address it.
    This work is the first one to explore the cooperative relay in the context of
    CRNs to improve spectrum diversity smartly by allowing spectrum-abundant nodes
    to help the spectrum-short ones. System Architecture In this section, we present
    an overview of the system architecture of a CRN with cooperative relay. In this
    article, we design the secondary system in an infrastructure mode as shown in
    Fig. 2: secondary end users, equipped with a single cognitive radio, connected
    to a local secondary access point (AP) to enjoy last mile connections. Primary
    users with different spectrums (channel 1 to 3, in this example) previously are
    deployed in the same region but are observed with quite low spectrum utilization.
    Secondary users can access these spectrum holes opportunistically, meaning they
    use the spectrum of the primary users only when it is not currently used by primary
    users. The secondary AP uses an OFDMA modulation scheme similar to the IEEE 802.22
    standard [5]. Note that the spectrum availability of secondary users can be heterogeneous
    due to the location difference among different spectrum users, the dynamic traffic
    of primary users, and the opportunistic access nature of secondary spectrum users.
    Figure 2. System architecture of secondary CRNs with cooperative relays. Show
    All As shown in the previous motivated example, we can improve the throughput
    of secondary users by leveraging cooperative relays. However, to make such an
    idea practical, we must address several challenges to: Signal processing: The
    three-node cooperation requires a signal for a single packet to be transmitted
    from a single radio on potentially discontinuous channels to avoid harmful interference
    to primary users. This can be realized by the existing approach of D-OFDM technology
    [6]. However, the signal partition, shifting, and combination required by the
    introduction of a relay node bring special challenges. Therefore, in the next
    section, we develop a novel signal processing scheme, named relay-assisted, discontiguous
    OFDM, to address those challenges. Resource allocation: Here the resource includes
    relay and channel resources —adjacent secondary transmission (pairs) content for
    relays and secondary node (pairs and relays) content for channels. Thus, the allocation
    of both relay and channel resource is coupled together and must be addressed jointly.
    Moreover, the resource allocation must take the transmission demand of each end
    user into consideration. This problem has not been observed in previous papers
    about CRNs yet. MAC-layer coordination: The unique operation of secondary nodes
    also brings challenges in the medium access (MAC) layer. The MAC protocol must
    coordinate the signal forwarding and packet transmission. In addition, the primary
    users’ signal detection is of fundamental importance for correct operation of
    secondary networks. We design our system as a synchronized system to ease these
    operations. The synchronization is easy to implement because the AP can make the
    coordination. Relay-Assisted, Discontiguous OFDM In this section, we address key
    challenges during the realization of the three-node cooperation technique and
    present our solutions to overcome these challenges. First, the sender must be
    able to transmit multiple packets on multiple channels at the same time using
    single-radio equipment. For this, we can simply adopt D-OFDM as the physical-layer
    technique, where signals on multiple channels can be transmitted simultaneously
    on single-radio equipment. Second, both relay and receiver should be able to alleviate
    the interference from other simultaneous transmitting channels to achieve a higher
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the specific channel. Third, relay and receiver
    should be able to decode the packet correctly using only some of all subcarriers
    that correspond to their working channel. We address these two challenges in the
    following two subsections, respectively. Radio-Frequency Configuration For the
    relay node or receiver, it is important to correctly decode the transmitted signal
    from multiple concurrently transmitted signals on multiple channels. To achieve
    this, it should filter out the signals on the working channel while it suppresses
    the noise and interference on other channels; this can be achieved by proper radio-frequency
    (RF) configuration. Assume that the frequency band of channel 1 is from ful to
    fv1, and the RF of the transmitter is set to be f0 at the receiver end. If RF
    is set to be the same frequency as the transmitter, when we use a filter to keep
    the signals on [fu1, fv1], signals in the symmetric frequency band [2f0-fv1, 2f0-fu1]
    also are kept. However, there can be severe interference in this frequency band.
    Therefore, to avoid the interference in the symmetric channel, the receiver set
    the receiving frequency to be f1 , which is on the right side of the whole bandwidth.
    Then, a bandpass filter is used to filter the signals in band [fu1, fv1]. Finally,
    the resulting baseband signal is multiplied by a sine signal of frequency f1−f0
    to be moved back into subcarriers [u1,v1] . Demodulation using Part of the Subcarriers
    Another key challenge for cooperative relay is that both the receiver and the
    relay should be able to decode the packet from a fraction of all subcarriers that
    correspond to the working channel. After the signals are filtered out, there are
    many other important functions that must be performed, including time synchronization,
    frequency alignment, and channel estimation. All these are performed based on
    the preambles added before the packet. Different from traditional OFDM, we must
    add preambles individually on each group of the subcarriers. Based on the preambles
    added before each channel, we use the delay-and-correlate algorithm to detect
    the beginning of the packet and use the cross-correlation-based algorithm to conduct
    symbol synchronization. Frequency error estimation is performed after the fast
    Fourier transform (FFT) module using the frequency domain algorithm to align the
    carrier frequency offset. Frequency domain channel estimation is conducted to
    overcome the influence of the wireless channel. Given the assumption that the
    channel is quasi-stationary and does not change during the time of transmitting
    a packet, we do channel estimation once for each packet. The implementation in
    the real testbed, introduced later, demonstrates that the proposed relay-assisted
    D-OFDM is feasible and can achieve significant throughput gain. Joint Relay Selection
    and Channel Allocation In this section, we focus on a network perspective: how
    secondary nodes in a CRN with cooperative relays coordinate with each other to
    allocate the relay and spectrum resource. The relay selection issue emerges when
    there are multiple resource-short nodes and resource-abundant nodes. We must make
    a decision of how to match resource-short nodes to their helpers. In addition,
    the channel allocation issue inherited in multi-channel networks still exists
    for both direct and relay links. What further complicates the problem is that
    these two issues are coupled. This is because relay selection has an impact on
    the channel allocation and vice-versa. Suppose time is partitioned into time frames
    with length Δt . In any frame, there can be two types of transmissions going on
    in the network. One is the traditional transmission between the AP and a node
    vi. The other one is the advanced transmission among three nodes (AP, vi, and
    its relay vj). We should make a decision in each frame on how to arrange the active
    transmissions into these two types. The detailed formulation for such a resource
    allocation problem can be found in a technical report [7], which is an NP-complete
    problem. To tackle that problem, we propose a heuristic solution based on the
    observation that if one user''s demand is not fulfilled, it will not act as a
    relay to help others because this definitely decreases the total throughput of
    the whole system (formal proof can be found in [7]). Based on this observation,
    we first partition nodes into two parts according to their traffic and spectrum
    availability. Then, we greedily select the best pair of destination and relay
    from the two parts to increase the system throughput. MAC Design for Relay-Assisted
    CRNs The previous sections present the feasibility of leveraging a helper to improve
    the throughput of a CRN. Then, we design a MAC protocol to coordinate physical
    (PHY)-layer operations among multiple nodes. Considering the existence of APs,
    global synchronization is rather easy to implement. The time is divided into time
    frames. At the start of each frame, secondary nodes with a single radio switch
    their radios to the common control channel to exchange control messages and negotiate
    the resource allocation, including both relays and channels. Then, in the remaining
    time of a frame, they switch to their assigned channels to conduct data transmission.
    Frame Structure Each MAC frame includes three parts: control-information exchange,
    downlink transmission, and uplink transmission. The length of the frame is fixed
    and is properly selected so that it can provide the required protection for a
    primary user by periodical spectrum sensing and can prevent high transmission
    delay. Primary User Detection With frame synchronization, primary-user detection
    can be controlled easily and provided with high accuracy compared to cases without
    synchronization. The detection process is put at the beginning of the information
    collection period. During the process, each secondary node is silent and senses
    the spectrum. Different sensing methods (energy detection, feature detection)
    can be applied. Coordination At the beginning of every frame, the AP sends a frame-control
    header on a common control channel. Nodes receive this header and synchronize
    with the AP. After that, a short period is used to collect information about the
    data demand and spectrum availability from each end user. Random access is used
    here. When the information is collected, a centralized algorithm at the AP is
    executed to allocate resources for all the secondary end users. Then, the allocation
    decision is broadcast on the control channel. Data Transmission After receiving
    the resource allocation message, each node adheres to the allocation decision
    made by the AP for downlink and uplink transmission. During the downlink time
    of one frame, if one node is assigned to communicate directly with the AP, it
    switches to the assigned channel to receive the transmission of the AP. For the
    relay node, it uses half of the downlink time to receive data from the AP and
    the other half of the time to forward data to the destination. For the node assisted
    by a relay, it spends the whole downlink time to receive data from the AP and
    uses half of the time to receive data from a relay on another channel. The uplink
    case is similar to the downlink one. The duration of downlink and uplink can be
    determined by the demand adaptively. Experimental Evaluation In this section,
    we set up a CRN testbed and implement our proposed relay-assisted D-OFDM, resource
    allocation algorithm, and MAC protocol. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate:
    An infrastructure-based CRN testbed set up. The core technologies to support cooperative
    relay were implemented through this testbed. Under various numbers of users and
    various traffic demands, our proposed cooperative relay scheme can consistently
    achieve good performance. The effectiveness of relay selection and channel allocation
    was verified through the experiments. Architecture for the CRN Testbed We design
    a cognitive radio system with the architecture shown in Fig. 3. Each node is composed
    of an open-source, reconfigurable-RF front end connected to a general-purpose
    computer in which the relay-assisted D-OFDM, resource allocation algorithm, and
    MAC functions are implemented in software. Each node serves upper-layer requests
    and interacts with the radio spectrum, with the input of spectrum usage rules
    from the external radio-spectrum management entity. Figure 3. CRN testbed architecture.
    Show All Reconfigurable Physical Layer The whole system is based on a reconfigurable
    hardware platform, and the physical layer is based on the platform of the universal
    software radio peripheral (USRP) and GNU radio. The USRP [4] recently became a
    popular experimental platform for wireless communication research projects. It
    implements front-end functionality and A/D and D/A conversion. RFX2400 daughter
    boards are used in our work, which operate in the 802.11 frequency range (i.e.,
    2.4 GHz) and have a transmit power of 50 mW (17 dBm). GNU radio [8] is an open-source
    toolkit for building software radios. It is designed to run on a PC; combined
    with minimal hardware, it enables the construction of simple software radios.
    GNU radio with version 7246 is adopted in our work, in which relay-assisted D-ODFM
    is implemented. With such a physical layer, we freely can adapt multiple dimensions
    of data transmission (power, frequency, and modulation). Spectrum Information
    This part is respon-sible for collecting and managing the spectrum information
    from the internal physical layer and for external radio spectrum management. The
    GNU radio of the internal physical layer can provide interfaces to deliver spectrum
    status, including both spectrum availability and channel condition, measured by
    the USRP. MAC Layer and Network Layer The MAC layer component is a self-developed
    part of the architecture. Depending on the detailed system configuration, the
    MAC protocol can be implemented in a standalone module, as a part of the GNU radio,
    or as a part of a routing layer. We leverage the work of the Click project as
    the routing part, which is built from fine-grained components, called elements,
    which perform packet processing. Cross-Layer Management Our cross-layer management
    component interfaces with other layers to collect network information and also
    to receive spectrum policy information from the radio-spectrum-management component.
    With such information, the cross-layer management component adjusts operation
    parameters to optimize network performance according to certain communication
    objectives. Performance Evaluation The CRN consists of a secondary AP and several
    secondary users (Fig. 4). We evaluate a relay scheme in different network configurations.
    Due to space limitations, only the topology with four nodes as shown in Fig. 5a
    is presented. Here, the numbers on the dashed lines indicate the number of commonly
    available channels between two connected nodes. The traffic demands are 100 kb/s,
    100 kb/s, 30 kb/s, and 0 kb/s, for node D1,D2,R1 , and R2 , respectively. The
    link between AP and D1 via relay R2 can support a data rate equal to one entire
    channel. However, if R2 is used by D1 , it has too much bandwidth compared to
    the demand of D1 , whereas D2 has no relay to fill its spectrum requirement. With
    our algorithm, an optimal transmission decision is made as shown in Fig. 5b: D1
    uses R1 as relay, and D2 uses R2 as relay. Figure 4. A photo of our real testbed.
    Show All Figure 5. Experiment for four end-users: a) topology with channels; b)
    optimal transmission. Show All Figure 6 shows the cumulative distribution function
    (CDF) of throughput gains for this topology. Our scheme provides a 35 percent
    (in theory, 40 percent) increase in throughput, which comes from D1 and D2 , with
    44 percent and 43 percent, respectively. Figure 6. CDF of throughputs for topology
    with 4 end-users: a) total throughput gain; b) throughput gain of nodes D1 and
    D2. Show All Further Discussion This article demonstrates the key concept of using
    cooperative relay for CRN. As this is a new research direction, additional research
    topics can be explored from this starting point. Transmission Constraints This
    work imposes several assumptions on the secondary users’ transmission that can
    be relaxed in future research. For example, we limit the secondary users’ transmission
    to be exclusive for each channel, meaning that within each time slot, a channel
    can be used by only one active transmission pair. System performance can be further
    improved if we allow simultaneous non-interfering transmissions among several
    distant destinations and relay pairs. Common Channel So far, we assume that there
    is always a common channel for the control message exchange between the AP and
    the end users, for example, industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands. When
    this is not the case, we must change the control channel dynamically according
    to spectrum availability. Another way is to use an OFDMA scheme such that each
    node uses its own channel common with the AP for control message exchange. Multiple
    Radios In our article, we assume all nodes are equipped with a single cognitive
    radio. This is reasonable considering the cost and size of end users. However,
    if this is not a concern, better spectrum utilization can be achieved. For example,
    if each node has two cognitive radios, a relay node can act as a pipeline between
    the AP and its relayed destination, with one of its radios communicating with
    the AP and the other one communicating with the destination on different channels
    simultaneously. Therefore, channels in the relay node are fully used, in contrast
    to half the effective time of the current design. Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Network
    Only infrastructure mode is discussed in this article. The cooperative relay concept
    also can be extended easily to ad hoc networks. In that case, multiple-source-destination
    pairs can exploit more spectrum channels with the help of relay nodes. However,
    coordinating ad hoc nodes is much more difficult than using the infrastructure
    mode. Synchronization, the multichannel hidden terminal problem, and distributed-spectrum
    sensing are several important issues that must be discussed. Conclusions Cooperative
    transmission appears to be a promising approach for improving the throughput of
    secondary nodes by increasing the spatial diversity and spectrum diversity. In
    this article, we gave a brief overview about some of the aspects of the interplay
    of cooperation and cognitive radio technologies. Facing the challenges brought
    by the heterogeneity in spectrum availability and also the traffic demand for
    secondary users, we explored the use of a cooperative relay node to assist the
    transmission of CRNs and improve spectrum efficiency. We observe that spectrum
    resources can be better matched to traffic demand with the help of a relay node.
    As the first work about exploiting spectrum resources using relay nodes for CRNs,
    we focus on the design and implementation in the infrastructure mode. To achieve
    this, we address several issues. First, we propose relay-assisted D-OFDM for data
    transmission as the fundamental component for the whole system. Second, we identify
    a new resource-allocation problem of joint-relay selection and channel allocation
    that is NP-hard. Finally, we design a practical MAC protocol to coordinate the
    relay and spectrum allocation. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance
    of cooperative relay for CRNs, we implement a testbed consisting of the USRP and
    GNU radio. Experimental results confirm a significant gain compared to traditional
    transmission. Leveraging a cooperative relay to improve spectrum diversity is
    a totally new research direction for CRNS; some interesting future research topics
    also are discussed. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported in part by Hong

    Metrics Abstract: This paper describes a new class of attacks specific to cognitive
    radio networks. Wireless devices that can learn from their environment can also
    be taught things by malicious elements of their environment. By putting artificial
    intelligence in charge of wireless network devices, we are allowing unanticipated,
    emergent behavior, fitting a perhaps distorted or manipulated level of optimality.
    The state space for a cognitive radio is made up of a variety of learned beliefs
    and current sensor inputs. By manipulating radio sensor inputs, an adversary can
    affect the beliefs of a radio, and consequently its behavior. In this paper we
    focus primarily on PHY-layer issues, describing several classes of attacks and
    giving specific examples for dynamic spectrum access and adaptive radio scenarios.
    These attacks demonstrate the capabilities of an attacker who can manipulate the
    spectral environment when a radio is learning. The most powerful of which is a
    self-propagating AI virus that could interactively teach radios to become malicious.
    We then describe some approaches for mitigating the effectiveness of these attacks
    by instilling some level of "common sense" into radio systems, and requiring learned
    beliefs to expire and be relearned. Lastly we provide a road-map for extending
    these ideas to higher layers in the network stack. Published in: 2008 3rd International

    IEEE Conference Location: Singapore SECTION I. Introduction Cognitive radio offers
    the promise of intelligent radios that can learn from and adapt to their environment.
    Much research is currently underway developing various reasoning and learning
    algorithms that allow cognitive radios to operate optimally in a large variety
    of different situations. However, as with many new technologies, initial research
    has not focused on security aspects of cognitive radio. Typically security is
    always “bolted on” after the fact by adding some sort of link authentication and
    encryption. This typically works well for data traversing a wireless network,
    but not necessarily for things fundamental to the operation of the wireless link
    itself. Since cognitive radios can adapt to their environment and change how they
    communicate, it''s crucial that they select optimal, secure means of communications.
    Data integrity and confidentiality can be handled by higher-layer cryptographic
    security, so here we focus on attacks fundamental to the cognitive radio itself,
    and independent of its higher-layer communications techniques. By putting artificial
    intelligence (AI) engines in charge of our wireless devices, we need to be aware
    that these engines can be provided false sensory input by adversaries, and this
    false input affects its beliefs and behavior (see figure 1). We need to look at
    threats we would ordinarily see in social networks, rather than computer networks.
    We define three classes of attacks: sensory manipulation attacks against policy
    radios, belief manipulation attacks against learning radios, and self-propagating
    behavior leading to cognitive radio viruses. All types of attacks manipulate the
    behavior of a cognitive radio system such that it acts either sub optimally or
    even maliciously. Protecting against attacks like these cannot be done through
    cryptographic means. It involves imparting some amount of intuition and common
    sense into a cognitive radio that allows it to debunk beliefs that don''t make
    sense. In this paper we explore these ideas. Very little research has examined
    new threats to cognitive radio due to their intelligent behavior. Some specific
    work has been conducted looking at attacks in dynamic spectrum access [1], [2],
    and was broadened to look at a variety of denial of service attacks against policy
    radios [3]. High-level requirements for using cognitive radio sensing and intelligence
    to address cross-layer security problems has been examined [4]. In this paper,
    we focus primarily on the physical (PHY) layer, and provide a general analysis
    of threats to different types of cognitive radio (including both policy and learning
    ra-dios). We then present a rough sketch at how such attacks can be mitigated
    in cognitive radio implementations, and provide a road-map for extending this
    analysis to the medium access control (MAC) layers and higher. An ideal cognitive
    engine would provide optimization across all layers, and the threat model fundamentals
    would apply to those higher layers as well; however, most of the current cognitive
    radio technologies focus on the PHY, so we use attacks against the cognitive radio
    PHY as exemplars. In the rest of the paper we develop the following threats to
    a cognitive radio network: sensory input statistics can be altered; faulty sensory
    input statistics can lead to belief manip-ulation; manipulated individual statistics
    and beliefs may be distributed through a cognitive radio network; and Fig. 1.
    Relationship between sensor input, beliefs, and behavior in a cognitive engine,
    showing how an adversary manipulating sensory input can change the beliefs and
    behavior of a cognitive radio. Show All behavior algorithms based on manipulated
    statistics and beliefs can result in suboptimal performance or malicious behavior.
    To mitigate the effectiveness of these attacks, cognitive radios should: always
    assume sensory input statistics are “noisy” and subject to manipulation; be programmed
    with some amount of “common sense” to attempt to validate learned beliefs; compare
    and validate learned beliefs with other devices on the network; expire learned
    beliefs to prevent long-term effects of attackers; and attempt to perform learning
    in known-good environments Section 2 describes common threat models currently
    used in security analysis, specifically the Internet threat model, and extensions
    assumed in wireless networks. Section 3 discusses threats to individual cognitive
    radio links. Section 4 extends that analysis to networks of cognitive radios.
    Section 5 details specific attacks against applications of cognitive radio being
    studied in contemporary literature. Section 6 develops techniques and strategies
    for mitigating these attacks. Section 7 provides a road-map for further study.
    Section 8 concludes. SECTION II. Wireless Threat Model In this section we outline
    the threat model commonly assumed for wireless networks, to provide a foundation
    on top of which we can start talking about a cognitive radio threat model. In
    any communication networks, there are two major attacker classifications: on-path
    versus off-path. An off-path adversary can inject data into a stream, or spoof
    other devices on the network, but cannot, in real time, see the traffic being
    transmitted. As such, off-path adversaries can be thwarted by using protocols
    in which devices can only participate if they can see the traffic. Fig. 2. Components
    within a single cognitive radio, showing reasoning and learning engines that manipulate
    the SDR''s operating state Show All On-path adversaries are by far the most capable.
    They can both observe and transmit data in real time. This gives them the ability
    to simply observe traffic, but also spoof, inject, remove, and alter it as well.
    Protection against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is difficult, as the adversary
    can degrade the link such that communication between valid parties is impossible.
    To protect against non-DoS attacks, a combination of mutual authentication, data
    integrity protection, and data encryption can be used. Most security-related protocols
    design for the worst-case scenario: the on-path adversary. Most transport protocols
    design for off-path adversaries, and recommend usage of a security sublayer if
    protection against on-path adversaries is required. Wireless networks offer additional
    challenges for protocol designers because it makes being an on-path adversary
    significantly easier. The link from individual devices to the network infrastructure
    is exposed much more so than in a traditional wired, switched network. All devices
    can see all traffic from all other devices within their radio-frequency (RF) range.
    Additionally, as in any network, connections between clients and servers typically
    traverse many physical links, each adding latency. By being so close to one end
    of the connection, attackers can much more easily spoof packets from devices within
    the broader infrastructure. Attackers in close proximity to their victim will
    see packets long before their intended recipient, making it easier to spoof a
    valid response before the server. The properties of RF also make deletion and
    alteration of packets much easier. By simply transmitting a jamming signal, resulting
    interference will degrade the signal quality for a packet, causing it to be lost.
    Once deleted, an altered packet can then be spoofed. Also the ease of deletion
    facilitates denial of service attacks. With wireless networks, we must assume
    the presence of on-path adversaries. Consequently, most wireless protocols include
    a built-in link-layer security protocol. For example, IEEE 802.11i [5] provides
    the necessary mutual authentication, data integrity, and data confidentiality.
    As we shall see in the next section, cognitive radio networks further complicate
    the threat model, as they offer adversaries the ability to interact with devices
    at an even more fundamental level. SECTION III. Threats to Cognitive Radio In
    this section we first describe the components in a generic cognitive radio and
    explain how they interoperate. We then detail two specific classes of radios:
    policy radios and learning radios. For these two classes we outline the types
    of attacks possible to the radios themselves. A. Cognitive Engine Architecture
    A cognitive radio (see Figure 2) consists of four major parts. First is the software-defined
    radio (SDR). This is a highly-configurable wireless communications device, typically
    capable of synthesizing a large number of communications waveforms by composing
    processing graphs of different radio components. For example, an SDR typically
    has an adjustable front-end allowing it to tune over different frequency ranges
    and an amplifier that allows communication at many different power levels. The
    modem components can implement many different modulation types with different
    symbol rates. Similar flexibility is possible for additional layers, including
    forward error correction and data framing, multiplexing, and scheduling. The SDR
    typically also has a wide variety of sensors. These sensors take digitized RF
    energy and produce a quantitative result. For example, an energy detector could
    measure the received power at the tuned frequency, in an effort to determine whether
    or not that channel is occupied. Specific waveform detectors can do similar tests
    to determine exactly what type of communications system is occupying the channel.
    Other sensors could characterize a noise or interference source by measuring the
    autocorrelation and other useful statistics that could help design an optimal
    transceiver. Receiver sensors can determine things such as the current signal-to-noise
    ratio (SNR), bit error rate, and frame error rate. The SDR then has a programming
    interface that exposes these configuration options and sensors to a controlling
    entity. They are essentially a set of inputs and outputs. The controlling entity
    needs to select the set of inputs that results in optimal outputs, where optimality
    is often defined with an objective or fitness function. Selecting the radio inputs
    is then simply a multi-dimensional, discrete optimization problem. To handle this
    optimization, a cognitive engine is intro-duced. All these inputs and outputs
    show up in the cognitive engine''s knowledge base as either read-only (statistics)
    or read-write (configuration). The knowledge base is a set of logical expressions
    representing the state of the radio system. Within the cognitive engine, there
    are two mechanisms for interacting with the knowledge base: the reasoning engine
    and the learning engine. A policy radio only has a reasoning engine, while a learning
    radio has both a reasoning and a learning engine. The reasoning engine is a set
    of logical inferencing rules, sometimes called a case-based reasoner. It is provided
    with a set of actions, the conditions under which those actions are executable,
    and how those actions affect the state of the knowledge base. The engine then
    proposes application of these rules in various permutation, searching for a proposed
    set of actions that will manipulate the knowledge base''s state in an optimal
    way. Here we select a combination of radio configuration values that will maximize
    some performance metric. Learning radios are far more flexible, because they include
    a learning engine. This learning engine is capable of starting with no preprogrammed
    policy and “trying out” various radio configurations to see how the system performs.
    For example, a radio can try out different modulation types to see which works
    optimally in a particular RF environment. Learning radios typically utilize a
    variety of classic AI learning algorithms, including search algorithms, neural
    networks, and evolutionary algorithms. In his dissertation [6], Mitola describes
    the typical cognition cycle of Observe → Orient → Plan → Decide → Act. If the
    radio supports learning, whenever this loop results in a new operating state for
    the radio, another stage called Learn is injected into the cognition cycle that
    allows the radio to add to its memory information about how the radio transitioned
    to this new operating state-information that can be used by Plan and Decide in
    future cognition cycles. In the context of Mitola''s cognition cycle, the goal
    of our attacks is to manipulate the Observe stage, and by doing so we can affect
    all others. For policy radios, by affecting Observe we can influence Act for that
    single cognition cycle. For learning radios, by affecting Observe we can influence
    Learn and thereby have a long-term impact on Act. While these AI features allow
    the radio to be extremely flexible and operate optimally in a large number of
    different scenarios, they can also offer an avenue for attackers, as described
    in the following sections. B. Policy Radios Threats In a policy radio, the main
    concern is an attacker spoofing faulty sensor information, causing the radio to
    select a suboptimal configuration. Radio sensors take digitized RF and extract
    useful statistics from it. By manipulating the RF the radio sees, an attacker
    can cause faulty statistics to appear in the knowledge base. By understanding
    how a radio''s statistics are calculated, an adversary can manipulate them. Since
    these statistics operate on raw RF energy, there is no cryptographic means of
    securing them, as is frequently done to prevent typical communications threats.
    We call this term of attacks sensory manipulation attacks since they rely on understanding
    a complex set of logic, and knowing what type of input to provide in order to
    coerce the desired output. C. Learning Radios Threats Learning radios are vulnerable
    to the same threats as policy radios, where an adversary provides false sensory
    input. However, a learning radio uses all its experiences to develop long-term
    behavior, making the attacks much more powerful. For example, an attacker can
    introduce a jamming signal whenever a policy radio switches to a faster modulation
    rate, forcing it to always operate at lower modulation rates, resulting in lower
    link speeds. This will cause link degradation for the duration of the attack.
    However a learning radio might permanently associate higher modulation rates with
    lower data rates, forcing it to always use lower data rates. Fig. 3. Process by
    which malicious, learned behavior, and the ability to teach that behavior to others,
    can be propagated through a cognitive radio network Show All Since these attacks
    can have much longer-term effects on learning radios we term them belief manipulation
    attacks. If you can metaphorically convince a radio that “up is down”, and “down
    is up”, and you can seriously impact how it behaves and reacts to particular situations.
    In the next sections we describe what effect these attacks can have on a network
    of cognitive radios, and then describe some technique for mitigating the attacks.
    D. Self-Propagating Behavior One of the most powerful types of attacks revolves
    around the idea of self-propagating behavior. In such an attack, state S on radio
    R 0 will cause behavior that induces state S on radio R 1 . Once radio R 1 is
    in state S , it can induce that same state on radio R 2 , and so on. Eventually
    state S will propagate through all radios in a particular area. More generally,
    it may not just be a single state S , but rather a series of state transitions
    S 1 ,…, S N that induce the same pattern of state transitions in neighboring radios.
    The result is effectively a cognitive radio virus as shown in figure 3, the severity
    of which will depend on possible side effects of these states. A key feature of
    these types of attacks is that they can spread between non-cooperative radios
    that never have direct protocol interaction. The possibility of such a set of
    states is not entirely implau-sible. For example, if many devices are trying to
    optimally and fairly share a distributed resource, often the optimal behavior
    is for each device to use an equal fraction of the available resource. When acting
    optimally, all devices are traversing the same series of states and executing
    the same behavior. An adversary may be able to influence this equilibrium such
    that the asymptotic state is not optimal, and possibly even malicious. SECTION
    IV. Cognitive Radio Networks From an artificial intelligence perspective, a network
    of cognitive radio is a set of independent, logical agents, interacting by each
    observing and changing their environment in some way. These agents can be cooperative,
    in which case they typically have a control channel for exchanging state information,
    or non-cooperative, where they act independently. A simple two-node cognitive
    radio network consisting of a single, point-to-point, duplex link is a simple
    example of a cooperative network. The two radios each configure themselves to
    optimally communicate, and share necessary channel statistics in order to jointly
    come to the optimal configuration. The transmitter is responsible for the configuration
    and must communicate this to the receiver, and the receiver measures the channel
    statistics and must communicate these to the transmitter. In larger networks,
    each node has its own sensors and gathers its own statistics. Each pairwise communications
    link must have a common configuration in order for data transfer to be possible.
    A simple example of this is the proposed IEEE 802.22 standard [7], where each
    client devices makes channel measurements and sends them to the base station.
    The base station then makes the determination on which channel is optimal and
    least likely to be occupied by a legacy communications system such as a television
    station. In a non-cooperative network, an attack against one cognitive radio will
    not affect any others, because other devices will independently take their own
    sensor measurements and make their own decisions. In a cooperative network, attacks
    against a subset of nodes can have further-reaching effects. For example, a conservative
    implementation of IEEE 802.22 would have logic that causes all devices to migrate
    to a new frequency if a single device detected a television signal. Thus an adversary
    can spoof a television signal to a single IEEE 802.22 device, and the network
    will migrate everyone to a new frequency, allowing the attacker contention-free
    access to the spectrum. More security-conscious implementations will try to guard
    against byzantine failures by more intelligently fusing conflicting statistics
    from a distributed sensor network. Some strategies for doing this are discussed
    in later sections. SECTION V. Classes of Attacks In this section we describe specific
    scenarios an attacker can construct by manipulating knowledge base state on devices
    in a cognitive radio network. We relate these attacks to some of the common applications
    of cognitive radio currently under study today. A. Dynamic Spectrum Access Attacks
    The first type of attack, which was introduced in [1], [2], is called the Primary
    User Emulation (PUE) attack, and can be effective in dynamic spectrum access (DSA)
    environments. In such environments, a primary user owns a license to a particular
    frequency band, and can use it whenever they wish. When they are idle, secondary
    devices can opportunistically use the available spectrum. Such secondary devices
    need spectrum sensing algorithms to detect when the primary user is active. All
    an attacker need do is create a waveform sufficiently similar to that of the primary
    user to trigger a false positive in the spectrum sensing algorithm. The secondary
    devices within range will believe a primary user is active, and will cause the
    system to vacate the channel. This gives the adversary unrivaled access to the
    frequency band. Fortunately the effects of this attack are transient, as it is
    only a sensory-manipulation attack. Once the attacker vacates the frequency, the
    secondary users notice the spectrum being once again idle, and can resume using
    it. Other DSA algorithms are more stateful, and accrue more detailed statistics
    about primary users. For example, some DSA algorithms gather channel access statistics
    for primary users in an attempt to predict when the channel will be idle, based
    on current and past behavior of the primary user [8]. Thus spoofing primary user
    waveforms can affect the longterm behavior of a secondary user, turning this attack
    into a belief-manipulation attack. If an adversary wishes to deny service to a
    secondary user operating in the presence of a time-division multiple access (TDMA)
    primary user, the attacker needs to make the primary user''s access pattern look
    random during the learning phase of the secondary user, rather than periodic.
    As a result, a secondary user cannot derive very much information about when they
    can transmit without interfering, significantly decreasing their capacity if not
    completely preventing transmission. This memory will persist after the attacker
    discontinues transmission. B. Objective Function Attacks In adaptive radio, the
    cognitive engine has a large number of radio parameters under its control. The
    cognitive engine manipulates these parameters over time in an effort to maximize
    its multi-goal objective functions. These attacks apply to any learning algorithms
    that utilize objective functions, most notably various forms of hill climbing
    and genetic algorithms. Since these attacks apply to learning engines, they are
    belief-manipulation attacks. Some possible input parameters could be center frequency,
    bandwidth, power, modulation type, coding rate, channel access protocol, encryption
    type, and frame size. The radio might then have three goals: low-power, high-rate,
    and secure communication. Depending on the application, each of these goals has
    a different weight. For example, if using the system for instant messages or email,
    low-power and secure would have higher weights than high-rate. For voice or video
    applications, high-rate and secure would have higher weights than secure. There
    are a few different types of attacks possible on a system like this. When radios
    are in a learning phase, they try different combinations of input parameters,
    measure the observed statistics such as bit error rate, and then evaluate the
    objective functions to see which inputs give the best results for their application.
    Of the three goals - low-power, high-rate, and secure - only one is affected by
    the channel. Low-power and secure are defined directly by inputs, while high-rate
    is defined by system outputs. Thus by affecting the channel, and adversary can
    manipulate whether or not high-rate communications is achieved. More concretely,
    imagine the following objective function f= w 1 P+ w 2 R+ w 3 S (1) View Source
    where w i are the weights and P t, R , and S represent the three goals of power,
    rate, and security. Imagine an adversary wishes to force a radio to use some security
    level s 1 rather than the more secure version s 2 , where s 1 < s 2 . Whenever
    the cognitive engine tries using s 2 , the adversary can jam the channel, artificially
    decreasing R from r 2 to r 1 with r 1 < r 2 . In particular, an adversary would
    need to cause sufficient interference such that w 1 P+ w 2 r 2 + w 3 s 1 > w 1
    P+ w 2 r 1 + w 3 s 2 (2) View Source or solving for r 1 : r 1 < r 2 − w 3 w 2
    ( s 2 − s 1 ) (3) View Source The consequence of such an attack is that whenever
    a higher security level is attempted, the system''s objective function decreases,
    and that higher security level is never used. This type of attack can already
    be successfully executed on static systems that involve human configuration. For
    ex-ample, consider an engineer trying to configure a point-to-point wireless link
    to interconnect two networks. If every time the network is activated with encryption
    enabled, an adversary jams the network, the engineer may eventually give up and
    believe there is a crypto-related impediment to using encryption, and simply run
    the network without encryption. Similarly, the IEEE 802.11 u standards are defining
    weaker security mechanisms for wireless local area networks (WLANs) to support
    placing E911 phone calls via unauthenticated WLANs in emergency situations. This
    represents a case where the need for connectivity outweighs security, and the
    logic behind this could be exploited if implemented with a learning engine. Additionally,
    similar attacks can be used to cause radios to believe that certain frequencies,
    bandwidths, or modulation types are less optimal and should be avoided. This would
    allow an attacker to sculpt the waveforms used by a cognitive radio to suit its
    goals, whatever they may be. It is very important to note that this type of attack
    only works when the radio is performing online learning, that is the radio is
    performing some sort of online optimization of the search space. Radios that perform
    offline learning observe the environment once, and then perform an offline search
    to find the optimal configuration; such radios assume independence of their observations
    and configuration, and consequently are immune to these attacks. It should also
    be noted that such radios theoretically do not require a learning engine, and
    their behavior can be reduced to the case-based reasoning of a policy radio [9].
    C. Malicious Behavior Attacks In this section we discuss an extension of the objective
    function attacks, where we teach a radio to become unknowingly malicious. Here
    we examine a scenario that cause a cognitive radio to become a jammer. Consider
    a system where a primary user is intermittently accessing a channel. Secondary
    users have channel sensing algorithms that can detect primary and secondary users
    access the channel. They have an objective function that balances throughput T
    and interference I , and looks like f= w 1 T− w 2 I (4) View Source The system
    seeks to maximize throughput while minimizing interference. The desired result
    is a secondary user will only communicate when the primary user is idle. However,
    if an adversary uses a jamming waveform that cannot be detected by the secondary
    user''s sensing algorithms, he can artificially decrease T when the primary user
    is idle. As a result, the cognitive radio will learn that the only time it can
    achieve useful communications is when the primary user is active. This effectively
    turns the cognitive radio into a jammer. Accomplishing this should be fairly straight-forward
    using common commercial waveforms. Imagine a primary user uses some linear, narrow-band
    modulation scheme, and the secondary radio uses Orthogonal Frequency Division
    Multiplexing (OFDM). Typically OFDM uses pilot tones on a few of the subcarriers
    for receiver channel estimation and synchro-nization. By transmitting a carrier
    wave on those pilot tones, an adversary can prevent OFDM receiver synchronization
    and consequently block any useful communication. Additionally, these CW signals
    are unlikely to trigger the cognitive radio''s spectrum sensing algorithms, which
    would prevent detection of the attack. SECTION VI. Attack Mitigation In this section
    we describe a variety of techniques for mitigating the effectiveness of the attacks
    detailed in the previous sections. A. Robust Sensory Input Improving sensor input
    can significantly help reduce the gullibility of cognitive radios. For example,
    if radios could carefully characterize the difference between interference and
    noise, they could distinguish between natural and man-made RF events. Such sensors
    could also feed specialized policy engine subroutines that specifically look for
    hostile signals that may be attempting to corrupt a radio''s beliefs. In a distributed
    environment, a network of cognitive radios can fuse sensor data to improve performance.
    For example if multiple cognitive radios exchanged time-synchronized, digitized
    RF, they could run cross-correlation algorithms to more precisely determine the
    difference between an attacker and noise. All sensory input should be considered
    “noisy”, since even without the presence of an attacker, statistics can occasionally
    be incorrect. For each input, cognitive radio designers should quantify the probability
    of detection failure in both benign and hostile environments. In some scenarios,
    attackers may be power-limited, allowing designers to compute theoretical upper-bounds
    to their effectiveness. B. Mitigation in Individual Radios In order to mitigate
    attacks against individual radios, we need to instill some amount of “common sense”
    into radio systems. Protecting individual policy radios from attack is difficult.
    They look at the current environment and evaluate what course of action to pursue
    subject to their policy. An adversary with knowledge of the policy could provide
    false sensor inputs in an effort to affect the radio''s behavior. Even without
    knowledge of the policy, an adversary could use various fuzzing techniques to
    infer the policy. As a result, radio policies should be carefully evaluated to
    protect against malicious sensor input. All possible states can be enumerated
    as the product space of all possible knowledge base values. The radio policy then
    defines a state transition framework that can be overlaid on the state space.
    Formal state-space validation, as is often done with cryptographic network protocols,
    can then be applied to the resulting state machine to ensure that a “bad state”
    is never reached. However, in scenarios such as the PUE attack, no carefully-engineered
    policy can protect a simple radio from detecting an adversary as a primary user.
    Mitigating such attacks relies on developing better sensing algorithms with lower
    false-positive rates. A better-developed sensing algorithm may be able to distinguish
    the legitimate primary user from the adversary. Additionally, radios might compare
    their perception of their environment with characteristics know a priori. For
    example, in [2], the authors attempt to geolocate primary transmitters, and compare
    their measured location to the locations of known primary users. Protecting individual
    learning radios is also difficult, but there are some strategies for preventing
    attackers from indefinitely altering a radio''s beliefs. First, beliefs must always
    be under constant reevaluation. A feedback loop should constantly be updating
    learned relationships between cognitive radio inputs and outputs. For example,
    coefficients in a neural network should be constantly recomputed, using a moving
    average, such that previously-learned behavior that may be incorrect can be expired.
    If continuously-learning radios are impractical or not desired for a particular
    scenario, then the learning phases must be conducted in a truly controlled environment.
    Outside auditing must take place to ensure that no adversarial signals are present
    during the learning phase. Another approach would be to build in logic that could
    invalidate learned actions that were known to violate certain principles. Writing
    such rules is difficult, because learned actions can often be non-intuitive (hence
    why using artificial intelligence can help us solve tough problems). For example,
    a radio might discover that achieved capacity is inversely proportional to bandwidth,
    which contradicts Shannon''s theorems. However, this might be caused by inadvertent
    overlapping with an adjacent-channel interferer. C. Mitigation in Networks In
    a network of cognitive radios, where we assume there is some sort of control-channel
    connectivity between cognitive engines, mitigating possible threats becomes a
    very interesting space. We now have a group of independent AI agents each seeking
    to maximize their own performance, and possibly global performance, depending
    on their level of cooperation with the devices around them. This new-found connectivity
    at the cognitive-engine level between peers allows us to use various techniques
    from swarm intelligence [10]. Swarm intelligence is a set of algorithms that mimic
    various animal behaviors; a common example is ant colony optimization that seeks
    to find a goal by sending virtual ants off searching for the goal, and leaving
    pheromone trails back to their starting point after finding intermediate solutions.
    One technique of specific applicability to security is particle swarm optimization
    (PSO) [11]. Each cognitive radio in a network represents a particle, each with
    it''s own hypothesis about what the best behavior is in a particular situation.
    The behavior it selects, however, is not wholly dependent on its own hypothesis,
    but is actually a weighted average of all hypotheses in the network. An example
    application of PSO is to the PUE attack against DSA systems. Here each device
    could make its own hypothesis about whether a particular transmission was from
    a primary user, and the group majority would then be the group decision. Certainly
    a weighted majority could be taken, based on which devices are most likely to
    have the most accurate hypothesis (due to proximity, sensor capabilities, etc).
    This approach could also be used in adaptive radio. For example, in the scenarios
    we described earlier, radios used various learning algorithms to determine how
    their inputs affected their objective function. An attacker could manipulate that
    process to cause altered behavior in the radio. If PSO were used during this learning
    phase, radios would experience something more akin to group learning, rather than
    individual learning, making it more difficult for an attacker to influence the
    system. Note, however, that such approaches should be used with care. By allowing
    this group learning and decision making, an attacker with influence over a few
    devices may now be able to affect the outcome of the entire group. SECTION VII.
    Road-map for Future Research In this paper we primarily focused on PHY security.
    We discussed scenarios where cognitive radios had control over and sensory input
    from PHY-level components, such as energy detectors, signal classifiers, modem
    components, and error correcting codes. However, there''s no reason this cannot
    be extended to the MAC, routing, transport, or even application layers. The eventual
    goal of cognitive radio is to permeate the entire network stack to allow intelligent
    control and security to an entire system [4]. The emphasis on the PHY layer so
    far is mostly because that''s as far as basic research into cognitive radio has
    been formally defined. A. Understanding Identity The next concept necessary to
    extend cognitive radios'' security capabilities is to allow the cognitive engine
    to reason about the identity of things in its environment. Currently cognitive
    engines may understand that energy at some frequency is another wireless device,
    and may even be able to tell the difference between different classes of devices,
    such as primary and secondary users, but the cognitive engine itself cannot recognize
    and differentiate two different secondary users. Adding this recognition can be
    accomplished in two different ways. First, more PRY-layer techniques could be
    used, such as RF fingerprinting. This would extend the current sensor capabilities
    to more fine-grained differentiation between transmitters, and give them the ability
    to recognize trans-mitter''s they''ve seen before. No detection rules are perfect,
    however, and this approach may still allow an attacker to manipulate their RF
    fingerprint to be detected as someone or something else. A better approach is
    to combine PHY-layer approaches with MAC-layer processing. For devices within
    the cognitive radio''s network, the MAC layer can provide much more specific and
    reliable information, especially if MAC-layer protocols are cryptographically
    protected to prevent manipulation. By feeding this information to the cognitive
    engine, a radio can now reason about its neighbors, because it knows who they
    are and when they''re communicating. This allows it to build up learned statistics
    specific to each neighbor, rather than for all neighbors. B. Earning and Using
    Trust Once a cognitive engine can reason about the identity of its neighbors,
    it can start learning trust metrics, which would in turn allow radios to reason
    about the trustworthiness of their neighbors. Trust is a loaded word that means
    many different things in many different applications. At the MAC layer, trust
    typically involves some quantification of how fairly a device is accessing the
    shared medium. If a device is greedily using more than its fair share, or is maliciously
    trying to prevent other devices from communicating, it could be seen as an adversarial
    force in the network. Also its willingness to receive packets is important. In
    a MAC layer, cognitive radios use feedback from the PHY and MAC layers to quantify
    how fair and reliable different neighbors are. They can then use this information
    to who can communicate to whom, and when (i.e. the essence of medium access control).
    One example scenario is a new device wishing to join a cooperative cognitive radio
    network. Initially the devices in this network have no knowledge of this new device
    or reason to communicate with it. If, over time, this device proves itself to
    be trustworthy, then other nodes in the network will grant it more access to the
    shared spectrum. This metric of MAC trust also could be used for distributed rate
    control. More trusted devices can be granted more capacity than they are entitled
    to for transient situations, however if this is abused their trust rating with
    neighbors may decrease, making it less likely that they''ll be given extra capacity
    in the future. C. Trust in Networking and Routing The next logical step is to
    extend reasoning about the trustworthiness of neighbors in a MAC layer to reasoning
    about devices further away in the network. To accomplish this, a cognitive engine
    needs control over and feedback from a system''s network layer. For example, the
    cognitive engine needs statistics from each transmitted and received packet, in
    addition to the ability to affect decisions about L3 communications and routing.
    This would allow a cognitive radio to learn trust information about the broader
    network and use it to develop policy about routing and forwarding of traffic.
    Certainly trust metrics in ad hoc routing is far from a new concept [12], [13],
    but allowing a cognitive engine to control how that trust affects the system could
    allow for new, emergent behavior implementing policies never before considered.
    As cognitive radio propagates up the network stack, new challenges will arise.
    In particular, adversaries will have more “sensors” they can attempt to fool.
    However one advantage to MAC-layer and higher sensors is that in many cases the
    data they are examining can be cryptographically protected to prevent adversarial
    manipulation. SECTION VIII. Conclusion In this paper we examined the problems
    associated with adversarial manipulation of cognitive radio sensory inputs, in
    an effort to cause the victim cognitive radio to behave suboptimally or maliciously.
    We showed how this ability to manipulate sensors introduces new threats beyond
    those typically associated with a wireless network. Some of the most powerful
    attacks involve an adversary manipulating the RF spectrum while a victim cognitive
    radio is in its learning phase. By skewing the radio''s performance in certain
    situations, the attacker can make a victim radio believe things that are untrue,
    and consequently cause it to behave in a suboptimal or malicious manner. Any radio
    that can learn from its environment can also be taught by its environment. We
    demonstrated several different attacks against dynamic spectrum access and agile
    radios, and even described how self-propagating behavior could lead to a cognitive
    radio virus. Mitigating such attacks involves building checks and balances into
    a cognitive radio. First, learned beliefs should never be permanent. Otherwise
    it could indefinitely induce undesired behavior. Second, cognitive radios should
    always assume sensors are noisy, whether its due to nature or a malicious force.
    Lastly, cognitive radios could collaborate with other cooperative radios on the
    network to coherently develop beliefs that are less likely to be subject to manipulation.
    Most of the attacks presented are specific to PHY-Iayer cognition. Sensors and
    decisions at higher layers can often be cryptographically protected, making them
    less vulnerable to manipulatory attacks. We layout a road-map for how a cognitive
    engine could help provide additional security at the higher layers, focusing primarily
    on extending cognition to provide security at the MAC layer. We''re a long way
    away from Mitola''s famous example where a military radio can realize it''s been
    lost and been picked up by an allied soldier, resulting in the deletion of its
    keying material and immediately connecting the ally to the appropriate liaison
    office [4]. However through incremental advancements we can build cognition capabilities
    into the entire network stack. Security is an important part of that - both recognizing
    threats to cognitive radios, but also how cognition can improve security - and
    this paper provides the initial building blocks for such advancement. Authors

    have come a long way since the roll out of the conventional voice-centric cellular
    systems. The demand for wireless access in voice and high rate data multi-media
    applications has been increasing. New generation wireless communication systems
    are aimed at accommodating this demand through better resource management and
    improved transmission technologies. The interest in increasing Spectrum Access
    and improving Spectrum Efficiency combined with both the introduction of Software
    Defined Radios and the realization that machine learning can be applied to radios
    has created new intriguing possibilities for wireless radio researchers. This
    book is aimed to discuss the cognitive radio, software defined radio (SDR), and
    adaptive radio concepts from several aspects. Cognitive radio and cognitive networks
    will be investigated from a broad aspect of wireless communication system enhancement
    while giving special emphasis on better spectrum utilization. Applications of
    cognitive radio, SDR and cognitive radio architectures, spectrum efficiency and
    soft spectrum usage, adaptive wireless system design, measurements and awareness
    of various parameters including interference temperature and geo-location information
    are some of the important topics that will be covered in this book. Cognitive
    Radio, Software Defined Radio, and Adaptive Wireless Systems is intended to be
    both an introductory technology survey/tutorial for beginners and an advanced

    Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency
    are two critical issues in designing wireless networks. Through dynamic spectrum
    access, cognitive radios can improve the spectrum efficiency and capacity of wireless
    networks. On the other hand radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting has emerged
    as a promising technique to supply energy to wireless networks and thereby increase
    their energy efficiency. Therefore, to achieve both spectrum and energy efficiencies,
    the secondary users in a cognitive radio network (CRN) can be equipped with the
    RF energy harvesting capability, and such a network can be referred to as an RF-powered
    cognitive radio network. In this article we provide an overview of the RF-powered
    CRNs and discuss the challenges that arise for dynamic spectrum access in these
    networks. Focusing on the trade-off among spectrum sensing, data transmission,
    and RF energy harvesting, we then discuss the dynamic channel selection problem
    in a multi-channel RF-powered CRN. In the RF-powered CRN a secondary user can
    adaptively select a channel to transmit data when the channel is not occupied
    by any primary user. Alternatively, the secondary user can harvest RF energy for
    data transmission if the channel is occupied. The optimal channel selection policy
    of the secondary user can be obtained by formulating a Markov decision process
    (MDP) problem. We present some numerical results obtained by solving this MDP
    problem. Published in: IEEE Wireless Communications ( Volume: 21, Issue: 3, June

    10.1109/MWC.2014.6845054 Publisher: IEEE Introduction Energy supply is always
    a critical issue in wireless communications [1]. Traditionally, portable/ mobile
    wireless nodes operate with energy supply from a battery, which has a limited
    capacity and needs to be physically charged or replaced regularly. Recently, RF
    energy harvesting technology has been developed and is able to supply energy to
    wireless nodes. Table 1 summarizes the experimental measurement of RF energy harvested
    from various RF energy sources. Besides, an important study [9] on the design
    of a digital TV energy harvesting circuit reports RF-to-DC conversion efficiencies
    above 0.4 percent at -40 dBm, above 18.2 percent at -20dBm, and over 50 percent
    at -5 dBm RF signal power incidence. Both the sensitivity of the energy harvester
    and the conversion efficiency are expected to be improved in the near future.
    Therefore, the adoption of RF energy harvesting technology is very plausible.
    In addition, compared with other forms of energy harvesting (e.g. solar, vibration,
    wind, and acoustic noise), RF energy harvesting does not depend on Nature, and
    hence it provides relatively predictable energy supply. The amount of RF energy
    that can be harvested depends on the wavelength of the harvested RF signal and
    the distance between an RF energy source and the harvesting device (Table 1),
    which can be calculated based on the Friis transmission equation [10]. Powering
    a cognitive radio network (CRN) with RF energy can provide a spectrum-efficient
    and energy-efficient solution for wireless networking [11], [12]. In an RF-powered
    cognitive radio network (RF-powered CRN), the RF energy harvesting capability
    allows the wireless devices (e.g. secondary users) to harvest energy from RF signals
    and use that energy for their data transmission. Such RF signals could be from
    nearby RF sources (e.g. primary users, cellular base stations, and other ambient
    RF sources) and can be converted into DC electricity. This energy can be stored
    in an energy storage and used to operate the devices and transmit data. To save
    cost and reduce implementation complexity, the wireless interface of the cognitive
    radio devices in an RF-powered CRN can be reused for RF energy harvesting in addition
    to transmitting and receiving data. The secondary users can transmit data when
    they are sufficiently far away from primary users or when the nearby primary users
    are idle. There-fore, the devices must not only identify spectrum holes for opportunistic
    data transmission, but also search for occupied spectrum band to harvest RF energy.1.
    Due to the specific nature of RF energy harvesting (e.g. the amount of harvested
    RF energy depends on distance) and the communication requirements of the cognitive
    radio devices, the communication protocols for the traditional CRNs may not be
    efficient for RF-powered CRNs. In particular, the dynamic spectrum sensing and
    channel access methods for the cognitive radios have to be optimized considering
    the tradeoff among network throughput (or spectrum efficiency), energy efficiency,
    and RF energy supply. Recent literature on RF-powered CRNs mainly focuses on investigating
    throughput maximization under various constraints. For example, the authors in
    [13] consider RF energy harvesting-enabled cognitive radio sensor networks under
    an energy causality constraint. The constraint imposes that the total consumed
    energy should not be greater than the total harvested energy. The authors propose
    an optimal mode selection policy to balance between the immediate throughput and
    harvested RF energy in transmitting and harvesting modes, respectively. In [12]
    the mobile devices in a secondary network opportunistically either harvest RF
    energy from transmissions of nearby devices in a primary network, or transmit
    data if the devices are not in the interference range of any other primary network.
    The throughput of the secondary network is maximized by deriving the optimal transmit
    power and density of the secondary transmitters under an outage-probability constraint.
    In [14] the authors consider a cognitive wireless body area network with RF energy
    harvesting capability. The authors discuss the challenges in the physical, medium
    access control (MAC), and network layers and some potential solutions. In addition,
    practical architectures are proposed for cognitive radio-enabled RF energy harvesting
    devices for joint information reception and RF energy harvesting. However, the
    problem of dynamic spectrum access for RF-powered CRNs has not been rigorously
    studied in the literature, and this is the main focus of this article. Table 1.
    Experimental data of RF energy harvesting. We first present an overview of the
    RF-powered CRNs and highlight the main differences between traditional CRNs and
    RF-powered CRNs. Then we discuss the research challenges related to dynamic spectrum
    access in the RF-powered CRNs. Then to study the trade-off between spectrum sensing,
    data transmission, and RF energy harvesting, we focus on the problem of channel
    selection for dynamic spectrum access in a multi-channel RF-powered CRN. This
    RF-powered CRN consists of multiple primary users allocated with different channels
    and secondary users with RF energy harvesting capability. The objective of a secondary
    user is to maximize her throughput. To achieve this objective, a channel selection
    policy has to be used. This policy is a mapping of the secondary user''s state
    (i.e. data queue, energy storage, and chan- nel status) to a particular channel
    to sense and transmit data or harvest RF energy. The policy can be obtained by
    formulating an optimization problem based on the Markov decision process (MDP).
    Overview of RF-Powered Cognitive Radio Network Rf Energy Harvesting in Cognitive
    Radio Device Figure 1 shows the general block diagram of a cognitive radio device
    with RF energy harvesting. The device consists of following components. A software-defined
    radio-based wireless transceiver for data transmission and reception. A spectrum
    analyzer, which observes and analyzes the activity of spectrum usage from measured
    signals. A knowledge extraction unit, which uses the information on spectrum usage
    to build and maintain a knowledge base of the spectrum access environment. A decision
    making unit to make decisions on spectrum access based on the knowledge base.
    A node equipment which implements certain applications (e.g. sensors). An A/D
    converter that digitizes the analog signal from the node equipment. A power controller
    to process the digital signal from A/D converter for network applications. An
    energy storage device which could be a battery or capacitor (for a low-power node)
    to store the harvested energy for future use. A power management unit, which dispatches
    the energy from RF energy harvester (i.e. decide whether to store the harvested
    energy in a battery or to transfer it immediately to other components). An RF
    energy harvester to collect RF signal and covert it into electricity. Figure 1.
    Components in RF-powered CRN device and their relationship to cognition cycle.
    Show All For a cognitive radio device, the major functions of observing, learning,
    orienting, planning, deciding and acting can be represented as a cognition cycle
    [15] as shown in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows the block diagram of a typical circuit
    for an RF harvester, which consists of antenna, impedance matching unit, voltage
    multiplier, and capacitor. Figure 2. Circuit design of an RF harvester. Show All
    Like the conventional CRNs, the RF-powered CRNs can adopt either an infrastructure-based
    or an infrastructure-less communication architecture. In the infrastructure-based
    architecture, a secondary base station coordinates data communication among secondary
    users. The impedance matching unit is a resonator circuit that operates at a designated
    frequency to maximize the power transfer between the antenna and the multiplier.
    The main components of the voltage multiplier are the diodes of the rectifying
    circuit which converts RF waves (AC signal in Nature) into DC signal. Generally,
    a higher conversion efficiency can be achieved by diodes with lower built-in voltage.
    The capacitor ensures a smooth delivery of power to the load. When energy harvesting
    is unavailable, the capacitor can also temporarily serve as a small energy reservoir.
    The RF harvester can be designed to work on either single frequency or multiple
    frequencies concurrently [16]. The antenna may need to work at multiple frequencies
    simultaneously to acquire enough energy as input. Note that the wireless transceiver
    and RF energy harvester may use different wireless interfaces (e.g. antenna) or
    the same interface. For the former, the device can transmit and receive data and
    harvest RF energy at the same time if they use different frequency. For the latter,
    the device will not be able to harvest RF energy at the same time as transmitting
    data. However, the device may be able to receive data and harvest RF energy simultaneously
    [17]. Architecture of RF-Powered Cognitive Radio Network An RF-powered CRN can
    be in various forms such as a cognitive wireless sensor network, a cognitive cellular
    network, a cognitive wireless mesh network, a cognitive device-to-device network,
    a cognitive wireless local area network, a cognitive wireless body network, and
    so on. Either spectrum overlay or spectrum underlay can be adopted for the spectrum
    access of secondary users according to the used radio transmission technology
    and/or the network requirement. Figure 3 shows the general network architecture.
    In this architecture, RF signal is used not only to transmit data, but also to
    transfer energy. The secondary user can receive RF energy from the primary base
    station and other primary users. Alternatively, the secondary user can receive
    RF energy from a secondary base station and other secondary users. Figure 3 also
    shows three zones associated with the primary base station. The “transmission
    zone” is the coverage of the primary base station (e.g. a cell), where the primary
    user communicates with the primary base station. Inside the “transmission zone”
    if the secondary user is in the “RF harvesting zone,” the secondary user can harvest
    RF energy from the primary base station due to strong primary RF signal. If the
    primary base station or primary users occupy the spectrum, then the secondary
    user cannot transmit data if it is in the “interference zone” (i.e. interference
    is created to the communication of the primary users). Figure 3. Network architecture
    of RF-powered cognitive radio networks. Show All Like the conventional CRNs, the
    RF-powered CRNs can adopt either an infrastructure-based or an infrastructure-less
    communication architecture. In the infrastructure-based architecture, a secondary
    base station coordinates data communication among secondary users. Again, either
    centralized or distributed dynamic spectrum access architecture [18] can be used
    for different forms of RF-powered CRNs. In the former case an optimal control
    of spectrum access can be achieved based on the global information about the radio
    environment and available RF energy gathered by a secondary base station. In the
    latter case, network-wise optimal control may not be achieved as the decisions
    on spectrum access and RF energy harvesting are made by individual secondary users
    autonomously and independently based on local information. To optimize the performance
    of RF-powered CRNs, spectrum sensing, access, and handoff functionalities must
    be revisited. In the next section we discuss the issues of designing dynamic spectrum
    access for the RF-powered CRNs. Research Challenges in Dynamic Spectrum Access
    in RF-Powered Cognitive Radio Networks To support intelligent and efficient dynamic
    spectrum access, cognitive radio networks have four main functionalities, namely,
    spectrum sensing, spectrum access, spectrum management, and spectrum handoff.
    In RF-powered CRNs the cognitive radios have to identify and switch to not only
    idle channels for data transmission, but also sense the occupied channels for
    RF energy harvesting. Therefore, the traditional methods for spectrum sensing
    and access may not be sufficient for RF-powered CRNs. In this section, we discuss
    the research issues that arise for spectrum sensing and access in RF-powered CRNs.
    Spectrum Sensing In conventional CRNs a secondary user focuses on identifying
    spectrum holes, channel idle probability, and channel quality. Some of the channel
    selection schemes, such as those in [19], [20], utilize the statistical spectrum
    occupancy information obtained through spectrum sensing to opportunistically access
    a free channel. However, the secondary user may select the channel that has a
    high idle probability but low channel quality. Therefore, channel selection schemes
    can also take channel quality into account [21]. In the multi-channel RF-powered
    CRNs, in addition to finding a free channel and its quality, the secondary user
    has to identify an occupied channel and its RF signal whose energy can be harvested.
    To maximize the throughput, the secondary user will have the following preferences
    in channel selection. If the secondary user has a low energy level in its energy
    storage, it should select the channel that tends to be occupied by a primary user
    and has strong RF signal to harvest energy. On the other hand, if a secondary
    user has a high energy level and there are many packets waiting for transmission,
    it should select the channel that is likely to be idle with high probability of
    successful packet transmission (i.e. channel quality is favorable). In addition,
    the secondary user may decide not to transmit in some particular channels if the
    primary users are sensitive to interference. Clearly, the decision problem for
    the secondary users is more complex and hence the traditional channel selection
    schemes will not be sufficient. Therefore, channel selection policies specifically
    designed for the multi-channel RF-powered CRNs will be needed. Again, secondary
    users perform spectrum sensing periodically, where the duration and the frequency
    of sensing can be adjusted. A longer sensing duration and/or a higher sensing
    frequency will lead to a higher sensing accuracy and more harvested energy. However,
    the throughput performance will be adversely affected since there will be less
    time for the secondary user to transmit data. Thus there exists a trade-off among
    the sensing duration and frequency of sensing (and hence sensing accuracy) and
    the amount of harvested energy versus communication throughput. The spectrum sensing
    period and the frequency of sensing can be optimized by jointly considering this
    trade-off. The secondary users can use either a proactive or an on-demand approach
    for spectrum sensing. In the proactive approach, a secondary user periodically
    senses different channels and maintains a database of all the channels. In the
    on-demand approach, the secondary user may sense the target channel when it needs
    to switch to the new channel. Another related issue would be the order in which
    the channels need to be sensed and selection of the channel to switch to. This
    decision depends on the activities of the primary users and also the state of
    the secondary users (e.g. remaining energy level). Spectrum Access Traditionally
    the spectrum access or MAC protocols for spectrum overlay-based CRNs are designed
    with the objective of maximizing the throughput of secondary users while protecting
    primary user from collisions due to secondary transmissions and to provide fair
    and efficient sharing of available spectrum among secondary users. For the RF-powered
    CRNs two types of MAC protocols, that is, fixed and random spectrum access, can
    be adopted to achieve similar performance objectives. The secondary users can
    use either a proactive or an on-demand approach for spectrum sensing. In the proactive
    approach, a secondary user periodically senses different channels and maintains
    a database of all the channels. In the on-demand approach, the secondary user
    may sense the target channel when it needs to switch to the new channel. Fixed
    Spectrum Access - For this type of protocol, radio resources (time slots and channels
    or subcarriers) are statically allocated to users (e.g. based on time-division
    multiple access [TDMA], or orthogonal frequency-division multiple access [OFDMA]).
    Given the availability of RF energy, the radio resource must be allocated optimally
    among multiple secondary users. For example, radio resource should be allocated
    to the users that are not harvesting RF energy (e.g. out of range of transmitting
    RF sources). Also, the radio resource should be allocated to the users that have
    sufficient amount of harvested RF energy to use the allocated radio bandwidth.
    Random Spectrum Access - For this type of proto- col (e.g. slotted ALOHA and carrier-sense
    multiple access with collision avoidance [CSMA/CA]), the secondary users contend
    for radio resources for data transmission. As in conventional CRNs, the main problem
    to be addressed in contention-based spectrum access is collision avoidance. However,
    this problem becomes more complicated due to RF energy harvesting. First, secondary
    users must decide whether to harvest RF energy or contend for data transmission.
    Second, to avoid collision a backoff mechanism can be applied. These decisions
    must consider the level of remaining energy and amount of RF energy to be harvested.
    For example, if the channel contention is high, some secondary users should back
    off their transmissions and harvest RF energy instead. This is not only beneficial
    for reducing collision, but also to increase the energy level. If the primary
    user re-occupies the channel, the secondary user may remain in the same channel
    but switch its mode to harvest RF energy. Note that in the RF-powered CRNs, the
    secondary user needs to switch channel not only when the primary user re-occupies
    the channel, but also when the secondary user needs to harvest RF energy. Channel
    Selection in RF-Powered Cognitive Radio Networks In the previous section we discussed
    the issues in designing dynamic spectrum access methods for an RF-powered CRN.
    In this section, for dynamic spectrum access in an RF-powered CRN, we will show
    how we can formulate the problem of channel selection for a secondary transmitter
    taking RF energy harvesting into account. We will first describe the system model
    under consideration and then present a MDP formulation for the problem. Afterward
    we will present numerical results obtained by solving the MDP formulation. System
    Model We consider an RF-powered CRN that consists of N primary users and one secondary
    user. Each primary user n is allocated with the nonoverlapping channel c n for
    data transmission. Therefore, there are N channels in the RF-powered CRN. All
    the primary users transmit data on a time slot basis. During each time slot, the
    channel can be idle or busy (i.e. occupied by the primary user for data transmission).
    The secondary user is equipped with an RF energy harvester and an energy storage
    which can store E units of energy. The secondary user can select one of the channels.
    If the selected channel is busy, the secondary user can harvest energy from the
    channel. Let γ n denote the probability that the secondary user succeeds in harvesting
    a unit of RF energy from channel c n . If the secondary user is in the harvesting
    area of a primary user n , the probability of successful RF energy harvesting
    is one. This probability can be obtained from an experiment (e.g. as listed in
    Table l). The harvested energy is stored in the energy storage. On the other hand,
    if the selected channel is idle, the secondary user can transmit a packet retrieved
    from its data queue. The secondary user requires W units of energy for data transmission
    in a time slot. The probability of a successful packet transmission on channel
    c n is denoted by σ n . The probability of a packet arrival for the secondary
    user in a time slot is denoted by α . The arriving packet is buffered in the data
    queue of the secondary user. The maximum capacity of the data queue is Q packets.
    We assume that the secondary user has only one wireless interface. Therefore,
    it cannot transmit data and harvest RF energy at the same time. Also, we assume
    that the receiver node is always ready to receive the transmitted packet. The
    channel selection policy used by the secondary user is a mapping from the secondary
    user''s state (i.e. the number of packets in the data queue and the energy level
    of the energy storage) to the action (i.e. the channel to select). The secondary
    user does not know the status of the channel (i.e. whether the channels are idle
    or busy). In this case the secondary user selects a channel based on statistical
    information. This information includes the probabilities of a channel to be idle
    and busy, the probability of successful packet transmission if the channel is
    idle, and the probability of successful energy harvesting if the channel is busy.
    After selecting the channel, the secondary user performs spectrum sensing to observe
    the channel status. If the channel status is busy/idle, the secondary user will
    harvest RF energy/transmit a packet. To obtain the optimal channel selection policy,
    we can formulate the MDP problem and solve it. Optimization Formulation The state
    space of the secondary user is defined by the possible number of packets in the
    data queue and the energy levels in the energy storage, which are bounded by Q
    and E , respectively. The action space is a set of available channels, which the
    secondary user can select. Given the channel selected by the secondary user, the
    following state transitions can happen. The Status of the Selected Channel is
    Idle - The tran- sitions depend on the packet arrival probability α and the successful
    packet transmission probability σ n In selected channel n . The number of packets
    increases and the energy level decreases. This happens when a packet arrives and
    a packet transmission is unsuccessful. The number of packets remains the same
    and the energy level decreases. This happens when a packet arrives and a packet
    is transmitted successfully or no packet arrives and a packet transmission is
    unsuccessful. The number of packets decreases and the energy level decreases:.
    This happens when no packet arrives and a packet is transmitted successfully.
    The Status of the Selected Channel is Busy - The tran- sitions depend on the packet
    arrival probability α and the successful RF energy harvesting probability γ n
    on selected channel n . The number of packets increases and the energy level remains
    the same. This happens when a packet arrives and RF energy harvesting is unsuccessful.
    The number of packets remains the same and the energy level remains the same.
    This happens when no packet arrives and RF energy harvesting is unsuccessful.
    The number of packets increases and the energy level increases. This happens when
    a packet arrives and RF energy harvesting is successful. The number of packets
    remains the same and the energy level increases. This happens when no packet arrives
    and RF energy harvesting is successful. A packet is transmitted successfully if
    the energy storage is not empty and there is no wireless channel error. Note that
    the number of packets cannot increase if the data queue is full. Similarly, the
    energy level cannot increase if the energy queue is full. Conversely, the number
    of packets cannot decrease if the data queue is empty, and the same is true for
    the energy level. The transition probability matrix for the MDP can be derived
    according to the above state transitions. We formulate an optimization problem
    based on an MDP. We obtain an optimal channel selection policy denoted by π ∗
    to maximize the long-term average throughput of the secondary user. The optimization
    problem is expressed as max π : J T (π)= lim t→∞ inf 1 t ∑ t ′ =1 t E(T( θ t ′
    , a t ′ )) (1) View Source where J T (π) is the throughput of the secondary user
    and T( θ t ′ , a t ′ ) is an immediate throughput function given state θ t ′ and
    action a t ′ at time t ′ . Note that this optimization problem does not require
    any constraint for energy harvesting, since if there is not enough energy in the
    storage, the secondary user cannot transmit a packet and is forced to harvest
    RF energy. Let the state variable be defined as θ=(e,q) where e and q are the
    energy level of the energy queue and the number of packets in the data queue,
    respectively. The immediate throughput function is defined as T(θ,a)={ η a σ a
    , 0, e≥W and q>0 otherwise. (2) View Source where θ=(e,q) is a combined state
    of energy level e and number of packets q in the energy storage and data queue,
    respectively. η a is the probability of the selected channel a (i.e. an action)
    to be idle and σ a is the probability of successful transmission by the secondary
    user on the selected channel a . In other words, the secondary user successfully
    transmits a packet if there is enough energy, the queue is not empty, and the
    selected channel is idle. The packet arrival probability, probability of successful
    packet transmission, and probability of successful RF energy harvesting determine
    the state transitions toward condition e≥W and q>0 , which results in immediate
    throughput. The optimal policy can be obtained by using a standard approach (e.g.
    through solving an equivalent linear programming problem, value/policy iteration
    algorithms, and Q-learning algorithm). Performance Evaluation Parameter Setting
    - We consider a secondary user whose energy storage and data queue sizes are 10
    packets and 10 units of energy, respectively. The secondary user requires one
    unit of energy for one packet transmission. The packet arrival probability is
    0.5. The primary users have two licensed channels c 1 and c 2 . The probabilities
    that the channels c 1 and c 2 will be idle are 0.1 and 0.9, respectively, unless
    otherwise stated. The probability of successful packet transmission on both channels
    is 0.95. The probabilities of successful RF energy harvesting with one unit of
    energy on channels c 1 and c 2 are 0.95 and 0.70, respectively, if they are occupied
    by the primary users. For comparison, we further consider a static policy, in
    which a secondary user selects a channel without considering the states of the
    data queue and energy storage. Numerical Results - We first show the effect of
    channel selection (for sensing and subsequently to transmit a packet or harvest
    RF energy) on the throughput performance of a secondary user. Figure 4 shows the
    throughput of the secondary user when the probability of sensing and accessing
    channel 1 is varied. Interestingly, the throughput can be low if the secondary
    user senses channel1 too little or too much frequently. This is because channel1
    is mostly occupied by the primary user. Therefore, sensing channel 1 more frequently
    will result in a larger amount of RF energy harvested. However, the secondary
    user will have less opportunity to transmit packets. On the other hand, sensing
    channel 1 less frequently will result in a smaller amount of RF energy harvested.
    As a result, the secondary user has a higher chance of having insufficient energy
    for packet transmission. There could be the optimal ratio that the secondary user
    should sense and access one particular channel. Figure 4. trade-off of sensing
    and throughput. Show All From Fig. 4 we also observe that the peak throughput
    at the different packet arrival rate could be different. For example, the peak
    throughput of the secondary user with packet arrival rate of 0.2 packets/time
    slot is lower than that with 0.5 packets/time slot. This is because the secondary
    user does not need much energy to transmit packets when the packet arrival rate
    is small. Therefore increasing the ratio of sensing and accessing channel 1 does
    not improve the throughput much. Next we examine the optimal channel selection
    policy, where the secondary user can optimally choose when to access a particular
    channel to sense and subsequently access for packet transmission or use it for
    RF energy harvesting. Figure 5 shows the optimal channel selection policy of the
    secondary user obtained from the MDP. A small probability of selecting channel
    c 1 means the secondary user is likely to select channel c 2 . We observe that
    the secondary user selects channel c 1 or c 2 depending on the data queue and
    energy storage states (i.e. the energy level and the number of packets, respectively).
    In this case, the secondary user selects channel c 1 when the energy level is
    low and the number of packets in the data queue is small. This is because channel
    c 1 is more likely to be busy (i.e. available for RF energy harvesting). On the
    other hand, the secondary user selects channel c 2 when the number of packets
    in the data queue is large and energy level is high. This is because channel c
    2 has a higher chance to be idle, which is good for packet transmission by the
    secondary user. Note that the channel selection policy favors the secondary user
    to select channel c 1 more than channel c 2 since the probability of successful
    RF energy harvesting from channel c 2 is lower than that from channel c 1 . Note
    that the number of packets cannot increase if the data queue is full. Similarly,
    the energy level cannot increase if the energy queue is full. Conversely, the
    number of packets cannot decrease if the data queue is empty, and the same is
    true for the energy level. The transition probability matrix for the MDP can be
    derived according to the above state transitions. Figure 5. Optimal policy of
    a secondary user. Show All We then investigate the case when the idle probability
    of channel c 1 is varied (Fig. 6). As the idle probability of channel c 1 increases
    (i.e. becomes less busy), the throughput of the optimal policy first increases.
    This is because the secondary user has more opportunity to transmit its packets.
    However, at a certain point the throughput decreases. This is because when channel
    c 1 is mostly idle, the secondary user cannot harvest much RF energy. Therefore
    there is not enough energy in the energy storage to transmit packets, thus the
    throughput decreases. We also provide a comparison with a static policy scheme.
    For the static policy the secondary user adjusts the ratio of selecting different
    channels until the maximum throughput is achieved. In this static policy the number
    of packets in the data queue and energy level of the energy storage are not taken
    into account. Consequently, the throughput of the static policy is lower than
    that of the optimal policy obtained from the MDP. Figure 6. Throughput under different
    dle probability of channel c1. Show All Conclusion Opportunistic RF energy harvesting
    is a promising technique to sustain the operation of secondary users in RF-powered
    CRNs. In this article we have discussed the channel selection problem with incomplete
    information in a CRN that consists of multiple primary users and a secondary user
    with energy harvesting capability. We have outlined the formulation of an optimization
    problem based on Markov decision process to obtain the optimal channel selection
    policy such that the throughput of the secondary user is maximized. We have observed
    that it is not always beneficial for the secondary user if a channel becomes idle
    often. In such a scenario the secondary user cannot harvest enough RF energy from
    the primary user for its own data transmission, resulting in a reduced throughput
    performance. The system model can be extended by considering the channel selection
    problem in a multi-channel RF-powered CRN composed of multiple secondary users.
    In this case the secondary users need to contend for the idle spectrum for transmission
    under an RF harvesting constraint. The channel selection problem in an RF-powered
    CRN can be also formulated considering dedicated RF energy sources. In such a
    scenario the network allows energy trading between secondary users and dedicated
    RF energy sources. The secondary users need to decide whether to buy energy from
    the dedicated RF energy sources or harvest free energy from nearby transmitting
    primary users. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes

    Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio techniques are being applied to many different
    communications systems. They hold promise for increasing utilization of radio
    frequencies that are underutilized today, allowing for improved commercial data
    services, and allowing for new emergency and military communications services.
    For example, these techniques are being considered by the U.S. FCC for communications
    services in unlicensed VHF and UHF TV bands. Although traditionally these techniques
    are closely associated with software-defined radios, many standards such as WiFi
    (IEEE 802.11), Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4), and WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) already include
    some degree of CR technology today. Further advances are occurring rapidly. IEEE
    802.22 will be the first cognitive radio-based international standard with tangible
    frequency bands for its operation. Standardization is at the core of the current
    and future success of cognitive radio. Industry stakeholders are participating
    in international standards activities governing the use of cognitive radio techniques
    for dynamic spectrum access and coexistence, next-generation radio and spectrum
    management, and interoperability in infrastructure-less wireless networks. This
    article provides a review of standardization activities for cognitive radio technologies
    and comments on prospects and issues for future standardization. Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction Technology forecasts predict that cognitive radio
    (CR) will be a critical part of many future radio systems and networks. Some regulatory
    domains, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States
    and of com in the United Kingdom, already are considering the use of CR technologies
    [2], [3]. A great deal of effort is pouring into cognitive radio technology and
    standards but is scattered across many activities. Several standardization organizations
    such as the Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Forum and International Telecommunications
    Union-Radio Sector (ITU-R) are working in this area [4]. This article surveys
    those activities within the IEEE. The IEEE has two well-known standards activities
    in this area-SCC41 (formerly known as P1900) and IEEE 802.22. However, there are
    several other, lesser known, related activities within IEEE as well. Before reviewing
    these, we present some background on cognitive radio and related technologies.
    The term cognitive radio first was used publicly in an article by Joseph Mitola
    III, where it was defined as “The point in which wireless personal digital assistants
    (PDAs) and the related networks are sufficiently computationally intelligent about
    radio resources and related computer-to-computer communications to detect user
    communications needs as a function of use context, and to provide radio resources
    and wireless services most appropriate to those needs.” [5] The definition was
    developed in the context of a software-defined radio (SDR), where the radio could
    easily be reconfigured to operate on different frequencies with different protocols
    by software reprogramming. Later the term was reused and reworked to suit different
    requirements by different authors. The level of cognition attributed to a radio
    depends on the complexity and intelligence of its cognitive engine, which can
    have learning capabilities and make decisions based on real-time changes in the
    operating conditions of the radio. Today, the term cognitive radio generally refers
    to a radio system that has the ability to sense its radio frequency (RF) environment
    and modify its spectrum usage based on what it detects. Note that the use of the
    term system is intentional as the components of a cognitive radio system can be
    distributed across multiple protocol layers and devices in a network. Often the
    term system is implicit when the words cognitive radio are used, but they are
    made explicit here for clarity. The specific behavior described in this paragraph
    also is termed dynamic spectrum access or DSA. Figure 1 provides a high-level
    view of the components that can be found in a cognitive radio sys-tem. Minimally,
    there must be at least one reconfigurable radio component with parameters, such
    as operating frequency and bandwidth, although many more parameters may exist.
    A sensing engine must exist that may accept inputs from the radio components,
    but many other sources also can be present, such as other networked nodes or data
    sources on the Internet and data such as geolocation data. The system can have
    a policy database that determines what behavior is acceptable in what circumstances.
    This database can be dynamically configurable allowing for policy changes. The
    system must have a reasoning engine that accepts inputs from the sensing engine
    and a policy database that determines an appropriate configuration for the radio
    compo-nents. The reasoning engine can be capable of learning, based on experience.
    Finally, a configuration database would maintain the current configuration of
    the radio components. A simple CR system might have a single reconfigurable radio
    component accepting sensing information from a single local node and no external
    data sources. Within IEEE, an area known as coexistence, which is indirectly related
    to cognitive radio, has been considered for many years. Many radios must include
    an ability to coexist with other radios using different protocols in the same
    bands. This is particularly true in unlicensed bands where a wide variety of unrelated
    protocols are applied, including such IEEE standards as IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15,
    and IEEE 802.16. In particular, techniques such as dynamic frequency selection
    (DFS) and power control (PC) were developed and standardized to deal with coexistence
    issues. The coexistence techniques developed and being developed for these bands
    are similar to those for DSA. In some regards, the application of CR/DSA techniques
    can be thought of as an evolution of coexistence techniques. Figure 2 shows a
    timeline for the evolution of cognitive standards within IEEE that takes coexistence
    standards as a starting point. Initial coexistence standards provided methods
    of measuring interference and mitigating interference through manual coordination.
    Human beings provided the cognitive engine! This can be thought of as a first
    generation of coexistence standards. These standards started being developed as
    early as 1999. Eventually people realized many of these techniques could be automated,
    and a second generation of standards resulted, including capabilities such as
    DFS and PC. Today CR/DSA standards are being developed that address issues such
    as coexistence. The specific standards and their timelines are depicted in Fig.
    2. In unlicensed frequency bands, coexisting protocols often have equal status
    and share equally. But the most important application of CR today is for secondary
    users, who can use only certain bands on the condition that they do not disturb
    the primary users of licensed bands. A spectrum shortage often is perceived (particularly
    at lower frequencies) because the entire spectrum has been allocated to primary
    users. Yet it has been found that in different geographic locations, large segments
    of the allocated spectrum are not utilized. (See, for example, [6].) CR/DSA techniques
    can permit additional (secondary) use of spectrum while protecting primary users.
    Many applications for CR technology exist, but minimally include commercial data
    networks, emergency services networks (first responders), and military networks.
    These applications of CR/DSA techniques still can be viewed as coexistence. Figure

    Figure 2. The evolution of IEEE standardization activities relating to dynamic
    spectrum access starting with coexistence standards, evolving toward DFS/PC, and
    finally encompassing true CR/DSA techniques. Show All As with many networking
    technologies, it is important that standards be developed for cognitive radio
    and applications such as coexistence. A great deal of standardization work has
    been conducted in recent years, and more work is in progress. This article reviews
    that work and is organized as follows: we consider the standards already developed
    or in development today that relate to CR technology. We discuss possible future
    directions. We summarize this article. Cognitive Radio and Related Standards Activities
    Tables 1–3 provide a synopsis of standardization work that was or is being conducted
    within IEEE for CR and related technologies. Table 1 presents completed standards
    activities. All the completed standards to date deal with coexistence of one form
    or another. Coexistence standards that depend on manual coordination are included
    because they defined what constitutes interference and mechanisms to mitigate
    it. These laid the ground work for the automated detection and spectrum-sharing
    techniques that evolved later. Many of these standards include DFS and transmit
    power control (TPC) for the purpose of facilitating spectrum sharing. They are
    designed to detect the presence of other systems, dynamically modify their use
    of spectrum to protect primary users, and to allow sharing between systems using
    diverse protocol sets. They are almost identical in function to DSA systems and
    can be found within several IEEE 802 standards. More information can be found
    below. Table 1. Comparison of various completed IEEE 802 standards projects relating
    to cognitive, dynamic spectrum access, and coexistence technologies. The set of
    activities in Table 2 are ongoing activities being conducted under Standards Coordinating
    Committee (SCC) 41 (http://www.scc41.org/). This group is focused on DSA networks
    and has several standards currently in development. More can be found below. They
    are well known for their CR activities and have a broader scope than the previous
    coexistence-oriented activities that were or are being conducted in IEEE 802.
    Table 3 addresses ongoing IEEE 802 activities related to CR technology. The first
    of these is 802.22 (http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/22/). The IEEE 802.22 working
    group is also well known for its cognitive radio activities. We provide greater
    details on this emerging standard. Finally, there are several other IEEE 802 activities
    that relate to cognitive standards but are less well known. We review some of
    these. Completed Standards of Interest For CR Although SCC 41 and IEEE 802.22
    are the primary cognitive standards efforts today, many completed IEEE 802 standards
    already include CR/DSA-like capabilities or related building blocks. Most of these
    concepts have evolved from coexistence activities. IEEE 802.15 was one of the
    first standards groups to grapple with coexistence issues. Many of the IEEE 802.15
    protocols were required to share the same unlicensed band (2.4 GHz) used by IEEE
    802.11. Systems implementing the 802.15 protocols generally are unable to communicate
    with systems implementing 802.11 protocols. Rather, they simply interfere with
    each other. The IEEE 802.15.2 Task Group was developed to grapple with coexistence
    issues and did seminal work in defining what it meant to coex-ist, and how coexistence
    could be facilitated and measured. A recommended practice resulted from their
    work. IEEE 802.15.2 contains a collection of collaborative and non-collaborative
    techniques that can be applied to improve the coexistence between systems; particularly
    IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15, but also in a more general sense. IEEE 802.15.2 defines
    coexistence as: “The ability of one system to perform a task in a given shared
    environment where other systems have an ability to perform their tasks and may
    or may not be using the same set of rules.” Table 2. Comparison of various ongoing
    IEEE SCC41 standards projects incorporating cognitive, dynamic spectrum access,
    and coexistence technologies. Coexistence does not require the use of cognitive
    techniques. But cognitive techniques can be used to facilitate coexistence. Another
    example of prior work in IEEE 802 groups relating to CR is the DFS and TPC capabilities
    added to IEEE 802.11 in IEEE 802.11h. These features deal with the fact that other
    systems (such as military radars) may operate in the unlicensed national information
    infrastructure (UNII) bands and require protection. The DFS features developed
    for 802.11 allow for the detection of military radar and the relocation of a potentially
    interfering 802.11 basic service set (BSS) to another frequency. The techniques
    developed for 802.11h can be applied to other bands and other systems with similar
    issues and can be leveraged by CR/DSA systems. IEEE 802.16–2004 is another standard
    that includes DFS and TPC capabilities. IEEE 802.15.4 includes dynamic channel
    selection (DCS), which is similar to DFS. IEEE SCC41 The SCC41 sponsors standards
    projects in the area of dynamic spectrum access networks. The SCC41/P1900 activities
    are co-sponsored by the IEEE Communications and Electromagnetic Compatibility
    Societies. New techniques and methods of dynamic spectrum access require managing
    interference, coordination of wireless technologies, and include network management
    and information sharing. The SCC41 addresses standardization for these techniques.
    The SSC41 identifies its roots as originating with SDR technologies as a key enabler
    for CR/DSA [7]. It concentrates on developing architectural concepts and specifications
    for network management between incompatible wireless networks rather than specific
    mechanisms that can be added to the physical (PHY) or media access control (MAC)
    protocol layers. The IEEE SCC41 will provide vertical and horizontal network reconfiguration
    management methods for interoperability in infrastructure-less wireless networks.
    The SCC41 [8] is developing policy-based network management for dynamic spectrum
    access among third/fourth generation (3G/4G), WiFi, and worldwide inter-operability
    for microwave access (WiMax) net-works. An example of the important work that
    is ongoing within the SCC41 is illustrated in Fig. 3 and shows the SCC41 concept
    of operations that enable spectrum management between cognitive and non-cognitive
    radio access networks (RANs). The network reconfiguration management (NRM) functions
    communicate with the terminal radio management (TRM) function to provide interoperability
    between the infrastructure-less wireless network environ-ments. The dynamic spectrum
    access and management of these environments include distributed decision-making
    via policies for each network. Distributed decision-making for DSA management
    account for these capabili-ties. P1900.4-compliant infrastructure would allow
    for terminal and network reconfiguration to account for these factors and may
    be able to use the existing network infrastructure to enable seamless connectivity.
    The individual working groups (WGs) of SCC41 are listed along with their scope
    and status in Table 2. It is anticipated that additional standardization activities
    will be conducted within the SCC41. The SCC41 recently proposed two new working
    groups to address policy language (P1900.5) and RF sensing (P1900.6). The goal
    of these groups is to develop the policy language framework using ontology-based
    languages and to address spectrum sensing functions that can be managed in the
    TRMs. Table 3. Comparison of various IEEE standards incorporating cognitive, dynamic
    spectrum access, and coexistence technologies. Figure 3. The P1900.4 concept of
    operations (CONOPS) where terminals use CR techniques to operate across a variety
    of existing network infrastructures and maintain seamless connectivity. Show All
    IEEE 802.22 In May 2004, in the landmark Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM)
    04–113 [3], the FCC announced the use of unlicensed wireless operation in the
    analog television (TV) bands. In response to this NPRM (and proceedings leading
    up to it), the IEEE 802 local area network/metropolitan area network (LAN/MAN)
    Standards committee created the 802.22 WG on wireless regional area networks (WRANs)
    with a CR-based air interface for use by license-exempt devices on a non-interfering
    basis in VHF and UHF (54–862 MHz) bands. IEEE 802.22 will be the first complete
    cognitive radio-based international standard with frequency bands allocated for
    its use. Significant progress has been made toward the PHY, MAC, and cognitive
    domain definitions of the standard. A few essential features are highlighted below.
    IEEE 802.22 will be the first complete cognitive radio-based international standard
    with frequency bands allocated for its use. Significant progress has been made
    toward the PHY, MAC, and cognitive domain definitions of the standard. Figure

    IEEE 802.22 frame structure, which is an extension of the IEEE 802.16E-2005 frame
    structure with the addition of a self-coex-istence window (SCW). Show All IEEE
    802.16 is intended for use in licensed and unlicensed bands. Coexistence issues
    have been a concern almost from the beginning. However, in 2004, project 802.16h
    was started to consider “improved coexistence mechanisms for license-exempt operation.”
    Figure 4a shows the proposed protocol referenced model (PRM) for a CR node that
    is likely to be adopted by the 802.22 WG. Definition of an appropriate PRM is
    important because it defines the system architecture, functionalities of various
    blocks, and their mutual interactions. The proposed PRM separates the system into
    the cognitive, data/control, and management planes. The data/control and management
    planes (non-cognitive components) look similar to other standards within the IEEE.
    The spectrum-sensing function (SSF) and geolocation function that interface with
    the RF stage of the device provide information to the spectrum manager (SM) on
    the presence of incumbent signals, as well as its current location. The SM function
    makes decisions on transmission of the information-bearing signals. The SM at
    the subscriber location is called the spectrum automaton (SA), because it is assumed
    that almost all of the intelligence and the decision-making capability will reside
    at the SM of the base station. The PHY, MAC, and convergence layers are essentially
    the same as in 802.16. Security sub-layers are added between service access points
    (SAPs) to provide enhanced protection. Spectrum sensing was one of the major challenges
    for this standard until recently. TV broadcasters had set a stringent limit for
    the TV signals to be reliably detected (probability of detection > 90 percent
    with probability of false alarm < 10 percent) at a signal strength of −116 dBm
    translating to roughly −21 dB of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on the receiver
    noise figure (NF) of around 11 dB and the use of omnidirectional antenna for spectrum
    sensing. However, there are currently at least three techniques that meet these
    stringent sensing require-ments. One of these techniques was proposed by one of
    the authors of this article [9]. The FCC also mandates the protection of approved
    Part 74 devices such as the wireless microphones in these frequency bands. Because
    wireless microphones operate with lower band-width, lower power, and anywhere
    in a TV chan-nel, they are difficult to detect and protect [10]. To facilitate
    their detection, a beacon signal will be constantly transmitted from specialized
    devices that will accompany the wireless microphone base stations. These beacon
    signals consist of repeated pseudo noise (PN) sequences and have a bandwidth of
    approximately 78 kHz with the center frequency at approximately the same location
    as that of the Advanced Television Systems Committee-Digital Television (ATSC-DTV)
    pilot signal of the channel currently occupied by the wireless microphone. The
    802.22 WG has adopted many of the PHY, MAC, security, and quality of service (QoS)
    features from the IEEE 802.16–2004 and 802.16e standards with some essential modifications
    due to the different propagation and operational scenario characteristics for
    WRANs. Because signals at VHF/UHF travel longer distances than those at higher
    frequencies, various WRAN cells using similar frequencies are likely to create
    co-channel interference. Hence, as compared to other standards, 802.22 has been
    quite proactive in addressing the issue of self-coexistence. Figure 4b shows the
    proposed IEEE 802.22 frame structure. The IEEE 802.22 frame structure is an extension
    of the IEEE 802.16–2004 and 802.16e frame structures except for an addition of
    a self coexistence window (SCW). Coexistence beaconing packets (CBPs) are transmitted
    in the SCW for inter-WRAN and intra-WRAN synchronization, backhaul message passing
    when backhaul connectivity is not avail-able, spectrum-and WRAN-sensing information
    exchange, channel sharing, interference-free scheduling, dynamic resource renting
    and offering, and if all else fails, channel contention. The IEEE 802.22 draft
    standard document explains these functionalities in detail. Other Ongoing Work
    of Interest for CR IEEE 802.19 is a technical advisory group (TAG) within IEEE
    802. IEEE 802.19 was created, based on the successes of 802.15.2, to act as a
    coexistence advisory committee across all of IEEE 802. It has spearheaded the
    creation of special rules focused on fostering coexistence within IEEE 802 standards
    operating in unlicensed bands. This includes monitoring the creation of coexistence
    assurance documents for new IEEE 802 wireless standards that could rely on cognitive
    techniques. Currently, 802.19 is working on a recommended practice for methods
    of assessing coexistence of wireless networks. When completed, these methods may
    be of use for cognitive systems. IEEE 802.16 is intended for use in licensed and
    unlicensed bands. Coexistence issues have been a concern almost from the beginning.
    How-ever, in 2004, project 802.16h was started to consider “improved coexistence
    mechanisms for license-exempt operation.” The resulting standard likely will include
    cognitive capabilities and mechanisms that can be broadly applicable in many systems.
    As of this date, the current draft of this standard is “D3,” and it is still being
    balloted within the 802.16 WG. Future Directions for CR/DSA Standardization Although
    rudimentary cognitive capabilities (detection of other signals with application
    of dynamic frequency assignment, power control, and other techniques in response)
    already exist, many would say that existing standards have not yet risen to the
    point of being cognitive. But the promise and potential value of such techniques
    clearly is recognized, and almost all existing and future wireless standards are
    trying to incorporate cognitive radio, dynamic-spectrum access, and coexistence
    techniques. In addition, as governments open and evaluate opening new bands specifically
    requiring the use of CR, these techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated.
    There are many issues yet to be fully addressed such as recognizing and defining
    harmful interference, inter-modulation and out-of-band impacts, providing security
    within cognitive systems, and self-and inter-system coexistence. These issues
    must be sorted out before regulatory bodies such as the FCC will alter their policies
    and rulemaking. Even then, existing standardization efforts fall far short of
    the original CR vision put forward by Mitola nearly ten years ago. What is lacking
    is the incorporation of other knowledge domains. Current cognitive radios account
    for knowledge of spectrum usage and to a limited degree, geolocation. This (spectrum
    uti-lization) is one knowledge domain. Other knowledge domains could include knowledge
    of the type of information to be accessed, knowledge of QoS and security requirements
    for data streams, and knowledge of available processing elements and databases
    in a network. CR capabilities also can exist outside the radio. It is believed
    that ultimately cognitive networking or cognitive communications will be more
    appropriate terms. Cognitive radio still is an active area of research, and as
    research progresses and comes into prac-tice, further standardization work will
    be required to facilitate adoption of new techniques. Conclusions Cognitive radio
    still is an active area of research, and as research progresses and comes into
    practice, further standardization work will be required to facilitate adoption
    of new techniques. Cognitive radio technology is advancing rapidly. Standardization
    is key to the current and future success of cognitive radio. This article has
    reviewed completed and on-going standards activities of interest for cognitive
    radio within IEEE. It also has considered future directions and standardization
    areas for cognitive radio technology. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio is regarded as a promising technology
    to provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless network architectures
    and dynamic spectrum access techniques. However, cognitive radio networks may
    also impose some challenges due to various factors such as the ever increasing
    complexity of network architecture, the high cost of configuring and managing
    large-scale networks, the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, diverse
    QoS requirements of various applications, and the intensifying difficulties of
    centralized control. A plethora of work has been carried out to address the challenges
    aforementioned by employing cognitive radio functionalities with self-organization
    features. In this article, variant aspects of self-organization paradigms in cognitive
    radio networks, including critical functionalities of MAC- and network-layer operations,
    are surveyed. The main contributions of this survey include introducing the fundamentals
    of existing cognitive radio and self-organization techniques as well as their
    current progress, surveying critical cognitive radio issues (including common
    control channel management, cooperative spectrum sensing, bioinspired spectrum
    sharing, network scalability and adaptive routing) as well as their self-organization
    features, and identifying new directions and open problems in cognitive radio
    networks. Published in: IEEE Wireless Communications ( Volume: 20, Issue: 2, April

    10.1109/MWC.2013.6507392 Publisher: IEEE INtroduction Since modern communications
    networks must deliver ever increasing data rates at an ever decreasing cost per
    bit, their spectral efficiency must be further improved. However, the current
    static spectrum allocation policy faces spectrum scarcity, especially spectrum
    bands, and cannot satisfy the increases in spectrum demand. More-over, a significant
    amount of spectrum is underutilized due to a large portion of the assigned spectrum
    being used sporadically. Hence, a new communication paradigm, dynamic spectrum
    access (DSA), whose key enabling technology is referred to as cognitive radio
    (CR), was recently proposed to solve these spectrum inefficiency problems. Since
    CR technology enables unlicensed users to share spectrum with primary/ licensed
    users in an opportunistic manner, both the spectrum utilization and coverage area
    of CR networks (CRNs) can be significantly improved. However, DSA technology suffers
    from low scalability and convergence. Moreover, CRNs may also impose new challenges
    due to the ever increasing complexity of network architecture, the fluctuating
    nature of the available spectrum, and some other important issues that affect
    the quality of service (QoS) of user applications. Furthermore, some other challenges,
    such as the increasing complexity with configuration and management of large-scale
    networks, the upgrading capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures
    (OPEX), and the intensifying difficulties of centralized control, will further
    arise in the future heterogeneous networks. Decentralized approaches, which enable
    CR users to perform spectrum sensing/access based on partial knowledge of network
    status, can be adopted to address the aforementioned challenges, and will consequently
    lead to a new concept: self-orga-nization. Various appealing characteristics,
    such as adaptivity to the varying environmental circum-stances, the ability to
    self-organize in a fully distributed fashion, and the ability to operate without
    centralized control or human intervention, have been emphasized in artificial
    self-organized networking (SON) systems such as wireless ad hoc and wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs). In CRNs, mechanisms of self-organization have also been emphasized
    to address the emerging spectrum scarcity problem. Since the coordination among
    the distributed CR users should experience minimum delay to facilitate seamless
    communications during spectrum handoff, decentralized protocols exploiting CR
    users'' local observations in spectrum sharing would provide a promising method
    to reduce the information exchanges among CR users for coordination. Therefore,
    DSA can obtain significant benefits from the self-organization features such as
    distributed control or localized interactions. In order to avoid the high computational
    and communication overhead required by the optimization of spectrum access in
    mobile networks, a distributed spectrum allocation based on local bargaining can
    be proposed to enable mobile users to negotiate spectrum assignment in a self-organizing
    manner. Furthermore, bio-inspired algorithms, which were inspired by the collective
    behavior of natural species, may also be investigated to improve the spectrum
    sharing efficiency in CRNs. In this article, we survey various aspects of CR technologies,
    with features of self-organization being emphasized. The main functionalities
    of CR, including spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum sharing, and
    spectrum mobility, are first investigated. Medium access control (MAC) strategies
    of CRNs, including the maintenance of a common control channel (CCC), and cooperative
    spectrum sensing and sharing, are then surveyed. After that, the critical network-layer
    issues in CRNs, such as network scalability and adaptive routing, are discussed,
    with the remaining challenges faced in those techniques analyzed. The remainder
    of this article is organized as follows. The fundamentals of CR techniques are
    introduced, followed by an introduction to the fundamentals of self-organization.
    Important issues of MAC strategies in CRNs, including the maintenance of a control
    channel and cooperative spectrum management, are surveyed. Critical network-layer
    issues, including network scalability and adaptive routing, are investigated.
    After that, the remaining challenges faced in developing future CR-enabled SON
    systems are analyzed, followed by the conclusions drawn. Fundamentals of Cognitive
    Radio Cognitive radio, as first introduced by Joseph Mitola III [1], is the key
    technology that enables an unlicensed (secondary) user to use spectrum in a dynamic
    and opportunistic manner. CR technologies provide opportunistic spectrum sharing
    capability by enabling users to perform spectrum sensing, spectrum management,
    spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility functionalities, as illustrated in Fig.
    1. Figure 1. Functionalities of cognitive radio, including spectrum sensing, spectrum
    mobility, spectrum management, and spectrum sharing. Show All CRN Architecture
    CRNs, equipped with the intrinsic capabilities of CR, will provide an ultimate
    spectrum-aware communication paradigm by exploiting the existing wireless spectrum
    opportunistically. The components of CRN architecture can be classified as the
    primary network and the CR network [2]. The primary network generally refers to
    the existing network infrastructure (e.g., common cellular and TV broadcast networks),
    and has exclusive rights to a certain spectrum. The latter, on the other hand,
    does not have license to operate in a desired band, and its spectrum access is
    allowed only in an opportunistic man-ner. Both infrastructure and ad hoc networks
    can be deployed in CRNs, with components of CR users, CR base stations, and spectrum
    brokers (or scheduling servers) included. Current Progress In Research On Cognitive
    Radio Since CRNs provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless
    network architectures and DSA techniques, they can be applied to various applications
    such as cognitive mesh networks, emergency networks, and military networks. Several
    projects around the world, such as NeXt Generation (xG) program [3] and the European
    DRiVE/OverDRiVE project [4], have been carried out to implement DSA in heterogeneous
    networks. Since CRNs provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous
    wireless network architectures and DSA techniques, they can be applied to various
    applications such as cognitive mesh networks, emergency networks, and military
    networks Besides, CR features have started to be included in recently developed
    wireless stan-dards, with the capabilities of wideband spectrum sensing and opportunistic
    spectrum exploitation emphasized. For instance, IEEE 802.22, which is the first
    worldwide standard based on the CR technologies, specifies spectral efficiencies
    of wireless regional area networks (WRANs) in the range of 0.5~5 b/s/Hz. Compared
    to the existing IEEE 802 standards, the base station coverage of an IEEE 802.22
    WRAN can go up to 100 km, provided that the power is not a restraining issue [2].
    Fundamentals of Self-Organization Self-organization, as occurs in many branches
    of science such as biology, physics, and telecommunications (as exemplified in
    Fig. 2), is regarded as a promising solution for large-scale networks to address
    the challenges brought by the ever increasing complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamics
    in complex communications systems. Various artificial SON systems (e.g., wireless
    ad hoc and WSNs) have been developed, with some major properties, such as the
    ability to self-organize without centralized control or human intervention and
    adaptive routing mechanisms to respond to the network topology changes, exhibited
    in them. Besides, as a critical and main feature of the Third Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced sys-tems, the self-X capabilities
    (e.g., self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, and plug-and-play)
    have already been emphasized in the evolved Node B (eNodeB) functionalities. Figure
    2. Self-organization, as occurs in many branches of science such as biology, economics,
    and telecommunications, is essentially an interdisciplinary research field. Show
    All Considering that several natural species have already evolved for one million
    years or even longer, some insights learned from those species may be beneficial
    in designing intelligent artificial systems (i.e., bio-inspired algorithms have
    been developed [5]). For instance, some ant colony optimization (ACO)-based protocols
    such as AntNet [6] and AntHocNet [7] have been developed for use in packet-switched
    networks and are proven to outperform the Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV)
    routing algorithm in terms of either packet delivery ratio or average end-to-end
    packet delay. Furthermore, some other pioneering works on finding out the essential
    and universal paradigms for designing intelligent artificial SON systems have
    already been carried out from an interdisciplinary point of view [8]. As the self-organization
    theory and technology continues to mature, self-organized approaches (e.g., bio-inspired
    methods) will play an increasingly important role in either performance enhancement
    or cost reduction in terms of CAPEX/OPEX and system control in CRNs. Mac Strategies
    for CRNS CR MAC protocols are conventionally classified by considering either
    the spectrum access scheme (i.e., to divide the spectrum access as random access,
    time slotted access, or hybrid access) or spectrum sharing architecture (i.e.,
    either centralized or decentralized). Besides, self-organization features are
    extensively observed in the decentralized spectrum sharing protocols and have
    been proven to be capable of achieving cost-effective spectrum access and management.
    Control Channel Management In CRNs Effective spectrum sharing and utilization
    can be obtained in CRNs through spectrum sensing/ management, with some new features
    (e.g., adaptive frequency hopping) introduced to reduce the interference between
    users or wireless technologies sharing the same spectrum bands. Designing multichannel
    MAC protocols is assumed to be the first step in the development of CR MAC protocols
    in unlicensed ad hoc scenarios. Different from conventional multichannel networks
    that consider a fixed number of channels at each user, the number of channels
    at each CR user varies with time and space in CRNs. Moreover, the timescale in
    which a CRN operates should be different from that of conventional multichannel
    networks since secondary users must be aware of the wireless environment evolution
    and rapidly adapt their behavior to comply with interference constraints. Therefore,
    different methodologies should be implemented to form a control channel for sharing
    the spectrum sensing results among CR users as well as sharing channel allocation
    information. Since the amount of signaling information exchanged in CRNs is substantially
    larger than in conventional networks, most CR MAC protocols exploit an out-of-band
    control channel. Although several existing works assume that a global control
    channel is available, the possibility of finding an opportunistic and universally
    available channel for all users in CRNs is very small. Thus, a local common channel
    can be applied to overcome this drawback, with two approaches, the CCC scheme
    and the split phase (SP) scheme, proposed to manage the out-of-band control channel.
    In the CCC scheme, CR users share a dedicated channel to exchange signaling and
    sensing information, and then perform channel selection. Although CCC may facilitate
    many spectrum sharing functionalities, a channel must be vacated when a primary
    user choose this spectrum band, and a fixed CCC is therefore unavailable. Moreover,
    a channel common to all users in CRNs is highly dependent on the network topology
    and varies over time. In practice, a distributed and localized CCC management
    method can be implemented to enable reliable sharing of sensing information among
    CR users. The SP scheme, on the other hand, requires time synchronization, but
    permits exploiting only one transceiver at CR users. By dividing each time frame
    into two parts (i.e., the control phase and data phase), CR users can overhear
    the control message conveyed by the subframe in the control phase so as to be
    aware of the network status [9]. Spectrum utilization is inevitably reduced due
    to wasted free data channels during control phase transmission. Cooperation In
    Cr-enabled Systems Cooperation is commonly observed in social species, where a
    worker usually does not perform all tasks but rather specializes in a set of tasks.
    In artificial systems (e.g., in WSNs or wireless ad hoc networks), massively distributed
    nodes may collaboratively transmit a big block of information. Another well-known
    cooperative technique for wireless cellular systems is coordinated multipoint
    (CoMP) transmission/reception, which has been chosen as one of the candidate techniques
    for 3GPP LTE-Advanced to increase the average cell throughput and cell edge users''
    spectral efficiency in both uplink and downlink transmissions. Cooperative Communications
    in CRNs In CRNs, although unlicensed users can opportunistically fill in spectrum
    holes to improve spectrum utilization with fast and agile sensing ability, these
    CR users must immediately vacate the licensed spectrum bands they are using once
    the primary users return to access those bands. As a result, the interruptive
    transmissions in unlicensed users will lead to discontinuous data service and
    intolerable delay. Challenges aforementioned can be addressed by using cognitive
    relaying, which enables distributed CR users to collaborate with each other and
    share their distinct spectrum bands. By separating all the secondary users into
    a few clusters, and selecting the most favorable user to act as the cluster head
    and report to the common receiver, spatial diversity gain in the proposed cooperative
    sensing can thus be enhanced Another challenge to CRNs'' connectivity is brought
    by the interference from multiple heterogeneous primary networks, and the constraints
    in the secondary users'' transmission power (i.e., to limit the interference to
    the primary networks) further deteriorate the connectivity. In consideration of
    the possibility of connecting multiple heterogeneous secondary networks with different
    radio access technologies via proper cooperation, those heterogeneous secondary
    networks as a whole can be treated as one secondary network. Thus, users from
    each secondary network can act as relays of the other secondary networks to enable
    this kind of inter-network cooperation. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing In CRNs,
    secondary users can be coordinated to perform cooperative spectrum sensing by
    detecting the primary users more accurately. In consideration of the sensing performance
    degradation due to the fading and/or shadowing that happens in the reporting channel,
    which forwards the sensing observations to a common receiver, a cluster-based
    cooperative spectrum sensing method may be applied to improve the sensing performance.
    By separating all the secondary users into a few clusters, and selecting the most
    favorable user to act as the cluster head and report to the common receiver, spatial
    diversity gain in the proposed cooperative sensing can thus be enhanced. Since
    the co-cluster users are usually close to each other, a perfect inter-user channel
    is thus assumed in most of the existing work. However, in consideration of the
    impact of spatial correlation between CR users on the performance of cooperative
    spectrum sensing, spatially close CR users are likely to be under the same environment
    conditions and suffer from common biases in spectrum sensing. In this case, CR
    users that are farther apart can benefit from their geographical difference and
    obtain more reliable spectrum sensing, although an imperfect channel may be obtained
    due to the inter-user spatial separation. The main self-organi-zation features,
    including fully distributed user selection without the need for a central entity,
    adaptive tracking of dynamic changes of the correlation experienced by the CR
    users due to the network changes, and location unawareness, have been exhibited
    in user selection and proven to be able to bring about significant benefits in
    improving the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing. Bio-Inspired Spectrum
    Sharing Bio-inspired algorithms, as inspired by the collective behaviors, have
    exhibited their capabilities in enabling artificial SON systems to be self-optimizing,
    fault-tolerant, highly scalable, and so on, and may be investigated to provide
    a new way of obtaining decentralized spectrum sharing. In [10], a biologically-inspired
    spectrum sharing (BlOSS) algorithm based on the adaptive task allocation model
    in insect colonies is pro-posed. Efficient spectrum sharing over multiple spectrum
    bands is enabled in BIOSS, which performs decentralized spectrum sharing and requires
    no inter-user coordination. In order to mitigate the drawback of BIOSS with a
    high probability of conflicts between CR users, an enhanced BIOSS algorithm (i.e.,
    e-BIOSS [11]) is proposed to enable CR users to select the appropriate channels
    to transmit and at the same time avoid interference to the incumbent users. The
    channel selection probability function in e-BIOSS is modified to enable a CR user
    to gravitate toward the channel with minimum excess power. Besides, a binary learning
    factor, which leads to a direct decision being made on whether to adopt or abandon
    a certain channel, is also applied in e-BIOSS to enable a rapid reaction to the
    dynamic wireless environment in CR users. Game Theory in CRNs Besides the aforementioned
    issues, game theory may also play an important role in modeling network interactions
    and optimizing MAC-layer protocols in CRNs. In game theoretic algo-rithms, interactions
    between CR users can be represented as a game, with the dynamics of CRNs being
    resolved efficiently by using game theory to model the adaptation and recursive
    interactive decision process (i.e., via a repeated game). Interactive behaviors
    among CR users can be represented as a game Γ=<N,{ S i },{ U i }> , where N is
    the set of game players, S i represents the strategy space of player i , and U
    i stands for the local utility function that models the scope of player i . Note
    that each player may adopt a unique utility function to pursue its specific goals.
    Game theoretic approaches that use optimization techniques to find the optimal
    strategies for spectrum sharing have been proposed in CRNs. For instance, a game
    theoretic DSA protocol called GMAC [12], which exploits a function to maximize
    overall network throughput by limiting transmission power, has been proposed,
    with Nash equilibrium being achieved through a distributed recursive game. In
    order to minimize the users'' cooperation overhead and reduce the delay of the
    optimization process at the same time, a clustering algorithm for the game theoretic
    DSA-driven framework is proposed in [13] to achieve inter-player coordination
    and overcome the scalability issues in DSA MAC protocols. Besides, game theory
    can also be exploited for performance evaluation of DSA schemes. In order to carry
    out a performance comparison between cooperative and non-cooperative approaches,
    game theory can be exploited to analyze the behavior of CR users for distributed
    adaptive channel allocation. For more game theoretic algo-rithms, interested readers
    may refer to [14]. Network-Layer Strategies in CR-Enabled Son Systems In this
    section, we focus on network-layer issues of CRNs, with important topics such
    as network scalability and adaptive routing studied. Network Scalability Scalability
    is a critical performance indicator in large-scale networks, and can be measured
    along the following three dimensions: The size of a system with respect to the
    number of involved subsystems The geographical size or geographical distance between
    subsystems The manageability of the whole system However, discouraging results
    showed that the transport capacity in an N -node WSN scales as 1/N from an information
    theoretical point of view, or 1/logN even by employing powerful tools of parallel
    and distributed optimization. In an ad hoc wireless network, the throughput in
    terms of bits per second for each node decreases at a rate between 1/ NlogT −
    − − − − − √ and 1/ N − − √ , as the number of nodes N grows asymptotically large.
    Self-organization, which has been regarded as a promising solution for the management
    and control mechanism of massively distributed net-works, requires a new control
    theory to realize such a manageable and nonlinear complex system through some
    simple and local interactions between neighboring individuals. Some common structural
    properties, referred to as small world and scale-free properties, have been observed
    in various SON systems to ensure network scalabili-ty. Since SON systems exhibit
    emergent properties and heavily rely on localized decision processes, a mechanism
    for positive and negative feedback will have the most fundamental role in controlling
    the systems'' scalability. Besides, some other advanced techniques, such as mobile
    relays, multihop routing, and load balancing, can also be employed to improve
    the scalability of CRNs. Adaptive Routing Adaptive routing, as a critical functionality
    of wireless self-organized networks, has already been studied considerably in
    recent decades. In consideration of the unique characteristics of the radio environment
    in CRNs, new challenges may arise in designing cognitive routing algorithms. First,
    the fixed CCC used in traditional routing protocols is infeasible in CRNs, with
    some specific routing functionalities, such as neighbor discovery, route discovery,
    and route establishment, difficult to facilitate. Second intermittent connectivity
    between neighboring nodes may happen frequently not only because of the node mobility
    and dynamic characteristics of wireless signals, but also due to the dynamic changes
    of available spectrum in CRNs. Besides, the QoS of unlicensed users (e.g., end-to-end
    latency, packet loss probability) may also be degraded due to issues of spectrum
    handoff and interference. Therefore, various important factors, such as the time-variant
    channel attenuation, dynamic changes of spectrum, and the frequency/space-domain
    characteristics of the radio environment should be considered jointly in constituting
    multihop CR routes. Last but not least, spectrum-aware rerouting algorithms should
    also be developed to adapt to spectrum fluctuations and enable optimization/maintenance
    of CR routes. In order to tackle the problem of opportunis-tic data transfer in
    mobile ad hoc networks, the broadcasting nature of wireless links can also be
    exploited to achieve cooperative communications at the link and network layers
    of static multihop wireless networks. Opportunistic spec-trum-aware routing can
    be created by taking advantage of the numerous yet unreliable wireless links in
    a wireless network in a probabilistic manner. Besides, interference minimization
    is usually taken into consideration in designing the spectrum-aware routing to
    optimize the performance from the perspective of delay, through-put, or load balancing.
    By building a runtime forwarding mesh that is updated periodically and offering
    a set of candidate routes to the destination, SAMER can balance the long-term
    route stability and short-term opportunistic performance successfully. In CRNs
    with a mesh framework, a spec-trum-aware mesh routing (SAMER) algorithm passes
    traffic across paths that opportunistically adapt to the dynamic spectrum conditions,
    with the highest-spectrum-availability link being exploited at the same time [15].
    By building a runtime forwarding mesh that is updated periodically and offering
    a set of candidate routes to the destination, the SAMER can balance the long-term
    route stability and short-term opportunistic performance successfully. REmaining
    CHallenges In spite of CRNs will provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous
    wireless architectures and dynamic spectrum access techniques, some challenges
    may still be imposed by CRNs due to the dynamic spectrum environment and the diverse
    QoS requirements of various applications. Heterogeneity induced challenges The
    heterogeneity of the CRNs, especially that exhibited in a multiuser environment
    with coexistence of CR users and primary users, introduces new challenges to the
    spectrum management and sharing. Besides, the heterogeneous spectrum comprising
    both licensed and unlicensed bands for different purposes imposes additional challenges
    in CR techniques. Multichannel spectrum sensing Since CR users may neither occupy
    a spectrum band for a long time period nor satisfy their requirements by utilizing
    a single spectrum band, multiple noncontiguous spectrum bands can thus be simultaneously
    sensed and utilized by CR users for purposes of improvement in throughput and
    communications reliability. However, designing a cost-efficient multispectrum
    sensing approach in heterogeneous CRNs is still a challenging task. Cooperative
    spectrum sensing The effective combination of cooperation and self-organization
    in spectrum sensing is worthy of further investigation, and a totally distributed
    CRN (i.e., cooperation is performed without relying on the coordination of CR
    base stations or permanent cluster heads) would be a promising solution in terms
    of cost reduction in network operation and maintenance. CCC implementation challenges
    Since the implementation of a static or fixed CCC for spectrum sharing is infeasible
    in CRNs, a proper CCC implementation must be exploited for clusters of CR users
    to facilitate the important spectrum sharing functionalities [2]. Being aware
    of the ever Increasing com-plexity, heterogene-ity, and dynamics of communications
    net-works, proposing more fundamental self-organization mechanisms and optimization
    approaches that are universally applicable to heterogeneous CRNs will still be
    a challenging task in the future. Spectrum mobility challenges Limited packet
    loss and delay are required during the spectrum mobility process, and this requirement
    raises new challenges in terms of seamless data trans-mission, priority-based
    channel management, and QoS guarantee. Self-organization paradigms in CR function
    alities Since self-organization paradigms are totally based on local behavior
    of individuals, the decentralized control may raise new challenges: Self-organization
    may not necessarily lead to an optimum solution; In order to minimize human intervention,
    the control decisions as well as data measure-ment/probing/processing should be
    operated autonomously. Therefore, a tradeoff between the reliability and the signaling
    overhead of self-organization methods must be addressed; A new theory of distributed
    self-control and self-management is required to pave the way toward the reliable
    CRNs with a high scalability and spectrum sensing speed. COnclusions As an ever
    increasing research and development effort has been focused on the valuable resource
    in wireless communications systems (i.e., the spec-trum) over the last several
    decades, CR has become a promising concept for utilizing the available spectrum
    more efficiently through opportunistic spectrum usage. Self-organization, as occurs
    in many branches of science such as biolo-gy, physics, and telecommunications,
    is regarded as an effective way to address challenges such as the increasing complexity
    of configuration and management of large-scale networks, upgraded CAPEX/OPEX,
    and the intensifying difficulties of centralized control in future heterogeneous
    net-works. In this article, some critical issues of CRNs in both MAC-layer and
    network-layer operations are surveyed, followed by a discussion of remaining challenges.
    Features of self-organization are emphasized in those issues. Being aware of the
    ever increasing complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of communications networks,
    proposing more fundamental self-organization mechanisms and optimization approaches
    that are universally applicable to heterogeneous CRNs will still be a challenging
    task in the future. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to acknowledge the Editor

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: For cognitive
    radio networks, efficient and robust spectrum sensing is a crucial enabling step
    for dynamic spectrum access. Cognitive radios need to not only rapidly identify
    spectrum opportunities over very wide bandwidth, but also make reliable decisions
    in noise-uncertain environments. Cyclic spectrum sensing techniques work well
    under noise uncertainty, but require high-rate sampling which is very costly in
    the wideband regime. This paper develops robust and compressive wideband spectrum
    sensing techniques by exploiting the unique sparsity property of the two-dimensional
    cyclic spectra of communications signals. To do so, a new compressed sensing framework
    is proposed for extracting useful second-order statistics of wideband random signals
    from digital samples taken at sub-Nyquist rates. The time-varying cross-correlation
    functions of these compressive samples are formulated to reveal the cyclic spectrum,
    which is then used to simultaneously detect multiple signal sources over the entire
    wide band. Because the proposed wideband cyclic spectrum estimator utilizes all
    the cross-correlation terms of compressive samples to extract second-order statistics,
    it is also able to recover the power spectra of stationary signals as a special
    case, permitting lossless rate compression even for non-sparse signals. Simulation
    results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed spectrum sensing algorithms
    against both sampling rate reduction and noise uncertainty in wireless networks.

    ISSN Information: DOI: 10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2181940 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction
    In cognitive radio (CR) applications, secondary CR users shall be able to sense
    a wide spectrum and adapt their transmission parameters dynamically to utilize
    the available spectrum while avoiding interference to any primary users (PU).
    To accomplish these tasks, fast and accurate spectrum sensing is a key enabler
    [1], [2]. Different from traditional spectral estimation problems for narrowband
    systems, CRs face distinct implementation challenges in wideband processing, which
    renders Nyquist-rate sampling costly or even impractical. Meanwhile, the CR channel
    environment is subject to frequency selective fading as well as dynamically varying
    noise and interference levels, which perplex those spectrum sensing techniques
    based on known or fixed signal and noise statistics. Further, the sensing time
    has to be short to ensure network responsiveness and efficiency. Traditional spectrum
    sensing techniques have major limitations for wideband CR networks. The matched
    filter is optimal for signal detection under Gaussian noise, but requires prior
    knowledge of the signal waveforms to be detected, which can be infeasible to acquire
    in practice. An energy detector does not require prior knowledge of PU signals
    and is simple to implement, but its detection accuracy is very sensitive to noise
    uncertainty and becomes unacceptable under low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) conditions
    [3]–[5]. Cyclic feature detectors are quite robust to both noise uncertainty and
    strong noise, and can differentiate various modulation types and hence potentially
    separate PUs from CRs [6]–[8]. These salient properties have been recognized and
    utilized in recent development on CR sensing [9]–[17]. On the other hand, it typically
    requires sampling at a higher-than-Nyquist rate in order to induce cyclostationarity,
    and generally takes a long sensing time to acquire reliable cyclic statistics
    [7], [8]. Due to the high sampling rate requirements and the limited dynamic range
    of wideband receivers, these techniques are typically carried out on a channel-by-channel
    basis over small bandwidth, in combination with a frequency shifter that scans
    one channel at a time over a wide band, or using a parallel set of multiple narrowband
    processors. However, for fast and reliable adaptation to highly dynamic wideband
    fading channels, it is desired to perform wideband spectrum sensing that simultaneously
    detects all signal sources over a wide band of interest. This paper aims to develop
    robust wideband spectrum detection techniques that are efficient in computation
    and feasible in hardware implementation. The spectrum pool under monitoring is
    very wide, say, from 300 MHz to several GHz, which is known to have low instantaneous
    utilization according to extensive spectrum occupancy measurements [18]. In this
    work, the cyclic feature detection principle is adopted in the wideband regime
    to simultaneously recover the entire spectrum with robustness against noisy uncertainty
    and low SNR conditions, and the unique sparsity property of the 2-D cyclic spectrum
    of communication signals is exploited to alleviate the sampling rate requirements
    with robustness to rate reduction. The key technical innovation is the development
    of new compressive sampling and sparse signal recovery techniques that directly
    recover the desired cyclic statistics instead of the (random) signal waveforms,
    which not only solve the main hindrance of wideband cyclic feature detection in
    terms of high sampling rate requirements but also alleviates the long sensing
    time compared with traditional techniques. It has been recognized that a signal
    which is sparse in a certain domain can be recovered using computationally feasible
    algorithms from a reduced number of samples [19], [20]. Such samples can be collected
    effectively via random linear projections [19]–[24]. Interestingly, the use of
    compressive random samplers can potentially enhance the dynamic range of wideband
    systems as well [25]. For a CR user, the wide band of interest typically possesses
    sparse features in the frequency domain, due to spectrum under-utilization of
    legacy radio systems. Accordingly, compressive sampling techniques have been developed
    for wideband sensing in CR networks [26]–[30], which effectively reconstruct the
    sparse frequency spectrum from sub-Nyquist-rate samples. Afterward, spectrum occupancy
    is estimated based on the recovered frequency or power spectrum, which are still
    prone to estimation errors caused by noise variations. In this work, our main
    contribution is to reconstruct the 2-D cyclic spectrum of a sparse signal directly
    from sub-Nyquist-rate compressive samples, without having to recover the signal
    itself or its frequency response. In doing so, an additional dimension of sparsity
    arises owing to the modulation-dependent structure in cyclic-frequency domain,
    in addition to sparsity in frequency domain. Exploitation of the sparsity structure
    in the added cyclic domain not only offers robust measures against time-varying
    yet non-cyclic noise and interference, but also makes it possible to further reduce
    the sampling rate while still reliably recovering the desired statistics for sensing.
    This work exploits the signal sparsity in both dimensions to extract second-order
    statistics of random processes, which departs from existing compressed sensing
    techniques for recovering one-dimensional deterministic signals. It is worth emphasizing
    that this conceptual departure constitutes a major challenge in utilizing existing
    sparse signal recovery techniques for linear samplers, because the compressive
    samples collected in the time domain do not have a direct linear relationship
    with the 2-D sparse cyclic spectrum to be recovered. To circumvent this difficulty,
    this paper derives a transformed linear system that connects the time-varying
    cross-correlations of compressive measurements to the desired cyclic statistics.
    This key reformulation allows the 2-D cyclic spectrum to be feasibly solved via
    convex ℓ 1 -norm minimization. The proposed compressive cyclic spectrum estimator
    can simultaneously capture multiple communication signals over a very wide band,
    and meanwhile remove non-cyclic noise and interference. As a special case, the
    developed compressive estimator is also instantiated to reconstruct the power
    spectral density (PSD) of stationary signals, which has a reduced dimension from
    the 2-D cyclic spectrum. Similar to [31], [32], because all the time-varying cross-correlation
    terms of compressive samples are utilized to recover a stationary power spectrum,
    the developed PSD estimator permits compressive sampling with considerable sampling-rate
    reduction, even for non-sparse signals. This paper also contributes to estimating
    the spectrum occupancy of wideband signals from the cyclic spectrum. On a single
    channel, binary signal detection based on the cyclic spectrum has been extensively
    studied. Subject to unknown noise levels, a family of cyclic feature detectors
    have been developed and compared based on various design principles [6], [7].
    The maximum-SNR single cycle detector has been described in [7]. However, the
    goal here is to use the cyclic spectrum for simultaneous estimation of the spectrum
    occupancy of multiple signals spreading on a wide band, which is motivated by
    the sensing needs of wideband CR networks but has not been investigated by traditional
    techniques. This paper extends the traditional single-channel setting to perform
    cyclic feature based spectrum occupancy estimation when multiple signal sources
    are present over a wide band. A band-by-band detection approach is proposed, where
    a multi-cycle generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is used on each channel
    to detect PU presence [11]. To obtain the noise statistics used in the GLRT detector,
    a blind estimator is derived to estimate the noise variance from the available
    compressive samples. Further, when the modulation type of the signals of interest
    is known, simple and fast techniques can be developed to detect the signal presence
    and estimate their cyclic features that reveal their carrier frequencies and transmission
    rates. Such a technique is illustrated for BPSK signals. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section II provides the problem statement and signal
    model. Section III describes the sparsity structure of the two-dimensional cyclic
    spectrum, the relationship between the sub-Nyquist-rate samples and the cyclic
    spectrum, the optimization formulation for recovering the sparse 2-D cyclic spectrum,
    as well as the practical implementations with robustness to finite sample effects.
    Section IV presents a compressive PSD estimator for stationary signals as a special
    case, and illustrates the mechanism of rate compression for non-sparse signals.
    Section V develops spectrum occupancy estimators based on the recovered cyclic
    spectrum. Corroborating simulation results are provided in Section VI, followed
    by a concluding summary in Section VII. SECTION II. Signal Model and Problem Statement
    Consider a wide band of interest in the frequency range [− f max , f max ] , where
    f max is very large, e.g., over-GHz. There are I active PU signals emitting over
    this wide band, where the i th signal is denoted by x i (t), i∈{1,2,…,I} . We
    have no information regarding the waveform, bandwidth and carrier frequency of
    each signal, nor the number of signals present. A CR is equipped with an (ideal)
    wideband antenna that passes all signal components within [− f max , f max ] .
    Hence, the received signal is given by x(t)= ∑ i=1 I x i (t)+w(t) (1) View Source
    where w(t) is the additive ambient noise. We suppose that primary user signals
    x i (t) are non-overlapping in frequency, since they could represent emitters
    from different services. As indicated by extensive spectrum occupancy measurements
    [1], [18], a good portion of the frequency range is idle due to spectrum under-utilization,
    suggesting that the frequency spectrum of x(t) is sparse. Our goal is to estimate
    the spectrum occupancy of the composite signal x(t) over the entire wide band,
    whose nonzero support regions reveal the frequency locations and bandwidths of
    individual signal components x i (t) . This is different from most existing work
    on cyclostationary signal processing, in which only one signal or signal mixture
    occupies the frequency band of interest. We are motivated to investigate the cyclic
    spectrum S(α,f) of x(t) , where f is the frequency and α is the cyclic frequency.
    Defining the cyclic autocorrelation function R x (α,τ)=∫x(t+τ/2) x ∗ (t−τ/2) e
    −j2παt dt , the cyclic spectrum, also termed the spectral correlation function
    (SCF), is the Fourier transform of R x (α,τ) with respect to the time-delay τ
    [7]: S x (α,f)=∫ R x (α,τ) e −j2πfτ dτ. View Source It essentially indicates the
    correlation of spectral components that are separated by α in frequency, and exhibits
    nonzero values only at a discrete set of cyclic frequencies α that reveals the
    inherent second-order periodicity of x(t) . It is known that S(α,f) can be nonzero
    only for |f|+|α|/2≤ f max [7], which suggests a diamond-shaped region around the
    origin of the bifrequency plane, as shown in Fig. 1(a). In a traditional analog-to-digital
    conversion (ADC) process, x(t) is sampled uniformly every T s =1/ f s seconds
    to yield digital samples x[n]=x(n T s ) , where f s is the sampling rate in Hz.
    The cyclic spectrum of the digital samples contains folded replicas of the original
    cyclic spectrum, with folding intervals being integer multiples of f s on both
    (α,f) directions [[7], Eq. (62)]. To avoid any aliasing in the cyclic spectrum,
    the minimum sampling rate should be 2 f max [6], that is, f s = 1 T s ≥2 f max
    . (2) View Source Because f max is very large in our CR sensing task, the required
    sampling rate f s has to be very high, causing large energy consumption and high
    hardware costs in ADC. On the other hand, we observe that the cyclic spectrum
    of the signal is in fact sparse, which motivates us to utilize the compressive
    sampling (CS) approach to reduce the sampling rate. In addition to the sparsity
    in frequency due to spectrum under-utilization, the signal x(t) is also sparse
    in cyclic frequency since some of the cyclic frequencies may not be occupied by
    any active signals. We refer x(t) as a sparse signal by focusing on its sparse
    cyclic spectrum. Fig. 1. Original cyclic spectrum S(α,f) can be obtained by wrapping
    the recovered cyclic frequency values in S (c) x ( f s =2 f max ) . (a) Original
    cyclic spectrum S(α,f) of the analog signal x(t) . (b) The folded cyclic spectrum
    { s (c) x (a,b) } N−1 a,b=0 of digital samples x t , shown within 0≤α,f≤ f s .
    Show All In the CS framework, x(t) is not directly sampled, but is passed through
    a set of properly designed analog filters { a m (t) } m and then down-sampled
    at a reduced rate f s,c =1/ T s,c ≤ f s , yielding compressive samples z[m]= a
    m (t)⋆x(t) | t=m T s,c ( ⋆ denotes convolution). In the discrete-time domain,
    we can stack M successive samples z[m] into z t =[z[0],…,z[M−1] ] T , which spans
    a sensing time block of T B seconds with T B = T s,c M . Within this block, a
    traditional uniform-rate ADC would yield N samples x t =[x[0],…,x[N−1] ] T , where
    N= T B / T s is larger than M . Hence, the sampling rate of the CS receiver is
    f s,c =(M/N) f s , where M/N∈(0,1] is the rate-compression ratio. This linear
    compressive sampling process can be described as z t =A x t (3) View Source where
    the rows of the sampling matrix A∈ R M×N are given by the digital representations
    of the sampling filters { a m (t) } m , respectively. Advances in CS assert that
    x(t) , or equivalently x t , can be recovered error-free with high probability
    from z t even when f s,c is lower than the Nyquist rate, as long as A satisfy
    certain restricted isometric property [19], [20]. The minimal number of samples
    needed (hence the sampling rate f s,c ) is determined by both A and the sparsity
    order of the signal of interest. Examples of { a m (t) } m include the parallel
    compressive samplers in [22]–[24] that can implement various forms of random matrices
    A such as Gaussian, Fourier and Bernoulli matrices, and the serial analog-to-information
    converter (AIC) in [21]. In this paper, we first reconstruct the 2-D cyclic spectrum
    S(α,f) for |f|+|α|/2≤ f max , directly from the compressive measurements z t .
    Then, based on the recovered cyclic spectrum, we extract useful features to estimate
    the spectrum occupancy of the wide band of interest. In contrast, a conventional
    CS approach may have to use a two-step approach to cyclic spectrum estimation:
    it first estimates x t from z t by recovering the sparse frequency response of
    x t , and then compute the cyclic spectrum from the estimated x t . In that case,
    the sparsity property in cyclic spectrum cannot be utilized, and both the computational
    costs and the required minimal sampling rate are high. Comparison will be detailed
    later on in Section VI-B. It suffices to remark here that the cyclic spectrum
    as signal statistics has less degrees of freedom than the random signal itself,
    and hence allows for faster recovery at lower sampling costs. SECTION III. Recovery
    of Sparse Cyclic Spectrum Consider a real-valued communication signal x(t) for
    clear exposition, while the complex-valued case can be derived accordingly. The
    corresponding digital sequence x t is zero-mean cyclostationary, which means that
    its time-varying covariance function, defined as r x (n,ν)=E{x(n T s ) x ∗ (n
    T s +ν T s )}=E{x[n] x ∗ [n+ν]} , is periodic in n with some integer P as the
    cyclic period ( E{⋅} denotes expectation). That is, r x (n,ν)= r x (n+kP,ν), ∀n,k,ν
    being integers. The cyclic period reveals the hidden periodicity in the signal,
    such as carrier frequency, symbol rate, chip rate, etc. [6]. It is assumed that
    the digital cyclic periods of all the signal components of x(t) belong to a permissible
    set P:{N/a } N−1 a=1 , corresponding to actual cyclic frequencies {(a/N) f s }
    N−1 a=1 . That is, for any component x i (t) whose cyclic spectrum can be sensed
    from x t , there exists an integer P i =N/a for some positive integer a such that
    r x i (n,ν)= r x i (n+ P i ,ν) . For other signal components whose cyclic periods
    do not fall within this permissible set P , it is still possible to reconstruct
    its cyclic spectrum via some interpolation formula deduced from Nyquist sampling
    theorem, which will not be derived in this paper. Let (a,b) denote the digital
    counterpart of the actual bi-frequency pair (α,f) , with α=(a/N) f s and f=(b/N)
    f s , respectively. The cyclic covariance function of x(t) is given by the Fourier
    series of r x (n,ν) with respect to time n . Since x t has a finite length N ,
    its cyclic covariance function can be estimated as r ~ (c) x (a,ν)={ 1 N ∑ n=0
    N−1−ν r x (n,ν) e −j 2π N an } e −j π N aν (4) View Source where a∈[0,N−1] is
    the digital cyclic frequency, and the adjustment term e −jπaν/N makes the sequence
    symmetric with respect to a . This is a biased estimate, but its estimation variance
    is smaller than that of an unbiased one [8]. The cyclic spectrum is the Fourier
    transform of the cyclic covariance with respect to time-lag ν , given by s (c)
    x (a,b)= ∑ ν=0 N−1 r ~ (c) x (a,ν) e −j 2π N bν (5) View Source where b∈[0,N−1]
    is the digital frequency. The sparsity order of x(t) is given by that of its cyclic
    spectrum s (c) x (a,b) , which is the fraction of nonzero points on the 2-D cyclic
    spectrum. We assume that some loose upper bound of the sparsity order is known
    a priori in order to choose an appropriate compression ratio. Let us represent
    the 2-D quantities { r ~ (c) x (a,ν) } N−1 a,ν=0 and { s (c) x (a,b) } N−1 a,b=0
    as matrices R ~ (c) x and S (c) x , respectively, each of size N×N . Meanwhile,
    { r x (n,ν) } N−1 n,ν=0 is represented by the time-varying covariance matrix R
    x =E{ x t x T t } , whose elements are shown in (38) in Appendix A. The support
    region of the 2-D cyclic spectrum S (c) x is shown in Fig. 1(b), which corresponds
    to the folded cyclic spectrum within the square region α,f∈[0, f s ] . Once S
    (c) x is acquired, it can be wrapped into the original cyclic spectrum S(α,f)
    in the diamond-shaped region of Fig. 1(a), by properly mapping the three subregions
    marked by I, II, and III. The problem of cyclic spectrum recovery amounts to estimating
    S (c) x :{ s (c) x (a,b) } N−1 a,b=0 from compressive samples z t . A. Linear
    Relationships Reconstruction of the cyclic spectrum can benefit from some explicit
    linear relationships among second-order statistics. In this subsection, we first
    derive a linear relationship between the unknown s (c) x (a,b) of interest in
    (5) and r x (n,ν) in (4). Then, because both x t [n] and r x (n,ν) are not available,
    we express r x (n,ν) as a linear function of r z (m,μ)=E{ z t [m] z ∗ t [m+μ]}
    , which is the time-varying data covariance of the compressive samples z t . Finally,
    a linear relationship between s (c) x (a,b) and r z (m,μ) is established, which
    simplifies the reconstruction process as sparse linear regression, as shown in
    the next subsection. 1. Relating s (c) x (a,b) to r x (n,ν) When x[n] is real-valued,
    it holds that r x (n,ν)= r x (n+ν,−ν)=E{x(n)x(n+ν)} , and hence R x = R T x is
    symmetric positive semi-definite. For n,ν∈[0,N−1] , there are only N(N+1)/2 unique
    terms of r x (n,ν) satisfying n+ν<N , which represent the degrees of freedom for
    the second-statistics of x[n] . We organize them into a vector r x of length N(N+1)/2
    , as follows: r x =[ r x (0,0), r x (1,0),…, r x (N−1,0) r x (0,1), r x (1,1),…,
    r x (N−2,1) ……, r x (0,N−1) ] T . (6) View Source To facilitate the representation
    of (4) using r x , we form an auxiliary covariance-related matrix R : R= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢
    ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ r x (0,0) r x (1,0) r x (2,0) ⋮ r x (N−1,0) r x (0,1) r x (1,1) r
    x (2,1) ⋮ 0 r x (0,2) r x (1,2) r x (2,2) ⋮ 0 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ r x (0,N−1) 0 0 ⋮ 0 ⎤ ⎦
    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ . (7) View Source which contain the same N(N+1)/2 elements of r
    x besides zeros. After some algebraic operations, it can be shown that vec{R}=B
    r x (8) View Source where vec{⋅} stacks all columns of a matrix into a vector,
    and B∈{0,1 } N 2 ×(N(N+1)/2) maps the entries of r x to those in vec{R} . Specifically,
    B is constructed by retaining N(N+1)/2 columns of the N 2 × N 2 identity matrix,
    for any column index q=νN+n satisfying 0≤n+ν<N, ∀n,ν∈[0,N−1] , or equivalently
    satisfying 0≤⌊q/N⌋+(q−⌊q/N⌋N)<N . Following (4) and (5), the cyclic covariance
    matrix R ~ (c) x and the cyclic spectrum matrix S (c) x are related to R through
    Fourier series transformations, as follows: R ~ (c) x S (c) x = ∑ ν=0 N−1 G ν
    R D ν = R ~ (c) x F (9) (10) View Source where F=[ e −j2πνb/N ] (ν,b) is the N
    -point DFT matrix, G ν =[(1/N) e −j2πa(n+ν/2)/N ] (a,n) ∈ C N×N , and D ν is an
    N×N matrix with only its (ν,ν) th diagonal element being 1 and all other elements
    being 0. From (8) and (9), and using the property vec{UXV}=( V T ⊗U)vec{X} ( ⊗
    denotes Kronecker product), we can vectorize R ~ (c) x and express it in a linear
    form of r x as vec{ R ~ (c) x }= ∑ ν=0 N−1 ( D T ν ⊗ G ν )vec{R}=H r x (11) View
    Source where H= ∑ N−1 ν=0 ( D T ν ⊗ G ν )B is of size N 2 ×(N(N+1)/2) . Meanwhile,
    we can also express vec{ R ~ (c) x } in terms of s (c) x =vec{ S (c) x } from
    (10), as follows: vec{ R ~ (c) x } =vec{ S (c) x F −1 }=( F −T ⊗ I N )vec{ S (c)
    x } =W s (c) x (12) View Source where W=( F −T ⊗ I N ) and I N is the size- N
    identity matrix. From (11) and (12), it holds that r x = H † W s (c) x (13) View
    Source where H † is the (pseudo) inverse of H . 2. Relating r z (m,μ) to r x (n,ν)
    and s (c) x (a,b) Next, we aim to relate the unknown s (c) x with the data vector
    z t by deriving the relationship between r x and the time-varying data covariance
    matrix R z =E{ z t z T t }∈ R M×M . Since R z is symmetric, its elements can be
    represented by the following vector of length M(M+1)/2 : r z =[ r z (0,0), r z
    (1,0),…, r z (M−1,0) r z (0,1), r z (1,1),…, r z (M−2,1) ……, r z (0,M−1) ] T .
    (14) View Source It holds evidently from (3) that R z =A R x A H . Meanwhile,
    R x and R z are linearly related to their vectorized counterparts r x and r z
    as follows: vec{ R x }= P N r x , r z = Q M vec{ R z } (15) View Source where
    P N ∈{0,1 } N 2 ×(N(N+1)/2) and Q M ∈{0,1/2,1 } (M(M+1)/2)× M 2 are some specific
    mapping matrices derived in Appendix A. Accordingly, it can be shown that r z
    = Q M vec{A R x A H } = Q M (A⊗A)vec{ R x }=Φ r x (16) View Source where Φ= Q
    M (A⊗A) P N is of size (M(M+1)/2)×(N(N+1)/2) . Finally, using (13) and (16), we
    can express the measurement vector r z as a linear function of the vector-form
    cyclic spectrum s (c) x as r z =Φ H † W s (c) x =Ψ s (c) x (17) View Source where
    Ψ=Φ H † W is of size (M(M+1)/2)× N 2 . 3. Further Simplifications Since S (c)
    x is conjugate symmetric about the origin for real-valued signals, all its useful
    information is contained in the subregion I of the cyclic spectrum plots in Fig.
    1; as a result only the shaded region in Fig. 1(b) needs to be recovered in order
    to reconstruct the original complex-valued cyclic spectrum of real-valued signals.
    Let S (c) xs denote the cyclic spectrum matrix for the shaded region, which is
    of size N×(⌊N/2⌋+1) ( ⌊⋅⌋ denotes floor operation). It is straightforward to show
    that S (c) x is related to S (c) xs as S (c) x = S (c) xs D (18) View Source where
    D=[ I ⌊N/2⌋ ⋮ I ~ ], I ⌊N/2⌋+1 is an identity matrix of size (⌊N/2⌋+1) and I ~
    of size (⌊N/2⌋+1)×(⌊N/2⌋−1) is formed by removing the first and last columns of
    an (⌊N/2⌋+1) reverse identity matrix. Vectorizing on both sides yield s (c) x
    =( D T ⊗ I N )vec{ S (c) xs }=K s (c) xs (19) View Source where K=( D T ⊗ I N
    ) and s (c) xs =vec{ S (c) xs } is of size N(⌊N/2⌋+1) . Plugging (19) into (17),
    we obtain the equivalent expression for the real-valued case: r z =Ψ s (c) x =
    Ψ s s (c) xs (20) View Source where Ψ s = Q M Φ H † WK is of size (M(M+1)/2)×(N(N+2)/2)
    . Here, the number of complex-valued unknowns in (20) has been reduced to N(N+2)/2
    . The estimate s ^ (c) xs can be acquired from the inverse problem of (20). Afterward,
    s ^ (c) x =K s ^ (c) xs can be found based on (19). B. Reconstruction Formulation
    Given the available data covariance vector r z , the cyclic spectrum recovery
    problem boils down to solving s (c) x from (17), which is an under-determined
    linear system. To accurately solve this problem, we make use of the prior knowledge
    about wideband communication signals. We observe that the 2-D cyclic spectrum
    is highly sparse, which can be incorporated into the spectrum estimator by penalizing
    the ℓ 1 -norm of the cyclic spectrum vector s (c) x to induce a sparse solution.
    Hence, we formulate an unconstrained ℓ 1 -norm regularized least squares (LR-LS)
    problem for reconstructing s (c) x , as follows: min s (c) x  ∥ ∥ r z −Ψ s (c)
    x ∥ ∥ 2 2 +λ ∥ ∥ s (c) x ∥ ∥ 1 . (21) View Source In (21), λ>0 is a weighting
    scalar that balances between the sparsity of the solution induced by the ℓ 1 -norm
    term and the data reconstruction error reflected by the ℓ 2 -norm LS term. The
    optimization formulation in (21) is attractive since it addresses the sparsity
    of the cyclic spectrum and is a convex problem, which can be solved by convex
    solvers such as cvx to efficiently reach the global optimum [34]. C. Implementation
    In practical implementations with finite data samples, the data vector r z in
    (21) is replaced by its finite-sample estimate r ^ z . Specifically, the steps
    for sparse cyclic spectrum recovery are as follows: Observe the received analog
    signal x(t) for a total time of T , which is chosen according to the desired sensing
    time and the time needed to produce reliable statistics. Divide the total time
    into L blocks, each of time-block length T B =T/L . Within each block l , the
    same random sampler A (e.g., the AIC [21]) is used to obtain a compressive sample
    vector z t (l) directly from x(t) at a reduced rate of f s,c =M/ T B =(M/N) f
    s , where f s =1/ T s ≥2 f max and N= T B / T s , with a compression ratio M/N<1
    . Estimate the covariance matrix R z of the compressive samples by the finite-sample
    average across all blocks as R ^ z =(1/L) ∑ L−1 l=0 z t (l) z H t (l) , and form
    r ^ z = Q M vec{ R ^ z } . Replace r z with r ^ z , and solve (21) to recover
    s ^ (c) x . The choice of L reflects the design tradeoff, via L=T f s /N for given
    T and f s . As L increases, the estimation variance of r ^ z is reduced and the
    finite-sample effect is alleviated, but the frequency resolution of the recovered
    s (c) x suffers, because the resolution increases linearly in N . SECTION IV.
    Recovery of Power Spectrum for Stationary Signals Besides cyclic spectrum estimation,
    the developed formulations can be used to efficiently estimate the power spectrum
    (aka PSD) in the frequency domain, which is a special case of the 2-D cyclic spectrum
    when the signal x(t) is (treated as) stationary. Power spectrum estimation is
    useful in many well-known spectral estimators, such as energy detectors. When
    x(t) is stationary, the covariance function r x (n,ν) becomes time invariant,

    of the stationarity property in (22), the time-varying covariance matrix R x in

    vec{ R ¯ x } can be represented linearly by r ¯ x through a binary-valued mapping
    matrix P ¯ N ∈{0,1 } N 2 ×N as follows: vec{ R ¯ x }= P ¯ N r ¯ x (27) View Source
    where P ¯ N can be deduced from (26) as: for any column ν∈[1,N−1] , there are
    2(N−ν) elements of 1''s at row indices ((n−ν)N+n) and (nN+n−ν), n=ν,…,N−1 , while
    all the rest elements are zero; for the column ν=0 , there are N elements of 1''s
    at row indices (nN+n),∀n∈[0,N−1] , while the rest elements on this column are
    zero. Although x(t) is stationary, z t is not, because each element z[m] is generated
    by filtering x(t) with an individual filter a m (t) indicated by the corresponding
    row of A , and { a m (t) } m are mutually incoherent as explained for (3). Therefore,
    there are still M(M+1)/2 degree of freedom in R z , represented by r z = Q M vec{
    R z } as in (15). It follows from (16) and (27) that r z = Q M (A⊗A)vec{ R ¯ x
    }= Φ ¯ r ¯ x (28) View Source where Φ ¯ = Q M (A⊗A) P ¯ N is of size (M(M+1)/2×N

    View Source where Ψ ¯ = Φ ¯ F −1 is of size (M(M+1)/2)×N . In (29), there are
    M(M+1)/2 linear equations and N unknowns. When M(M+1)/2>N , this is an over-determined
    system that can be solved using simple least squares. This is a revealing observation,
    suggesting that sub-Nyquist-rate sampling with M/N<1 can be employed to permit
    a unique least squares solution to the PSD vector s ¯ x , even when s ¯ x is non-sparse.
    Strongest compression (M/N ) min is attained when M(M+1)/2=N , which suggests
    ( M N ) min = 8N+1 − − − − − − √ −1 2N ⟶ N→∞ 2 N − − − √ . (30) View Source This
    result owes to the use of all cross-correlations of the compressive samples in
    recovering the second-order statistics, which is also exploited in [31], [32].
    With (29), the PSD can be estimated as s ¯ ^ x =arg min s ¯ x  ∥ r z − Ψ ¯ s ¯
    x ∥ 2 2 +λ∥ s ¯ x ∥ 1 . (31) View Source By setting λ=0 , (31) reduces to a sparsity-agnostic
    LS estimator that can be used when the PSD is non-sparse and M/N≥(M/N ) min ;
    on the other hand, adopting λ>0 results in a sparsity-aware LR-LS estimator useful
    when the PSD is sparse, as in CR sensing applications. B. Sampler Design and Minimal
    Sampling Rates It is of interest to investigate the issues of sampler design and
    minimal sampling rates when (31) is employed for power spectrum estimation. First,
    we address a special case when the unknown PSD is non-sparse and a special form
    of nonuniform random ADCs is employed [22]. The sampling matrix A∈{0,1 } M×N has
    a single nonzero element of one in each row while all other elements are zero
    [22], which is essentially an M×N matrix constructed by randomly selecting M rows
    out of the N×N identity matrix. The sampler design problem boils down to the row
    selection problem. When the pair-wise differences of the selected row-indices
    span over all the possible time-lags ν=0,…,N−1 , the resulting sampler ensures
    that all elements of r ¯ x (ν) be captured by the cross-correlation terms of the
    compressive samples, and hence A is invertible. Similar to [32], we deduce that
    solutions to the minimal length- (N−1) sparse ruler problem yield the desired
    row selections. The minimal sparse ruler problem has been studied in the literature,
    see, e.g., [33], and has been used to design minimal redundant linear arrays [36].
    Many exact and approximate solutions for this problem have been precalculated
    and tabulated. Some examples of the minimal sparse rulers are shown in [32] for
    various values of N . The examples in [32] indicate that the minimal compression
    ratio (M/N ) min can be lower than 50% for N≥10 , and goes to below 25% for N≥50
    , while ensuring lossless reconstruction of any non-sparse PSD with limited bandwidth
    |f|≤ f max ≤ f s /2 . Since the aforementioned sparse sampling matrices are degenerated
    versions of full (random) matrices, we conjecture that the compression ratio can
    be made even lower when full random matrices are utilized. Further, when the PSD
    is sparse and the sparsity-aware formulation in (31) is used, the inverse problem
    of (29) can be solved with high probability even when it is an under-determined
    system, which means that the compression ratio can be made even lower than that
    in (30) or that given by the minimal sparse ruler problem for non-sparse signals.
    SECTION V. Cyclic-Based Spectrum Occupancy Estimation After recovering the sparse
    2-D cyclic spectrum S(α,f) in its vectorized form s ^ (c) x , we now want to simultaneously
    estimate the spectrum occupancy of all frequency sub-bands within the monitored
    wide band. We develop two spectrum detection algorithms: one adopts a band-by-band
    multi-cycle generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) framework that works for
    all types of modulation and waveform patterns, and the other is tailored to known
    modulation types for simple and fast estimation, for which we take BPSK signals
    as an example. A. Band-by-Band Approach Based on Multi-Cycle GLRT The goal of
    spectrum occupancy estimation is to decide whether a specific frequency location
    f (n) is occupied or not. We set f (n) =(n/N) f s , ∀n∈[0,N/2] , according to
    the frequency resolution of the discrete cyclic spectrum s (c) x (a,b) in (5).
    The sensing task amounts to a band-by-band inspection of the spectrum occupancy
    over the entire frequency range |f|≤ f s /2 , with f s /2≥ f max . It is important
    to note that such a band-by-band inspection is a computational approach for processing
    the data collected simultaneously from a wideband antenna, which is fundamentally
    different from a narrowband approach in which narrowband antennas scan the wide
    spectrum one by one along with frequency shifters and narrowband filters/processors.
    We now focus on the occupancy decision on a single band f (n) . An active signal
    on this band would occupy a region I (n) of the 2-D cyclic spectrum map defined
    by the cyclic-frequency and frequency pairs (α,f) satisfying [7]: f+ α 2 = f (n)  and
    |f|+ |α| 2 ≤ f max ,∀(α,f)∈ I (n) . (32) View Source In the discrete-time domain,
    this region is represented by discrete points ( α i , f i )∈ I (n) , which correspond
    to a set of integer-valued indices ( a i , b i ) , that is, S( α i , f i )= s
    (c) x ( a i , b i ), ∀i∈ I (n) d . Because α i =( a i /N) f s and f i =( b i /N)
    f s by definition, the index set I (n) d can be deduced from (32) as b i + a i
    2 =n, and | b i |+ | a i | 2 ≤ f max N f s ≤ N 2 , ∀i∈ I (n) d . (33) View Source
    We stack the estimated { s ^ (c) x ( a i , b i ) } i∈ I (n) d into a vector c
    ^ (n) of length | I (n) d | , which is formed by selected entries of the vectorized
    cyclic spectrum s ^ (c) x in (21), that is, c ^ (n) [i]= s ^ (c) x ( a i , b i
    ), ∀i∈ I (n) d . This row selection operation can be expressed as c ^ (n) = J
    n s ^ (c) x (34) View Source where the binary-valued selection matrix J n ∈{0,1
    } | I (n) d |× N 2 is obtained from the N 2 × N 2 identity matrix by retaining
    its rows with indices ∀i∈ I (n) d only. Apparently, J T n J n = I | I (n) d |
    . To test for the presence of a PU signal at the frequency f (n) , the following
    binary hypothesis test is formulated: H 1 c ^ (n) H 0 c ^ (n) = c (n) +ϵ =ϵ (35)
    View Source where c (n) is the nonrandom true vector of cyclic spectrum values,
    and ϵ is asymptotically Gaussian distributed, i.e., lim LN→∞ LN − − − √ ϵ∼N(0,
    Σ (n) ) , where Σ (n) is the asymptotic covariance matrix. Because Σ (n) is not
    readily available, we derive a blind estimator for Σ ^ (n) using the available
    reduced-rate measurements { z t (l) } L l=0 , shown in Appendix B. Replacing Σ
    (n) by Σ ^ (n) results in a data-adaptive GLRT detector. Treating c (n) as an
    unknown nuisance parameter, the adaptive GLRT can be derived for (35), which yields
    the following test statistic: T (n) = ( c ^ (n) ) H ( Σ ^ (n) ) −1 c ^ (n) . (36)
    View Source Using the noise statistics derived in Appendix B, (36) is the optimal
    detector in the presence of colored Gaussian noise [35]. Specifically, T (n) is
    compared with a threshold η (n) to make decisions on the occupancy at frequency
    f (n) , where η (n) is chosen to comply with the allowable false alarm rate [35].
    The detection performance is not sensitive to the threshold, because the sparsity-enforcing
    ℓ 1 -norm operation has shrank small values of c (n) to be near zero and much
    separable from true signals [19]. This is a multi-cycle GRLT, because c ^ (n)
    contains multiple cyclic frequencies α i for i\in {\cal I}_d^{(n)} . When the
    test is done for all f^{(n)} , we will have identified not only the carrier frequency
    but also the bandwidth of each occupied frequency band. Putting together all the
    occupied bands, we are able to depict the spectrum occupancy over the entire wide
    band. Overall, the proposed spectrum occupancy estimation algorithm is implemented
    by the following steps: Set n=0 . Form the cyclic spectrum matrix \mathhat{{\bf
    S}}_{x}^{c} from \mathhat{{\bf s}}_{x}^{c} ={\rm vec}\{\mathhat{{\bf S}}_x^{(c)}\}
    . Let f^{(n)}=({n}/{N})f_s . Find the cyclic spectrum values of interest from
    (32), and calculate \mathhat{{\bf c}}^{(n)} from (34). Calculate the test statistic
    in (36) using \mathhat{{\bf \Sigma}}^{(n)} calculated from (45) and (47). If it
    is larger than a predetermined threshold \eta^{(n)} , then a PU is declared present
    at frequency f^{(n)} , otherwise PU absence is declared. If n < {N}/{2} , increase
    n by 1 and go to Step 2). B. Fast Algorithm for Known Modulation Types When the
    modulation type of the signal sources are known, their cyclic features on the
    bi-frequency plane can be utilized to quickly identify the key signal paprameters.
    For example, consider that x(t) consists of multiple BPSK signals, each with carrier
    frequency f_{c} , symbol rate {1}/{T_0} and a full-width rectangular pulse shaper.
    The number of signal components and their modulation parameters are unknown, but
    the modulation type is known. Ignoring the weak sidelobes in the frequency domain,
    the major cyclic feature is a main lobe at \alpha=2f_{c} , spanning over f=-{1}/{T_0}
    to f={1}/{T_0} (Fig. 14(a) in [7]). The nonzero region of support for such a signal
    is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Nonzero region of support for the cyclic spectrum
    of BPSK. Show All Our idea is to identify the modulation-dependent parameters
    T_0 and f_c by finding the lobe locations on the estimated 2-D cyclic spectrum.
    First, we can simply search over the cyclic frequency \alpha along the axis f=0
    . If \vert \mathhat{S}(\alpha,0) \vert > \gamma (\gamma is a preset threshold),
    then we claim that there is a BPSK signal with estimated carrier frequency \mathhat{f}_c
    = \alpha/2 . Next, we let {\cal A}=\{\alpha \vert \ \vert S(\alpha,0)\vert > \gamma\}
    . For each \mathtilde{\alpha} \in {\cal A} , we search along the line \alpha =
    \mathtilde{\alpha} to find the double-sided width of the lobe, denoted by 2w ,
    such that all the points in the lobe have absolute values equal to or greater
    than \gamma . The bandwidth of the corresponding BPSK signal is also 2w , and
    hence we can claim that the frequency band [\mathtilde{\alpha}/2-w,\mathtilde{\alpha}/2+w]
    is occupied, and the estimated symbol period is \mathhat{T}_0 = 1/w . By now,
    we have rapidly identified not only the carrier frequency f_c but also the bandwidth
    1/T_0 of a BPSK signal. The procedure is applicable to the entire wide band to
    identify all BPSK signals. Combining all the occupied frequency bands, we are
    able to draw the spectrum occupancy map. Extensions of the fast approach to other
    types of modulated signals are possible, using the features of the modulation
    types. For instance, for an SQPSK signal [7] with carrier frequency f_{c} and
    symbol rate {1}/{T} , two peaks with similar heights will appear at \alpha=2f_{c}-{1}/{T}
    and \alpha=2f_{c}+{1}/{T} , and this feature can be used for fast detection. SECTION
    VI. Simulations This section presents Monte Carlo simulation results that testify
    the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under sampling rate reduction and
    noise uncertainty. The frequency band under monitoring has f_{\max}= 500 MHz,
    in which two signal sources {\rm PU}_1 and {\rm PU}_2 appear at the center frequencies
    187.5 MHz and 375 MHz, respectively. Two setups are considered: 1) both {\rm PU}_1
    and {\rm PU}_2 are BPSK signals, 2) {\rm PU}_1 is BPSK and {\rm PU}_2 is QPSK.
    The symbol period for each source is fixed at T_0=0.1\ \mu s. The reference (Nyquist)
    sampling rate is f_{s}=1 GHz, and the non-compressed discrete-time representation
    {\bf x}_t is of length N=32 in each time block1. Although both setups 1) and 2)
    have the same nonzero spectral occupancy of 8%, their nonzero cyclic spectral
    occupancies are not the same, due to the different cyclic features of BPSK and
    QPSK signals. In fact, Setup 1) has a 0.75% cyclic spectral occupancy, and Setup
    2) has a cyclic spectral occupancy of 0.625%. These occupancy ratios also demonstrate
    that the 2-D cyclic spectrum is much more sparse than the power spectrum. A. Robustness
    to Rate Reduction A key parameter of interest is the compression ratio M/N for
    sampling rate reduction. Its impact on the error performance of the proposed cyclic
    spectrum estimation algorithm is tested on Setup 2) with a mixture of BPSK and
    QPSK signals, in a noise-free case. The performance metric is the normalized mean-square
    error (MSE) of the reconstructed cyclic spectrum \mathhat{{\bf s}}_x^{(c)} with
    respect to the uncompressed one {{\bf s}}_x^{(c)} , for a given compression ratio
    M/N . That is, {\rm MSE} = {\rm E}\{\Vert \mathhat{{\bf s}}_x^{(c)} - {\bf s}_x^{(c)}
    \Vert_2^2/\Vert {\bf s}_x^{(c)} \Vert_2^2\} . Similarly, the MSE performance for
    the proposed PSD reconstruction is also evaluated as: {\rm MSE} = {\rm E}\{\Vert
    \mathhat{\bar{{\bf s}}}_x - \bar{{\bf s}}_x \Vert_2^2/\Vert \bar{{\bf s}}_x \Vert_2^2
    \} , where \mathhat{\bar{{\bf s}}}_x represents the power spectrum reconstructed
    from compressive samples with compression ratio of M/N and \bar{{\bf s}}_x stands
    for the uncompressed one. Fig. 3 depicts the MSE versus the compression ratio
    M/N , for L=40, 200 and 400 data blocks. The MSE performance of the PSD reconstruction
    algorithm is also shown in the same figure for L=200 . The figure shows that the
    MSE curves start to flatten out when M/N\geq 0.3 , which is the rate-reduction
    region where the cyclic spectrum and PSD recovery algorithms are robust. The estimation
    performance for L=200 outperforms that of L=40 , because of more effective alleviation
    of the finite-sample effect. On the other hand, the estimation performance for
    L=400 is quite close to that for L=200 , indicating that the performance improvement
    offered by increasing L eventually saturates. This is because the finite sample
    effect has been adequately alleviated when L is large enough, such that the compression
    ratio has started to dominate the MSE performance. Fig. 3. Normalized MSE of reconstruction
    versus compression ratio M/N . Show All After cyclic spectrum recovery, the GLRT-based
    approach is utilized to estimate the frequency occupancy. Fig. 4 depicts the probability
    of detection P_d versus M/N , for a false alarm rate P_{\rm fa}=0.01 . The decision
    threshold \eta^{(n)} is set to satisfy the false alarm rate via simulations. It
    shows that the compression ratio can go as low as 0.25 while keeping P_d \geq
    0.9 . As a result, when the frequency occupancy is 8%, the sampling rate can be
    reduced by three-quarter, while still maintaining good estimation performance.
    When the frequency occupancy is more sparse, the effective sampling rate can be
    reduced even further. Fig. 4. Probability of detection P_d versus compression
    ratio M/N , for a fixed false alarm ratio of 0.01. Show All B. Robustness to Noise
    Uncertainty To testify the robustness of spectrum sensing under noise uncertainty,
    we compare the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the proposed compressive
    cyclic feature detector to that of an energy detector (ED). A traditional ED can
    be combined with existing compressive sampling techniques through a two-step procedure.
    First, the signal realization within each data block l is treated as a deterministic
    signal, and the frequency response {\bf x}_f(l)={\bf F}{\bf x}_{t}(l) is reconstructed
    from compressive samples {\bf z}_t(l) = {\bf A} {\bf x}_t(l) using the LR-LS formulation
    as \eqalignno{&\mathhat{{\bf x}}_{f}(l)= {\rm arg} \min_{{\bf x}_f(l)}\left \Vert
    {\bf z}_{t}(l) - {\bf A}{\bf F}^{-1}{\bf x}_{f}(l) \right \Vert_{2}^{2} + \lambda
    \left \Vert {\bf x}_{f}(l) \right \Vert_1.\cr &&\hbox{(37)} } View Source Then,
    the estimated \mathhat{{\bf x}}_{f}(l) over all L blocks are used to compute the
    power spectrum \bar{\bf s}_x as the sample average, as follows: \mathhat{\bar{{\bf
    s}}}_x ={1\over L}\sum_{l=1}^{L} {\rm diag}\left\{\mathhat{{\bf x}}_{f}(l) \mathhat{{\bf
    x}}_f^H(l)\right\} View Source where {\rm diag}\{\cdot\} returns the diagonal
    of a matrix. In energy detection, each element of \mathhat{\bar{{\bf s}}}_x serves
    as the energy-related test statistic for the signal component at the corresponding
    frequency band, which is passed through a decision threshold to detect the frequency
    occupancy band by band. Note that the existing compressive sampling solution in
    (37) is computationally expensive, because L inverse problems have to be solved
    before computing the sample average \mathhat{\bar{\bf s}}_x . In contrast, the
    proposed compressive PSD approach in Section IV only solves one inverse problem
    by directly extracting the signal statistics rather than the signal itself. Besides,
    (37) is inferior in terms of recovery performance, because it does not make use
    of the fact that the frequency responses across all blocks share the same nonzero
    support. During spectrum detection, the noise power level is varying and hardly
    known exactly, due to thermal noise change, amplifier gain change, calibration
    error, and fluctuating interference levels in CR networks. The lack of accurate
    knowledge of the noise variance is known as noise uncertainty [4]. In the simulations,
    the SNR is defined as the in-band signal to noise ratio of each signal source.
    We use a nominal SNR of -3 dB with noise uncertainty levels of \Delta = 0, 1,
    2 and 3 dB, which means that the actual SNR levels vary randomly between {\pm}
    \Delta of the nominal value. The impact of the noise uncertainty is assessed using
    the method of robust statistics [5]. In this method, the upper limit of the noise
    PSD level that corresponds to the lower limit of the SNR is used to calculate
    the probability of false alarm, whereas the lower limit of the noise PSD corresponding
    to the upper limit of the SNR is used to calculate the probability of detection.
    Such robust statistics assess the detection performance under worst case scenarios.
    A total of L=200 data blocks are used for noise averaging, and the number of compressive
    measurements in a block is M=16 , which corresponds to a compression ratio of
    0.5. Fig. 5 depicts the ROC of the proposed compressive cyclic feature detector
    and PSD detector, compared with ED. The figure shows that the proposed cyclic
    feature detector is quite insensitive to noise uncertainty, because the varying
    yet non-cyclic noise does not appear at \alpha \neq 0 . The ROC performance considerably
    outperforms that of energy detection, while the latter degrades noticeably as
    the noise uncertainty level increases. Fig. 5. ROC of the compressive cyclic feature
    approach (“Cyclo”), PSD approach (“PSD”) and energy detection (“ED”). Show All
    C. Comparison of Spectrum Occupancy Estimation Techniques Here the GLRT and the
    fast cyclic-based spectrum occupancy estimation techniques are compared, using
    Setup 1) where both PUs are BPSK signals. The test parameters are: the SNR is
    -5 dB without uncertainty, M=16 (i.e., M/N=50\hbox{\%} ) and L=200 . Fig. 6 shows
    the ROC curves for both algorithms. The figure shows that the GLRT approach provides
    slightly better performance. Considering that the GLRT approach applies to general
    modulation types, it is preferred whenever enough computational resources are
    available. Fig. 6. ROC performance of the two spectrum occupancy estimation approaches.
    Show All D. Influence of the Number of Blocks Used The total sensing time is an
    important parameter that determines network responsiveness and performance. When
    the block size N and the sampling rate f_s are fixed, the total sensing time depends
    on the number of blocks L . Increasing L means longer sensing time and shorter
    time for transmission, but it could also lead to improved sensing performance.
    For Setup 2), Fig. 7 shows the impact of L on sensing performance, for {\rm SNR}
    = -6 dB without noise uncertainty, and 50% rate compression with M=16 . It shows
    that L=200 has better performance than L=40 , but increasing L further to L=400
    does not offer much additional performance improvement. Similar to Fig. 3, this
    phenomenon of diminishing performance gain is because the finite sample effect
    has been adequately alleviated when L is large enough. Fig. 7. ROC of the proposed
    sensing method for different L values: M=16, N=32 . Show All SECTION VII. Conclusion
    This paper has proposed a new method for recovering the sparse 2-D cyclic spectrum
    from a reduced number of compressive samples. The vectorized cyclic spectrum is
    reformulated to take a linear relationship with the covariance function of the
    compressive samples, which is a key step in enabling effective recovery of the
    2-D cyclic spectrum via convex \ell_{1} -norm minimization. As a special case
    of the compressive cyclic spectrum estimator, a new power spectrum estimator for
    stationary signals is also developed, which allows sub-Nyquist rate sampling even
    for non-sparse signals. From the recovered cyclic spectrum, two techniques have
    been developed to estimate the spectrum occupancy of a wide band hosting an unknown
    number of active sources: a band-by-band multi-cycle GLRT detector, and a fast
    thresholding technique for signals with known modulation types such as BPSK signals.
    The proposed spectrum occupancy estimation techniques demonstrate salient robustness
    to sampling rate reduction and noise uncertainty. Appendix A Mapping Matrices

    Noise Covariance Estimation on Cyclic Spectrum This Appendix derives a non-data-aided
    estimator for the noise covariance matrix {\bf \Sigma}^{(n)} used in the cyclic

    samples can be estimated as \mathhat{{\bf r}}_{{z}}=({1}/{L})\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}\mathhat{{\bf
    r}}_{{z}}(l) . Each summand can be expressed as \mathhat{{\bf r}}_{{z}}(l) =\mathhat{{\bf

    for performance analysis. Alternatively, we relax the \ell_1 -norm term in (21)

    Abstract: Multiple access methods in a wireless network allow multiple nodes to
    share a set of available channels for data transmission. The nodes can either
    compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an
    individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical
    tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied
    to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access
    in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious
    behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms
    for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can
    provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based
    on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review
    of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete
    information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free
    and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider
    time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA),
    and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access
    (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in
    dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed. The major
    findings from the game models used for these different access schemes are highlighted.
    To this end, several of the key open research directions are outlined. Published

    theory is a branch of applied mathematics which is concerned with how rational
    entities make decisions in a situation of conflict. It provides a rich set of
    mathematical tools to model and analyze interactions among the rational entities,
    and the rationality is based on gains or payoff perceived by these entities. Game
    theory has been primarily used in Economics. It has also been used in other disciplines
    such as Biology, Political science, Engineering, and Philosophy. One of the major
    areas in Engineering where game theory has been used is data communication networking.
    In particular, it has been used to model and analyze routing and resource allocation
    problems in a competitive environment, and more recently to security problems
    in wireless networks. Applicability of game theory tools to analyze power control,
    waveform adaptation, medium access, routing, and node participation was discussed
    in [1] from a layered perspective. In a multi-user wireless communication network,
    the transmitting nodes share the limited radio resources (e.g., wireless channels
    and transmission power). Therefore, one critical issue is how the nodes share
    these resources to transmit data so that the optimal network performance can be
    achieved. Multiple access methods developed for wireless networks can be divided
    into two main groups, namely, contention-free channel access and contention-based
    random access methods. In a multiple access scheme, nodes can either cooperate
    or compete to achieve their objectives (e.g., optimal throughput and quality-of-service
    (QoS)). Consequently, game theory has become a very useful mathematical tool to
    model and analyze multiple access schemes in wireless networks, and to obtain
    solutions for resource allocation, channel assignment, power control, and cooperation
    enforcement among the nodes. The notion of multiple access game can be illustrated
    by the following example [2], [3]. Suppose that there are two mobile nodes t x
    1 and t x 2 who want to access a shared wireless channel to send information to
    the corresponding receivers rcv r 1 and rcv r 2 . Both the receivers are within
    the transmission range of both the transmitters. Each transmitter has one packet
    to transmit in each time step and it can either choose to transmit during a time
    step or wait. If t x 1 transmits, the packet is successfully transmitted if t
    x 2 chooses not to transmit during that time step (and hence there is no collision).
    For successful packet transmission, t x 1 obtains a benefit at the cost of transmit
    power. It is of interest to analyze the interactions between the transmitters
    under different network settings and performance objectives. Different game models
    (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information
    games) have been developed to study the behavior of transmitting nodes to access
    the wireless channel(s) and obtain the multiple access solution (or equilibrium)
    [2], [4]. Various game models are considered under different scenarios, perspectives,
    or assumptions on transmitting nodes'' behavior. Nevertheless, the common aim
    of these models is to improve network performance (e.g., throughput maximization,
    resource consumption minimization, and QoS guarantee) given self-interest or group-rationality
    of transmitting nodes. The motivations of using game models for design, analysis,
    and optimization of multiple access in wireless networks are as follows: Theoretical
    foundation for multiple access schemes:Game theory, which is most notably used
    in Economics, usually considers a multiplayer decision problem. A success or benefit
    of an individual in making decisions depends on the decisions of others. Game
    theory provides a theoretical basis to analyze interactions in multiplayer systems
    including human as well as non-human players (e.g., computers, animals, and plants)
    [5]. Therefore, it can be applied to a wireless communication network in the context
    of resource sharing where the players are the nodes (e.g., mobile stations, base
    stations, access points) in the network. Cooperation or competition among mobile
    nodes for channel access in a wireless network is a multiplayer decision problem,
    which can be modeled as a game. The benefit of a node as a result of its chosen
    action (i.e., strategy or move) can be measured in terms of performance metrics
    such as throughput and delay. An equilibrium solution of the game model defines
    the actions of the different nodes (e.g., transmission power) for which the chosen
    performance objective is optimized. Modeling selfish/malicious behavior of nodes:The
    transmitting nodes in a wireless network may behave selfishly in order to reap
    performance advantage over other nodes, as a result of which the overall network
    performance may degrade. To make the network robust against the selfish behaviors
    (or attacks) by these malicious nodes, efficient defense mechanisms need to be
    built into the system. Game theory can be used to model and analyze the selfish
    behavior of nodes and design the defense mechanisms for robust multiple access
    in wireless networks. Distributed protocols: In many scenarios, wireless nodes
    make their decisions in an individual (or distributed) manner rather than in a
    centralized manner. Game theory is a suitable tool to optimize wireless access
    distributively [6]. In a centralized scheme, solving the problem of multiple access
    may become computationally expensive when the network size increases. Also, the
    network control overhead could be prohibitive. In contrast, efficient distributed
    algorithms can be designed based on game theory which can reduce the communication
    and computation overhead significantly. Therefore, game theory is a useful tool
    to develop efficient distributed protocols for wireless networks. With an appropriate
    game formulation, cross-layer optimization can be also performed in a distributed
    way. Mechanism design:The parameters of a game can be designed (or varied) such
    that it leads the independent and self-interested wireless nodes toward a system-wide
    desirable outcome. Pricing is one technique that can be used for such mechanism
    design (or incentive scheme) to regulate the usage of radio resources by the wireless
    nodes by adjusting their costs. This article comprehensively surveys the existing
    researches on game theoretic approaches for channel access in a multiuser wireless
    network. The aim of this article is to familiarize the readers with the state-of-the-art
    research on this topic and the different techniques for game theoretic modeling
    of the multiple access problem in wireless systems. Different types of game models
    are reviewed for both contention-free and random channel access schemes. For contention-free
    channel access, time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency- division multiple
    access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA)-based wireless networks
    are considered. For contention-based channel access, game models for ALOHA and
    carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based channel access methods are reviewed.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II presents an overview
    of multiple access methods for wireless networks. Then, an overview of game theory
    and its applications to multiple access design is presented in Section III. Next,
    we review the game models for contention-free channel access and random channel
    access in Sections IV and V, respectively. Section VI provides a summary of the
    survey and discusses several open research issues. Section VII concludes the paper.
    SECTION II. Overview of Multiple Access Methods In this section, the general concepts
    of channel access and performance issues related to multiple access design in
    wireless networks are discussed. A. General Concepts Channel access methods in
    wireless networks can be divided into two main groups, namely, contention-free
    channel access and contention-based random channel access schemes. In contention-free
    schemes, multiple nodes are allocated with the radio resources (e.g., time slot,
    channel, and code) by a central entity and the nodes use the allocated resources
    for data transmission [7]. Contention-free channel access can be used in time-division,
    frequency-division, and code-division multiple access networks. Time-division
    multiple access (TDMA): In TDMA, time is divided into fixed-length frames and
    each frame is divided into multiple time slots. Time slots are allocated to the
    nodes for data transmission. In TDMA, synchronization among the nodes is required
    to avoid interference [8]. Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA): In FDMA,
    radio frequency band is divided into multiple channels. The channels are allocated
    to the nodes for data transmission. Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access
    (OFDMA) is an improved version of FDMA which is based on the orthogonal frequency-division
    multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in the physical layer. In OFDMA, frequency band
    is divided into multiple subcarriers which are shared among the nodes. OFDMA is
    used in the IEEE 802.16-based WiMAX networks. Code-division multiple access (CDMA):
    In CDMA, multiple nodes can transmit data on the same channel simultaneously.
    The transmitted data by each node is encoded by using a unique spreading code.
    The spreading codes for the different users are orthogonal/near-orthogonal to
    each other. The receiver of each node can decode the original data correctly if
    the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is maintained above a threshold.
    For contention-based random access scheme, a node has to compete with other nodes
    to transmit data over the wireless channel. A packet transmitted by a node will
    be received successfully if there is no collision. A collision occurs when multiple
    nodes transmit data simultaneously and the SINR at the receiver is lower than
    the minimum SINR required to decode the original packet correctly. If collision
    occurs, a node may attempt to retransmit the packet, and the specifics of the
    retransmission method depend on the protocol used. The most common contention-based
    channel access schemes are as follows [9]: ALOHA: In ALOHA, if a node has a packet
    to send, it will attempt to transmit the packet immediately. If the packet collides
    with packets from other nodes, the node will retransmit the packet later. The
    ALOHA protocol can be operated in a slotted fashion, in which case, time is divided
    into slots, and packet transmissions are aligned with the time slots. Carrier
    sense multiple access (CSMA):CSMA is a probabilistic medium access method in which
    a node senses the status of the channel before attempting transmission. If the
    channel is idle, the node initiates a transmission attempt. If the transmission
    is unsuccessful due to a collision, the node waits for a packet retransmission
    interval and transmits again. Two of the improved variants of CSMA are CSMA with
    collision detection (CSMA/CD) and CSMA with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). In
    CSMA/CD, assuming that a node is able to detect a collision, a transmission is
    terminated as soon as a collision is detected. The collision can be avoided by
    expanding the retransmission interval (i.e., backoff period) for the node to wait
    before a new transmission. In CSMA/CA, if the channel is sensed busy before transmission,
    to decrease the probability of collisions on the channel, transmission is postponed
    for a random period of time. B. Performance Issues in Multiple Access for Wireless
    Networks The key requirements for the design and optimization of multiple channel
    access schemes for wireless networks are as follows [10]: Maximize network throughput:
    Throughput refers to the amount of data successfully transmitted by the nodes
    over a time period. Maximizing the overall system throughput is a key objective
    of most of the multiple access schemes. This is turn improves the spectrum efficiency
    in wireless networks. Minimize delay: Delay refers to the time required for a
    packet to be transmitted successfully since it has been received at the transmission
    buffer from the upper layer. Delay is a key performance metric for real-time traffic
    (e.g., voice and video). Multiple channel access schemes for such traffic have
    to minimize delay. Guarantee fairness: Fairness is a measure of whether the nodes
    are receiving an equal (or fair) share of radio resources. Multiple channel access
    schemes must guarantee a certain level of fairness to all nodes in the network.
    Improve power efficiency: Power efficiency is an important performance metric
    for battery-powered wireless nodes. There is a tradeoff between power efficiency
    and network performance. To reduce power consumption, a node can be put in standby
    mode during which the node cannot transmit and/or receive packets. Consequently,
    the throughput reduces. In a wireless network, the nodes sharing the limited radio
    resources may have different behaviors. On one hand, all nodes can cooperate to
    meet the above requirements and achieve optimal network performance. This is referred
    to as group rationality. On the other hand, the nodes can be noncooperative to
    compete with each other for the radio resources. This is referred to as self-interest
    behavior. To analyze these behaviors and investigate their impact on network performance,
    game theory can be applied through which the equilibrium solution (i.e., behavior
    of the nodes at steady state) can be obtained. SECTION III. Overview of Game Theory
    and Its Applications to Multiple Access In this section, the basic concepts used
    in game theory are discussed and different game models are briefly introduced.
    The issues pertinent to using game theory to analyze multiple access schemes in
    wireless networks are also discussed. A. General Concepts A game is defined by
    a set of players, a set of actions for each player, and the payoffs for the players.
    A player chooses an action and the complete plan of action is referred to as the
    strategy. When the action is chosen deterministically, it is called a pure strategy.
    On the other hand, when the action is chosen probabilistically according to a
    certain probability distribution, it is called a mixed strategy. Based on the
    strategies of the players, their payoffs are determined. Depending on the nature
    of the game, there are different solution concepts. However, almost all of them
    rely on the equilibrium concept which ensures that a player will gain a fair or
    optimal payoff given the strategies of other players in the game. Pareto optimality
    or Pareto efficiency is another well-known concept in a game. A strategy is called
    Pareto optimal if it is impossible to make one player better off without necessarily
    making other players worse off. B. Game Theoretic Models Two major game-theoretic
    approaches which can be used to model multiple access schemes are the noncooperative
    and the cooperative game approaches. In a noncooperative game, the players make
    rational decisions considering only their individual payoff. In a cooperative
    game, players are grouped together and establish an enforceable agreement in their
    group. 1. Noncooperative games Self-interested players in a non- cooperative game
    make decisions independently. The players are unable to make enforceable contracts
    but it does not mean that players do not cooperate. Any cooperation in the games
    must be self-enforcing. Noncooperative game theory has been used extensively to
    study various issues in wireless networks (e.g., medium access control game, time
    slot competition, and power control in CDMA). The goal of a noncooperative game
    model is to find the equilibrium solution for networks with self-interested nodes.
    A well-known solution concept for a noncooperative game is Nash equilibrium [11].
    A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for the players such that no player
    has any intention to change his/her strategy to gain a higher payoff given that
    none of the other players changes his/her strategy. Let i be an index of a player,
    i∈I={1,…,M} where I is a set of players and M is the total number of players.
    Let S i denote a set of strategy of player i . s i ∈ S i is any possible strategy
    of player i . The Nash equilibrium satisfies the following condition [11]: u i
    ( s ∗ i , s ∗ −i )≥ u i ( s i , s ∗ −i ),∀i∈I,∀ s i ∈ S i (1) View Source where
    u i (⋅) is the payoff function of player i, s ∗ i is a Nash equilibrium strategy
    of player i , and s ∗ −i is a Nash equilibrium strategy vector of all players
    except player i . However, a Nash equilibrium may not exist in a game. Also, even
    if a Nash equilibrium exists, it may not be unique. Another solution concept which
    is more general than the Nash equilibrium is known as correlated equilibrium [12].
    In this concept, a strategy profile is chosen according to the joint distribution
    instead of the marginal distribution of players'' strategies as in the Nash equilibrium
    solution. The definition of correlated equilibrium is given below. Let S i denote

    (i.e., a recommended strategy according to the distribution π ) to player i ,
    a distribution π is defined to be a correlated equilibrium if no player i can
    choose a strategy s i instead of s ∗ i which results in a higher expected payoff.
    A noncooperative game can be classified as either a complete or an incomplete
    information game. In a complete information game, information such as the payoffs
    and strategies of the players are observable to all the players. On the other
    hand, in an incomplete information game, the information is unknown by other players.
    An incomplete information game can be modeled as a Bayesian game [11] in which
    Bayesian analysis is used to predict the outcome of the game. The equilibrium
    solution of such a game is called Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Similar to the Nash
    equilibrium in a complete information game, a Bayesian Nash equilibrium can be
    obtained in which each player seeks for a strategy profile that maximizes its
    expected payoff given its beliefs about the types and strategies of other players.
    Moreover, a game can be classified as either a static game or a dynamic game.
    A static game is a one-shot game where all players make decisions without knowledge
    of the strategies that are being chosen by other players. The one-shot game ends
    when actions of all players are chosen and payoffs are received. In contrast,
    in a dynamic game, a player chooses an action in the current stage based on the
    knowledge of the actions chosen by the other players in the current or previous
    stages. This dynamic game can be called a sequential game since players play a
    static game repeatedly. The common equilibrium solution in dynamic games is a
    subgame perfect Nash equilibrium [13]. A subgame perfect Nash equilibrium represents
    a Nash equilibrium of every subgame of the original game. A common method to obtain
    subgame perfect equilibria is backward induction. A dynamic game with incomplete
    information can be described as a multi-stage game when information is unknown
    to other players [11]. It is similar to a dynamic game with complete information
    in that the players take turns sequentially rather than simultaneously but information
    is incompletely known to others. The players follow their beliefs and dynamically
    update their beliefs by using the Bayes'' rule. In a dynamic game with incomplete
    information, perfect Bayesian equilibrium is the solution concept which can be
    considered as a combination of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium and subgame perfect
    equilibrium concepts. Repeated game [11] is a special kind of dynamic game in
    which the same set of players plays the same stage game or one-shot game repeatedly
    over a long time period. Repeated games can be divided into two key types, namely,
    finite and infinite repeated games, depending on whether the period of time during
    which the game is played is finite or infinite. Most repeated games are typically
    infinite repeated games and a player takes into account the effect of his/her
    current action on the future actions of other players. Markovian game (i.e., Markovian
    dynamic game or Markov game) is an extension of game theory to Markov Decision
    Process-like environments. A Markovian game can be defined as a type of stochastic
    game [14] [15] which can be regarded as a multiagent extension of Markov decision
    process [16]. The key difference between a Markov game and a Markov decision process
    is that a transition depends on the current state and the action profile of the
    players. Also, each player may receive different reward as a result of the action
    profile. Each player has a reward function (i.e., payoff function) and tries to
    maximize its expected sum of discounted reward. A more specific type of Markovian
    game is a switching controlled Markovian game where the transition probability
    in any given state depends on the action of only one player. The Nash equilibrium
    for such a game can be computed by solving a sequence of Markov decision processes.
    Auction game [17] is a game theoretic approach in which an object or service is
    exchanged on the basis of bids submitted by the bidders to an auctioneer. There
    are two main auction mechanisms, namely, the first and second price auctions.
    In first price auction, an object or service is given to a bidder who submitted
    the highest bid and pays a price equal to the amount of bid. In second price auction,
    an object or service is given to a bidder who submitted the highest bid and pays
    a price equal to the second highest amount of bid. Stackelberg game or leader-follower
    game [11] is a strategic game in which the player acting as a leader moves first
    and then the rest acting as followers move afterward. Then, the problem is to
    find an optimal strategy for the leader, assuming that the followers react in
    such a rational way that they optimize their objective functions given the leader''s
    actions. The Stackelberg game model can be solved by subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.
    Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) [18] is a solution concept in the evolutionary
    game theory. In this game, the evolution of social behaviour of animals in a population
    is considered. In a wireless network, a population can be a group of mobile nodes
    sharing the channels. A strategy is called an ESS if in a fixed population, the
    entire population using ESS cannot be invaded by mutant strategies of a small
    group. 2. Cooperative games In a cooperative game, players are able to make enforceable
    contracts. The players in a coalition cooperate to maximize a common objective
    of a coalition. In this case, players can coordinate strategies and agree on how
    the total payoff is to be divided among players in a coalition. Nash bargaining
    game is one type of cooperative games where the players maximize the product of
    their gains given what each player would receive without cooperation (i.e., threat
    point). This is referred to as the Nash bargaining solution which can be defined
    as follows: s ∗ =arg max s ∏ i∈I ( u i ( s i )− u d i ) (3) View Source where
    u i (⋅) is the payoff function of player i, s i is a strategy of player i , and
    s ∗ is a Nash bargaining solution strategy vector of all players, and u d i is
    the threat point (i.e., the utility gained if player i decides not to cooperate
    and bargain with the other players). Coalition formation game is a cooperative
    game involving a set of players who are looking for cooperative groups (i.e.,
    coalitions). A coalition S, which represents an agreement among the players to
    act as a single entity, can be formed by players in a set N to gain a higher payoff,
    and the worth of this coalition, denoted by v is called the coalitional value.
    Two common forms of coalitional games are strategic form and partition form. In
    the former case, the value of a coalition S depends on the members of that coalition
    only (i.e., independent of how the players in N\S are structured). In the latter
    case, the value of a coalition S strongly depends on how the players in N\S are
    structured. Coalitional game models can be developed with either transferable
    payoff or non-transferable payoff. In a transferable payoff coalitional game,
    there is no restriction on how the total payoff will be divided among the members
    of a coalition. In a non-transferable payoff coalitional game, the payoff that
    each player in a coalition obtains depends on the joint actions that the players
    of a coalition select [19]. A stable solution for a coalition formation game ensures
    that the outcome is immune to deviations by groups of players (i.e., no player
    has an incentive to move from its current coalition to another coalition). Game
    theory can be used to model and analyze cooperative and noncooperative behaviors
    of nodes and their interactions during channel access in wireless networks. There
    are a few considerations when game theory is applied to model and analyze multiple
    access schemes in wireless networks. C. Issues in Game Theoretic Design of Multiple
    Access Schemes Self-interest and group-rationality: Most of the game theoretic
    models developed for multiple access in wireless networks have the assumption
    of self-interest and grouprationality for the noncooperative and cooperative game
    models, respectively. A node with self-interest has the objective to maximize
    only its own payoff. However, this behavior may not provide a socially optimal
    solution. The corresponding depreciation is called price of anarchy. On the other
    hand, group-rational nodes can cooperate to achieve a socially optimal solution,
    and for this, a cooperative game (e.g., bargaining game) can be applied [20] [21].
    However, in many cases, the group-rationality condition may not hold for all nodes,
    and some nodes may deviate from cooperation. Therefore, a penalization (or punishment)
    mechanism is required to enforce cooperation among the nodes so that a socially
    optimal solution can always be achieved. Penalization mechanisms: These mechanisms
    [22] are proposed to promote cooperation in multiple access among nodes sharing
    the channel. The punishment is commonly applied to the nodes deviating from cooperation
    since such deviation can degrade the network performance. In this respect, two
    important issues are the detection of deviating nodes and designing the punishment
    mechanism to be applied. Practical implementation: Although game theory provides
    solutions for a situation of conflict during multiple access, it is still difficult
    to implement these solutions in a practical environment. In many cases, distributed
    implementations are desirable. In some distributed implementations, the mobile
    stations may require information such as SINR, power, price from the base station(s)
    in order to converge to the equilibrium solution. However, in a realistic scenario,
    these information cannot be observed perfectly (e.g., channel gain of other nodes).
    Therefore, the mobile stations may need to have the ability to learn from the
    radio environment which may increase the complexity of implementation and reduce
    the rate of convergence of the solution of the game to the equilibrium solution.
    Payoff function: A payoff function represents the benefit or reward to a player
    in the game when an action is chosen by this player. Defining a suitable payoff
    function is an important issue. When the payoff function is defined differently,
    the solution of the same game model applied to the same multiple access scheme
    can be dramatically different. The payoff function should be defined considering
    the physical performance measures of the nodes and/or networks. In the following
    sections, we review various game theoretic models proposed in the literature to
    study multiple access schemes. This review is categorized based on different types
    of multiple access methods and types of the game models used. SECTION IV. Game
    Models for Contention-Free Channel Access In this section, game models for contention-free
    channel access based on TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA are reviewed. A. TDMA-Based Channel
    Access Games Since the nodes have to transmit data during their allocated time
    slots, in TDMA-based channel access games, the nodes compete for time slots to
    achieve their performance objectives (i.e., QoS requirements). Four different
    game models, namely, noncooperative static game, auction game, dynamic game, and
    repeated game models are discussed. A summary of the key features of these game
    models is provided in Table II. The details of these models are discussed next.
    Table I Summary of Game Models Table II Summary of TDMA-Based Channel Access Games
    1. Noncooperative static game-theoretic approach In [23], a noncooperative static
    game model for QoS-aware resource competition is proposed for a single-hop wireless
    network with multiple wireless links. The wireless nodes need to compete for the
    transmission time within a time slot. The power consumption of all nodes is assumed
    to be constant and the channel fading is assumed to follow a stationary fiat-fading
    process. Two nodes are considered as the players in the game. The time slot length
    is denoted as t i T where t i ∈[0,1] is the time slot share of node i (i.e., fraction
    of time in a slot to be accessed by node i ) and T is the size of frame. Time
    slot share t i is the strategy of nodes. Two nodes i=1,2 transmit their data without
    collision if t i + t 2 ≤1 and collision occurs if t 1 + t 2 >1 . Time slot allocation
    to the nodes is shown in Fig. 1(a). Since the nodes have self-interest, they minimize
    the time slot usage given the channel state information (i.e., channel power gain
    denoted as h i ) subject to the effective capacity [24]. The corresponding optimization
    formulation for node 1 is as follows: min t 1 E h { t 1 } (4) View Source subject
    to E h { e − β 1 t 1 R 1 }− A 1 ≤0 (5) View Source and t 1 ≤1− t 2 (6) View Source
    where E h denotes expectation over h, β 1 is the normalized QoS exponent, R 1
    is the normalized transmission rate which is a function of channel state information.
    A 1 is equal to e − θ 1 C 1 where C 1 denotes the target effective capacity exponent
    and θ 1 denotes the QoS exponent for node 1. This effective capacity is also considered
    as an objective of the system. Nash equilibrium is the solution of this time slot
    competition game. It is found that the Nash equilibrium may not be unique. However,
    since the game can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, a unique solution
    can be obtained by minimizing the Lagrangian function of the objective function
    if the available time slot length is enough to guarantee QoS for both the nodes.
    2. Auction game-theoretic approach In [25], a second price and sealed bid auction
    for time slot competition in a dynamic spectrum access scenario is proposed. In
    dynamic spectrum access, each node i∈I={1,…,M} (i.e., the bidder/player in a game)
    submits its bid to the base station. The value of the submitted bid is the portion
    of the time slot (i.e., between 0 and 1) that will be used to help the base station
    relaying data to another distant node. The bidding value b i of node i is a non-decreasing
    function of the channel condition x i . The base station (i.e., the auctioneer)
    allocates the downlink channel to a node offering the highest bid (as shown in
    Fig. (b)). The price that this winning node pays is equal to the second highest
    bid. The amount of transmitted data of winning node j is denoted as d j = x j
    (1− max i∈I,i≠j b i ( x i )) where x j is the channel condition of the winning
    node which is assumed to be the amount of data received per unit time, and b i
    ( x i ) is the bid submitted by a node. A node chooses a value of bid which maximizes
    its expected amount of transmitted data under its budget constraint given the
    probability distributions of the channel conditions of all the nodes. The budget
    constraint of node i represents the amount of time that the node is Fig. 1. The
    diagram represents different time slot allocations: (a) time slot allocation based
    on [23], (b) time slot allocation based on [25], and (c) time slot allocation
    based on [26]. Show All able to provide to the base station for data relaying.
    Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution. It is found that, for pure strategy,
    a Nash equilibrium exists in the two-node case, but in a general multiple-node
    case, a Nash equilibrium may not exist. A distributed algorithm is proposed for
    updating the bids which converges to the Nash equilibrium. The results show that
    to avoid zero throughput (i.e., maximum bid), the budget constraint has to be
    smaller than one. Also, the higher the budget constraint, the lower is the throughput
    for each node. A system model almost similar to that in [25] is considered in
    [26]. The second-price auction mechanism is used for the nodes competing for time
    slots in a downlink transmission scenario. Similar to [25], the utility function
    of a node is the expected amount of transmitted data and the bidding value b i
    of node i is a function in the channel condition x i . A node submits a bid which
    maximizes its expected amount of transmitted data under the budget constraints
    given the probability distributions of the channel conditions of all the nodes.
    The time slot allocation process for this auction game can be illustrated as in
    Fig. 1(c). The Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution of the auction game.
    It is shown that the Nash equilibrium leads to a unique allocation which is also
    Pareto optimal. For uniformly distributed channel state, the aggregated throughput
    that nodes achieve at the Nash equilibrium is at least 3/4 of the optimal aggregated
    throughput achieved using an optimal centralized allocation without fairness consideration.
    Also, a centralized opportunistic scheduler is proposed to achieve proportional
    fairness. The a priori knowledge of channel distribution is not required by this
    scheduler. The centralized scheduler will assign time slots according to the Nash
    equilibrium strategy. 3. Dynamic game-theoretic approach In [27], a Marko- vian
    dynamic game is formulated to solve the transmission rate adaptation problem in
    a dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio network. In such a network, the
    secondary users (or cognitive radio users) opportunistically access the radio
    spectrum, which is licensed to the primary (or licensed) users, without causing
    harmful interference to the primary users. The players of the game are secondary
    nodes competing for the channel or time slot in a TDMA scenario (e.g., in the
    IEEE 802.16-based network). In a TDMA cognitive radio system, the system has a
    predefined decentralized access rule that allows only one secondary node to access
    the channel at a time. The access rule is defined as a function of channel quality
    and transmission delay. This transmission rate control problem is formulated as
    a general-sum switching control Markovian dynamic game. In this dynamic game,
    the system state transition probability at each time slot depends only on the
    active secondary node. Node i (i.e., secondary node i ) follows a decentralized
    access rule to try to occupy a time slot at time n , after a period of time t
    n i = γ i q n i h n i where γ i is the QoS parameter of node i, Q n i is the buffer
    occupancy state of user i , and h n i is the channel state of node i . The composite
    variable x n i =[ q n i , h n i ] denotes the state of user i at time n . If there
    are more than one node having the same waiting period, a node will be randomly
    picked with equal probability. after node j is selected to transmit data, this
    node chooses action a n j (i.e., transmission rate in bits/symbol) assuming an
    M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation. The transmission cost of the selected node
    j, c j ( x n , a n j ) , is defined as its transmission bit error rate (BER),
    and the cost of node i, d i ( x n , a n j ) , is defined as its delay constraint
    (i.e., QoS constraint) which is a function of the buffer state q n i . The transition
    probabilities depend only on the action of active node; hence, a Markovian dynamic
    game can be formulated. The strategy of node i . denotes the transmission policy
    s i . The Nash equilibrium policy s ∗ i is computed by minimizing the expected
    total discounted cost function subject to the expected total discounted delay
    constraint as follows: s ∗(n) i ={ s n i : min s i C n i ( s i )}subject to D
    n i ( s i )≤ D ^ i (7) View Source where C n i ( s i ) is the infinite expected
    total discounted transmission cost calculated from c j ( x n , a n j ) . D n i
    ( s i ) is the infinite expected total discounted delay which is calculated from
    d i ( x n , a n j ) and cannot be greater than threshold D ^ i . The value iteration
    algorithm is used to obtain a Nash equilibrium policy. The Nash equilibrium policy
    of any node i is observed to be a randomized mixture of pure policies and the
    pure policies are non-decreasing on the buffer occupancy state. A stochastic approximation
    algorithm exploiting this structure is presented to efficiently estimate the Nash
    equilibrium policy by computing parameters such as buffer state thresholds and
    randomization factors. In [28], a system model similar to that presented in [27]
    is considered; however, correlated equilibrium is studied as the solution of the
    game. Two distributed correlated equilibrium algorithms (i.e., iterative correlated
    equilibrium algorithm and correlated Q-Iearning algorithm) are proposed to obtain
    the correlated equilibrium in the Markovian game. The stationary policy s ∗ is
    a correlated equilibrium for the Markovian game, i.e., ∑ a −i ∈ A −1 s ∗ x ( a
    −i , a i ) Q s ∗ i (x,{ a −i , a i })≥ ∑ a −i ∈ A −1 s ∗ x ( a −i , a i ) Q s
    ∗ i (x,{ a −i , a ′ i }) (8) View Source where Q s ∗ i (⋅) is the Q-function of
    user i : which is the total discounted reward of taking action a in state x .
    The Q-function is a function of the user i ''s utility plus the infinite expected
    total discounted utility. The utility is the difference between a function of
    achievable transmission rate and the transmission delay. When an iterative algorithm
    is used to find the correlated equilibrium, each user does not need the information
    of the Q- functions of other users, and this can be used to develop distributed
    algorithms. However, the probability transition matrix is required to update the
    Q- function values. The correlated Q-Iearning algorithm can remove the requirement
    of a system state transition probability matrix for the iterative correlated equilibrium.
    Hence, it is more practical than the iterative algorithm. 4. Repeated game-theoretic
    approach In [29], a repeated game model for spectrum sharing in a cognitive radio
    network is presented. The game enforces the nodes to tell their true channel conditions
    and to cooperate with each other. Data transmission over a long time period is
    considered. Therefore, spectrum sharing can be formulated as a repeated game where
    the nodes are concerned about their payoffs (e.g., throughputs) in the future.
    The actions of the nodes are the power allocation according to the power constraint
    and channel condition. In this game, the power constraint is assumed to be identical
    for all nodes. If all the nodes make an agreement and share the spectrum in an
    orderly fashion, every node gains benefit from the cooperation. However, some
    nodes may violate the agreed upon rule and deviate from cooperation. Then, the
    game model provides a punishment mechanism which will be triggered and applied
    to the deviating node for a certain period of time. The period of time for punishment
    is chosen such that the expected payoff from cooperation is greater than the expected
    payoff from deviation. To design a cooperation rule, an opportunistic time slot
    allocation method is developed which maximizes the total throughput. The node
    informing the best channel gain will be allocated time slots for transmission.
    However, in the incomplete information case, the channel gain of one node may
    not be known to other nodes, and some node may falsely inform its channel gain
    information. Therefore, a Bayesian mechanism is introduced to enforce all the
    nodes to tell the true values of their channel gains. B. Channel Access Games
    in FDMA In FDMA, the nodes compete for available channels in the network and the
    solutions of the game models (i.e., equilibria) can be obtained in the complete
    and incomplete information cases. We consider three different game models, namely,
    noncooperative static game, auction game, and cooperative game models. A summary
    of the key features of these game models for FDMA is provided in Table III. The
    details of these models are discussed next. Table III Summary of FDMA-Based Channel
    Access Games 1. Noncooperative static game-theoretic approach In [30], the optimal
    FDMA channel assignment problem for noncooperative wireless networks is studied
    assuming that the nodes can be equipped with either single or multiple radio interfaces.
    The available frequency band is divided into orthogonal channels. The authors
    introduce a payment formula to ensure the existence of a strongly dominant strategy
    equilibrium (SDSE) [31], which is a stronger solution concept than the Nash equilibrium.
    This payment is used to obtain the globally optimal solution in terms of effective
    system-wide throughput. The strategy of node i( s i ) is the channel assignment
    vector which is the number of radio interfaces allocated to each channel. The
    solution in terms of SDSE can be described as follows: ∀ s −i ∈ S i ,∀ s i ≠ s
    ∗ i , u i ( s ∗ i , s −i )≥ u i ( s i , s −i ) ∃ s −i ∈ S i ,∀ s i ≠ s ∗ i , u
    i ( s ∗ i , s −i )> u i ( s i , s −i ) (9) (10) View Source where S i is the set
    of all possible strategies and u i (⋅) is the payoff function of node i . The
    payoff function is defined as the difference between the throughput and the payment
    to the system administrator. The payment is a function of the node''s throughput
    plus a penalty (if the node deviates from the globally optimal solution) or a
    bonus (if the node does not deviate). An algorithm to obtain the SDSE is proposed.
    It is proved that the algorithm converges to the SDSE. Multiple channel access
    in multi-cell and multi-user OFDMA networks is considered in [32]. In multi-cell
    networks, changes of resource allocation in a cell affect the performances of
    other nearby cells. A noncooperative game model for sub-channel assignment, rate
    adaptation, and power control is introduced. Node i with self-interest maximizes
    its own payoff u i (⋅) (e.g., minimizes its transmission power) by allocating
    its transmission rates r i on different sub-channels k∈{1,…,K} under the required
    rate R i and power constraint P i max as follows: min r i u i (⋅)= ∑ k=1 K P k
    i ,s.t. ∑ k=1 K r k i = R i (11) View Source where P k i is the transmission power
    of user i in subchannel k Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution. This Nash
    equilibrium (NE) can be obtained by using the water-filling algorithm. However,
    in some cases of high channel interference, there might be multiple Nash equilibria
    or the solution might also be undesirable (i.e., the overall power for the users
    is larger than the power constraint: ∑ K k=1 P k i > P i max ). A dual noncooperative
    game is used if the desired NE solution cannot be obtained. The definition of
    the dual game is as follows: max r i ∑ k=1 K r k i ,s.t.   ∑ k=1 K P k i = P i
    max . (12) View Source after the dual noncooperative game converges, if the desired
    NE solution is still not reached (i.e., if any node has to play the dual noncooperative
    game, the obtained NE is considered as an undesired NE), a mechanism called virtual
    referee is introduced to improve the performance of this noncooperative game.
    The key idea of the virtual referee mechanism is that a referee monitors the nodes
    in the network. If the Nash equilibrium is reached, the referee does nothing;
    however, if it is not, the referee will modify the game rule in order to remove
    some nodes from accessing subchannels so that a better performance can be achieved.
    The flow of this noncooperative game with a referee is shown as Fig. 2. Fig. 2.
    The diagram illustrates the steps of the algorithm for noncooperative game with
    virtual referee in OFDMA networks. Show All A channel allocation game is studied
    in [33] as a static game when nodes have multiple radio interfaces. The players
    are the nodes with self-interest which aim to maximize their own profits defined
    as the total rates or channel utilization. In this game, there are K orthogonal
    channels. If the same channel is used by multiple nodes, they can hear the transmissions
    of each other. Moreover, a node can use multiple channels at the same time. The
    strategy of each node is the channel allocation vector or the number of radio
    interfaces on each channel. The payoff of each node is the achieved bit rate.
    It is assumed that the rate on each channel is allocated equally by using a reservation-based
    time-division schedule among the interfaces. The total available rate on a channel
    is assumed to be a non-increasing function of the number of radio interfaces accessing
    this channel. The set of channels used by node i is denoted as K i . The payoff
    function of node i , defined as u i , is the sum of achieved bit rate r on each
    occupied channel k∈ K i as follows: u i =∑ l i,k l k R( l k ) (13) View Source
    where l i,k is the number of radio interfaces of node i currently using channel
    k, l k is the number of radios using channel k , and R( l k ) is the total rate
    which is a decreasing function of the number of radios using channel k . Nash
    equilibrium is considered as a solution. If the total number of radio interfaces
    is smaller than or equal to the number of channels, then a flat channel allocation
    (not more than one radio interface per channel) is the Nash equilibrium. To find
    a Nash equilibrium, three algorithms are introduced. The first one is a centralized
    algorithm with perfect information. It requires sequential action of players and
    global coordination. This global coordination can be achieved with an extra radio
    interface per device for scanning the channels. The second algorithm is a distributed
    algorithm with perfect information. This algorithm is a round-based algorithm
    in which a random radio interface assignment to the nodes over the channels is
    used. It is assumed that there is no node that can assign more than one radio
    interface to any channel. after the initial assignment, each node evaluates the
    number of radio interfaces on each channel and tries to improve its total rate
    by reorganizing the allocation. However, an unstable allocation can occur. To
    avoid this problem, a backoff technique is used. Each node chooses a random initial
    value and then decreases this counter value periodically. The reallocation is
    performed when the counter is zero. The third algorithm is a distributed algorithm
    with imperfect information. This algorithm also uses the backoff technique. In
    each round, a node calculates the average number of devices on the channels. Then,
    the node can obtain a probability to choose channel. The algorithm can reach a
    stable state but it may not be the Nash equilibrium since the available local
    information is incompletely known. Then, a mechanism is introduced to resolve
    inefficient stable states. The main difference of [34] from the previous game
    model is that the base stations (rather than the mobile nodes) are the players
    in this game. A noncooperative distributed resource allocation game in a multi-cell
    OFDMA system is proposed for M base stations serving L nodes. All of the base
    stations share the same frequency band with the total bandwidth B divided into
    k sub-channels. The players are the base stations and a strategy is the sub-channel
    assignment and power allocation. The transmission power at a sub-channel k of
    base station i is denoted as p i k . That is, p i =( p i 1 ,…, p i k ,…, p i K
    ) is the transmission power vector of all the sub-channels of base station i .
    The constraint on the transmission power of each base station is ∑ K k=1 p i k
    ≤ P max . The payoff function is defined as the difference between the weighted
    sum of the data rates ( ∑ i∈ U i β j R j (P, A i )) and the cost of total. power
    ( ∑ K k=1 p i k ) where U i is the set of nodes in cell i, β i is a weighting
    factor, P=[ p 1 ,…, p i ,…, p M ] and A i =[ a i kj ] K×L , a i kj is 1 if sub-channel
    k is assigned to node j ; otherwise, it is o. The payoff function is defined as
    follows: u i (P, A i )= ∑ j∈ U i β j R j (P, A i )−c ∑ k=1 K p i k (14) View Source
    where c denotes the price per unit power, having the unit bps/W. Each base station
    maximizes its payoff function. To find the optimal sub-channel assignment given
    a network power vector P 0 , the sub-channel assignment game can be represented
    as max A i ∑ i∈ U i β j R j ( P 0 , A i ) . Using a greedy approach, the solution
    A ∗i (P) , can be found when P is determined. Hence, we can obtain the optimal
    power allocation, which is the Nash equilibrium, by solving max p i ∑ j∈ U i β
    j R j ( P 0 , A ∗i (P)) . The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium of
    the power allocation game can be proved. Moreover, a distributed resource allocation
    algorithm is proposed to obtain both the sub-channel assignment and power allocation.
    The algorithm iteratively converges to an equilibrium point. The key concept of
    the algorithm is that each base station updates the subchannel assignment according
    to a greedy approach and the power allocation according to the best-response update
    using local information from nodes (i.e., SINR in each sub-channel). The work
    of [35] presents a noncooperative game model for spectrum access in distributed
    cognitive radio networks. In such a network, M secondary nodes opportunistically
    transmit data on the channel allocated to the primary node. Let p i be transmission
    power of secondary node i (i.e., transmitter and receiver). Secondary node i has
    a maximum transmission power constraint ( p i ≤ p ^ i ) in each channel. It is
    assumed that the total power in each channel must not exceed the maximum total
    power of all users using the channel k∈{1,…,K} , which is ∑ i∈ U k p i ≤ P ^ where
    U k denotes the set of all nodes using channel k and P ^ is the maximum total
    power of all users. The strategies of secondary nodes are the choices among K
    available channels. The objective of secondary node i is to maximize its payoff,
    which is a function of SINR γ k i on each channel k (i.e., max u i ( γ k i ) )
    subject to the maximum transmission power constraint p ^ (i.e., p i ≤ p ^ ). Using
    an N-channel bi-matrix game, the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium is
    proved. Next, this noncooperative game model is extended to the Stackelberg game
    since the channel access of a disconnecting secondary node depends on the other
    secondary nodes'' strategies. There are events which cause disruption in channel
    access. Arrival of a primary node is the main cause of channel access disruption
    since the secondary node has to leave the channel immediately. Interference from
    multiple secondary nodes accessing the channel and channel fading may also cause
    disruption in channel access. In an unexpected event, a secondary node who has
    any strategy that can help uninterrupted channel access is considered to be a
    leader (i.e., a leader has information on channel access by primary users). The
    rest of the secondary nodes who do not have any information on accessing channel
    are followers. Then, the payoff of the leader is the summation of u i ( γ k i
    ) and the cost that the followers pay for switching the channel. The payoff for
    a follower is the difference between u i ( γ k i ) and the price that the leader
    sets for switching the channel. Note that this leader-follower scenario is temporary.
    A node finds a channel and broadcasts the new channel information. Only one node
    can be a leader in each channel. The numerical results show the existence of an
    equilibrium solution. 2. Auction game-theoretic approach In [36], a distributed
    resource control scheme is presented to achieve fairness in OFDMA systems. Specifically,
    an auction game-theoretic resource allocation scheme based on iterative multi-unit
    second price auction is applied. A base station (BS) controls transmission power
    and bidding to maximize system capacity and node fairness. From an information-theoretic
    point of view, the medium access control (MAC)-layer throughput capacity region
    is achievable by successive decoding [37] when at each subchannel k , the first
    node''s decoded signal is subtracted from the sum signal, then the next node''s
    signal is decoded, and so on. In this auction, first each node i submits bid b
    i which includes power control variable and bid value. Each node calculates its
    bid by maximizing the expected Shannon capacity, and each node submits its bid
    and waits to be assigned the decoding priority for each sub-channel from the base
    station. after the bids are received by the base station, the decoding priority
    is assigned to each node following the weighted sumrate capacity maximization
    of the base station. The cost that each node i pays is the cost for winning the
    l th decoding priority at subchannel k . Then, transmission power will be allocated
    based on the optimal and fair water-filling allocation according to the result
    of the decoding order. Also, the cost that the nodes have to pay will be announced.
    To obtain the Nash equilibrium for bidding in this auction, an iterative update
    algorithm is proposed. The key concept is to update the bid value based on the
    difference between the current bidding efficiency and the target bidding efficiency
    at each time slot t . Bidding efficiency is computed by a node''s achievable transmission
    rate divided by the cost of the node. Also, the bidding control variable is updated
    using the subgradient algorithm as follows: x (t+1) = x (t) + α t g (t) (15) View
    Source where x (t) is the bidding control variable at time t, α t is a constant
    step size, and g (t) is a subgradient which is a function of the total cost that
    node has to pay for and the total bid money that node can use during the game.
    The analytical and simulation results show that this iterative update algorithm
    can converge to the stable and optimal equilibrium which can achieve fairness
    among users when the channel conditions of the subchannels for the different nodes
    are uniformly distributed. 3. Cooperative game-theoretic approach In [38], a cooperative
    game theoretic model is proposed for secondary base stations (SBSs) in a cognitive
    radio network. The main concept of this work is to form cooperative groups among
    the SBSs in a multi-channel cognitive radio network by using a game theoretic
    approach called coalition formation game. To improve the quality of information
    about availability of primary nodes (PNs) to serve secondary nodes (SNs), the
    SBSs share their information through control channels such as a cognitive pilot
    channel (CPC) to other SNs. SBS i∈I={1,…,M} detects the presence of any PU k∈K={1,…,K}
    by using a channel and serves L i SNs. Each SBS can gather information on the
    availability of channels as a subset K i ⊆K . The false alarm probability obtained
    by SBS i : over PN channel k is denoted as P i fal,k ‘ Then, the total potential
    utility of SBS i in a noncooperative approach is given as follows: u({i})= ∑ k∈
    K i ∑ j=1 L i [(1− P i fal,k ) θ k ρ ji − α k (1− P i det,k ) (1− θ k )( ρ k r
    k − ρ j k r k )] (16) View Source where ζ k is the probability that channel k
    is available and α k is a penalty factor defined by PN k for any SN causing interference.
    The term (1− P i det,k ) is the probability of misdetection. ρ ij is the probability
    of successful transmission of SN j to its serving SBS i at the time when channel
    k is available. The term ( ρ k r k − ρ j k r k ) is the reduction in the probability
    of successful transnusston of PN k at its receiver r k whenever SN j transmits
    over channel k at a time of the presence of PN k due to the mis-detection of PN
    k To improve the utility, the SBSs can share the available knowledge of the presence
    of PNs; however, there is a tradeoff between the utility gained from learning
    new channels (through information sharing) and the cost to obtain cooperative
    information. In a coalition S , the set of known PNs by any SBS i in the coalition
    is defined as K S = ∪ i∈S K i . Hence, the payoff of any SBS i∈S is defined as
    follows: u i (S)= ∑ k∈ K S ∑ j=1 L i [(1− P i k fal,k ) θ k i i k ρ ji − α k (1−
    P i k det,k ) (1− θ k i i k )( ρ k r k − ρ j k r k )] (17) View Source where θ
    k i i k is the probability that SBS i can obtain the knowledge of channel k from
    another SBS i k ∈S. i k =i if SBS i : has its own information on channel k . SBS
    i k giving the maximum utility will be selected by SBS i . Since the payoff of
    SBS i depends only on the identity of the SBSs in the coalition which SBS i .
    is a member of, this game can be considered as a hedonic coalition game [39].
    The formulation of the game is described next. Given two coalitions S 1 . and
    S 2 , and i∈ S 1 and i∈ S 2 , S 1 ⪰ S 2 means SBS i prefers to be a member of
    coalition S 1 over being a member of coalition S 2 , and S 1 ≻ S 2 means SBS i
    strictly prefers to be a member of coalition S 1 over being a member of coalition
    S 2 . Then, the proposed coalition formation game can be defined as follows: S
    1 ⪰ S 2 ⇔ w i ( S 1 )≥ w i ( S 2 ) (18) View Source where w i (S) is a preference
    function for SBS i and coalition S . SBS i makes a decision to leave its current
    coalition S x and then to join another coalition S y when S x ≠ S y if and only
    if S y ∪{i} ≻ i S x . This can be interpreted as: an SBS will switch to a new
    coalition if it can strictly gain more payoff without decreasing other members''
    payoffs in the new coalition. A partition or a set of all coalitions is Nash-stable
    if no SBS has an incentive to move from its current coalition to another coalition
    or to deviate and act alone. A distributed algorithm to find a Nash-stable partition
    is proposed and the simulation results show that the average payoff per SBS of
    the coalition formation scheme outperforms one of the noncooperative schemes when
    the number of SBS increases. Another coalitional game for transmission power allocation
    and subchannel assignment in the uplink channel of an OFDMA system is presented
    in [40]. In the considered system model, there are M nodes located in the coverage
    area of a same base station. The base station provides K ‘ subchannels to node
    i∈I={1,…,M} to guarantee the target rate requirement. Let k denote each subchannel
    k∈K={1,…,K} . Let R i be the target rate requirement of node i . Suppose that
    the total bandwidth is B , then the carrier spacing of every subchannel is △f=B/K
    -. A player defined in this game is a pair of one subchannel and one node. Hence,
    MK players are considered in this game. The strategy of each player is the transmission
    power assigned to subchannel p ik . Then, there are M coalitions ζ=[ S 1 ,…, S
    i ,…, S M ] to be assigned to the M nodes and each coalition S i contains K .
    players (e.g., shown in Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Coalitions of players are formed following
    the game model in [40] when there are 3 mobile nodes and 3 subchannels. Show All
    In this game, the members in each coalition do not change during the game. Consequently,
    the coalition S i achieves its rate C i = ∑ k∈K C ik where C ik =△f log 2 (1+
    γ ik ) is the Shannon capacity achieved by node i on subchannel k . γ ik is the
    SINR at the base station. The payoff that each coalition will obtain is defined
    as follows: u( S i )= 1 C k / R k −1 −α.t(1− C k / R k ) (19) View Source where
    t(⋅) is the step function with t(y)=1 if y≥0 and t(y)=0 if y<0 , and α is a positive
    constant. A coalition will achieve the highest payoff (i.e., positive infinite)
    when C k = R k . An iterative algorithm based on Markov modeling of the TU coalitional
    game is proposed to update the best responses. The analytical and numerical results
    show that the algorithm can be considered as a Markov process. The process can
    quickly converge to an absorbing state which is also a Nash equilibrium solution
    with probability of one. C. Channel Access Games in CDMA CDMA systems use spread-spectrum
    technology in which each node is assigned with a different code to allow multiple
    users to be multiplexed over the same channel at the same time. Power control
    for multiple access is crucial for CDMA to ensure that the received signal can
    be decoded correctly. In a CDMA system with self-interested nodes, the transmission
    power control problem can be modeled as both the complete and incomplete information
    noncooperative games. Also, cooperative game models can be used for group-rational
    nodes in a CDMA system to achieve a Pareto optimal power control strategy. A summary
    of the key features of these game models for CDMA is provided in Table IV. The
    details of these models are discussed next. Table IV Summary of CDMA-Based Channel
    Access Games 1. Noncooperative static game-theoretic approach In [41], a noncooperative
    game model is presented for power control. Each node has an objective to maximize
    its own utility. The game considers a multi-carrier direct-sequence CDMA system
    in which the data stream for each node is divided into multiple parallel streams.
    Each stream is first spread using a spreading sequence and then transmitted on
    a carrier. The strategy of each node is to choose its transmission power. A high
    transmission power may yield high SINR and high transmission rate. However, it
    may also cause high interference to the other nodes in the network. The utility
    of a node is defined as the ratio of the total throughput and the total transmission
    power for all K carriers. Assuming that all the nodes use equal transmission rates,
    the utility function of a node can be expressed as the ratio of the summation
    of the efficiency functions and the summation of transmission powers for all K
    carriers. The efficiency function (f(γ)) represents packet success probability.
    The utility is a non quasi-concave function of the transmission power of the node.
    Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution. At the Nash equilibrium, each node
    transmits only on the carrier with the best effective channel. This best effective
    channel is the channel that requires the least amount of transmission power to
    achieve optimal SINR γ ∗ , at the output of the uplink receiver. Optimal SINR
    γ ∗ =γ f ′ (γ) is the solution to the efficiency function. A unique Nash equilibrium
    in this game can be achieved under a certain set of conditions. Also, an iterative
    and distributed algorithm based on best-response update is proposed to obtain
    the Nash equilibrium. The results show that, at the Nash equilibrium, the total
    network utility of this multicarrier system is higher than that of a single carrier
    system. Also, it is higher than that of a multicarrier system with the nodes choosing
    their transmission powers to maximize their utilities over each carrier indepen-dently.
    In [42], a noncooperative static Bayesian game is presented for uplink power control
    in a CDMA network. Each node chooses its transmission power. The payoff is a function
    of the difference between throughput and power consumption. The throughput part
    in the payoff function is composed of the gain from achievable bit rate and a
    ‘success function’. The ‘success function’ is a Sigmoid function of SINR. Since
    the path loss information for the other nodes is not completely known, each node
    uses path loss probability density functions to estimate the SINR (and hence payoff)
    of the other nodes. The solution of this incomplete information game is the Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium (BNE), which can be obtained from the best-response dynamics.
    This dynamics represents the strategy update rules based on the expected utility
    when path loss information is not completely known to the other nodes. The existence
    of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium is proved and it can be obtained in a distributed
    way. In [43], a noncooperative power control game for multirate CDMA networks
    is studied. All nodes in this multirate CDMA system use the same chip rate. However,
    they are able to adjust their processing gains to increase their data rates. The
    objective of the game is similar to that of [41], [42]. However, the payoff of
    each node is defined as the difference between the throughput in bits per second
    and the cost of transmission power. The cost that each node has to pay is a function
    of its received power divided by the total received power of all nodes plus noise
    at the base station. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium are
    proved for two channel models, i.e., a binary-input Gaussian output channel and
    a binary symmetric channel. Also, the spectral efficiency is derived for both
    the channel models. A joint rate and power control game model is presented in
    [44] for uplink CDMA communications. The system model and the concept of power
    control and rate updates in this game are similar to those in [46]. In particular,
    each node can adjust both transmission rate and transmission power to maximize
    its payoff (i.e., utility). The payoff of each node is in bits/J, which can be
    calculated from packet length, transmission power, transmission rate, and an efficiency
    function which is related to the SINR. The strategy of each node is to choose
    rate and power for transmission. The sets of rate and power are shown to be convex.
    The existence of Nash equilibrium for joint rate and power control is proved by
    using the NikaidoIsoda theorem [45]. Moreover, an algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium
    in this noncooperative joint transmission rate and power control game, shortly
    called NRPG, is proposed. The requirement of this algorithm is that each node
    has to obtain the SINR of the other nodes. The algorithm is proved to converge
    to the same Nash equilibrium when the nodes are assigned with different initial
    powers. Also, NRPG can converge to the solution faster than the algorithm proposed
    by Zhao and Lu [46]. Another noncooperative game model for power control is proposed
    in [47]. The strategy of each node is to choose transmission power p i . Each
    node in this system model has an objective to minimize its cost (instead of maximizing
    its utility). The cost function should be convex and non-negative and in [47]
    it is chosen to be a weighted sum of power ( β i p i ) and square of SIR error
    ( δ i ( γ tar i − γ i )) which is the difference between the actual SIR and the
    target SIR. β i and δ i are weighting constants. A distributed algorithm is proposed
    to obtain the Nash equilibrium. The power update algorithm is expressed as follows:
    p t+1 i = γ tar i ( p t i γ t i )− β i 2 δ i ( p t i γ t i ) 2 (20) View Source
    where t denotes the t th iteration of the algorithm. However, the information
    of interference power and SIR is still required by the node from the base station
    in order to calculate γ t i in each iteration. The convergence of the algorithm
    is proved. The proof shows that the algorithm converges to a unique fixed solution
    under a set of conditions. Also, the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional
    power balance algorithm (e.g., smaller number of iterations are required for convergence
    to a solution, higher efficiency in power saving, and more nodes can be handled).
    2. Cooperative static game-theoretic approach In [48], a cooperative game is applied
    to obtain the optimal power allocation in a CDMA system. A multiuser CDMA system
    with perfectly known channel information and fixed signature and linear sequences
    is considered. The objective is to minimize power consumption given minimum SINR
    of each node. It is shown that the power region (i.e., a feasible set of power
    allocation such that the SINR requirement of each node is met) is convex and log-convex.
    If the power region is not empty, then there is a unique power allocation that
    satisfies the SINR requirements of all nodes. To obtain the unique, Pareto optimal,
    and proportional fair solution, a bargaining game similar to that in (3) is formulated
    and solved. In this case, a node''s strategy is its transmission power. The results
    show that the utility should be appropriately selected as a function of transmission
    power. The payoff function can be chosen to be u i ( s i )=− e s i , where s i
    , node i ''s strategy is the choice of transmission power. SECTION V. Game Models
    of Random Channel Access In this section, the game models for random channel access
    are reviewed. In particular, channel access based on ALOHA and CSMA/CA protocols
    are considered. A. Channel access games in ALOHA-like protocols In the literature,
    different game models, namely, noncooperative game, cooperative game, evolutionary
    game, and Stackelberg game models have been used for analyzing ALOHA-like channel
    access schemes with (and without) power control and rate adaptation. A summary
    of these game models is provided in Table V. The details of these models are described
    below. Table V Summary of ALOHA-like Channel Access Games 1. Noncooperative game-theoretic
    approach In [49], a noncooperative static game analysis is applied to the slotted
    ALOHA protocol with M selfish nodes. Actions of nodes are “To transmit” and “Not
    to transmit”. A node has the objective to maximize its expected payoff given other
    nodes'' transmission probabilities. The payoff is zero when a node chooses not
    to transmit, one when a node chooses to transmit and it is successful, and − c
    i when a node chooses to transmit but it is unsuccessful (here c i is the cost
    of unsuccessful transmission for node i ). Mixed strategy Nash equilibria are
    considered as the solutions which can be described as the transmission probability
    (i.e., the probability to perform action “To transmit” and “Not to transmit”)
    of the nodes. In [50], a noncooperative ALOHA game model is presented. The actions
    of the nodes are similar to those in [49]. However, the payoff is the utility
    defined as the difference between a logarithmic function of a node''s SINR and
    the cost of transmission. Note that the transmission power is assumed to be identical
    for all nodes. The channel gains of other nodes are unknown, and a node''s objective
    is to maximize its own expected utility. Note that only one node with the highest
    channel gain can capture the channel. Each node will gain zero payoff if it does
    not transmit. A node will transmit if its expected payoff is greater than zero.
    Bayesian Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution of the game. In a noncooperative
    ALOHA game, the Bayesian Nash equilibrium is always the threshold strategy of
    a channel gain. That is, a node will transmit if its channel gain is not lower
    than the threshold. The threshold strategy enables the system to exploit multiuser
    diversity by giving more chance of transmission to the node with better channel
    gain. To find the optimal strategy, the optimal threshold strategy has to be obtained
    first. In this model, only a symmetric case is considered where the cumulative
    distribution function (CDF) of channel gains and weights of the payoff function
    are identical for all nodes. The existence of a unique symmetric Bayesian Nash
    equilibrium is proved. Noncooperative Bayesian static ALOHA games are also presented
    in [51] and [52]. Both the game models consider interference. As in [49], a fixed
    power is assumed in both the MAC games. The nodes do not know others'' channel
    states (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)). Each node decides to transmit or not
    to transmit the data (i.e., strategies) based on the SNR. In [51], each node will
    then obtain its payoff which is the difference between the utility function of
    SNR and the cost function if its transmission is successful. The node will pay
    the cost if its transmission is unsuccessful and will gain nothing if the node
    makes a decision not to transmit data. Also, in [52], the payoff is the network
    throughput expressed as the difference between a logarithmic function of SNR and
    the cost of transmission power. Each node has an objective to maximize its expected
    payoff given a belief about other nodes'' channel states (i.e., probability density
    functions of other nodes'' SNRs or channel gains) and the transmission probabilities.
    As in [50], only symmetric case is considered, and Bayesian Nash equilibrium is
    obtained as the solution of both of these games. It is found that a node will
    transmit if its channel gain is not lower than the SNR threshold. The existence
    of a unique symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium is proved. It is mentioned in
    [52] that in the static game with symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium, a threshold
    exists such that the expected payoff of “To transmit” action is equal or greater
    than the expected payoff of “Not to transmit” action if and only if its channel
    gain is greater than the equilibrium threshold and the expected payoff is equal
    to or greater than zero. The best-response dynamics is used to obtain a pure Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium strategy. The convergence time of the best-response dynamics
    is of the order of a polynomial of number of nodes. In [53], nodes can observe
    multiple contention signals which are functions of nodes'' channel access probabilities.
    The action of each node is to select the channel access probability. The payoff
    of each node is the utility which is the difference between a function of its
    channel access probability and the cost. The cost is defined as a function of
    contention measure signals (e.g., collision probability and idle time between
    channel access). Nash equilibrium is considered as a solution. The conditions
    under which the Nash equilibrium becomes efficient are established. The utility
    functions can be defined by using reverse engineering from existing protocol and
    by using forward engineering from desired operating points and based on heuristics.
    Since a node can observe the outcome of others'' actions and payoffs indirectly,
    the node can use these observed information to update their distributed algorithms
    to converge to the Nash equilibrium. The dynamics of the random access game is
    studied. Three basic dynamic algorithms (i.e., best-response based, gradientplay
    based, and Jacobi-play based algorithms) are presented. Also, a variant of the
    basic best response-based dynamic algorithm is proposed when the propagation delay
    is taken into account. Moreover, a dynamic algorithm under estimation error is
    considered. It is proved that the stochastic gradientplay algorithm converges
    to the equilibrium point without error. A power-controlled MAC game and a random
    access game with incomplete information are presented in [54]. A node can be either
    selfish or malicious (i.e., type of node). In the power-controlled MAC game, the
    payoff of a selfish node is the expected value of the difference between a function
    of SINR and the energy cost. The payoff of a malicious node can be defined as
    two different functions depending on its opponent nodes. Two utility functions
    are considered, i.e., based on SINR and Shannon rate. Nash equilibrium is considered
    as the solution when the types of the nodes are known. On the other hand, Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution when the types of the nodes are
    unknown. Each node maximizes its expected payoff by varying its transmission power.
    A Bayesian random access game, in which the nodes transmit with probabilities
    such that their payoffs are maximized, yields the same result as that of the power-controlled
    game. The payoff of a selfish node is the expected value from successful and unsuccessful
    transmissions. Also, each node dynamically updates its belief about the opponent''s
    type using Bayes'' rule. Similar to [54], in [55], both random access game and
    power control game are studied. First, a random access game is presented. The
    payoff of node i is calculated based on the expected payoff when it transmits
    data, and the expected utility when it waits for transmission. A dynamic random
    access game is considered. At each stage of the game, nodes follow a mixed strategy
    (i.e., transmit or wait). Each node maximizes its payoff by choosing the transmission
    probability appropriately. The decision at each stage can be described as a state
    (i.e., the number of backlogged nodes) which is a general property of Markov games.
    Given the state information, the Markov perfect equilibrium at each stage of the
    game can be computed as the Nash equilibrium of the mixed strategy game. Cooperation
    among the nodes yields a higher payoff than that at the Nash equilibrium. Next,
    a power control game is presented. Unlike the mixed strategy of transmitting or
    waiting in the random access game, power control is the mixed strategy of each
    node in the power control game. Each node selects its transmission probability
    with different power levels from a feasible set of power levels to maximize its
    expected payoff. This payoff depends on the probability that the captured power
    level at the receiver belongs to any node i . Similar to the power control game,
    in a rate adaptation game, each node selects the probabilities of employing different
    modulation schemes (i.e., using different transmission rates) that maximize its
    payoff. This payoff depends on the probability that the captured rate belongs
    to any node i :. Zero power level or zero transmission rate can be considered
    as the action of waiting for a transmission. To this end, a joint power control
    and rate adaptation game is formulated. Nodes determine their equilibrium strategies
    which are both the power level and transmission rate maximizing their expected
    payoffs. Numerical results show that power and rate control game improves the
    expected utilities compared to the random access game discussed in the same paper.
    However, the joint power and rate control game incurs a higher computational complexity.
    In all the above works, it is assumed that the network has the single packet reception
    capability only. In contrast, in [56], a noncooperative game model is developed
    for optimal decentralized transmission control in a slotted ALOHA-like protocol
    for a finite-size random wireless network having the multipacket reception capability.
    The objective of each node in the network is to optimize its transmission probability
    such that its own utility is maximized. It is proved that, for a node, when the
    probability of successful transmission is a non-decreasing function of the corresponding
    SINR, there exists a threshold transmission policy which maximizes its utility.
    Subsequently, it is shown that there exists a Nash equilibrium at which every
    node adopts a threshold policy. 2. Incompletely-cooperative game-theoretic approach
    In [57], a game-theoretic model of a slotted ALOHA-like MAC is presented. The
    model considers nodes with traffic of either high-priority (HP) or low-priority
    (LP). Since the nodes transmitting low priority traffic can experience an unfair
    channel access (i.e., HP packets have higher probability to be transmitted than
    that of LP packets), selfish nodes can cheat by classifying the low priority traffic
    as high priority traffic to gain performance improvement. To solve this problem,
    an access point (AP) can decide the size of contention phase (CP) and contention
    free phase (CFP). In the contention phase, LP queues contend for channel with
    probability q while HP queues contend with probability p>q . The access point
    can switch to a contention-free phase for a fraction of the time α to poll the
    n LP nodes. Then, the throughput that each LP node receives during CFP is α/n
    as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. High and low priority queues access the channel with
    different probabilities during contention phase and low priority nodes are polled
    equally during contention-free phase. Show All Average delay and throughput are
    used to compute the utility of HP and LP nodes, respectively. Nash equilibrium,
    which is a solution of this game, is any fraction of time α in which the throughput
    of nodes with LP traffic pretending to be the HP traffic is lower than the throughput
    of truthful nodes with LP traffic. Therefore, Nash equilibrium is the point where
    none of the nodes has an incentive to lie about its traffic type. The access point
    can choose a value of α from an admissible range to ensure the truthful Nash equilibrium.
    This point can be chosen as the Nash bargaining solution from cooperative game
    theory. In [58], a pricing-based noncooperative slotted ALOHA MAC game is presented.
    The key idea of this game is to motivate the nodes to cooperate with each other
    by using a pricing mechanism in the payoff function so that the multiuser diversity
    gain can be achieved. A static game is proposed in which the actions of each player
    i∈I={1,…,M} are “To transmit” and “Not to transmit”. If a player successfully
    transmits its packet(s), the payoff is 1− c i − μ i , where c i is the cost of
    transmission and μ i is the price charged per successful packet transmission.
    If the transmission is unsuccessful, the payoff is − c i − v i . If a player chooses
    not to transmit and it waits, the payoff is − v i , where v i is the waiting cost
    which is defined as 1− c i − μ i . In this game, each node maximizes its payoff
    given the medium access probabilities of all nodes. The probabilities of medium
    access are identical for all nodes since a fair game is considered. To maximize
    the expected payoff, a node will choose “To transmit” when the expected utility
    of “To transmit” action is not lower than that of “Not to transmit” action. Nash
    equilibrium, which is considered as a solution, can be found to be of threshold
    type. The equilibrium threshold is the cost of the corresponding action. Therefore,
    the transmission is successful only if there is exactly one transmitting node
    and transmission cost is smaller than the equilibrium threshold. 3. Evolutionary
    game-theoretic approach In [59], an evolutionary game-theoretic model is formulated
    for ALOHA protocol. An evolutionary game is a dynamic game where players interact
    with other players and adapt their strategies based on payoff (fitness). The dynamics
    (i.e., stability) of the population adopting different strategies is studied.
    Also, an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) is considered. In the evolutionary
    game model, if an ESS is reached, the proportions of population adopting different
    strategies do not change over time. In particular, the population with ESS is
    immune from being invaded by a population with non-ESS strategy. The effect of
    time delay on the dynamics of the evolutionary game model is studied. Similar
    to the other ALOHA games, each player has two possible strategies (i.e., “To transmit”
    and “Not to transmit”). For the two-player case, if a player transmits a packet,
    it incurs a transmission cost (c∈(0,1)) irrespective of whether the transmission
    is successful or not. The payoffs are 1−c,0 , and −c if the player has a successful
    transmission, no transmission, and collision, respectively. It is found that this
    game has two pure Nash equilibria (i.e., (Player I - Transmit, Player II - Not
    to transmit) and (Player I - Not to transmit, Player II - Transmit)) and one mixed
    Nash equilibrium (1−c,c) where 1−c and c represent proportions of individuals
    which transmit and do not transmit, respectively. The strategy (1−c,c) can also
    be an ESS since this strategy is a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium. 4. Stackelberg
    game-theoretic approach In [60], slotted ALOHA protocols are analyzed using game
    theory. The model considers throughput of the system when nodes are of self-interest
    and compete for bandwidth using a generalized version of slotted-ALOHA protocols.
    First, an analysis based on a two-state Markov model is presented when the nodes
    cooperate to equally share the bandwidth and maximize the system throughput. The
    states are “Free state” when the most recent transmission of node is successful,
    and “Backlogged state” when the most recent transmission is unsuccessful due to
    collision. The results show that the lower bound of aggregated throughput is one
    half and this bound is independent of the number of nodes. Next, an analysis is
    presented for the case when the nodes are selfish to maximize their own throughputs.
    Since in this case all nodes transmit with probability one, the system throughput
    will be zero. Next, a Stackelberg game model is presented. A leader is any node
    that takes the selfish nodes (i.e., the followers) into account. The follower
    and leader nodes choose their best strategies (i.e., transmission probabilities
    in both states) by maximizing their throughputs (i.e., payoffs) subject to constraints
    on the budgets of the nodes. The budget should be higher than the cost of transmission.
    The followers maximize their throughputs based on the leader''s strategy while
    the leader maximizes its own throughput according to the best response strategies
    of followers. Backward induction is used to find the Stackelberg equilibrium.
    The leader achieves a higher throughput than that of the followers when the budget
    is large. B. Channel Access Games in CSMAICA Systems In this section, the game
    models formulated for analyzing CSMA/CA-based channel access are reviewed. The
    solution of a CSMA/CA game describes how the nodes in the network should choose
    their backoff windows so that the equilibrium point can be reached. Noncooperative
    static game-theoretic approach, noncooperative dynamic game approach, and repeated
    game approach can be used to model and analyze CSMA/CA systems. Since the nodes
    are selfish, to maximize their payoffs, the nodes may set the backoff windows
    to the smallest value. However, if all the nodes do so, the network throughput
    will be zero due to collision. To avoid this problem, incompletelycooperative
    game models are used in which the nodes are enforced to cooperate in the system
    by using a penalizing mechanism. A summary of these approaches is provided in
    Table VI. The details are described below. Table VI Summary of CSMA/CA Channel
    Access Games 1. Noncooperative static game-theoretic approach In [51], a medium
    access contention game model is formulated for the CSMA protocol. Similar to the
    slotted ALOHA protocol, the possible results from transmission attempts of each
    node are successful transmission, collision, and no-transmission. Transmission
    after k backoff slots is added to the action space of each node. The action set
    is A={1,…,K,K+1} , where k∈K=A∖{K+1}={1,…,K} denotes transmitting at slot k and
    index K+1 denotes the action of not-transmitting a packet. The payoff function
    of node i is the difference between the utility and the cost of transmission if
    this node selects a backoff slot number which is less than the backoff slot number
    of each of the other nodes. Node i : incus a cost of transmission if a collision
    occurs, that is, when the earliest backoff slot chosen by one (or more) of the
    other nodes is the same as that of node i . Node i gains nothing if it selects
    a backoff slot number greater than the lowest backoff slot number among the other
    nodes. The nodes play the game by maximizing their expected payoffs (similar to
    the ALOHA game models discussed in Section V-A1 before) given the type spaces
    (i.e., channel SNR, h) and beliefs (i.e., probabilities of channel states of other
    nodes, P −i ( h −i ) ). A symmetric mixed strategy (in terms of the probability
    that the node will not transmit at the first k∈K slots) Bayesian Nash equilibrium
    is found for this single-stage (static) Bayesian game. In [61], CSMA/CA is first
    modeled as a static game and then as a dynamic game (e.g., Bayesian learning game
    with incomplete information). In the static game, the action can be “To transmit”
    or “Not to transmit” (i.e., wait). after node i selects its action, the utility
    of node i is calculated as a function of status of the packet transmission and
    actions of all nodes. The status can be “idle” (i.e., no transmission), “successful”,
    or “fail” (i.e., collision). If the nodes “decide to transmit at the beginning
    of a given slot with probability p i “ or “stay quiet with probability 1− p i
    , for the same transmission probability by all nodes (i.e., symmetric behaviour),
    there is a unique solution of this static game ( s ∗ 1 =⋯= s ∗ i =⋯= s ∗ M = p
    ∗ ) which is a symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium given as follows: s ∗
    i =1− ( u w − u f u s − u f ) 1 M−1 (21) View Source where there are M nodes in
    the system and u s , u f , and u w are the payoffs that a node obtains if its
    status is successful, failed, and idle, respectively. The dynamic game model for
    CSMA/CA will be described in Section V-B2. In [62], a noncooperative game theoretic
    model is presented for contention control in a point-to-multipoint network (e.g.,
    WiMAX network). Multiple subscriber stations (SSs) are connected to a base station.
    A time-division duplex mode for wireless access is used for best-effort traffic.
    To provide multiple access services, a node has a limited number of time slots
    to transmit request messages (REQs). The node enters a contention resolution process
    when it has packets to send. The node sets its backoff counter (i.e., the number
    of slots that the node needs to wait before it transmits an REQ). If an REQ is
    successfully received and there is enough bandwidth, then the node can transmit
    data without collision in the scheduled time slots. The transmission is unsuccessful
    if a permission is not received by the node from the base station within a defined
    period of time, in which case, a new exponential backoff process is started. The
    objective here is to obtain high throughput by avoiding collision in the system.
    This can be achieved by gradually adjusting the contention windows of all contending
    nodes to the optimal values. The game in [62] considers a saturated system (i.e.,
    nodes always have packets to transmit). The channel access probability of node
    i can be found to be p i =2/(C W i +1) where C W i is a constant contention window
    of node i . The utility function has to be continuously differentiable, strictly
    concave, and with finite curvatures bounded away from zero. The utility is chosen
    to be a function of channel access probability which is the strategy of a node.
    The cost of transmission is the probability of collision ( p i , q i (p)) , where
    q i (i) is the conditional collision probability of node i . In the game, the
    utility function is defined as follows: μ( p i )= ln( p i )− p i / w i 1/ v i
    −1/ w i . (22) View Source u( p i ) is an increasing function in the strategy
    space of node i (i.e., channel access probability ( p i ) ) where p i ∈[ v i ,
    w i ] and 0< v i < w i <1 . The payoff function is then u( p i )=μ( p i )− p i
    q i (p) . Nash equilibrium (defined as p ∗ ) is the solution of the game. The
    proof of the existence of unique non-trivial Nash equilibrium (i.e., u i ( p ∗
    i )= q i ( p ∗ ) , where q i (i) is the conditional collision probability of node
    i .), is provided. The best-response play and gradient play algorithms are presented
    to obtain the Nash equilibrium solution. The results show that, with this algorithm,
    a higher throughput is achieved with fewer transmissions than that of standard
    binary exponential backofff protocol. 2. Noncooperative dynamic game-theoretic
    approach The single-stage CSMA Bayesian game in [51] described before is extended
    to a dynamic game where the static one-stage game is played repeatedly. The action
    of node i , can be either to transmit a packet or not to transmit a packet based
    on node i ''s channel gain h i and node i . ''s type. K stages associated with
    K backoff slots are considered in this Bayesian dynamic game. At stage k∈{1,…,K}
    , if node i successfully transmits its packet, it will obtain the payoff function,
    μ i ( h i )− c i ( h i ) where μ i is the utility function and c i ( h i ) is
    the cost function. If node i unsuccessfully transmits its packet, it will pay
    − c i ( h i ) as a cost of transmission; otherwise, node i gains nothing (i.e.,
    zero payoff). If there is no transmission, the stage of the game increases from
    k to k+1 . When there is at least one transmission at any stage k , the game ends.
    Each node maximizes its expected payoff from stage 1 to k to obtain the perfect
    Bayesian equilibrium (PBE). A symmetric PBE is considered since it is a proper
    operating point of a distributed protocol for the following reasons. First, it
    might not be possible to distinguish among nodes in the random access network.
    Second, asymmetric PBE is not sustainable since it causes unfairness problem by
    assigning unequal shares of channel to the nodes. Third, it is much simpler to
    operate a network with a single strategy in a symmetric equilibrium for all nodes
    than to operate a network with different strategies for different nodes. The symmetric
    PBE is shown to be a threshold strategy. That is, any node i : decides to transmit
    at stage k when its SNR is greater than SNR threshold h k th (i.e., h i > h k
    th ). The numerical results show that the proposed protocols provide better robustness
    and higher multi-user diversity gain than those of conventional random access
    protocols. The static game is extended to a dynamic Bayesian-learning game with
    the unknown number of contending nodes in [61] (i.e., the static game is played
    repeatedly). There are maximum of M nodes in the system. These nodes compete for
    transmission at the beginning of a time slot. Fairness requirement is considered.
    In order to maximize the payoffs of the nodes, only symmetric strategy with s
    ∗ 1 =⋯= s ∗ i =⋯= s ∗ M = p ∗ , which is the probability of transmission, is considered.
    Each time slot corresponds to a stage in this dynamic game. Since the number of
    contending nodes is unknown, each node needs to observe the feedbacks from its
    previous play. Then, the node can build its belief about the network using Bayes''
    rule. It is assumed that all nodes can keep track of their historical information
    perfectly. Three counters (i.e., the total number of passed time slots, the total
    number of successfully transmitted data packets, and the number of times that
    ACK control-frame is not received in a pre-defined time space after transmitting
    the data packet) are used to compute the belief. The current packet transmission
    probability and the frame collision probability of each node can be computed by
    these three counters under the assumption that all nodes always have packets to
    transmit. Each node has to listen to the channel to receive any possible packet
    from its neighbouring nodes when it is idle. after that, each node can obtain
    the posterior belief of the number of concurrently contending nodes (n) for the
    channel by using both the transmission and collision probabilities (i.e., p and
    q , respectively) as follows: n=f(p,q)=1+ log(1−q) log(1−p) . (23) View Source
    It is found that the equilibrium optimal solution of this game depends on the
    number of contending nodes n . The transmission probability can be varied according
    to the following equation in which only contention parameter C W min (i.e., minimum
    contention window) is considered: p= 2(1−2q) (1−2q)(C W min +1)+q.C W min .(1−(2q
    ) n ) (24) View Source where C W min =min([n×rand(7,8)],C W max ),rand(x,y) returns
    a random value between x and y , and n is the number of concurrently contending
    nodes. The game state n can be then updated using (23) after a node updates its
    beliefs. Simulation results show that the performance of the dynamic CSMA game-based
    MAC is superior to the IEEE 802.11 DCF MAC in terms of throughput, delay, and
    packet-loss rate. Another dynamic game model for CSMA/CA is proposed in [63],
    where the probabilities of transmission are the strategies of the nodes. Each
    node estimates its conditional collision probability and adjusts the persistence
    probability. The payoff of each node is the difference between the utility when
    the node accesses the channel with probability p i , and the cost (i.e., probability
    of collision). For a network with homogeneous nodes, the game model has a unique
    nontrivial Nash equilibrium which is a symmetric equilibrium. This guarantees
    fair sharing of wireless channel among the same class of nodes. Next, the dynamics
    of the game is studied. Although one node can observe the outcome of other nodes,
    it does not have complete knowledge of actions and payoffs of other nodes. Every
    node adjusts its current channel access probability gradually in the gradient
    direction based on the observations of other nodes'' actions. Then, the Nash equilibrium
    can be reached. Based on the dynamics of this random access game, a new MAC protocol
    based on CSMA/CA is proposed. Instead of executing exponential backoff upon collisions,
    each node estimates its collision probability and contention window according
    to gradient play. Each node can estimate its conditional collision probability
    by observing the average number of consecutive idle slots. Therefore, the size
    of contention window can be adjusted accordingly. Throughput and shortterm fairness
    of the proposed MAC protocol are better than those of the IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol.
    Service differentiation is also considered. When there is more than one class
    of nodes, the throughput ratio can converge to a constant when the total number
    of nodes increases. 3. Incompletely-cooperative game-theoretic approach In [64],
    a CSMA/CA-based MAC game model is presented for dynamic spectrum access in a cognitive
    radio network. This game model can be divided into two sub-games. The first subgame
    is a channel allocation game in which the nodes compete to allocate radio interfaces
    to the channels. The second subgame is a multiple access game among the nodes
    contending to transmit packets in the same channel. The available frequency band
    is divided into K channels of the same bandwidth. Each node is equipped with l
    radio interfaces (for l<K ). Each node can hear other nodes'' transmissions if
    the same channel is used. Each node determines the number of interfaces to be
    used in each channel. This is the action of nodes in the first sub-game of channel
    allocation. Each node maximizes its utility function which is the sum of throughputs
    achieved by the node in all allocated channels. Each node can observe other nodes''
    information perfectly. The solution of the channel allocation game is the Nash
    equilibrium if the difference between the number of interfaces in any channel
    x and that in any other channel y is lower than or equal to 1. Also, the number
    of interfaces allocated to any channel x by node i is lower than or equal to 1
    for any channel y . It is found that if the rate function of each channel is independent
    of the number of interfaces in any channel, then any Nash equilibrium of channel
    allocation is Pareto optimal. The existence of Nash equilibrium is shown and its
    efficiency (i.e., price of anarchy) is studied. It is found that the price of
    anarchy is close to one (i.e., Nash equilibrium yields a payoff close to that
    of the socially optimal solution). Next, the second sub-game for CSMA/CA channel
    contention is formulated. This sub-game aims not only to optimize the network
    performance, but also to provide incentives to the nodes to behave optimally.
    The actions of the nodes are “To transmit”, “Not to transmit”, and “To backoff”
    in which a contention window value between one and the maximum value is chosen
    by a node. Node i selects the value of contention window on each channel c to
    maximize its throughput (i.e., payoff). The static CSMA/CA game shows that the
    Nash equilibrium (i.e., contention window is chosen to be one) is inefficient
    and unfair. A desirable solution for the CSMA/CA game should have three properties:
    uniqueness, per-radio fairness, and Pareto optimality. Using the Nash bargaining
    framework from the cooperative game theory, these three properties can be achieved.
    However, in the noncooperative regime, the Nash bargaining solution is not a Nash
    equilibrium and might not be stable. Therefore, a penalizing mechanism is introduced
    by which the node deviating from Nash bargaining solution will be punished. A
    jamming mechanism is presented to penalize the deviating node. The deviating node
    is selectively jammed for a short duration by other nodes using the same channel
    when the deviating node is detected doing selfishly for its transmission. Using
    the penalty function and the jamming mechanism, the game can reach a Nash equilibrium
    unilateral deviation from which is not profitable. A distributed algorithm is
    proposed to obtain the Pareto-optimal Nash equilibria. The algorithm can converge
    to the equilibrium point even in case of imperfect information. The algorithm
    is based on a round-based distributed algorithm [65]. Also, a coordination algorithm
    is proposed for CSMA/CA in which one node acts as a coordinator for the observed
    channel by inflicting penalties to the other nodes which receive a higher throughput.
    In [66], an incompletely cooperative game model is presented for wireless mesh
    networks. The routers and clients communicate wirelessly with each other in a
    mesh architecture. CSMA/CA is used as a channel access mechanism. Since a packet
    can be retransmitted only for a certain number of times, the game model can be
    formulated as a finite repeated game. The number of opponents can be estimated
    by using conditional collision probability and transmission probability. These
    probabilities are computed by the node using two local counters (the total number
    of successfully transmitted data frames and the total number of transmitted data
    frames which are unsuccessful). However, these estimations are accurate only under
    saturated conditions (i.e., nodes always have packets to transmit). A virtual
    CSMA/CA mechanism, V-CSMA/CA is proposed. V-CSMA/CA follows the CSMA/CA scheme
    but it handles virtual frames. V-CSMA/CA will send a virtual frame and then the
    probability of collision is estimated. If the channel is idle, the node will observe
    that the virtual frame is successfully transmitted. A collision of virtual frame
    will be detected whenever any other node chooses the same time slot for transmission
    of their real data frame. If the node has no packet to transmit, the game state
    is estimated by using V-CSMA/CA. If the node has packets to transmit, the game
    state is estimated by using CSMA/CA. In the analysis of the game, a player is
    not always fixed. That is, Player 1 stands for node i and Player 2 stands for
    all other opponent nodes. The actions of Player 1 are “Transmission” and “Backoff”.
    The actions of Player 2 are “Successful Transmission” (i.e., Player 1 selects
    “Backoff” and none of the nodes in the group of Player 2 selects “Transmission”),
    “Unsuccessful Transmission” (i.e., Player 1 selects “Backoff”, but a node in the
    group of Player 2 selects “Transmission”), or “Backoff” as shown in Fig. 5. μ
    i b , μ i f , and μ i s are utility obtained when Player i chooses to backoff,
    to transmit and transmission is successful, and to transmit but transmission fails,
    respectively. The optimal strategy of each player ( s ∗ i ) can be found by minimizing
    its payoff by varying the transmission probability p i . It can be considered
    as a mixed strategy solution. Then, the cooperation among the nodes considered.
    In a two-node scenario, one node adjusts its transmission probability to help
    the other node to achieve the optimal payoff (i.e., p ∗ 1 =arg min p 1 u 1 ( p
    2 , p 1 ) and p ∗ 2 =arg min p 2 u 2 ( p 1 , p 2 ) , where u 1 (⋅) and u 2 (⋅)
    are payoff functions of Players 1 and 2 which are based on each other''s utility
    of transmission, respectively. Fig. 5. Strategies of two players when Player 1
    is nodeand Player 2 refers to all opponent nodes [66]. Show All The transmission
    probabilities can be changed by tuning the MAC contention parameters as in [61].
    after estimating the game state, the mesh router broadcasts its estimated information
    to all nodes. Since in a dynamic network frequent information updates are needed,
    this may result in large overhead. To reduce the overhead, a distributed approach
    is used by each node to detect the channel, estimate the game state, and adjust
    the contention parameters. Moreover, the estimation is performed after a packet
    is transmitted or a packet is discarded (rather than in every time slot). Also,
    the contention parameter is adjusted accordingly. The simulation results show
    that the incompletely cooperative game can improve throughput and decrease delay,
    jitter, and packet loss rate. The fairness of this game is comparable to that
    of the IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol. 4. lncomoletelv-coooerative repeated game-theoretic
    ap- 5. proach In [67], a game-theoretic study of CSMA/CA under a backoff attack
    is presented. An enforcement mechanism is introduced for the misbehaving nodes
    in the network. Although this enforcement mechanism is similar to that in [64],
    here it is used in the context of a mobile ad hoc network and the game formulation
    is for a repeated game in which a long-term utility is to be maximized. First,
    a noncooperative game is formulated for a finite number of nodes. Each node chooses
    an action which is a backoff configuration from a feasible set. The payoff function
    is defined to be the bandwidth share function depending on the backoff configuration
    profile (s=( s 1 ,…, s i ,…, s M )) . Nash equilibrium is the solution of this
    one-shot noncooperative game which might be unfair or inefficient. Therefore,
    to obtain a better solution, a repeated game is proposed in which a node takes
    into account the effect of its current action on the future actions of other nodes.
    The number of stages is finite and should be large enough to approach the steady
    state values. Nodes can switch between standard or non-standard backoff configuration
    (i.e., fair or more-than-fair bandwidth share, respectively) to maximize their
    own long-term payoffs. To prevent the backoff attack and to obtain a fair Pareto
    optimal and sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium, a strategy profile called cooperation
    via randomized inclination to self-ish/greedy play (CRISP) is introduced. This
    optimal solution is a probability distribution over the selected backoff configuration
    at stage k( s k i ) . An invader node deviating from CRISP will experience lower
    bandwidth than that of nodes playing CRISP. SECTION VI. Summary of Game Models
    and Open Research Issues A. Summary of Game Models Table VII summarizes the game
    models formulated for the key multiple access mechanisms. In the channel access
    games for TDMA, nodes compete with each other to obtain time slots for their transmissions.
    Time slot allocation among the nodes is performed by using various game models.
    In the auction game models, the nodes bid for time slots and they have to pay
    to the base stations for the allocated time slots. Game models can be formulated
    in which the nodes are able to choose transmission power in their allocated time
    slots. To enforce cooperation among the nodes, a punishment and truthtelling mechanism
    can be used. Table VII Summary of Channel Access Games In the channel access games
    for FDMA, most of the models consider how nodes (with single or multiple radio
    interfaces) choose channels for transmission. In these game formulations, the
    number of radios, transmit rate, and power rate assigned to each channel correspond
    to nodes'' actions. In the channel access games for CDMA, power control is the
    key objective of all the proposed games. Both cooperative and noncooperative games
    can be formulated. Nodes select their transmission powers to meet their requirements
    in terms of SINR and transmission cost. In most of the ALOHA-like game models,
    the nodes can choose either “To transmit” or “Not to transmit” as their possible
    actions and the transmission powers of the nodes are assumed to be fixed. Then,
    the games have mixed strategy solutions. Some of the games can be shown to have
    solutions which are threshold strategies. In some of the CSMA/CA game models,
    the actions are “To transmit” and “To wait for k backoff time slots”. The solutions
    of these game models are mixed strategies (i.e., the transmitting probability
    of nodes at the first k time slots). In some CSMA/CA-like MAC game models, the
    action set of nodes is defined as transmission probabilities. In addition, most
    of the CSMA/CA-like MAC game models consider only the symmetric strategy case
    by assuming that all nodes are identical and throughput maximization is the key
    objective. Since in random access schemes, nodes access the channel(s) in a distributed
    manner, some nodes may misbehave. A penalizing mechanisms is required to address
    this problem. A summary of game models for contention-free channel access approaches
    is shown in Table VIII and a summary of game models for random channel access
    approaches is shown in Table IX. Table VIII Game theory models for contention-free
    channel access Table IX Game models for random channel access B. Open Research
    Issues Based on the summary of the game models presented in the previous section,
    several open research issues on the application of game theoretic models for design,
    analysis, and optimization of multiple access schemes for wireless networks can
    be identified as follows: Investigation of different equilibrium concepts: Many
    works in channel access games only study Nash equilibrium as the solution concept.
    However, Nash equilibrium does not always provide the best network performance.
    Therefore, other equilibrium concepts need to be inves-tigated. For example, Nash
    bargaining solution, which is Pareto optimal, can be considered for efficiency
    and fairness reasons. Another solution is correlated equilibrium which is a more
    general equilibrium concept than the Nash equilibrium and also incurs less computational
    complexity. It can be computed in polynomial time for essentially all kinds of
    multi-player games. Utility and cost function design: In the application of game
    theory to multiple channel access, utility and cost indicate, respectively, the
    preference of players to be maximized and to be minimized for channel access.
    There are many different functions used to represent payoff of players in channel
    access games. Comparisons among the utility functions in terms of performance
    and effectiveness may be required. Also, the utility functions should consider
    system parameters such as the priorities of packets, amount of battery power available,
    and application-layer QoS parameters. To obtain suitable utility functions that
    can converge to desirable equilibria, reverse engineering from existing protocols,
    desired operating points, or forward engineering from heuristics [68] can be used.
    Cooperation enforcement mechanism: In random channel access games, many works
    propose cooperation enforcement mechanisms in noncooperative scenarios. Penalizing
    and pricing mechanisms are introduced. However, the complexity and implementation
    issues of these mechanisms (e.g., jamming and detection mechanisms) need to be
    investigated while developing practical protocols. In this case, a pricing mechanism
    may be preferred over a penalizing mechanism since pricing schemes are easier
    to be implemented by service providers. Uncertainty in wireless and mobile networks
    and accuracy of available information: Some game models are formulated as dynamic
    or repeated games in order to analyze the outcomes in long-run periods. Most games
    assume that the number of nodes in the network is constant; however, in realistic
    scenarios, the number of nodes changes over time (i.e., nodes leave or join the
    network). In random channel access games, the number of nodes can be estimated
    by using probabilities of packet transmission and collision. It might be acceptable
    if the time duration of one stage of the game is short or the game is not played
    infinitely. However, it is not completely true for all games. Moreover, most games
    assume that the nodes completely know other nodes'' information. The assumption
    may not always hold in a mobile wireless network. Then, unknown information has
    to be estimated based on some available knowledge of mobiles and their belief
    models (i.e., probability distribution). Currently, there are few works using
    game-theoretic approaches with incomplete information. Bayesian game and Bayesian-learning
    mechanism are useful tools to study the multiple access problem under incomplete
    information. More works in this area are required to model and analyze distributed
    multiple access methods in large-scale wireless networks. Cost of information:
    The Bayesian Nash equilibrium for incomplete information game may be inefficient
    due to the lack of complete information. Nodes can implement the information gathering
    mechanism so that a better decision can be made. However, the cost of information
    collection needs to be considered and a cost-benefit analysis needs to be performed.
    Develop defense mechanisms against multiple access attack: Defending attacks from
    untrusted nodes is an important research issue in wireless networks. Malicious
    nodes prevent other nodes from accessing the network (i.e., denial-of-service
    (DoS) attack). For example, jamming attack is a form of DoS attack. There are
    some channel access games which take security issues into consideration. However,
    most of these game-theoretic models analyze the interactions between pairs of
    jammers and communicating nodes or between pairs of jammers and detecting nodes
    when an intrusion detection system (IDS) is deployed [69] [70]. A few researches
    such as those in [71]–[73] formulate games between jammers and communicating nodes
    in order to analyze equilibrium points as defense strategies against jamming attacks.
    More researches in this area are required. For example, we can formulate a noncooperative
    game with incomplete information when types of nodes such as selfish, malicious,
    or defending (i.e., when IDS is deployed) are incompletely known to other nodes.
    Multiple access in heterogeneous wireless networks: Channel allocation and multiple
    access problem in a heterogeneous wireless access network can be modeled by using
    game theory. In a heterogeneous network, the service providers for the different
    wireless access networks as well as the mobile users (who are able to access the
    different networks using multiple radio interfaces) may cooperate or compete with
    each other. Game theoretic modeling and analysis of the interactions among the
    mobile nodes and service providers is an interesting research topic. Again, in
    a heterogeneous network where a bi-Ievel hierarchy exists (e.g., in a cellular
    network where macrocells are underlaid with femtocells), transmission power and
    rate control problem (e.g., by the macro base stations and the femto access points)
    for multiple access can be modeled by using game theory, and an optimal multiple
    access method can be designed. Develop application-centric game models for multiple
    access: Traditional multiple access schemes may not be efficient in some specific
    wireless access scenarios such as in vehicular networks and wireless sensor networks.
    There are two steps in designing MAC protocols for a specific application [74].
    First, the application requirements and the resource constraints are specified.
    Next, a protocol that satisfies all these constraints is designed. For example,
    in vehicular networks, high mobility that causes the topology of the network to
    vary rapidly is one of the application specifications, and transmission delay
    (i.e., emergency messaging delay) is an application requirement. Limited bandwidth
    due to high vehicle mobility and vehicle density is one of the resource constraints.
    These specifications and requirements need to be considered when designing a multiple
    access method for vehicular networks. For a game theoretic multiple access scheme,
    the utility functions for the players should take the related parameters into
    account. Due to the applications'' specific requirements and specifications, developing
    game models for application-centric multiple access is more challenging. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion Game theory has been widely used to model and analyze the noncooperative
    and cooperative behaviours of mobile nodes in the context of multiple access in
    wireless networks. The game models are useful for designing distributed channel
    access mechanisms in wireless networks to achieve stable and efficient solutions.
    This article has presented a comprehensive survey of the game models developed
    for multiple access in wireless networks. These game models have been categorized
    based on the types of protocols (e.g., contentionfree or contention-based) and
    types of games (e.g., complete and incomplete information, and static and dynamic
    games). The major findings from these game models have been discussed. Unavailability
    of complete information, misbehaviour of nodes, consideration of system (i.e.,
    implementation) aspects give rise to major challenges in designing game theoretic
    design of multiple access schemes in wireless networks. From these perspectives,
    several open research directions have been outlined. Authors Figures References

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: A green-energy-powered cognitive radio (CR) network
    is capable of liberating the wireless access networks from spectral and energy
    constraints. The limitation of the spectrum is alleviated by exploiting cognitive
    networking in which wireless nodes sense and utilize the spare spectrum for data
    communications, whereas dependence on the traditional unsustainable energy is
    assuaged by adopting energy harvesting through which green energy can be harnessed
    to power wireless networks. Green-energy-powered CR increases the network availability
    and thus extends emerging network applications. Designing green CR networks is
    challenging. It requires not only the optimization of dynamic spectrum access
    but also the optimal utilization of green energy. This paper surveys the energy-efficient
    CR techniques and the optimization of green-energy-powered wireless networks.
    Existing works on energy-aware spectrum sensing, management, and sharing are investigated
    in detail. The state of the art of the energy-efficient CR-based wireless access
    network is discussed in various aspects, such as relay and cooperative radio and
    small cells. Envisioning green energy as an important energy resource in the future,
    network performance highly depends on the dynamics of the available spectrum and
    green energy. As compared with the traditional energy source, the arrival rate
    of green energy, which highly depends on the environment of the energy harvesters,
    is rather random and intermittent. To optimize and adapt the usage of green energy
    according to the opportunistic spectrum availability, we discuss research challenges
    in designing CR networks that are powered by energy harvesters. Published in:

    WIRELESS access networks are among the major energy guzzlers of the telecommunications
    infrastructure, and their current rate of power consumption is escalating because
    of the explosive surge of mobile data traffic [1], [2]. Therefore, greening wireless
    access networks will not only decrease the operational expenditures (OPEX), but
    also improve the sustainability of information communications technology (ICT).
    Greening wireless access networks can capitalize on the broad paradigm of cognitive
    radio (CR). Haykin [3] has precisely defined CR as “A cognitive radio transmitter
    will learn from the environment and adapt its internal states to statistical variations
    in the existing radio frequency (RF) stimuli by adjusting the transmission parameters
    (e.g., frequency band, modulation mode, and transmission power) in real-time and
    on-line manner.” With the cognitive capability to detect the available spectrum
    and the reconfigurability to dynamically access spectrum over which less fading
    and interference is experienced, the intelligent CR communication system enhances
    the spectrum agility and energy efficiency [4]. Among many areas of wireless systems
    that can be improved via CR, existing literature primary focuses on improving
    spectrum efficiency rather than energy utilization, let alone the unreliable dynamic
    energy. Zhao and Sadler [5] presented an overview of the dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA), which differentiates the CR wireless system from legacy wireless systems,
    which are licensed to operate in a dedicated operating frequency band. Various
    functionalities of CR are introduced in [6], [7]. While researchers in [8]– [10]
    discussed spectrum sensing, which enables CR to seek and access the spectrum opportunities,
    Wang et al. [11] surveyed various applications which can take advantages of the
    DSA feature of CR, and Akyildiz et al. [12] discussed the CR-based wireless access
    network architecture. Different from current CR networks powered by the reliable
    on-grid or un-rechargeable energy source, continuous advances in green energy
    have motivated us to focus on the energy efficiency and investigate the green
    powered cognitive radio (green CR) network. The concept of energy harvester has
    been proposed to capture and store ambient energy to generate electricity or other
    energy form, which is renewable and more environmentally friendly than that derived
    from fossil fuels [13], [14]. If the green energy source is ample and stable in
    the sense of availability, the cognitive radio network can be powered to opportunistically
    exploit the underutilized spectrum by harnessing free energy without requiring
    energy supplement from external power grid or battery. Fig. 1. A taxonomy of dynamic
    spectrum access (expanded and adopted from [5], [15]). Show All It is, however,
    not trivial to design and optimize the green energy enabled CR networks owing
    to the opportunistic arrival of idle spectrum and free energy in reality. This
    survey concisely summarizes the state-of-the-art research in energy efficient
    cognitive radio systems from three aspects: 1) achieving power aware functionality
    in the CR systems, 2) designing energy efficient wireless access systems via cognitive
    radio, and 3) optimizing green CR networks. Although green powered wireless networks
    currently are not deployed at a large scale owing to the higher cost per watt
    than the grid energy, powering wireless networks by green energy is imminent and
    is becoming a sustainable and economically friendly solution. The aim of this
    article is to provide some insights for future research in green powered dynamic
    spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks, which are capable of liberating
    wireless access networks from spectral and energy constraints. The rest of the
    paper is organized as follows. After reviewing the fundamental concepts of cognitive
    radio and dynamic spectrum access, we provide 1) a summary of energy efficient
    spectrum sensing, spectrum management and handoff, and spectrum sharing methods
    for cognitive radio systems in Section II. This is followed by 2) the current
    and future trends of cognitive radio based wireless access networks, e.g., energy
    efficient relay/cooperation cognitive radio system and cognitive small cells,
    in Section III. Then, 3) the energy-harvesting based cognitive radio functionality
    is covered in Section IV. To this end, 4) the optimization of green energy utilization
    in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are reviewed and open research issues are outlined
    in Section V. SECTION II. Energy Efficiency in CR Traditional spectrum licensing
    schemes use the command-and-control model, in which explicit rules are laid for
    use of the spectrum [15]. Severe under-utilization of the static licensed spectrum
    presents great challenges for the resource constrained wireless network to handle
    the growing popularity of new wireless devices and applications. To enable more
    flexible spectrum access, dynamic spectrum access techniques have been proposed
    to solve this spectrum inefficiency problem, by allowing unlicensed users to access
    the radio spectrum under certain restrictions. In a dynamic spectrum access network,
    three broadly categorized models (based on [5], [15]) shown in Fig. 1 are commonly
    used. Cognitive radio technology has emerged as a key enabler for dynamic spectrum
    access. In a CR-based DSA network, the primary system owns the spectrum rights,
    while unlicensed users can dynamically share the licensed spectrum in an opportunistic
    manner. This capability is provided by the following cognitive functionalities
    [6]: 1) Spectrum sensing and analysis: Spectrum sensing is defined as the task
    of finding spectrum opportunities, i.e., spectrum holes, in the local neighborhood
    of the overlay CR receiver [16]. Once the spectrum hole is utilized by a secondary
    (unlicensed) transmitter, no primary receiver will be affected by this secondary
    transmitter, and no primary transmitter will interfere with the intended secondary
    receiver either [3]. Spectrum analysis uses the information obtained from spectrum
    sensing to schedule and make a decision to access the spectrum by SUs. 2) Spectrum
    management and handoff: This function enables SUs to select the best available
    channel and vacate the channel when PU is detected to reclaim it [12], and therefore
    somewhat addresses the challenges imposed by the fluctuating nature of the available
    spectrum, as well as the diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements of various
    applications [7]. 3) Spectrum allocation and sharing: It coordinates access to
    the available channel with other users (PUs, other SUs, or both), so that the
    interference level incurred by secondary spectrum usage should be kept below a
    certain threshold, and collisions and interference among multiple SUs are alleviated.
    Although CRs enable spectrum sharing with smart operation and agile spectrum access
    [17], a major limitation of a practical cognitive radio network is the increasing
    power consumption introduced by the cognitive capability and reconfigurability.
    Energy aware cognitive radio system has been investigated from three general perspectives.
    1) Energy minimization minimizes the power consumption for a given performance
    requirements. 2) Performance maximization maximizes the performance for a given
    limited power budget. 3) Utility maximization takes the power consumption cost
    into account during sensing/transmission, with utility functions in the form of,
    such as, the difference between the two, or the ratio of performance reward and
    cost of power. η= η= F(P)−μP F(P) μP (1a) (1b) View Source where specific performance
    criteria of utility η , such as ‘bit/Joule,’ can be found in [2], F is the performance
    function with respect to power consumption P , and μ is a price parameter. Based
    on the various approaches and criteria mentioned above, we will introduce the
    functionalities of energy efficient CR. A. Spectrum Sensing and Analysis The primary
    goal of CR is to access the spectrum opportunistically. This makes spectrum sensing
    crucial because it enables users to detect the activities of a primary user in
    a frequency band. The categories of spectrum sensing, energy-related advantages
    and drawbacks, and the research problems concerning energy efficiency are presented
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Categories of spectrum sensing. Show All To design energy efficient
    spectrum sensing methods, we should first learn the performance indicators used
    to measure the detection performance: the detection probability p d , i.e., the
    probability of declaring the presence of PU when it is in fact occupying the spectrum,
    and the false alarm probability p f , i.e., the probability of declaring the presence
    of PU when it is actually idle. The higher the p d , the better the PUs are protected.
    The lower the p f , the more spectrum opportunities are explored by SUs [18].
    Note that the complementary probability of p d , is called miss-detection probability,
    and sometimes referred to as collision probability when SU starts transmission
    immediately once the sensing result indicates the channel is idle [5]. To improve
    the quality of spectrum sensing under various conditions, such as whether prior
    information about the probability of the primary user''s presence on the target
    channel, defined in Eq. (2), is available or not, and the target channel is narrow
    or wide, a collection of spectrum sensing methods have been proposed [8]. π 0
    = π 1 = Prob{ H 0 } Prob{ H 1 } (2) View Source where H 1 is the hypothesis that
    PU is active, while H 0 means the spectrum is idle. Although the aforementioned
    algorithms yield different sensing performance and power consumption, the relationship
    in Eq. (3) holds in general, based on the binary hypothesis testing. p d = p f
    = Prob{f( T S ,γ)> λ d | H 1 } Prob{f( T S ,γ)> λ f | H 0 } (3) View Source where
    f is related to signal detection and processing in the physical layer (PHY) [8],
    [12]. p d is increasing with the sensing time T S and SNR γ , but is decreasing
    with the detection threshold λ d . p f is decreasing with T S and γ as well as
    the false alarm threshold λ f . In addition to sensing performance, the energy
    efficiency of the spectrum sensing algorithms depends on the power consumption,
    as shown in Eq. (4), which involves the scheduling of a spectrum sensing activity
    in the time and spatial domains by the media access control (MAC) layer. P S =
    P R = F S ( T S )= F S ( N S ) F R ( N C ,D) (4) View Source where F S and F R
    are the sensing and reporting power functions, respectively. The sensing power
    P S is increasing with the sensing time T S , which is further proportional to
    N S , the number of collected samples. P R , the power consumed by reporting the
    sensing result, is increasing with the transmission distance D and the number
    of nodes participating in the sensing N C . Besides the energy consumed to obtain
    the sensing result, the major energy waste of CRNs is due to the miss-detection
    of PU, which can lead to collision and retransmission. As a result, the power
    consumed for data transmission, P T , is related to the detection probability
    p d and SNR γ , according to a decreasing function F T defined as follows. P T
    = F T (γ, p d ). (5) View Source 1) Sensing Duration and Frequency Problem As
    shown in Fig. 2(a), to balance the energy-inefficiency of continuous spectrum
    sensing (high P S ) and the unreliability issue of periodic spectrum sensing (low
    p d and high p f ), Gan et al. [19] optimized the sampling rate ( N S / T S )
    and sensing time T S to minimize the total sensing power across multiple potential
    channels, within the constraints of detection performance. 2) Sensing Architecture
    Design Problem As shown in Fig. 2(b), with multiple SUs sensing and sharing information,
    power consumed by sensing P S and reporting P R can both be decreased when every
    cognitive radio will randomly turn off its sensing device, this energy saving
    approach is referred to as sleeping or on-off sensing. The probability of switching
    off is called the sleeping rate. The second approach to reduce P R is censoring,
    where a sensing result is sent only if it is deemed informative. The censor rate
    refers to the probability of the sensing results being located in the censor region,
    a signal interval for the locally collected energy [20]. Another method of reducing
    P R is clustering, instead of sending local sensing results directly to the fusion
    center (FC), they are sent to the assigned cluster heads (CHs) , which then make
    local cluster decisions and send them to FC. This way the network energy consumption
    is reduced due to the distance reduction. Extensive centralized detection performance
    optimization and overhead minimization algorithms can be found in [21]– [23],
    where three approaches are implemented in a complementary way. Besides the centralized
    spatial diversity scheduling, each SU can decide whether to sleep or share results
    by itself. However, the broadcasting nature of wireless environment provides the
    opportunity for SU to be a free rider, who overhears the sensing result and does
    not contribute to the sensing process. Various games have been modeled in [24],
    [25] to study the above mentioned incentive issue of cooperative spectrum sensing
    where each selfish SU aims to maximize its own utility in the form of Eq. (1a).
    3) Multi-Channel Scheduling Problem With the introduction of scheduling in the
    frequency domain, spectrum opportunity can be further exploited from a new degree
    of freedom, as illustrated in Fig. 2(c). Cooperative Sensing Scheduling When periodic
    spectrum sensing is adopted for multiple channels, the sensing scheduling has
    to address the cooperative sensing scheduling (CSS) problem [26]: how to assign
    secondary nodes to different channels? Except for the energy-performance tradeoff
    (greater N C leads to a better sensing performance but more energy will be consumed
    in both sensing and reporting) , performance-opportunity tradeoff exists in CSS,
    i.e., assigning more SUs to one channel will yield more reliable sensing outcome,
    but spectrum opportunity is not fully explored since less potential channels are
    sensed [27]. Sequential Channel Scheduling As far as the sensing process is concerned,
    the only task for periodic spectrum sensing is to find the idle spectrum. After
    getting the sensing result, SU could either transmit when the sensed channel is
    free, or wait for the channel which is currently occupied by PU. In sequential
    channel sensing, the task is to find an idle channel with good quality. So, SU
    can switch to a different channel and perform sensing again even when the current
    sensed channel turns out to be idle. A channel-specific access decision has to
    be made based on the analysis of both the sensing result and possible channel
    quality estimation afterwards if the channel is unoccupied [28]. Since channel
    switching and sensing require additional time and energy, SU needs to efficiently
    locate an idle channel with satisfactory channel quality. More specifically, a
    channel sensing order scheme and a channel selection protocol (stopping rule)
    have to be designed to optimize CR networks. Any performance metrics of sequential
    sensing scheduling will be related to the transmission performances, such as throughput
    and delay, since they are the criteria to judge whether the channel is good enough
    for SU. The transmission performance related design, which is the function of
    spectrum analysis and access process, will be further discussed later in the following
    section. B. Spectrum Management and Handoff Spectrum analysis and spectrum access
    consist of two major components of the spectrum management mechanism [12]. First,
    the sensing strategy specifies whether to sense and where in the spectrum to sense.
    Then, spectrum analysis will estimate the characteristics of the spectrum holes
    that are detected through spectrum sensing. Third, the access strategy will make
    a decision on whether to access or not, by judging whether this is the best available
    channel. While the focus of the last section (except for sequential channel scheduling)
    is finding the spectrum opportunity in an energy efficient way, this section will
    further concentrate on locating the spectrum opportunity with good quality. The
    channel characteristics (mostly channel capacity) determines the data transmission
    power level appropriate to the user requirements. As a result, energy efficiency
    plays an important role in the design of the spectrum management mechanism. 1)
    Spectrum Access The sequential decision process of sensing and access strategies
    gives rise to a new option for SU: keeping idle on the current channel without
    sensing or transmission. The reason is that when energy consumption is considered,
    instead of sensing a channel that may turn out to be in use by PU or obtaining
    an idle channel with poor fading condition, it is better for SU to do nothing
    at all. The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which
    permits the uncertainty of information in modeling the operation mode selection
    problem, is suitable for CRNs where PUs'' traffic is not fully observable to the
    secondary network. By jointly considering three conflicting objectives among gaining
    immediate access, gaining spectrum occupancy information, and conserving energy
    (for future sensing, transmission, and idling) on a single-channel, the POMDP
    framework [29] indicates that the optimal sensing decision and access strategy
    uses a threshold structure in terms of channel free probability and channel fading
    condition, i.e., SU with un-rechargeable battery and limited power should sense
    the channel when the conditional probability that the channel is idle in the current
    slot is above a certain threshold, and it will access the channel if the fading
    condition of this idle channel is better than a certain threshold. 2) Spectrum
    Mobility As mentioned in the previous section, spectrum availability in CR networks
    varies over time and space. So, except for the traditional mobility which refers
    to mobile users traversing across cells or current channel conditions becoming
    worse [30], CR networks incur another dimension mobility, spectrum mobility, in
    which SU has to move from one spectrum hole to another to avoid interference in
    case of the reappearance of PU. CR networks need to perform mobility management
    adaptively depending on the heterogeneous spectrum availability, which is a result
    of the highly unpredictable mixed multimedia primary traffic in today''s wireless
    networks. In general, spectrum handoff, in which SU can switch to another vacant
    channel and continue data transmission when the current channel is sensed as busy,
    can be categorized into two major types. One is the reactive-sensing spectrum
    handoff, in which the target channel is sensed or selected only after the spectrum
    handoff request is made. The other is the proactive-sensing spectrum handoff,
    where the target channel for spectrum handoff is predetermined [31]. The reactive
    spectrum handoff pays the cost of sensing time to guarantee the accuracy of the
    selected target channel. By pre-determining the target channel, the proactive
    spectrum handoff avoids the sensing time but loses certain accuracy. Extensive
    performance analysis of spectrum handoff can be found in [31]– [34]. As shown
    in Eq. (6), tuning the radio frequency of the cognitive device will result in
    additional power consumption. P HO = F HO ( f t − f c ) (6) View Source where
    F HO is an increasing function and the handing off power P HO is related to the
    frequency difference between the target channel f t and the current channel f
    c . In practice, to minimize the energy consumption incurred during handoff, SU
    may prefer to wait for the current channel and conserve energy, at the cost of
    service quality. As a result, the handoff strategy will have to make a priori
    decision about whether to request handoff or not. This section mainly focuses
    on the coordinated spectrum access among PUs and SUs, which is primarily based
    on the sensing result. How to coordinate spectrum access among SUs, and how to
    share the spectrum resource effectively when the PU is active, will be investigated
    in the next section. C. Spectrum Sharing and Allocation According to the coordination
    behavior between PUs and SUs, existing solutions for spectrum sharing can be classified
    into three major categories [35]. 1) Spatial spectrum sharing, e.g., spectrum
    underlay, always allows secondary users to access the spectrum subject to interference
    temperature (IT) constraint, which is the threshold of interference impairing
    the PU receiver [36]. 2) Temporal spectrum sharing, e.g., spectrum overlay, allows
    secondary users to utilize the spectrum only when it is idle. 3) Hybrid spectrum
    sharing, in which SUs initially sense for the status (active/idle) of a frequency
    band (as in the temporal spectrum sharing) and adapt their transmit power based
    on the decision made by spectrum sensing, to avoid causing heavy interference
    (as in spatial spectrum sharing) [37]. Since SUs might be competing for the resource
    or cooperating to improve efficiency and fairness of resource sharing [38]– [40],
    spectrum sharing can be implemented in two manners: cooperative and non-cooperative,
    depending on the SUs'' behavior within the secondary network. Regardless of the
    spectrum sharing model, spectrum allocation mechanisms have a great impact on
    the energy consumption and performance of each individual SU and the whole secondary
    network. As a result, energy efficient designs, which take into account of the
    diversity of SUs'' power budgets, the channel conditions and the QoS requirements,
    are of great interest to the spectrum sharing and allocation algorithms. 1) Spatial
    Spectrum Sharing Since IT is subject to space-time-frequency variation, spectrum
    sharing, along with power control, bit-rate and antenna beam allocation, which
    are all implemented by the dynamic resource allocation (DRA), have become essential
    techniques for energy efficient underlay CRs [41]. Moreover, to access the same
    spectrum being used by PUs, SUs normally provide incentive to compensate for the
    additional interference induced to PUs. The incentive can be in the form of spectrum
    trading, in which radio resources such as spectrum in a CR environment can be
    sold and bought [40]. So, efficient spectrum sharing and allocation can generate
    more revenue for the spectrum owner and also enhance the satisfaction of PUs.
    Illanko et al. [42] considered the centralized cooperative DRA problem, where
    the downlink power allocation of OFDM CRN is modeled as a concave fractional program.
    Near optimal solutions, which maximize bit/Joule energy efficiency while meeting
    SUs'' rate demands and PUs'' IT-constraint, are given in closed form. In addition
    to the centralized DRA, which requires a centralized entity having full knowledge
    of the network, distributed DRA is more suitable for scenarios with no such infrastructure
    [43]. From PUs'' viewpoint, Han and Ansari [44] studied the spectrum trading between
    the primary and secondary network. PUs'' traffic is offloaded to the secondary
    network, which in exchange will gain spectrum for its own traffic transmission.
    To minimize the primary energy consumption with power budget and rate requirement,
    the auction-based energy-spectrum trading scheme is proposed to approximate the
    behavior of the primary and secondary network for distributed spectrum allocation.
    2) Temporal Spectrum Sharing In temporal spectrum sharing, the issue is transmission
    opportunity exploitation, i.e., spectrum exploitation, which means that after
    a spectral hole is identified, i.e., spectrum exploration, how efficient can SUs
    access and utilize the spectrum, while not interfering with the primary users.
    Because of the spectrum sensing process, the IT-constraint is less stringent as
    compared to the spatial spectrum sharing model. However, interference still exists
    due to frequency reuse in today''s wireless systems and power leakage into the
    adjacent frequency band being occupied by PU [45]. Although spectrum sensing is
    up to SUs, varying spectrum condition and diverse QoS requirements still challenge
    the energy-aware DSA. Hasan et al. [45] considered the centralized power allocation
    over multiple OFDM subcarriers, with IT-constraint and limited transmission power
    budget. Sub-optimal schemes are proposed to maximize the corresponding convex
    utility function which incorporates the achievable data rate of SU and the expected
    rate loss due to sensing error or spectrum reoccupation by PU. Gao et al. [46],
    on the other hand, proposed a framework of distributed DRA for energy constrained
    OFDMA based CRN. Fig. 3. Relaying and cooperation in cognitive radio systems.
    (a) Cooperation between secondary users. (b) Cooperation between primary and secondary
    users. Show All SECTION III. Energy Efficiency via CR In this section, we discuss
    how to adopt CR into the wireless access network to improve the energy efficiency.
    Given the complexity of the topic and the diversity of existing technical approaches
    [11], we focus on the major applications of cooperative and cognitive radio communications,
    and heterogeneous cognitive radios for the emerging Long Term Evolution-Advanced
    (LTE-Advanced) networks. A. Green Relaying and Cooperative CR The major challenge
    of CR networks is to guarantee the QoS requirements while not causing unacceptable
    performance degradation of PUs. In some cases, reliable end-to-end transmission
    within the secondary network requires a large amount of power, leading to harmful
    interference to PUs [47]. The key enabling technology of boosting the overall
    performance while saving energy is the relay technology [38]. For the relay based
    CR networks, the path loss is less due to the shorter transmission range, and
    the interference caused to the primary network is potentially reduced due to the
    lower transmission power. Furthermore, when no common available spectrum between
    a pair of secondary users exists, the relay node can help establish the end-to-end
    communication through the dual-hop channel [48] (two sets of available spectrum:
    one for the source-relay link and one for the relay-destination link). Unlike
    the pure relay systems, the cooperative node acts as both an information source
    and a relay. Network coding based two-way relay schemes with decoding (decode-and-forward)
    and without decoding (amplify-and-forward, denoise-and-forward, compress-and-forward)
    are introduced to implement cooperative communications [38]. The inherent cooperative
    diversity can save energy by combining the signals received from different spatial
    paths and consecutive time slots [49]. In the context of CRN, two basic cooperative
    transmission scenarios exist: 1) cooperative transmission between secondary users
    that aims to increase the secondary throughput for a given spectral hole; 2) cooperative
    transmission between primary and secondary users that aims to increase the spectrum
    opportunities of SU. Given the fact that under the specification of relay protocols,
    relay nodes will work differently from the regular cognitive devices, as illustrated
    in Fig. 3. The spectrum sensing and resource allocation designs need to take into
    account of the features of relaying cognitive radio and cooperative cognitive
    radio systems. 1) Relay-Enhanced Cooperative Spectrum Sensing With the secondary
    relay enhanced CR networks, besides the fact that cooperation can be used to enhance
    the transmission performance, the capability of sensing can be improved when relays
    perform spectrum sensing cooperatively with secondary users. Huang et al. [50]
    investigated the tradeoff between cooperative sensing performance and energy consumption
    for the scenario shown in Fig. 3(b), where the relays operate with the amplify-and-forward
    (AF) protocol, and one of the relays will forward the signals of PU to SU in order
    to help determining the presence and absence of PU. Under given p d and p f constraints,
    the energy consumption for spectrum sensing is minimized over the number of samples
    (proportional to sensing time) and the amplification gain. 2) Resource Allocation
    for Cooperative Transmission Between SUs With the introduction of the secondary
    relay, the resource related issues include relay selection, power allocation and
    subcarrier matching. Ge and Wang [47] investigated the power allocation issue
    for the scenario shown in Fig. 3(a), where multiple PUs co-exist in the three-node
    AF-relay-enhanced CR network. The optimization problem is formulated to maximize
    the overall ‘bits/Joule’ of the OFDM-based CR relaying system under the consideration
    of many practical limitations, such as transmission power budget of the CR source
    node (SN) and the relay node (RN), minimal capacity requirement, and interference
    threshold of the primary users, where the energy consumption includes a constant
    circuit energy P C . Similarly, Shaat and Bader [51] considered the resource allocation
    problem in the decode-and-forward (DF) relayed OFDM based CR system. The power
    allocation is optimized jointly with the subcarrier matching under individual
    power constraints in the source and relay. The sum rate is maximized while the
    interference temperature is kept below a pre-specified threshold. Similarly, Zhao
    et al. [48] investigated power and channel allocation for a three-node DF relay-enhanced
    cognitive radio network, where cooperative relay channels are divided into three
    categories: direct, dual-hop, and relay channels, providing three types of parallel
    end-to-end transmission. Fig. 4. Heterogeneous cognitive radio system. Show All
    Chen et al. [52] studied the distributed relay selection scheme to achieve the
    goal of maximizing the received reward that is contributed by the system spectrum
    efficiency and energy consumption. The problem is formulated as a multi-armed
    restless bandit problem, which has been widely used for stochastic control. The
    secondary relay node in Fig. 3(a) is equivalent to the arm, in which the state
    of an arm is characterized by the time-varying channel condition of all related
    links, spectrum usage and residual energy states. Each arm chooses to be passive
    or active for relaying the data, and performs the corresponding adaptive modulation
    and coding (AMC) strategy if the arm is selected. Similarly, Luo et al. [53] jointly
    considered the relay selection scheme and optimal power allocation scheme to achieve
    a good tradeoff between the achievable data rate and network lifetime. Furthermore,
    Chen et al. [54] adopted the multi-armed restless bandit model to improve multimedia
    transmissions over underlay CR relay networks, while ensuring PUs with a minimum-rate
    for a certain percentage of time. The cross-layer design approach is used to minimize
    multimedia distortion, increase spectral efficiency and prolong network lifetime,
    by jointly considering optimal power allocation, relay selection, adaptive modulation
    and coding, and intra-refreshing rate. 3) Resource Allocation for Cooperative
    Transmission Between PUs and SUs With the introduction of cooperative relay in
    Fig. 3(b), PU engages appropriate SUs to relay its transmission so as to improve
    primary transmission performance, e.g., enhancing achievable throughput/reliability
    and/or saving energy. In return, PUs yield a portion of spectrum access opportunities
    to relaying SUs for secondary transmissions. The strategy of cooperation can be
    a) TDMA based three-phase cooperation, i.e., PUs broadcast in the first phase,
    SUs relay in the second phase, and SUs transmit in the third phase. b) FDMA based
    two phase cooperation, in which PU divides its spectrum into two orthogonal subbands,
    and broadcasts on the first subband in the first phase. SUs relay on the same
    subband in the second phase, and continuously transmit in both two phases on the
    second subband. The work in [55] is concerned with enhancement of spectrum-energy
    efficiency of a cooperative cognitive radio network shown in Fig. 3(b). The relay
    selection and parameter optimization are formulated as a Stackelberg game, which
    is suitable for problems with a sequential structure of decision-making. Since
    PUs have higher priority over SUs, PUs are leaders when cooperating with SUs,
    i.e., PUs decide whether to cooperate and how to cooperate in the first stage.
    In the second stage, SUs aim to maximize its own utility by playing the non-cooperative
    power control game. B. Green Cognitive Small Cells Although relay and cooperative
    networks can improve the signal quality of cell edge indoor users to a certain
    degree, the rapid growth of mobile service usage accelerates the need for novel
    cellular architectures to meet such demands [56]. Instead of relying on careful
    deployment of conventional base stations, the LTE-Advanced or beyond standards
    propose heterogeneous networks (HetNets) to resolve the capacity demand issue
    [57], [58]. HetNet consists of a macrocell network overlayed by small cells. The
    macro-tier guarantees the coverage, while the overlay network provides means to
    satisfy the local capacity demand. The small cells in this two-tier architecture
    can be micro-cells, picocells or femto-cells, where the distinction between them
    can be found in the size of the cells and the capability of auto-configuration
    and auto-optimization. The reduced cell size can lead to higher spatial frequency
    reuse and lower power consumption. However, the cross-tier interference will occur
    if the small cells and the macrocell overlap in their assigned spectrum; the intra-tier
    interference among multiple small cells will also impair user performance in both
    cell tiers. Efficient and agile spectrum access enabled by cognitive radio can
    avoid interference and overcome the coexistence issues in multi-tier networks
    [59]. As illustrated in Fig. 4, both macro cell and small cell can be equipped
    with cognitive functionality. Depending on whether priorities of the secondary
    users are provisioned, the system could be open access or closed access [58].
    When cognitive cells are configured as closed access, only registered secondary
    users can communicate with their cognitive base stations and primary users can
    only access their base stations even in a shared subchannel. When cognitive cells
    are configured as open access, it could be accessed by both its users and all
    cochannel primary users, and there is no notion of priority for the transmissions
    of macro BSs [59]. To improve the overall energy efficiency which is severely
    affected by the installation of the additional small cell tier, how to utilize
    the cognitive capabilities to save energy and mitigate interference is still a
    research challenge. 1) Open Access Architecture The major function of the secondary
    small cells is to offload traffic from the macro cells. Since the traffic demand
    highly fluctuates over space, time, and frequency, the small cells do not always
    have users to serve. By utilizing the spectrum sensing results to determine whether
    there is traffic to offload, the small cell can decide whether to enter the sleep
    mode or not. For HetNets with open-access configuration, Wildemeersch et al. [60]
    evaluated a distributed sleep-mode strategy to minimize the energy consumption
    of the small cells. Optimal sensing duration and sensing probability are derived
    under various detection performance constraints and the traffic offloading requirements.
    2) Closed Access Architecture The transmission of the primary base station has
    higher priority, and the secondary network has its own users to serve. As compared
    with the traditional spatial/temporal spectrum sharing scenario, the differences
    in this case are the confined cell size and transmission power of the cognitive
    small cells. Similar to the spatial spectrum sharing scenario in [44], the secondary
    cells can grant access to the primary users. In return for the extra power consumption,
    the secondary cells are guaranteed a certain revenue as the incentive mechanism.
    Yang et al. [61] studied the joint power allocation of the macro primary base
    station and secondary small cells to guarantee the energy-saving and throughput
    of the primary network. In particular, the utility of the primary users is maximized
    and the pricing function is incorporated to reflect the virtual money to be paid
    to the small cells. Xie et al. [62] fully exploited the cognitive capability by
    considering a wireless network architecture with macro and femto cognitive cells.
    The ‘bits/Hz per Joule’ energy-efficient resource allocation problem is modeled
    as a three-stage Stackelberg game, where the primary network leads the game by
    offering the selling price in the first stage. The cognitive macro base station
    will decide whether to buy the spectrum size in the second stage, and allocate
    the procured spectrum among femtocells and macro secondary users. In Stage III,
    the femtocell performs power allocation for the femtocell secondary users. A gradient
    based iteration algorithm is proposed to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium. SECTION
    IV. Energy-Harvesting CR While all the above techniques optimize and adapt energy
    usage to achieve energy efficient CR networks, energy related inhibition has not
    been precluded. For battery powered nodes, they can only operate for a finite
    duration as long as the battery lasts. For main grid-powered nodes, the primary
    rationale still pertains to cost efficiency and reduced carbon footprints. As
    a result, CR has to be optimized to provision green communications by using green
    power. Energy harvesting has been applied to address the problem of tapping energy
    from readily available ambient sources that are free for users, including wind,
    solar, biomass, hydro, geothermal, tides, and even radio frequency signals [13],
    [14]. Depending on application scenarios, SUs can be sensor nodes in a sensor
    network, or mobile devices and even base stations in a cellular network; all these
    devices can be equipped with the energy harvesting capability [63], [64]. The
    energy-arrival rate is a significant metric to evaluate the energy harvesting
    capability. To guarantee a certain level of stability in energy provisioning,
    energy sources are normally implemented in a complementary manner. As a result,
    passively powered devices (the energy harvesting generators that do not require
    any internal power source [13] and sometimes use different green energy sources)
    and hybrid powered devices (the energy harvesting generators that have a backup
    non-renewable energy source in case the power provided by energy harvesting is
    insufficient [65], [66]) are attractive as inexhaustible replacements for traditional
    wireless electronic devices in the cognitive radio networks. A. Green Energy Harvesting
    Models Depending on whether there is a storage capability for the power output
    of the harvesting system, the generic system model is classified into: 1) the
    harvest–use architecture, which mandates that the instantaneous energy harvesting
    rate should always be no less than the energy consumption rate [63]; 2) the harvest–store–use
    architecture with a storage component (e.g., rechargeable batteries) to hoard
    the harvested energy for future use. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the energy harvesting
    process and energy consuming process (i.e., sensing, transmission, reception,
    etc.) can be scheduled simultaneously, or in a time switching way [67]. The unified
    model of the energy harvesting process of these architectures is given in Eq.
    (7). E h =αηE (7) View Source where E h is the harvested energy, E represents
    the green energy source, which is normally modeled as a Markov process [68]. 0<α≤1
    is the time switching ratio that is used for energy harvesting ( α=1 for simultaneous
    energy harvesting and consumption) , and 0<η<1 is the energy conversion efficiency.
    Fig. 5. The harvest–store–use mechanism of cognitive device. (a) Simultaneous
    energy harvesting and consuming. (b) Time switching between energy harvesting
    and consuming. Show All Fig. 6. The RF energy harvesting mechanism. (a) Power
    splitting in the receiver. (b) Time switching in the receiver. Show All For the
    green cognitive radio network, RF harvesting is an energy form of particular potential
    because the green CR can transmit data on the idle spectrum while harvesting energy
    from the busy spectrum. Another advantage of RF energy is the simultaneous transfer
    of wireless information and power [67]. So, except for the separated energy harvester
    and information receiver similar to Fig. 5(a), co-located energy harvester and
    information receiver can adopt two practical architectures: power splitting and
    time switching. As depicted in Fig. 6(a), when the RF signal reaches the receiver,
    part of it is used for power extraction and the rest for the simultaneous data
    detection. Note that Fig. 6(b), which requires only one set of antenna for both
    energy and data, is a special case of Fig. 5(b). The unified model of the RF energy
    harvesting process of these architectures is given in Eq. (8). E h =αη|h | 2  E
    (8) View Source where h is the channel condition between the RF energy harvester
    and the RF energy source. |h | 2 E represents the energy of the received RF signals.
    0<α≤1 is the time switching ratio or power splitting ratio that is used for energy
    harvesting. For architectures shown in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 6(a), the existing literature
    assumes that energy harvested in the current time slot can only be used in subsequent
    time slots, owing to the energy half-duplex constraint [69]. So, before performing
    the cognitive functionality, the available residual energy is observable in all
    of the architectures. However, as compared with the cognitive radio systems powered
    by traditional on-grid energy, EH CR is different in the sense of the dynamic
    nature of energy supply, i.e., opportunistic energy harvesting makes the energy-arrival
    rate no longer constant. Accordingly, the power budget is dynamic, namely, energy
    causality constraint (EC-constraint), also referred to as the energy neutrality
    constraint. The EC-constraint requires that the total consumed energy should not
    exceed the total harvested energy, which may further be limited by the finite
    battery capacity [70], [71]. B. Green Energy Utilization and Optimization The
    conventional energy efficient techniques cannot be applied directly into the case
    where the transmitter or the receiver is subject to intermittent and random harvested
    energy. For passively powered devices, it is more reasonable to adopt the performance
    maximization approach: optimize the system function according to harnessed green
    energy. Although minimizing current energy consumption may bring future reward
    in performance, the energy minimization approach alone cannot guarantee the system
    performance, which is the overall design objective. For hybrid powered devices,
    the three approaches can still be adopted because on-grid non-green power remains
    part of the energy source. However, energy minimization and utility maximization
    should factor in the fact that the green energy consumption is free for a given
    deployed EH system [72]. 1) Transmission Policy With Energy Harvester For the
    architecture with separated energy harvester and information transmitter, as illustrated
    in Fig. 5(a), maximizing the utilization of green energy means tailoring the power
    management scheme for the random harvested source. Ho and Zhang [73] considered
    the point-to-point wireless data transmission system with the energy harvesting
    transmitter. They assumed two types of side information (SI) about the harvested
    energy and time varying channel conditions are available: causal SI (of the past
    and present slots) or full SI (of the past, present and future slots). Optimal
    energy allocation is developed to maximize the throughput over a finite horizon.
    Similarly, optimal energy management schemes are provided to maximize the throughput
    by a deadline and minimize the transmission completion time of the communication
    session [74], [75]. Also, the throughput optimal policy is proposed for the constrained
    setting where only online knowledge of the energy arrival process and the channel
    fade level is available [75]. Furthermore, the energy management policies can
    be extended to various directions. For example, the works in [76], [77] and [78]
    explored the joint source and relay power allocation over time to maximize the
    maximum throughput of the three node DF relay system, in which both the source
    and relay nodes transmit with power drawn from energy-harvesting sources. Han
    and Ansari [66] studied the power allocation scheme for the system with hybrid
    energy supplies. By utilizing the green power thoughtfully, the on-grid power
    consumption is minimized while the QoS of users in terms of SINR is guaranteed.
    Although the energy cannot be consumed before it is harvested, the traffic cannot
    be delivered before it has arrived. Yang and Ulukus [79] proposed the packet transmission
    policy to minimize the packet transmission completion time in which the transmitter
    has to wait until enough green energy is harvested in order to adopt a higher
    transmission rate. For a multi-user system, the multi-user diversity in terms
    of channel conditions can be explored to enhance the green energy utilization.
    Therefore, scheduling different users at a given time slot may require different
    amounts of green energy. By exploring the multi-user diversity, a packet scheduling
    algorithm may shape BS''s energy demands to match the green power generation [80].
    Fig. 7. Cognitive functionalities in energy harvesting. Show All 2) Reception
    Policy With Energy Harvester To address the opportunistic wireless energy harvesting
    at the receiver side, the goal is to design the optimal splitting and switching
    rule for the architectures shown in Fig. 6. Since the co-channel interference
    is useful for the wireless RF energy harvester, though it limits the quality of
    data reception, the time switching rule needs to incorporate the time varying
    channel condition. To minimize the outage probability or the ergodic capacity
    for wireless information transfer, while maximizing the average harvested energy,
    joint optimization of transmit power control of the transmitter, which is plugged
    with a traditional on-grid power source, and scheduling of information and energy
    transfer in the receiver, is considered in [81]. The design of the harvesting
    rule in the receiver is of particular importance to the relay networks because
    the amount of harvested energy determines the forwarding ability of the relay,
    while the information received in the relay acts like the data source in the forwarding
    phase. According to the numerical analysis [82], various system parameters, such
    as power splitting ratio, energy harvesting time, source transmission rate, noise
    power, source to relay distance, and energy harvesting efficiency, affect the
    performance of the three node AF relay channel, where the relay node harvests
    energy from the received RF signal and uses that harvested energy to forward the
    source information to the destination. 3) Challenges on Green Energy Utilization
    and Optimization Currently, the research on green energy utilization and optimization
    mainly relies on having the knowledge of the instantaneous energy arrival rate,
    either assuming that it is already available (offline optimization), or assuming
    that the causal information or statistical knowledge can be obtained (online optimization)
    [68]. For the offline optimization, the closed form optimal transmission/reception
    can normally be obtained, such as variants of the water-filling algorithm [73],
    [75]. Since the assumption of having complete information of the energy arrival
    rate (past, present and future) is normally unrealistic due to the intermittent
    nature of the green energy source, various learning algorithms have been studied
    to estimate the statistical parameters of the energy arrival processes [83]. When
    the energy harvesting profile is modeled as the Markov process, the online energy
    management scheme is cast under the framework of Markov decision processes (MDPs).
    However, such decision policies are complex, and thus a simpler alternative is
    required to analytically balance energy consumption and harvesting [68]. C. Cognitive
    Functionalities in Energy Harvesting Envisioning green energy as an important
    energy resource, the design and optimization of the cognitive radio network is
    challenging since the network performance and the user QoS highly depend on the
    dynamics of the available spectrum and green energy. To alleviate the network
    from the spectral and energy constraints, the inherent relationships between system
    performance and the availability of power and spectrum are investigated and illustrated
    in Fig. 7. 1) Harvesting Strategy In the time domain, prior to the sensing strategy
    and access strategy, harvesting strategy is needed in the time switching architecture
    to specify whether to harvest and how long to harvest because it affects the EC-constraint,
    which will influence the subsequent sensing and possible transmission. Yin et
    al. [84] studied the harvesting duration and number of channels to be sensed next.
    The mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize
    the expected achievable throughput of SU over all of the idle channels in one
    time slot. Meanwhile, when considering the architecture of the receiver in Fig.
    6, how to split the power between RF harvesting and data detection is another
    research challenge. This is of particular importance for the relaying and cooperative
    CR networks because the detected data need to be transmitted to the destination
    by utilizing the harvested energy. 2) Sensing Strategy The non-constant EC-constraint
    will affect the sensing strategy because the instantaneous low residual energy
    may not be able to fully support a complete sensing process, or not be able to
    complete the data transmission successfully, even the channel will be indicated
    as idle if SU indeed decides to sense. So, should SU 1) remain idle until the
    accumulated energy reaches a threshold, which is greater than power needed for
    a single sensing and transmission, 2) perform sensing and possible transmission
    when the residual energy is sufficient for a single sensing and transmission,
    3) perform sensing and gain spectrum occupancy information when the accumulated
    energy is above a predefined sensing power threshold, or 4) keep sensing as long
    as there is energy left? Although the work in [29] has already considered the
    sensing decision policy, the corresponding zero energy arrival rate of the un-rechargeable
    cognitive device makes the third and forth policy trivial because when the residual
    energy is less than the power required for a successful sensing and transmission,
    any sensing strategy afterwards will bring zero payoff. For the cognitive device
    equipped with energy harvester, however, the fourth policy may be preferable because
    spectrum sensing not only gains spectrum occupancy information, but also leaves
    room in the battery for the newly arrived free energy. 3) Detection Performance
    The detection probability and the false alarm probability in Eq. (3) should factor
    in the sensing strategy, owing to the fact that p d will increase if the cognitive
    device stays idle without sensing when the channel is busy. On the other hand,
    when the channel is actually idle, p f will increase. Modeling the energy arrival
    process as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence of random
    variables with fixed average rate, Park et al. [85] adopted the sensing decision
    policy where SU with sufficient energy to carry out spectrum sensing and transmission
    will sense the channel. The optimal single spectrum detection threshold λ is derived
    to maximize the expected total throughput of SU under energy causality and collision
    constraints. 4) Sensing Scheduling In the spatial domain, the diversity of residual
    energy among cooperative devices makes the scheduling problem more complex. For
    instance, to maximize the life time of sensors which are dedicated to perform
    cooperative spectrum sensing using the harvested energy, an online algorithm is
    required for the scheduling of each sensor''s active time, and the scheme proposed
    in [86] is insufficient since the energy arrival rate is not zero anymore. When
    spectrum sensing is shared in a distributed non-cooperative way, existing literature
    makes the implicit assumption that no explicit relationship exists between the
    sensing/reporting power and available transmission power, i.e., SU can always
    transmit with the maximum power. This is reasonable since the steady positive
    energy arrival rate is guaranteed by the on-grid power source. So, the expected
    throughput will be a function of sensing policies (whether to contribute to sensing
    or not), sensing results and channel condition γ . In the EH-CR environment, however,
    each SU''s utility function should take the available residual energy into account,
    which will further affect their sensing strategy. In the frequency domain, the
    secondary system or every SU still has to take the residual energy into consideration
    in scheduling the sensing process because the subsequent transmission will be
    affected by it. 5) Access Strategy With varying energy arrival rate, the user
    may be forced to remain idle on the unoccupied spectrum if the remaining energy
    is insufficient to perform a successful data transmission, and so the access strategy
    has to incorporate the dynamic EC-constraint. Park et al. [87] investigated how
    energy harvesting capability affects the expected total throughput of SU. The
    optimal sensing and access policy determining which channel to sense and possible
    access is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process because
    the spectrum occupancy state is not fully observable to SU. With a given sensing
    duration and fixed power required for data transmission in one time slot, a sub-optimal
    myopic policy, which maximizes the expected immediate throughput of SU is proposed.
    Furthermore, Park et al. [88] considered a scenario where idle SUs can harvest
    RF energy from active PUs. The optimal sensing decision policy and access policy
    are also formulated as POMDP, and a sub-optimal myopic policy is proposed as well.
    6) Resource Allocation The harvesting strategy will have an impact on the sensing
    decision, which further affects the available power for the subsequent data transmission.
    To achieve better performance of the secondary networks, the dynamic resource
    allocation mechanism should be able to reveal these internal relationships. Adopting
    the similar sensing decision policy in [85], Chung et al. [89] studied the power
    control scheme which maximizes the average throughput during a slot, subject to
    the collision constraint imposed by PU. Gao et al. [90] jointly considered the
    sensing strategy and power allocation strategy to maximize the throughput of SU
    over multiple consecutive time slots. A sub-optimal online algorithm is designed
    based on the dynamic spectrum state, harvested energy, and the channel fading
    level. 7) Power Pricing Although current wireless access networks mainly rely
    on the power grid, which is a large interconnected infrastructure for delivering
    electricity from power plants to end users, the majority of research endeavors
    on green cognitive radio has been focused on the locally generated green power,
    whether by the cognitive device itself, or trade with other green base stations.
    In fact, facing the emerging challenges, e.g., rising energy demand, aging infrastructure,
    and increasing greenhouse gas emission [91]– [93], the traditional power grid
    is becoming smart, which can integrate with renewable green energy resources such
    as wind and solar power [94]. The work in [95] represents cognitive heterogeneous
    mobile networks in the smart grid environment. A three-level Stackelberg game
    is developed to model the problems of electricity price decision, energy efficient
    power allocation and interference management. Then, a homogeneous Bertrand game
    with asymmetric costs is used to model price decisions made by the electricity
    retailers. A backward induction method is used to analyze the proposed Stackelberg
    game. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the reduction in the operational expenditure
    and C O 2 emissions in cognitive heterogeneous mobile networks. SECTION V. Green
    Energy Powered Cognitive Radio Networks Although we have discussed green powered
    cognitive devices in the previous sections, we try to further improve the energy
    efficiency by utilizing the green power in the cognitive radio networks. As the
    smart grid advances and develops, green power farms that harvest energy from green
    sources, e.g., solar energy and wind energy, can substantially reduce carbon footprints.
    Also, the penetration of distributed green energy capitalization is galvanizing
    worldwide. In the near future, consumers are allowed to contribute their clean
    energy back to the grid [96]. Taking advantages of distributed electricity generators,
    telecommunications equipment manufacturers, such as Nokia Siemens and Ericsson,
    have designed and built green energy powered off-grid base stations to reduce
    OPEX of mobile networks in rural areas [64]. The overall power consumption of
    the wireless network depends on the energy generated from the ambient source,
    the storage capacity of the battery, the traffic demands and the wireless channel
    conditions, which are all dynamic processes, as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8. Common
    models used in CR network. Show All In addition to the utilization of standalone
    power generators, optimizing green energy enabled cognitive radio networks involves
    power sharing/trading with other distributed green generators and power purchasing
    from the green power farms of the smart grid, as illustrated in Fig. 9. As compared
    with cellular networks powered by distributed green generators or green power
    farms, the operation of green energy powered cognitive radio networks is more
    complex, because 1) various system architectures ( Fig. 2) require different energy
    distribution within the network, e.g., the centralized controller needs more energy
    in the spectrum sensing phase while SUs demand more energy in the data transmission
    phase; 2) cognitive functionality depends on the energy availability while spectrum
    availability in turn affects the energy consumption. To untangle the intertwined
    energy and spectrum dynamics within the complex network architectures, we first
    discuss how to optimize the green energy utilization within the cellular network,
    in which only the energy dynamics is considered. This will provide some insights
    for the data transmissions in the green cognitive radio system. Then, with the
    introduction of spectrum dynamics, the energy utilization is discussed in green
    cognitive radio networks. A. Wireless Network Powered by Distributed Green Generators
    Taking advantages of the characteristics of wireless communications, the power
    sharing with neighboring cells can be facilitated through traffic offloading.
    Various user-BS association schemes or cell size adapting schemes can realize
    this implicit power sharing method. Han and Ansari [97]– [99] considered the centralized
    user association scheme by taking into account of the green energy storage and
    traffic queue of multiple base stations, a green energy aware and latency aware
    scheme is proposed to minimize the sum of the weighted traffic delivery latency
    of BSs in a heterogeneous mobile network. Meanwhile, the user can associate with
    multiple base stations, as in coordinated multipoint transmission (CoMP) [100],
    such that the diversity of channel conditions, traffic load and amount residual
    green energy can be utilized jointly for the data transmission. Similarly, for
    the cell size adapting scheme, the BSs can decide whether to expand and cover
    more active users, or shrink smaller until entering the sleep state. With the
    grid infrastructure, the power generated by the distributed green generators can
    be directly shared. For instance, when users with traffic are located far away
    from the base stations with ample energy storage, traffic offloading is not power
    economical or even feasible due to the fading of the wireless channel. In this
    case, it is more rational to transmit the energy through the power line directly.
    Furthermore, power trading can be implemented where the node with traffic to serve
    and the node with ample power storage can be selfish users. The trading process
    can also take the form of traffic offloading, power transmitting, or both. Fig.
    9. Green energy powered cognitive radio network. Show All TABLE I Green Energy
    Enabled Wireless Network B. Wireless Network Powered by Green Power Farms Although
    power can be shared/traded as a fundamental resource element which determines
    the performance of the wireless system, there is a side effect from power and
    interference. Less power means less interference to the neighbors. Accordingly,
    the neighbors'' power will be consumed less. Kwak et al. [101] implemented the
    centralized power sharing scheme through interference management. For a given
    power budget which can be used to purchase a certain amount of power from the
    electricity supplier, or for a given capacity of the green power farm, how to
    allocate the power into multiple base stations and time slots determines the long-term
    utility function of the network. The utility based on SINR is optimized jointly
    by user scheduling and BS power control for different power sharing constraints
    in spatial and time domains. When smart grid with green power plants is the power
    provider for the wireless cellular network, the energy price has a great impact
    on the energy efficiency in the cellular network. Owing to the uncontrollable
    nature of the green source, the generated green power may be surplus, and this
    may harm the energy suppliers since energy storage cost will impact the revenue
    [102]. As a result, balancing the market through pricing is extremely important
    in the green environment. Bu et al. [103] considered a system with multiple electricity
    retailers, and multiple clusters of BSs. BSs in one cluster can go to sleep or
    be active and participate in the CoMP transmission with other active cluster members.
    Considering the pollutant level of and the price offered by each retailer, independent
    clusters need to decide which retailers to procure electricity from and how much
    electricity to procure. The system has been modeled as a two-level Stackelberg
    game, where 1) the Stackelberg leaders, the electricity retailers, try to maximize
    the revenue; 2) the Stackelberg follower, the cellular network, tries to maximize
    the utility function with regard to blocking probability, power cost and pollutant
    levels. C. Cognitive Radio Network Powered by Green Energy The green energy enabled
    wireless network can be provisioned by a green power farm or distributed green
    generators. Table I describes the pros and cons of these two types of provisioning;
    in particular, the green power farm is costlier to build while the energy provisioned
    by distributed green generators is less stable. Whether being powered by a green
    power farm or distributed green generators, cognitive radio network imposes more
    challenges for green energy utilization because the nodes with available spectrum,
    the nodes with sufficient power and the ones with data traffic to serve may all
    be different. Emerging methods which can balance the spectrum, power and traffic
    within the secondary network are desirable and briefly discussed next. Sharing/trading
    sensing results is a form of power balancing. For instance, traffic arrives at
    a SU transmitter, which is supposed to perform spectrum sensing and data transmission
    to its intended SU receiver. A third CR node near the SU receiver may keep sensing
    and offer the sensing results if the aforementioned SU transmitter is in power
    shortage. With a sufficient large amount of power, this CR node can even directly
    offload the data traffic from the SU transmitter. In this way, the transmission
    power will be saved due to a shorter distance between the third CR node and the
    SU receiver. Mutually, if all of the cognitive radio devices act like each other''s
    remote backup power storage, the temporal and spatial power sharing within the
    networks is realized. Mobile charging which relies on the wireless energy transfer
    can be another approach to balance the power within a cognitive radio network.
    Mobile vehicles/robots, which carry high volume batteries [104], can serve as
    back up mobile power storage and periodically deliver energy to cognitive devices
    with insufficient energy supply. Power balancing can rely on the grid architecture
    to transmit power, especially when sufficient power source and cognitive devices
    in need of power are separated far away. Since spectrum opportunity is a local
    concept, offloading the sensing tasks or trading sensing results will be unreliable.
    Also, moving vehicles in long distance will result in high energy consumption.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion This article surveys various developments and advances
    on energy efficient cognitive radio functionality from spectrum sensing and analysis,
    spectrum management and handoff, to spectrum sharing and allocation. The state
    of the art of the energy efficient CR based wireless access network, such as relay
    and cooperative radio and small cells, is reviewed from each aspect. Recent advances
    and challenges in research related to energy harvesting based green cognitive
    radios are elicited. Yet, many challenging problems remain to be tackled. This
    article will hopefully help readers to jump start further research in provisioning
    green energy powered cognitive radio networks. Authors Figures References Citations

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: The cognitive radio is an emerging technology that
    enables dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks. The cognitive radio is capable
    of opportunistically using the available portions of a licensed spectrum to improve
    the application performance for unlicensed users. The opportunistic use of the
    available channels in the wireless environment requires dynamic channel assignment
    to efficiently utilize the available resources while minimizing the interference
    in the network. A challenging aspect of such algorithms is the incorporation of
    the channels'' diverse characteristics, highly dynamic network conditions with
    respect to primary users'' activity, and different fragmented sizes of the available
    channels. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art channel
    assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks. We also classify the algorithms
    by presenting a thematic taxonomy of the current channel assignment algorithms
    in cognitive radio networks. Moreover, the critical aspects of the current channel
    assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks are analyzed to determine the
    strengths and weaknesses of such algorithms. The similarities and differences
    of the algorithms based on the important parameters, such as routing dependencies,
    channel models, assignment methods, execution model, and optimization objectives,
    are also investigated. We also discuss open research issues and challenges of
    channel assignment in the cognitive radio networks. Published in: IEEE Communications

    By Index Terms Recommendations Comments ABSTRACT Research in the physical (PHY)
    and medium access control (MAC) layers for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and dynamic
    spectrum sharing (DSS) is still at its infancy. Aspects such as spectrum sensing,
    coexistence, measurement and spectrum management, network reliability and QoS
    support in face of the need to avoid causing harmful interference into incumbents,
    to name a few, are key to the success of future cognitive radio (CR) systems and
    have received little attention so far. In addition, it is critical to understand
    the interplay of these various cognitive radio concepts and how they impact the
    overall network performance. In this paper we address these questions by presenting
    the design and performance evaluation of a CR-based PHY and MAC for DSA and DSS
    of vacant television (TV) channels. This air interface described here forms the
    baseline of the current IEEE 802.22 draft standard, and features a number of key
    PHY and MAC CR-based components for use by license-exempt devices in the spectrum
    that is currently allocated primarily to TV services. Through simulations and
    prototyping, we analyze the performance of this first CR-based wireless network
    with respect to spectrum sensing, system capacity, QoS support, coexistence, and
    network reliability. References J. Mitola et al., "Cognitive Radios: Making Software

    Abstract: Wireless networks and devices have been rapidly gaining popularity over
    their wired counterparts. This popularity, in turn, has been generating an explosive
    and ever-increasing demand for, and hence creating a shortage of, the radio spectrum.
    Existing studies indicate that this foreseen spectrum shortage is not so much
    due to the scarcity of the radio spectrum, but due to the inefficiency of current
    spectrum access methods, thus leaving spectrum opportunities along both the time
    and the frequency dimensions that wireless devices can exploit. Fortunately, recent
    technological advances have made it possible to build software-defined radios
    (SDRs) which, unlike traditional radios, can switch from one frequency band to
    another at little or no cost. We propose a MAC protocol, called Opportunistic
    Spectrum MAC (OS-MAC), for wireless networks equipped with cognitive radios like
    SDRs. OS-MAC (1) adaptively and dynamically seeks and exploits opportunities in
    both licensed and unlicensed spectra and along both the time and the frequency
    dimensions; (2) accesses and shares spectrum among different unlicensed and licensed
    users; and (3) coordinates with other unlicensed users for better spectrum utilization.
    Using extensive simulation, OS-MAC is shown to be far more effective than current
    access protocols from both the network''s and the user''s perspectives. By comparing
    its performance with an Ideal-MAC protocol, OS-MAC is also shown to not only outperform
    current access protocols, but also achieve performance very close to that obtainable
    under the Ideal-MAC protocol. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing

    1 Introduction The demand for radio spectrum has rapidly been increasing for several
    reasons. First, wireless networks and devices are rapidly gaining popularity over
    their wired counterparts mainly due to their low cost and convenience of use,
    which, in turn, has increased the demand for spectrum. Second, wireless applications
    are increasing in number, size, and complexity, thereby requiring more bandwidth
    and, hence, more demand for spectrum. Finally, advances in wireless technology
    have enhanced the quality of existing applications and created new wireless services,
    which also increases the demand for spectrum. For example, although technological
    advances in cellular networks created 3G that enabled high-speed data rates, they
    also contributed to higher consumer demand: Consumers now want to receive not
    only the traditional voice service but also Internet data services via their handheld
    devices. In contrast, the spectrum supply has not been keeping up with the spectrum
    demand. This expected shortage in spectrum supply has prompted both industry and
    federal agencies to explore new ways of making efficient use of the spectrum.
    In November 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established the
    Spectrum Policy Task Force (SPTF) to identify possible changes in the current
    spectrum allocation policies that will increase its overall public benefits. The
    US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) also created the so-called
    Next-Generation (XG) Program that aims at developing a new generation of access
    technology [1] that will more efficiently use the spectrum. Industry organizations
    such as the MITRE Corporation [2], [3] and the IEEE 802.22 Working Group [4],
    [5] are also working on technologies and standards necessary for providing wireless
    devices with the capability of adaptive and dynamic spectrum access and sharing.
    Changing policies to allow dynamic spectrum allotment and developing techniques
    to enable opportunistic spectrum access are two major challenging issues that
    need to be resolved for the efficient use of limited and precious spectrum. Since
    the former issue falls within the domain of policy makers and regulatory bodies,
    we will focus on the latter issue. Preliminary studies [6], [7], [8] indicate
    that the spectrum shortage problem is not so much due to the scarcity of the radio
    spectrum but due to the inefficiency of current spectrum allocation methods. For
    instance, from the actual measurements of spectrum use in several major US cities
    during various periods in July 2002, it was observed that many portions of the
    radio spectrum below 1 GHz are not in use for significant periods of time [7].
    Likewise, measurements taken during the period between January 2004 and August
    2005 show that only about 5 percent of the spectrum is actually in use in the
    band below 3 GHz at any location in the US and at any time [8]. These indicate
    the availability of ample spectrum opportunities—often also referred to as “white
    spaces”—for wireless devices to exploit along both the time dimension (resulting
    from variability of spectrum usage over time) and the frequency dimension (resulting
    from variability of spectrum usage over different frequency bands). Due mainly
    to technology limitations, spectrum has traditionally been “statically” licensed
    and assigned in blocks via frequency division. However, technological advances
    enabled Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), unlike traditional radios, to switch from
    one frequency band to another at minimal cost. SDRs are expected to be a key component
    of future wireless systems and applications and will empower wireless devices
    with the capability of dynamically accessing the entire frequency band. This paper
    proposes a new protocol for cognitive wireless networks that empowers SDR-based
    wireless devices with the following capabilities: adaptively and dynamically seeking
    and exploiting opportunities in both licensed and unlicensed spectra and along
    both the time and frequency dimensions, accessing and sharing spectrum among different
    unlicensed and licensed users, and coordinating with other unlicensed users for
    better spectrum utilization. The effectiveness of OS-MAC is extensively evaluated
    using an ns2-based simulation. The performance of OS-MAC is compared with 1) that
    of existing spectrum-access methods and 2) that of an Ideal-MAC protocol, demonstrating
    that OS-MAC is far more effective than current access protocols from both the
    network''s and the user''s perspectives. Moreover, OS-MAC is shown to not only
    outperform current access protocols but also achieve performances that are very
    close to those achievable under an Ideal-MAC protocol. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the requirements for achieving
    spectrum agility. Section 3 describes the proposed OS-MAC protocol. Section 4
    evaluates the effectiveness of OS-MAC using an ns2-based simulation. Section 5
    discusses the applicability/implementation of OS-MAC. The related work is discussed
    in Section 6. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 7. SECTION 2 Spectrum
    Agility: A Design Guideline In order to design MAC protocols that can fully exploit
    the available spectrum in both licensed and unlicensed frequency bands, one must
    first understand spectrum allocation policies and recognize their access limitations.
    R1. Spectrum Regulations. At present, the FCC statically divides radio spectrum
    into frequency bands and assigns them to users according to one of the three models
    [6], which, for simplicity, we classify into two types. The first type is to allocate
    frequency bands to licensees, referred to as Primary Users (PUs), who have exclusive
    and flexible rights to use their assigned spectrum. PUs are also protected against
    interference when using their assigned spectrum. The second type is to allow other
    users, referred to as Secondary Users (SUs), to share the remaining spectrum (that
    is, unlicensed spectrum) in a nonexclusive manner. Unlike PUs, SUs have neither
    rights to nor guarantees of interference protection. To improve spectrum efficiency,
    regulatory bodies such as the FCC need to revise their spectrum-leasing policies
    and/or pursue market regulations that encourage licensees to provide SUs with
    opportunistic access to their spectrum bands. R2. Interference Avoidance. Since
    PUs have exclusive access rights to their allocated spectrum bands, SUs can opportunistically
    use licensed spectrum only if their signals do not cause interference to PUs.
    That is, upon the detection of the presence of PUs, SUs must immediately vacate
    the channel if they happen to be using the licensed spectrum band. Note that detection
    mechanisms are beyond the scope of this paper. Readers may refer to [9], [10],
    [11], and [12] for the methods that SUs can use to detect the presence of PUs.
    Hence, access methods for promoting spectrum efficiency must enable SUs to suppress
    their signals or immediately vacate the licensed spectrum upon the detection of
    PUs. R3. Spectrum Access Sharing. Since different SUs may simultaneously seek
    spectrum opportunities, multiple different SUs can simultaneously move to and
    use the same spectrum band. Thus, opportunistic spectrum access methods must support
    the coexistence of multiple SUs in the same spectrum band. R4. Spectrum Access
    Efficiency. The SPTF identified three forms of efficiency—spectrum, technical,
    and economical—to improve. From the MAC''s perspective, it is the first form of
    efficiency that needs to be achieved. Hence, spectrum access methods must provide
    SUs with collaborative capabilities for spectrum efficiency. The proposed protocol
    OS-MAC is designed in accordance with the four design requirements above. SECTION
    3 Opportunistic Spectrum Media Access Control Protocol 3.1 Assumptions and Notation
    OS-MAC is developed under the following assumptions: The available radio spectrum
    is equally divided into N nonoverlapping data channels 1 (DCs) and one common
    control channel (CC). We assume that the spectrum division into DCs and CC is
    done by a third authoritative party (for example, the FCC) and that all SUs have
    prior knowledge of such division. Each DC is associated with a number of PUs that
    have exclusive and flexible use and access rights to use it. PUs can use their
    own DC at any time. We use the notion of an SU Group (SUG) to represent a set
    of users who want to communicate with each other: an SUG may consist of two or
    more SUs. At any time, only one member in an SUG can transmit information at a
    time, and the rest in the same group will receive it (this is akin to one member
    talking and the others listening in a group discussion). There may be multiple
    SUGs in the network, all of which simultaneously seek spectrum opportunities on
    all DCs to establish communications. We will hence call these types of communication
    sessions. SUGs can seek and use any DC, as long as the DC is not being used by
    its PUs. That is, upon the detection of the presence or the return of PUs, SUs
    must immediately vacate the DC. The rationale behind the above SUG model is to
    design a MAC that supports not only the traditional one-to-one communication sessions,
    but also the new emerging many-to-one communication sessions such as teleconferencing.
    Note that a pair of communicating users can be viewed as a special case of an
    SUG with only two members. We assume that an SU can directly communicate with
    any other SU when tuned to the same channel. Under this assumption, mobility is
    not an issue, provided that users stay connected during their communication. However,
    if the condition of the wireless spectrum worsens due to mobility or any other
    factors, the adaptive feature of the proposed protocol allows SUs to seek and
    switch to other better quality spectrum bands. Each SU is equipped with a single
    half-duplex transceiver to transmit or receive on one channel at any given time.
    3.2 General Description of Opportunistic Spectrum Media Access Control All interchannel
    control frames are communicated via the CC, whereas DCs are used for communicating
    all data frames and all intrachannel control frames. Each DC will always have
    one Delegate SU (DSU) appointed among those SUs currently using it. All DSUs (one
    from each DC) periodically switch to CC to inform each other of the traffic loads
    experienced on their DCs. After learning of the conditions of all DCs, each DSU
    returns to its original DC and informs all SUGs currently using that DC about
    the traffic conditions of all the other DCs. Based on this information, each SUG
    selects and then switches to the “best” DC for data communication until the end
    of the current period. Although DSUs are in the CC, informing each other of their
    channel conditions, all other SUs continue using their DCs for normal data communications.
    We propose that all SUs within the same DC use the IEEE 802.11 DCF access mode
    (without RTS/CTS) [13] (see the Appendix for a summary of the IEEE 802.11). However,
    since an SU sender may send information to multiple receivers, only one receiver
    will acknowledge the receipt of a packet as follows: Upon receiving a packet,
    each receiver sets a random backoff timer. If the receiver sees an ACK (from a
    different receiver) prior to the expiration of its timer, then it cancels the
    timer. If its timer expires before seeing any ACK, then the receiver sends an
    ACK. Recall that all members belonging to the same SUG are assumed to all hear
    each other. Therefore, having only one receiver acknowledge the receipt of a packet
    will suffice. Here, ACKs are used to handle delivery failures caused by collisions.
    Our MAC protocol also provides the option of turning off the acknowledgment mechanism;
    that is, no ACKs are sent back to the sender. This can be used to support sessions
    whose communication quality is not too sensitive to packet losses. In summary,
    OS-MAC divides time into periods, each of which is called the Opportunistic Spectrum
    Period (OSP) and consists of three consecutive phases: Select, Delegate, and Update.
    The lengths, in time slots, of these three phases are denoted by SelWin, DelWin,
    and UpWin, respectively. Events occurring during each of these phases are briefly
    described as follows: Select Phase. Each SUG selects the “best” DC and uses it
    for communication until the end of the current OSP. Delegate Phase. On each DC,
    a DSU is appointed among those currently using the channel to represent the group
    during the Update Phase. Update Phase. All DSUs switch to the CC to update each
    other about their channel conditions, whereas all non-DSUs continue communicating
    on their DCs. 3.3 Details of Opportunistic Spectrum Media Access Control Under
    OS-MAC, each SU in the network will be in one of the following phases at any given
    time: Network Initialization Phase. If an SU is not involved in any communication,
    it will tune its transceiver to the CC. The SU will keep listening to the CC,
    unless it does the following: It decides to establish a new session (and, hence,
    forms a new SUG). In this case, it moves to phase 2. It receives a JoinRequest
    control frame from another SU that requests it to join/form an SUG. In this case,
    it replies with a JoinReply control frame and switches to the DC indicated in
    the received JoinRequest frame. It then moves to phase 3 to start communication
    with others in the group. It decides to join an existing SUG/session. In this
    case, it scans all the DCs until it detects its desired SUG. Here, we assume that
    the SU has prior knowledge about its desired SUG, including its presence and ID.
    Upon detecting the desired SUG, the SU moves to phase 3. Session Initialization
    Phase. If an SU wants to establish a new session, it will set its SessionInitialization
    timer to 2 InitWin=(MaxSelWin+DelWin+2×UpWin) and keep listening to CC, unless
    any of the following occurs: The SessionInitialization timer expires prior to
    receiving any UpdateCC control frame. UpdateCC frames are periodically sent on
    the CC by DSUs to inform each other of channel conditions during the Update Phase
    (more in phase 4). In this case, the SU (the only SU currently active in the network)
    will initialize its OS-MAC Parameter Set (to be defined later), select a random
    DC, inform its group members about the chosen DC, and switch to that channel for
    data communication (moving to phase 3). The SU receives UpdateCC frames prior
    to the expiration of its SessionInitialization timer. In this case, the SU will
    update its OS-MAC Parameter Set to those indicated by the UpdateCC frames, select
    its “best” DC (via the Select Mechanism), inform its group members of the chosen
    DC, and switch to that DC for data communication (moving to phase 3). Data Communication
    Phase. During the last UpWin time slots of each OSP, DSUs will switch to the CC
    to invoke the Update Mechanism (moving to phase 4). When DSUs switch to the CC,
    all other SUs will continue using their DCs for data communications. When the
    Update Mechanism ends, each DSU will switch back to its DC to inform all the SUs
    (currently using the same DC) of the conditions of all other DCs that it just
    learned via the Update Mechanism. To convey this information, the DSU will broadcast
    an UpdateDC control frame upon switching back to its DC. This control frame will
    then signal the beginning of a new OSP by indicating all its parameters (see Sections
    3.4 and 3.8 for details). Upon receiving the UpdateDC frame, the sender of each
    SUG will invoke its Select Mechanism (moving to phase 5) to select the “best”
    DC. Depending on which DC is selected by the Select Mechanism, all members of
    an SUG may switch to a new DC or remain in the same DC. In either case, SUGs will
    use the chosen DC to communicate until the end of this new OSP. At the end of
    the Select Phase, SUs will invoke the Delegate Mechanism (moving to phase 6) to
    appoint the DSUs that will represent DCs during the next OSP. Update Phase. During
    the last UpWin time slots of each OSP, each DSU will be tuned to the CC to invoke
    its Update Mechanism. This mechanism consists of having each DSU send an UpdateCC
    control frame to inform other DSUs of its DC''s traffic condition. By the end
    of this window period, all DSUs will tune their transceivers back to their original
    DCs and return to phase 3. Select Phase. After returning from the CC to their
    DCs (that is, after phase 4), DSUs will immediately broadcast an UpdateDC control
    frame that informs all SUs of the current traffic conditions of all DCs. All control
    frames communicated on the DCs will have shorter DIFS periods to give them access
    priority over the channel. OS-MAC uses PIFS(=SIFS+TimeSlot) as the time to wait
    for all control frames. Upon receiving this information, the sender of each SUG
    will invoke its Select Mechanism. Based on information in the UpdateDC frame,
    this mechanism allows senders of all SUGs to 1) choose the “best” DCs that they
    will use next and 2) inform all their SUs members of the selected DC. All members
    of the SUG will immediately switch to the selected DC for data communication.
    Delegate Phase. At the beginning of each Delegate Phase and during a period of
    DelWin time slots, SUs on each DC will invoke their Delegate Mechanism to appoint
    their DSU that will represent their DC during the next OSP. Fig. 1 summarizes
    all the above phases of the protocol. Fig. 1. OS-MAC. Show All 3.4 Opportunistic
    Spectrum Media Access Control Parameters Each SU always maintains and periodically
    updates a data structure, called the OS-MAC Parameter Set, that consists of five
    elements: φ() . This is a vector with as many elements as the number of DCs, where
    an element corresponding to a DC is responsible for holding and keeping track
    of the access-time share, 3 defined as the ratio of the time during which the
    SU possesses the DC during the Select Phase to that of the total length of the
    Select Phase, that SUs using the DC are currently receiving. The element of an
    SU''s vector that corresponds to the DC that is used by the SU itself is updated
    by the SU during the Select Phase by measuring the fraction of time that the SU
    has access to the DC. The other elements of the vector are periodically updated
    during the Update Phase on the CC if the SU is the delegate of the DC. Otherwise
    (that is, if the SU is not a delegate), they are updated upon receiving an UpdateDC
    from the DSU. As we describe next, updating the SelWin parameter and determining
    the new “best” DC are both based on the information contained in φ() . SelWin.
    This is the length (in time slots) of the current Select Phase. This window determines
    how long SUs should wait before seeking better DCs by examining the conditions
    of other DCs. Note that the window is adjusted to the conditions of the channels.
    It is adaptively calculated based on the vector φ() as SelWin =−4(MaxSelWin−MinSelWin)
    ×var[φ()]+MaxSelWin, (1) View Source where MaxSelWin (upper bound) and MinSelWin
    (lower bound) are two design parameters, and var[φ()] is the variance of the φ()
    vector. Fig. 2 shows SelWin as a function of var[φ()] . Note that var[φ()] varies
    between 0 and 1/4 because each element of the φ() vector is a ratio that can only
    be between 0 and 1. Further clarifications regarding (1) are provided in Section
    3.1.3. DelWin. This window need not be adaptive (see Delegate Mechanism). It is
    a design parameter that should be large enough to allow at least one successful
    transmission. This window is typically much smaller than SelWin. UpWin. This window
    need not be adaptive (see Update Mechanism). It should be large enough to allow
    at least N successful UpdateCC control frames. This window is typically much smaller
    than SelWin. PeriodStartTime. This is the start time of the next OSP. It is the
    old value of PeriodStartTime plus the values of the three windows SelWin, DelWin,
    and UpWin. 3.5 Select Mechanism One major challenge in designing OS-MAC is how
    the phenomenon of “synchronizing behaviors” can be resolved. Due to their adaptive
    nature of locating and switching to the best spectrum band (that is, less loaded,
    less noisy, and so forth), several SUGs may end up all switching to the same band,
    thereby rendering it the worst. This undesired phenomenon leads not only to a
    lesser achievable per-SUG throughput, but also to an overall degradation of the
    spectrum utilization. The following Select Mechanism is designed to avoid this.
    Fig. 2. Adaptation of SelWin. Show All Upon receiving an UpdateDC control frame
    that contains an updated φ() vector, a sender S of a given SUG currently using
    DC i will select a new DC as follows: Let φ ¯ ¯ ¯ = N ∑ l=N l=1 1 φ(l) and A={DCj:φ(j)>
    φ ¯ ¯ ¯ ,j=1,2,…,N} . If φ(i)> φ ¯ ¯ ¯ , S will remain on the same DC i . Else
    with probability φ(i) φ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ , S will remain on the same DC i , and with probability
    (1− φ(i) φ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ) φ r (j) ∑ k∈A φ r (k) , S will select DC j∈A where φ r (k)=
    φ(k)− φ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ φ(k) ,∀k∈A . Note that the above selection algorithm is executed
    by the sender of each SUG only. Once decided, the sender will immediately inform
    each of its members about the chosen DC via a JoinRequest control frame. Once
    informed, all members will switch to the chosen DC. Note that an SUG may stay
    on the same DC during the next OSP since the outcome of the Select Mechanism may
    be the same DC. In such a case, no JoinRequest frame is sent. There are several
    points that require mentioning regarding our Select Mechanism. First, since at
    any given time, only one member of each SUG can be transmitting, then the number
    of SUs in an SUG does not affect the SUG''s share of bandwidth. In other words,
    an SUG''s share of the bandwidth depends on the total number of SUGs currently
    using the system and not on the total number of SUs. Second, note that the proposed
    Select Mechanism is stable in that it prevents unnecessary DC switches by neither
    allowing SUGs whose access-time shares are higher than the average to switch their
    DCs nor allowing those with shares below the average to switch to other DCs whose
    shares are also below the average. Finally, recall that our protocol strives to
    ensure that each SU receives an equal share of the available bandwidth by adaptively
    switching to bands with better bandwidth shares. Hence, our fairness criterion
    is to assure that each user receives the same throughput. Although bandwidth fairness
    within each DC is ensured via the IEEE 802.11 access mechanism, bandwidth fairness
    across all DCs is ensured via the Select Mechanism of our MAC protocol. In the
    following, we formally state and prove this last feature. Proposition 1. For every
    DC j , E[φ(j)]= φ ¯ ¯ ¯ . Proof. Let n 0 j and n j denote the number of SUGs occupying
    DC j before and after invoking the Select Mechanism, respectively. Let us arrange
    the set of N channels as {1,2,…,l,l+1,…,N} such that φ(j)≤ φ ¯ ¯ ¯ ⇔j≤l . Without
    loss of generality, we assume that φ(j) is inversely proportional to n 0 j . Let
    φ(j)= 1 n 0 j ,∀j . Let X ij denote the random variable representing the number
    of SUGs currently belonging to DC i that decided to switch to DC j after invoking
    the Select Mechanism. Note that X ij ∼B( n 0 j , p ij ) , where p ij =(1− φ(i)
    φ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ) φ r (j) ∑ k∈A φ r (k) , and hence, E[ X ij ]= n 0 i p ij . We will
    show that E[ n j ]= 1 φ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ for all j . Let a= 1 N ∑ p=N p=1 n 0 j . There
    are two cases to consider: Case 1. j=l+1,l+2,…,N . E[ n j ] = n 0 j + ∑ i=1 i=l
    E[ X ij ]= n 0 j + ∑ i=1 i=l n 0 i p ij = n 0 j + (a− n 0 j ) ∑ N p=l+1 (a− n
    0 p ) ∑ i=1 i=l ( n 0 i −a)=a, View Source since ∑ l i=1 ( n 0 i −a)= ∑ N i=l+1
    (a− n 0 i ) . Case 2. j=1,2,…,l . E[ n j ]= φ(j) φ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ n 0 j =a . 3.6 Delegate
    Mechanism The purpose of this mechanism is to appoint a new DSU that will represent
    the DC during the next Update Phase. The idea is simple. When the Delegate Phase
    begins, all SUGs belonging to a given DC continue competing for the DC through
    the 802.11 random access scheme. Recall that, for each successful transmission,
    an ACK will be sent back to the sender. Under the single-hop assumption, these
    ACKs will be heard by all SUs of the DC. The first sender that successfully delivers
    a packet during the Delegate Phase is automatically appointed as the new DSU.
    Therefore, upon receiving an ACK notifying a successful reception, the sender
    considers itself the new DSU. Any other SU that is using the same DC will also
    hear the ACK and hence would know that someone else is appointed as the DSU. Once
    appointed, the DSU will act as the delegate until it sends an UpdateDC at the
    beginning of the next Select Phase. Once appointed as a delegate, a DSU should
    not quit until it sends the UpdateDC, even when its session ends earlier. This
    is not an issue since the length of the combined Delegate and Update Phases is
    on the order of seconds, whereas the length of sessions that we consider is on
    the order of a dozen of minutes. Note that the Delegate Mechanism is 1) simple
    and 2) incurs no overhead. It is simple because it exploits the already-existing
    ACK mechanism. The mechanism is distributed and does not require any extra message
    exchange, hence incurring no bandwidth overhead. 3.7 Update Mechanism The length
    of the Update Phase (that is, UpWin time slots) is divided into N identical intervals.
    Upon switching to the CC, a DSU representing channel j will broadcast its UpdateCC
    control frame on the jth interval. During the UpWin time slots, upon receiving
    an UpdateCC frame, each SU will update its 1) TSF timer to that indicated in the
    Timestamp field and 2) the φ() structure to that indicated by the φ(n) field of
    the frame received from channel n . 3.8 Control Frame Formats 3.8.1 UpdateCC Control
    Frame During the Update Phase, each DSU will broadcast an UpdateCC control frame
    to inform other DSUs of the condition of the DC that it represents. Each UpdateCC
    frame will contain the following fields: Timestamp: Indicates the current time
    and is necessary for time synchronization. PeriodStartTime: Indicates the start
    time of the new OSP. This information is needed for SUs that just joined the network.
    φ(n) : The time share in accessing the channel experienced in DC n . 3.8.2 UpdateDC
    Control Frame As soon as the DSU switches back to its DC (after invoking the Update
    Mechanism), it will broadcast an UpdateDC control frame on the DC. The purpose
    of this frame is to inform all other SUs of the channel-access-time shares of
    the other DCs. This frame also signals the debut of a new OSP. An UpdateDC frame
    will contain the following fields: Timestamp: This indicates the current time
    and is needed for time synchronization. SelWin: The length of the Select Phase.
    DelWin: The length of the Delegate Phase. UpWin: The length of the Update Phase.
    φ() : This vector contains the channel access times of all DCs (see Section 3.4
    for details). 3.8.3 JoinRequest Control Frame Whenever an SUG decides to switch
    to a new (better) DC, the delegate of the group will send a JoinRequest frame
    to all its members, informing them of that DC. The best DC is determined via the
    Select Mechanism, as described in Section 3.5. As mentioned earlier, there are
    two scenarios during which a JoinRequest may be sent: at the session initialization
    phase or upon receiving an UpdateDC. This frame will contain the following fields:
    SrcAddr: The source address of the sender. DstAddr[]: An array containing the
    destination addresses of all the members of the SUG. TargetDC: The best DC to
    use during the current OSP. 3.8.4 JoinReply Control Frame This frame acts as an
    ACK to a JoinRequest. Similar to acknowledging data packets, only one receiver
    will acknowledge the receipt of a JoinRequest. JoinReply will contain the destination
    address of the sender DstAddr. 3.9 Features of OS-MAC Having detailed OS-MAC,
    we would now like to reiterate and provide the intuitions behind its features.
    3.9.1 Efficient Usage of Spectrum Since only one SU from each DC switches to the
    CC during the Update Phases while the other SUs continue using their DCs, there
    is no wastage of spectrum opportunities. Because OS-MAC uses the contention-based
    IEEE 802.11 access method, SUs will always probe and use all available bandwidth,
    independent of how many SUs are actually using the DC. In fact, each SU using
    a DC will, on the average, receive an access-time share that is inversely proportional
    to the total number of SUs currently using the same DC. 3.9.2 Negligible Control
    Overhead The control overhead (in terms of spectrum wastage) associated with OS-MAC
    is primarily due to the Update Phase during which DSUs leave their DCs and switch
    to the CC to exchange control frames. Obviously, no spectrum would be wasted if
    each DC has more than one SUG using it such that when DSU switches to the CC,
    the other SUGs continue using the DCs. Only when the spectrum is lightly loaded
    can OS-MAC incur a negligible overhead in terms of spectrum wastage. The overhead
    is negligible because the length of the Update Phase (in the order of a second)
    is very small as compared to that of the period (OSP) (on the order of a dozen
    minutes). Besides, here, we are not dealing with lightly loaded networks. In fact,
    when networks are lightly loaded, there is no need for spectrum-agile MACs in
    the first place. 3.9.3 Adaptability to Spectrum Condition At first glance, one
    can note that, the shorter the OSPs, the more balanced the traffic load across
    all DCs and the higher the spectrum wastage as the Update Phases occur more frequently.
    Although the former maximizes the spectrum efficiency, the latter does the opposite.
    OS-MAC deals with these two conflicting objectives by adaptively adjusting the
    length of OSPs to current network traffic loads. 4 The philosophy behind OS-MAC''s
    adaptation of the lengths of OSPs to the traffic load is simply to strive in ensuring
    that all serviced sessions receive an equal access-time share (and, hence, an
    equal bandwidth share) of unused spectrum, regardless of which DC they use. Achieving
    an equal access-time share across all sessions 1) guarantees balanced loads across
    all DCs and, hence, efficient overall spectrum utilization and 2) maximizes the
    per-session quality of communication. OS-MAC relies on the variance of φ() (the
    access-time shares received on all DCs) to determine whether sessions receive
    an equal share or not and accordingly adjust the lengths of OSPs. That is, an
    increase in the variance is interpreted by OS-MAC as an indication of unbalanced
    traffic load over DCs. As a result, OS-MAC reduces the length of OSP so that sessions
    with small shares can switch to DCs whose received shares are higher. On the other
    hand, when OS-MAC detects small variances, it increases the length of OSP, as
    this implies that sessions are likely to receive the same share independent of
    the DC that they use. Hence, there is no need for them to seek/change their DCs
    any time soon (see (1) for a formal definition of SelWin). Now, let us consider
    the wastage of spectrum due to the Update Phases under this adaptation. When the
    traffic load is light, the variance of φ() is small, and hence, the lengths of
    OSPs are large. This is true regardless of whether the load is balanced. Therefore,
    under light loads, the spectrum wastage due to the Update Phases is minimal because
    these phases infrequently occur. On the other hand, as discussed in Section 3.1.2,
    under medium to high traffic loads and independent of the lengths of OSPs, OS-MAC
    incurs no spectrum wastage. In essence, this adaptation technique of OS-MAC maximizes
    the overall spectrum efficiency at very little or no control overhead. This is
    confirmed via our simulation results, as presented in Section 4. 3.9.4 Collaborative
    Spectrum Sharing OS-MAC uses the CC as a means for all SUs, seeking and using
    available spectrum opportunistically to collaborate for better performance at
    both the user and the network levels with minimum overhead. OS-MAC assures collaboration
    via its Update Mechanism by which representatives from each DC periodically switch
    to the CC to update each other with channel conditions. Because only one SU from
    each DC switches to CC, whereas the other SUs continue using their DCs, OS-MAC
    maintains coordination among users at no or little spectrum wastage. As we will
    discuss in Section 5, the bandwidth allocated to the CC should be just large enough
    to support interchannel control traffic. 3.9.5 Avoidance of Synchronizing Behaviors
    Another important feature of OS-MAC lies with its Select Mechanism. This mechanism
    allows SUGs to seek and use the spectrum opportunistically by adaptively and dynamically
    switching to less crowded DCs. Although the Select Mechanism is formally described
    in Section 3.5, we provide here insights and intuitions on how it works. First,
    under OS-MAC, only SUGs whose received access-time shares are below the average
    should seek and switch to DCs with higher received shares. Others should remain
    on their DCs. To avoid synchronizing behaviors in which all or many SUGs with
    low shares switch to the DC whose received share is the highest, OS-MAC uses a
    probabilistic selection approach. That is, with a given probability, some of those
    SUGs whose received shares are below the average will remain on their DCs or possibly
    choose a DC with a higher received share than the average but not the highest.
    Hence, without incurring any synchronizing behaviors, the Select Mechanism statistically
    assures that all sessions receive “almost” equal access-time shares by periodically
    having some (not all) sessions seek opportunistic DCs (see Proposition 1 for a
    formal proof). Moreover, the Select Mechanism prevents unnecessary DC switches
    from occurring by neither allowing SUGs whose shares are higher than the average
    to switch their DCs nor allowing those with shares below the average to switch
    to other DCs whose shares are also below the average. SECTION 4 Performance Evaluation
    The effectiveness of OS-MAC is extensively evaluated via an ns2-based simulation.
    OS-MAC is comparatively evaluated along with R-MAC, MC-MAC, and Ideal-MAC. 5 Each
    simulation run took 2 days and was repeated 10 times, each with a different seed.
    All reported results were averaged over 10 seeds. 4.1 Simulation Method and Parameter
    Setting The spectrum is divided into N nonoverlapping DCs and one CC, each of
    which has a capacity of B bits per second (bps). Each DC is associated with a
    number of PUs that have exclusive right to access it. PUs may use their own DC
    at any time. We characterize each DC n with ON (busy) and OFF (idle) periods of
    exponentially distributed lengths with means λ ON (n) and λ OFF (n) , respectively.
    The parameters λ ON (n) and λ OFF (n) are used to control the DC n ''s traffic
    load resulting from PUs. These parameters are also allowed to simulate cases where
    different DCs experience different loads. Let η p (n)= η ON (n) η ON (n)+ η OFF
    (n) , View Source and δ P denote the PUs'' average traffic load on DC n and the
    coefficient of variation of PUs'' traffic loads across all the N DCs. In addition,
    let η P = 1 N ∑ n=1 N η P (n) View Source denote the PUs'' average load on all
    DCs. Along with PUs, SUs seek and use the spectrum left unused by PUs by forming
    groups, establishing sessions, and communicating on DCs. There are M SUGs in the
    network. Here, we assume that M≫N (otherwise, the problem becomes trivial). During
    the course of simulation, sessions are randomly generated by SUGs as follows:
    Each SUG generates sessions, each of size Z bytes selected from a uniform distribution
    with mean Z ¯ and coefficient of variation δ Z . Between every two consecutive
    sessions, each SUG goes into an idle period also selected from a uniform distribution
    with mean I ¯ and coefficient of variation δ I . The packet length is set to L
    bytes. Let η S = M N Z ¯ Z ¯ + I ¯ B View Source be the SUs'' per-DC traffic load.
    Hence, DC n ''s traffic load due to all users is η(n)= η P (n)+ η S . Note that
    the network parameter η constitutes an upper bound on the average per-DC achievable
    utilization. We run simulations for different values of η P and η S . These values
    are controlled via the simulation parameters of PUs ( λ ON (n) and λ OFF (n) for
    every DC n ) and those of SUs ( Z ¯ and I ¯ ). All measurements are taken in the
    same way for all three protocols: OS-MAC, R-MAC, and MC-MAC. All the other simulation
    parameters are fixed as indicated in Table 1. TABLE 1 Simulation Parameters We
    consider the performance of all three protocols for three network scenarios: η
    P (n)=0 on each DC n . PUs are not present. η P (n)=30 hbox% on each DC n . PUs
    are present, provided that they generate a total traffic load of 30 percent. η
    P (n)=60 hbox% on each DC n . PUs are present, provided that they generate a total
    traffic load of 60 percent. Let us now elaborate on how the parameters DelWin,
    UpWin, MinSelWin, and MaxSelWin of our proposed OS-MAC are to be chosen. The length
    of DelWin must be large enough to permit for the successful delivery of at least
    one packet. Note that since the Delegate Phase incurs no extra control traffic
    overhead, the length of such a parameter is not so crucial to the performance
    of the protocol. We chose DelWin to be 5 seconds. The length of UpWin must also
    be large enough to permit for at least N successful UpdateCC control frames. Unlike
    DelWin, UpWin depends on the number of spectrum bands N . Hence, it is a design
    parameter. In our simulation, we set it to 1 s, which is long enough for 5 DCs
    (N=5) . As for the parameters MinSelWin and MaxSelWin, since we consider communication
    sessions of length of the order of a dozen minutes, we set MinSelWin and MaxSelWin
    to 5 and 15 minutes, respectively. These are also design parameters. 4.2 Random
    Media Access Control, Multichannel Media Access Control, and Ideal Media Access
    Control OS-MAC is compared with the following MACs: R-MAC, MC-MAC, and Ideal-MAC.
    4.2.1 Random Media Access Control First, there is currently no commercial protocol
    or device that supports dynamic and adaptive multiband access to the spectrum.
    In the current technology (for example, IEEE 802.11), users in the unlicensed
    band can select and use one spectrum band among several available bands, but such
    a selection is statically done. Therefore, to compare our protocol with current
    access methods, we defined and introduced the Random-MAC (R-MAC) protocol to mimic
    current commercial multiband access methods. Like OS-MAC, R-MAC also uses a dedicated
    CC for interchannel control traffic while using DCs for data communications. R-MAC
    works as follows: When an SU wants to establish a session and hence form an SUG,
    it will randomly select one of the N DCs, inform all its members of the selected
    DC, and switch to that DC for immediate data communication. All members of an
    SUG will use only one DC during each session. That is, they are not allowed to
    switch DCs during a session. Upon the detection of PUs on their selected DC, all
    members on the channel will cease transmissions, as long as the DC is occupied
    by the PUs. Only when the DC is sensed idle again could the members resume transmission.
    Once their session ends, all members switch back to the CC. Like OS-MAC, multiple
    SUGs that selected the same DC will share the channel in accordance with carrier
    sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), as specified in IEEE
    802.11 [4]. SUs that want to join ongoing sessions will scan the N DCs to detect
    the group that they intend to join. 4.2.2 Mc-Mac Like OS-MAC, MC-MAC [14], 6 which
    is a multichannel access protocol, uses a single half-duplex transceiver, a dedicated
    CC, and N DCs. Time is divided into beacon intervals. At the beginning of each
    interval, all SUs switch to the CC for a short period of time called ATIM window.
    During this window, source-destination pairs negotiate and select their “best”
    DCs to communicate their packets. Upon agreeing on a DC, the pair switches to
    it for DATA/ACK packet transmission until the end of the beacon interval. Each
    SU maintains a data structure, called Priority Channel List (PCL), holding information
    regarding the busyness of each DC. An entry of a node A''s PCL corresponding to
    DC n will be in one of the three preference states at all time: LOW. n has been
    selected by a neighbor of node A to use during the current beacon interval. MID.
    No neighbor of node A has selected this n for use during the current beacon interval.
    HIGH. n has only been selected by node A (among its neighbors) for use during
    the current interval. Negotiation and selection of DCs among SUs are done via
    a three-way handshake: ATIM-REQ, ATIM-ACK, and ATIM-RES. Before transmitting packets,
    the sender switches to the CC and waits for the ATIM window to send an ATIM-REQ
    message with PCL information to its receiver. After receiving the ATIM-REQ, the
    receiver selects the best channel as follows: If there is a HIGH-state DC in the
    receiver''s PCL, this DC is selected. Else, if there is a HIGH-state DC in the
    sender''s PCL, this DC is selected. Else, if there is a DC with the MID state
    in both PCLs, this DC is selected. Else, if there is a DC with MID in only one
    side, this DC is selected. Else (all DCs are in the LOW state), add the counters
    (as explained in the following) of the sender''s PCL and the receiver''s PCL and
    select the DC with the least counter. Each SU maintains a counter for each DC,
    indicating the number of pairs that selected the DC for use during the next beacon
    interval. Once the receiver selects a DC, it sends an ATIM-ACK back to the sender,
    indicating the selected DC. The sender then replies with an ATIM-RES (reservation)
    packet to allow neighbor SUs to learn of the fact that this DC will be used by
    those SUs during the next beacon interval. This information is needed so that
    those neighbor SUs can accordingly update their NAVs. 4.2.3 Ideal Media Access
    Control To develop a comparative feel, we evaluate and compare the performance
    of OS-MAC, R-MAC, and MC-MAC with respect to an Ideal-MAC protocol. A protocol
    is considered to be an Ideal-MAC when: It equally distributes all sessions over
    all DCs. That is, the total traffic load generated by all sessions is equally
    distributed over all DCs. All packets are successfully delivered at their first
    trial. That is, no retransmission is needed (no packet collision and no packet
    loss). There is no need for ACKs. That is, the Ideal-MAC protocol is perfect not
    to rely on ACKs. Clearly, no protocol can achieve the performance obtainable under
    the Ideal-MAC protocol. It represents an upper bound on the average achievable
    performance. We will use the Ideal-MAC protocol as a baseline for our performance
    comparison. 4.3 Performance Metrics We consider three performance metrics to evaluate
    OS-MAC from both the user''s and the network''s perspectives. From the user''s
    perspective, we evaluate the SUs'' per-session quality under the three network
    scenarios discussed above. Note that we will be concerned only with SUs'' session
    quality. PUs always have the exclusive right to access their DC, and hence, their
    session quality should not be affected by the protocol being used. Therefore,
    to evaluate the performance of OS-MAC from the user''s perspective, we evaluate
    two metrics. 4.3.1 Relative Session Delays D Under Ideal-MAC, the average session
    duration can be expressed as Ideal-MACduration= ZM NB(1− η P ) . View Source We
    then define the delay of a session to be the time diff-erence between its measured
    duration and its Ideal-MAC duration. The metric D of a given session is the ratio
    of its delay to its Ideal-MAC duration. 4.3.2 Normalized Session Goodput Shares
    S The session goodput share is defined as the fraction of the time used by a session
    to successfully communicate packets to that of its total measured duration. Note
    that we only measure the goodput; that is, we do not consider retransmission packets
    nor ACKs. The average session goodput share obtainable under the Ideal-MAC protocol
    can be expressed as Ideal-MACgoodputshare= N M (1− η P ). View Source The metric
    S , which evaluates the goodput of the proposed OS-MAC, is then defined as the
    session goodput share normalized to that obtainable under the Ideal-MAC protocol.
    From the network''s perspective, we consider measuring how much of the spectrum
    left unused by PUs can actually be exploited by SUs under each protocol. Hence,
    we evaluate the following metric. 4.3.3 Unused Spectrum Utilization ( U ) This
    metric is defined to be the ratio of bandwidth used by SUs to that of the total
    spectrum left unused by PUs. Before delving into the details of the simulation
    results and analysis, it is important to note that when the network is lightly
    loaded, 7 all protocols perform well. This is due primarily to the fact that when
    sessions in the network are not that many, even when sessions are not perfectly
    balanced across the DCs, the network (that is, all DCs) can fully support all
    the sessions. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on networks that experience medium
    to high traffic loads. In the remainder of this section, we only present and analyze
    results when the network load is above 40 percent. The x-axis of all plots in
    this section represents the traffic load generated by all SUs ( η S ) normalized
    to the total amount of the spectrum left unused by PUs. It is called the Secondary
    Traffic Load on Unused Spectrum, denoted as η ′ S . Hence, η ′ S = η S × 1 1−
    η P . For example, when the PUs'' load is η P =60 hbox% and the SUs'' total load
    is η S =20 hbox% , the x-axis point corresponding to this scenario is η ′ S =50
    hbox% . 4.4 Session Delay Analysis In this section, we measure 1) the average
    session delay D ¯ and 2) the coefficient of variation δ D of delays of all serviced
    sessions under all three protocols: OS-MAC, R-MAC, and MC-MAC. Although D ¯ evaluates
    how well the protocol performs on the average, the metric δ D allows us to evaluate
    the protocol''s performance in terms of fairness among multiple sessions. That
    is, the lower δ D is, the fairer the protocol becomes. 4.4.1 Average Relative
    Session Delay Fig. 3 shows the relative delays averaged over all serviced sessions
    as a function of the SUs'' traffic load η ′ S under each of the three network
    scenarios: no PUs (Fig. 3a), PUs with η P =30 hbox% (Fig. 3b), and PUs with η
    P =60 hbox% (Fig. 3c). Fig. 3. Average relative session delays D ¯ as a function
    of SUs'' traffic load on unused spectrum η ′ S . (a) No PUs. (b) PUs with η P
    =30 hbox% . (c) PUs with η P =60 hbox% . Show All When PUs are not present (Fig.
    3a), whereas all three protocols cause similar session delays under light traffic
    loads, OS-MAC performs better than the other two protocols under medium to high
    loads. MC-MAC, however, still outperforms R-MAC due to its load-balancing feature.
    OS-MAC outperforms MC-MAC because of its adaptability. Recall that the length
    of beacon intervals of MC-MAC is fixed a priori. Hence, unlike OS-MAC, MC-MAC
    does not adapt to traffic load variations. When PUs are present (Figs. 3b and
    3c), observe that the average measured delay under R-MAC is significantly higher
    than that under OS-MAC. For example, Fig. 3b shows that the average duration of
    sessions serviced under R-MAC varies from almost three times as long ( D ¯ ≈180
    for η ′ S =40 hbox% ) to almost twice as long ( D ¯ ≈80 hbox% for η ′ S =95 hbox%
    ) as the average duration obtained under Ideal-MAC. This delay is even longer
    when PUs incur higher loads, as in the case shown in Fig. 3c ( η P =60 hbox%)
    , where the session duration could be almost three and a half times as long as
    the Ideal-MAC duration. Compared to MC-MAC, OS-MAC also achieves better performance
    in terms of session delays. Note that sessions under MC-MAC can be delayed for
    almost one and a half times as long as in the case of Ideal-MAC ( D ¯ ≈50 hbox%)
    . On the other hand, the delays measured under OS-MAC are significantly small
    (always less than 5 percent) regardless of the traffic load. It is also worth
    noting that these results show that the proposed protocol not only outperforms
    R-MAC and MC-MAC but also performs almost as well as Ideal-MAC. The performance
    difference between OS-MAC and the other two protocols is due to its two distinct
    features: adaptation and selection. First, unlike MC-MAC, the parameter SelWin
    of OS-MAC dynamically adapts to channel conditions and load. The higher the variability
    of traffic load across DCs is, the smaller SelWin becomes, and vice versa. Hence,
    when DCs'' loads are highly variable, OS-MAC shortens its period so that SUs can
    seek better DCs often enough to exploit unused spectrum opportunities. On the
    other hand, when DCs experience less load variability (all DCs have similar loads),
    the length of the period accordingly augments to avoid unnecessary switching.
    Second, the metric (access-time share or throughput share) through which OS-MAC
    assesses the condition of a given DC accounts for the load incurred by PUs, whereas
    MC-MAC decides purely based on the number of SUs that currently use a given DC.
    4.4.2 Coefficient of Variation of D : A Fairness Index Fig. 4 shows the coefficient
    of variation of all measured average session delays as a function of SUs'' traffic
    load ( η ′ S ) , again under each of the three network scenarios: no PUs (Fig.
    4a), PUs with η P =30 hbox% (Fig. 4b), and PUs with η P =60 hbox% (Fig. 4c). Recall
    that the coefficient of variation δ D of session delays is a way of measuring
    and evaluating the protocols'' fairness with respect to the time (duration) for
    sessions to complete. That is, higher values of δ D imply that the corresponding
    protocol does not fairly service all sessions. Fig. 4. Coefficient of variation
    of relative session delays δ D as a function of SUs'' traffic load on unused spectrum
    η ′ S . (a) No PUs. (b) PUs with η P =30 hbox% . (c) PUs with η P =60 hbox% .
    Show All There are two observations to make on the fairness of a protocol. First,
    sessions supported under OS-MAC not only take, on the average, no longer than
    those obtainable under R-MAC or MC-MAC, but also are equally treated by finishing
    each within a time that is proportional to its size. Moreover, this fair treatment
    by OS-MAC is always assured, regardless of the PUs'' load, whereas it is not assured
    under R-MAC nor MC-MAC. In fact, as shown in Fig. 4c, the variation of session
    delays under R-MAC ranges from almost δ D =150 hbox% to almost δ D =100 hbox%
    when η ′ S varies from 40 percent to 100 percent. This means that under R-MAC,
    some sessions could be delayed more than twice as long as other sessions. In certain
    situations, as in the case shown in Fig. 4b, when η ′ S ≃50 hbox% , some sessions
    could be delayed almost four times longer than other sessions. The variation of
    session delays under MC-MAC is also higher than that under OS-MAC. It could be
    as high as δ D =150 hbox% when η P =30 hbox% (Fig. 4b) and as high as δ D =50
    hbox% when η P =60 hbox% (Fig. 4c). In summary, in terms of delay variation among
    different sessions, the proposed protocol is not only fairer than R-MAC and MC-MAC
    but is also fair since the obtained coefficients of variation are very small.
    Second, the variation of delays of different sessions is sensitive to the total
    traffic load, independent of the protocol being used, and behaves as follows:
    When the total network load η is high or low, the variation is low. This is because,
    regardless of how well the protocol balances the sessions across the DCs, at high
    loads, all sessions end up getting delayed, making the delay variation small.
    If the network load is low, the delay variation is also small, but this time,
    the network is able to support all sessions with almost no or little delay. Recall
    that the total network load η is equal to η P + η S = η P + η ′ S (1− η P ) .
    For example, an SU traffic load on the unused spectrum of, say, η ′ S =40 hbox%
    corresponds to a total network load of η=65 hbox% (Fig. 4b) and η=80 hbox% (Fig.
    4c) if the PUs'' network load is η P =30 hbox% and η P =60 hbox% , respectively.
    This explains why the η ′ S =40 hbox% in Fig. 4b (which corresponds to a medium
    total network load of η=65 hbox% ) results in a higher delay variation than the
    η ′ S =40 hbox% (which corresponds to a high total network load of η=80 hbox%
    ) in Fig. 4c. Clearly, the η ′ S =40 hbox% in Fig. 4a still corresponds to a low
    total network load of η=40 hbox% , since no PUs are present. This also results
    in a low delay variation. 4.5 Goodput Analysis We now evaluate the performance
    in terms of sessions'' achievable goodputs. We measure the average S ¯ of normalized
    (with respect to Ideal-MAC) goodput shares of all serviced sessions in the network.
    Although it suffices to evaluate the performance from either a delay or a throughput
    perspective (since, in theory, both are equivalent), we decided to present the
    throughput results to confirm our analysis and performance. Fig. 5 shows the measured
    normalized goodput share averaged over all serviced sessions as a function of
    the SUs'' network traffic load η ′ S under each of the three network scenarios:
    no PUs (Fig. 5a), PUs with η P =30 hbox% (Fig. 5b), and PUs with η P =60 hbox%
    (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5. Average normalized session goodput shares S ¯ as a function
    of SUs'' traffic load on unused spectrum η ′ S . (a) No PUs. (b) PUs with η P
    =30 hbox% . (c) PUs with η P =60 hbox% . Show All First, note that each session
    serviced under the proposed protocol achieves, on the average, a goodput share
    S ¯ of more than 85 percent of that achievable under Ideal-MAC. In addition, observe
    that, the higher the network load due to PUs is, the closer the achieved share
    under the proposed protocol is to that achievable under Ideal-MAC. This demonstrates
    that the proposed protocol performs extremely well, given that Ideal-MAC does
    not account for the bandwidth used neither for packet retransmission nor for sending
    ACKs. Hence, most of the difference in the achievable goodputs is actually consumed
    by ACKs and possible packet retransmissions due to collisions. Another point that
    requires attention is that the achievable goodput shares under OS-MAC are not
    sensitive to the PUs'' network load. This is an important feature of OS-MAC. Both
    R-MAC and MC-MAC, on the other hand, provide sessions with lesser shares than
    what they would otherwise achieve under Ideal-MAC, especially for networks with
    medium or high traffic loads. For example, although the normalized average goodput
    share is ≈60 hbox% for R-MAC and 75 percent for MC-MAC when η P =30 hbox% , it
    is only ≈30 hbox% for R-MAC and 60 percent for MC-MAC when η P =60 hbox% . Unlike
    OS-MAC, both R-MAC and MC-MAC are sensitive to network traffic loads. 4.6 Unused
    Spectrum Analysis To evaluate the performance of OS-MAC from the network''s perspective,
    we measure the percentage of the bandwidth/spectrum that is actually used by SUs
    to that of the total spectrum left unused by PUs. Fig. 6 shows this percentage
    as a function of the SUs'' network traffic load η ′ S under each of the three
    network scenarios: no PUs (Fig. 6a), PUs with η P =30 hbox% (Fig. 6b), and PUs
    with η P =60 hbox% (Fig. 6c). Fig. 6. Average utilization of unused spectrum U
    ¯ as a function of SUs'' traffic load on unused spectrum η ′ S . (a) No PUs. (b)
    PUs with η P =30 hbox% . (c) PUs with η P =60 hbox% . Show All First, note that,
    independent of PUs'' network traffic load, SUs under OS-MAC utilize the spectrum
    left unused by PUs to its fullest extent. For example, SUs'' network traffic load
    of 40 percent ( η ′ S =40 hbox% ) also yields to about 35 percent to 40 percent
    of utilization of the total spectrum left unused by PUs, whereas SUs'' network
    traffic load of 90 percent ( η ′ S =90 hbox% ) also yields about 85 percent of
    utilization of the total spectrum left unused by PUs. This is true, regardless
    of the PUs'' network traffic load (see Fig. 6a for PUs'' traffic load η P =0 ,
    Fig. 6b for PUs'' traffic load η P =30 hbox% , and Fig. 6c for PUs'' traffic load
    η P =60 hbox% ). In addition, observe that OS-MAC is not sensitive to PUs'' network
    loads; that is, the spectrum left unused by PUs is fully exploited by SUs under
    each of the three network scenarios: η P =0 hbox% as in Fig. 6a, η P =30 hbox%
    as in Fig. 6b, and η P =60 hbox% as in Fig. 6c. Hence, OS-MAC performs well not
    only from the user''s perspective but also from the network''s perspective. When
    the network load is medium to heavy (that is, the SUs'' traffic load is greater
    than 80 percent and the PUs'' traffic load is greater than 60 percent, as shown
    in Fig. 6c), note that R-MAC and MC-MAC respectively result in an average utilization
    of the unused spectrum of only about 25 percent to 30 percent and 55 percent to
    60 percent, whereas OS-MAC always results in an average spectrum utilization of
    more than 85 percent. The performance difference between OS-MAC and MC-MAC in
    terms of spectrum utilization is due to 1) the adaptation of OS-MAC''s parameters
    to channel conditions and loads, 2) the PU-aware channel assessment metric of
    OS-MAC, and 3) the delegation mechanism of OS-MAC that, unlike the case of MC-MAC,
    avoids having all SUs periodically switch to the CC for channel setups and selection.
    Having all SUs switch to the CC every beacon interval, as in MC-MAC, results in
    bandwidth wastage since all DCs will not be used during the entire ATIM window
    period. In our protocol, only one delegate of each DC switches to the CC, whereas
    all other SUs remain in and continue using their DCs. Based on the simulation
    results, we can make two claims. First, OS-MAC is shown to be more effective than
    R-MAC and MC-MAC not only from the network''s perspective but also from the user''s
    perspective. Second, it achieves performances that are comparable to those obtainable
    under Ideal-MAC. 4.7 Extensions to OS-MAC The access-time share metric used by
    OS-MAC to characterize a DC''s conditions is defined as the ratio of the amount
    of time during which the SU possesses the channel during the Select Phase to that
    of the total duration of the Select Phase. This ratio is periodically updated
    every OSP. Note that when all DCs support the same data rate, the access-time
    share is exactly equivalent to the obtainable throughput share, which can simply
    be calculated as the access-time share times the bandwidth of the DC. Hence, the
    metric used by OS-MAC to assess channel conditions ensures that each user receives
    an equal share of the available throughput. We now show how OS-MAC can easily
    be extended to support the case when different DCs may be allocated different
    bandwidths or experience different channel conditions, thereby enabling them to
    support different data rates. In such a case, we define the obtainable throughput
    share as the total number of bits successfully sent during the Select Phase divided
    by the length of the Select Phase, and we use it for assessing the condition of
    a channel. Note, however, that this incurs very little modification to OS-MAC.
    Each user will then have to count the number of successfully delivered packets
    in lieu of the amount of time during which it had control over the DC. SECTION
    5 Practicality versus Efficiency 5.1 Is a Common Control Channel Necessary? The
    designation of a portion of resource as a “common good” may appear unattractive
    to selfish individuals. Are we not fortunate that this does not always hold? In
    some cases, all individuals will be better off with the “common good” than if
    each had pursued only his selfish interest. Public parks and highways are two
    illustrative examples of “common goods” (the land is the resource here), where
    all individuals would be worse off without them. Imagine what would happen if
    there were no highways, but each individual had a piece of land. With some reflection,
    one can observe that the inefficiency of the spectrum resource is pretty much
    due to the lack of efficient access methods, which is, in turn, due to the spectrum''s
    current selfish command-and-control regulations. Dedicating a piece of the spectrum
    as a common means for collaborative tasks is, indeed, an absolute necessity to
    achieve spectrum access efficiency. To a considerably large extent, each having
    a spectrum band without a common channel is very much like each having a piece
    of land without a highway. Moreover, previous studies [15], [16], [17] show and
    argue that the dedication of a common channel leads to high overall spectrum efficiency.
    In [15] and [16], the authors experimentally show that a common spectrum coordination
    channel (CSCC) actually significantly improves the overall efficiency of the spectrum.
    A second case where a common channel is shown to be very beneficial is the European
    DRiVE Project [17], in which a dedicated common channel, referred to as a logical
    common coordination channel (LCCC), is used as a means for spectrum users to coordinate
    for better dynamic spectrum allocation. From its efficient usage standpoint, the
    spectrum is far better off with a dedicated common channel than without it. The
    design of OS-MAC is based on this principle. 5.2 Will Cooperation Prevail? One
    subtle question in spectrum agility that has not yet fully been answered is how
    PUs can be protected from the SUs'' interference if SUs are allowed to opportunistically
    access and use their spectrum. To make the matter even worse, the issue is not
    so much of how interference protection can be assured but how we can do so while
    maximizing spectrum utilization. Let us think of the question as a two-step challenge:
    first, get it to work, and then, make it efficient. It is worth noting that the
    above interference problem cannot efficiently be solved unless SUs are capable
    of detecting the presence or the return of PUs in any spectrum band that they
    use or may use. As mentioned in Section 2, this work assumes that the underlying
    physical radio is capable of detecting the return or the presence of PUs. Hence,
    the physical layer is assumed to inform its MAC layer of its detection of PUs.
    Under this assumption, we now look at what OS-MAC can do to tackle the above two-step
    challenge. If we relax the efficiency requirement, it should be apparent that
    interference can be avoided by just empowering SUs with the capability of vacating
    the licensed spectrum upon the detection of the return or the presence of PUs.
    One simple approach is then to have SUs switch to the common channel and start
    over after finding new spectrum opportunities. Another even simpler approach is
    to have SUs cease communication upon the detection of PUs and stay tuned to the
    same spectrum band until it becomes vacant again. Clearly, these two approaches
    are not efficient from the spectrum utilization''s standpoint. If spectrum efficiency
    is our ultimate goal and hence presents a constraint to the problem, then the
    MAC layer must also provide SUs with a low-cost recovery mechanism. The recovery
    mechanism should allow SUs to quickly find and switch to different spectrum bands
    upon the detection of the return of PUs. There are two approaches that OS-MAC
    can use to efficiently solve the interference-avoidance problem: noncooperative
    and cooperative. In the noncooperative approach, OS-MAC assumes that PUs do not
    cooperate with SUs for better spectrum utilization. For example, PUs do not alert
    SUs of their return nor permit spectrum sharing with SUs, even for an amount of
    time that allows SUs to inform each other of and switch to a new opportunistic
    band. In this case, SUs must cease using the licensed spectrum band immediately
    upon the detection of PUs. In OS-MAC, all SUs must suspend their sessions, switch
    to CC, and wait until the next Update Phase to select a new DC. Although the reason
    behind the immediate vacancy is to preserve the PUs'' quality of service, this
    may cause the overall spectrum inefficiency, which unfortunately conflicts with
    the main objective. We envision that this approach is likely to be more applicable
    and attractive from the implementation/practicality point of view, at least in
    a short-term strategy, since it does not require explicit involvement of licensees.
    The cooperative approach, on the other hand, consists of having spectrum licensees
    collaborate with SUs to achieve efficient spectrum use. For example, if SUs are
    allowed to continue using the spectrum after the detection of PUs for a short
    duration of time before vacating the channel, they may be able to inform each
    other of other potential spectrum opportunities and, hence, seize and switch to
    one of them without going through the common channel. In fact, one can think of
    several ways to improve spectrum use, each of which depends not only on licensees''
    willingness and incentives to collaborate but also on their spectrum access methods.
    For example, if PUs use the CDMA technology as their access method, we argue that
    it would be more beneficial in terms of the overall spectrum efficiency if a few
    spreading codes are reserved for SUs to use in such an emergency case. On the
    other hand, if PUs rely on the OFDMA technology to access their spectrum, one
    can reserve one narrow-band channel for SUs to use in case of the return of PUs.
    In essence, we think that spectrum use can be far more effective if a small portion
    of the bandwidth of each spectrum band (whether time, frequency, or code) is reserved
    for emergency use. Obviously, this approach requires that spectrum policies and
    market regulations evolve toward more flexible models than current ones. Spectrum
    policy makers are then required to implement such flexible strategies not only
    in newly allocated bands but also and gradually in the already-occupied spectrum.
    It requires 1) intelligent economical/pricing strategies to encourage licensees
    to move toward spectrum openness and 2) innovative transitional mechanisms that
    can be employed to improve spectrum efficiency without degrading the quality of
    existing services. Although less efficient, we envision that the noncooperative
    approach is a short-term solution for the opportunistic access of spectrum. The
    cooperative approach will prevail in a longer term. SECTION 6 Related Work There
    have been numerous studies on the classical multiple channel access [14], [18],
    [19], [20], [21]. In general, most of the reported protocols set aside a channel
    (CC) for traffic control and use the others for data communications (DCs). DCA-MAC,
    as proposed in [19], assumes that each wireless device is equipped with two half-duplex
    transceivers: One is always tuned on the CC and the other is tuned on a DC. DCA-MAC
    operates on a packet-by-packet basis; that is, prior to transmitting each packet,
    the source-destination pair must switch to the CC to negotiate the new DC, on
    which the next packet will take place. To some extent, DCA-MAC is very much like
    the IEEE 802.11, except that the RTS/CTS handshaking mechanism indicates not only
    who is using the medium during next packet but also who is using each DC. Another
    multiple-channel MAC, called MC-MAC, is proposed in [14]. Like OS-MAC, MC-MAC
    also uses one half-duplex transceiver. In MC-MAC, all devices must periodically
    tune on the CC for an interval of time, called ATIM, during which source-destination
    pairs negotiate and select their new DC. The period, which is a design parameter,
    is chosen and fixed at the time of initialization. Most of these reported multiple-channel
    access protocols cannot be used in the context of spectrum agility for several
    reasons. First, they are not designed for opportunistically accessing licensed
    spectrum. Second, they are mostly designed for conventional one-to-one packet
    communication, and hence, they do not support the notion of a group of users involved
    with a session. Finally, they are static in the sense that their parameters are
    to be fixed a priori, and hence, they do not adapt to current traffic loads for
    better spectrum utilization in real time. The design of dynamic and agile techniques
    for spectrum sharing and allocation is more recent and is still in its infancy
    [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Generally, these reported techniques
    can be classified into two categories: centralized [22], [23] and distributed
    [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. In [22], a centralized protocol, called the Dynamic
    Spectrum Access Protocol (DSAP), for managing and coordinating spectrum access
    is proposed. The DSAP is basically a way of providing and managing the dynamic
    allocation of spectrum bands to users while avoiding congestion and minimizing
    interference. Zekavat and Li [23] propose a new cognitive radio-based architecture
    for dynamic channel allocation. The basic idea is that, instead of having users
    always subscribe to and receive service from one service provider, they can dynamically
    and adaptively change their service provider based on quality/cost metrics such
    as channel availability, congestion, and cost. These approaches are new and interesting
    concepts to address the inefficient and “static” way of current spectrum allocation
    policies. There have also been distributed approaches ranging from dynamic allocation
    of spectrum [24], [25] to its adaptive sharing among multiple users [26], [27],
    [28]. Cao and Zheng [24] propose a dynamic bargaining approach for spectrum allocation
    across mobile users. The approach extends existing graph-coloring-based spectrum
    assignment schemes to account for mobility. Their approach reduces computation
    and communication overheads by taking prior-to-move allocation information into
    account in determining the new assignments. Along the same line, Zhao et al. [25]
    present a dynamic channel coordination scheme, where users organize themselves
    into groups with similar communication interests. Although members of each group
    subscribe and use one channel to communicate with each other, boundary members
    are allowed to subscribe to multiple channels to maintain connectivity across
    multiple groups. In [26], the channel allocation problem is modeled to be the
    outcome of a game in which the players are the users, their actions are the choices
    of transmitting channels, and their preferences are reflected through the quality
    of the chosen channels. They also define two different objective functions for
    the spectrum sharing games, respectively capturing the utility of selfish and
    cooperative users. Based on these game-theoretic approaches, cooperation-based
    spectrum sharing methods are shown to achieve better spectrum access performance
    than noncooperative sharing ones. This, however, comes at the expense of increased
    overhead due to required information exchange. Sankaranarayanan et al. [27] propose
    AS-MAC, a multiband access MAC protocol that enables communication between pairs
    of nodes. Basically, AS-MAC empowers nodes to first agree upon a DC through a
    handshake that involves the exchange of three control messages—an RTS, a CTS,
    and a Reservation (RES) message—and then switch to it for communication. This
    handshake is similar to that of the IEEE 802.11, except that instead of agreeing
    on which time slots to reserve, pairs of nodes use the handshake to agree and
    then reserve the DC to communicate on. In [28], a MAC protocol, called DOSS, is
    proposed for spectrum-agile networks. Like DCA-MAC, DOSS functions on a packet-by-packet
    basis; a new channel is negotiated for each packet. Under DOSS, the spectrum is
    divided into one CC and many pairs of (data or busy-tone) bands; that is, for
    each data band, there is a busy tone band mapped to it. Although the CC is used
    for DC negotiation, busy-tone bands are used by receivers to prevent nearby transmitters
    from interfering with them. DOSS then prevents this interference by requiring
    that receivers continuously send busy tones on the corresponding busy tone bands
    during the whole course of their receptions. DOSS has three major disadvantages.
    First, although busy tones solve the hidden-terminal problem with lesser traffic
    overhead than the traditional IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS handshaking mechanism, the bandwidth
    that they use may be significant, thereby resulting in spectrum inefficiency.
    Second, DOSS requires that each device has at least two transceivers: one for
    sending busy tones and the other for data communication. Finally, power consumption
    may now present a major concern due to the extra amount of energy needed for transmissions
    of busy tones. SECTION 7 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed the OS-MAC protocol
    for cognitive wireless networks. OS-MAC dedicates one channel as a common CC,
    where interchannel control traffic takes place. In OS-MAC, devices are only required
    to be equipped with a half-duplex transceiver. OS-MAC empowers SDR-based wireless
    devices with the capabilities of 1) adaptively and dynamically seeking and exploiting
    opportunities in both licensed and unlicensed spectra and along both the time
    and the frequency dimensions, 2) accessing and sharing spectrum among different
    unlicensed and licensed users, and 3) coordinating with other unlicensed users
    for better spectrum utilization. OS-MAC has several distinct features. First,
    it significantly improves the spectrum access efficiency by balancing the traffic
    load over all spectrum bands. Second, it fairly treats all users by assuring them
    to receive an equal access-time share or throughput share. Third, it incurs no
    or little control overhead. Finally, it dynamically adapts to the network traffic
    load to achieve higher performance while minimizing the control overhead. The
    performance of OS-MAC is evaluated using an ns2-based simulation. We showed that
    OS-MAC is far more effective than current protocols from both the network''s and
    the user''s perspectives. We also showed that OS-MAC achieves performances that
    are very close to those achievable under the Ideal-MAC protocol. Introduction
    of IEEE 802.11 The IEEE 802.11 MAC [13] protocol supports two types of traffic:
    asynchronous and synchronous. The protocol allows simultaneous existence of both
    types by partitioning transmission time units, called superframes, into a contention-free
    period (CFP) and a contention period (CP). The point coordination function (PCF)
    is an access method provided by the IEEE 802.11 Standard to support the synchronous
    traffic during CFPs, whereas the distributed coordination function (DCF) is an
    access method that the Standard provides to support the asynchronous traffic during
    CPs. The DCF method is based on the CSMA paradigm and is originally designed to
    solve and tackle certain problems, namely, the hidden and exposed terminal problems,
    which are introduced by the wireless nature of the ad hoc networks. The IEEE 802.11
    DCF Standard Specifications then included the collision-avoidance feature by means
    of the RTS and CTS handshake mechanism to solve these problems. According to the
    DCF specifications, prior to transmitting a packet, a user must first sense the
    medium to be idle for a minimum duration called the DIFS period. Then, to reduce
    collision, the user must wait for an additional random backoff period calculated
    as b×τ , where b is a number, called backoff counter, selected from a uniform
    distribution in the interval [0, W 0 −1] and τ is the length of the time slot
    period. The parameter W 0 is a fixed number referred to as the initial contention
    window size. While waiting, the user decrements its counter by 1 every idle time
    slot. Every time the medium becomes busy, the user must freeze its backoff counter.
    Once the counter is frozen, the user resumes decrementing the counter by 1 every
    idle time slot after sensing that the medium is again idle for a DIFS period.
    When the counter reaches 0, the user proceeds transmission. In the case of unsuccessful
    transmission, the user keeps retransmitting the packet until it either succeeds
    or reaches a threshold number of attempts. At the ith retransmission attempt,
    the contention window size W must equal W i =max{ f i × W 0 , W m } , where f
    is a persistent factor (typically f=2 ) and W m is the maximum allowed size of
    the contention window. Upon a successful transmission, the contention window is
    rest to its initial size. When the receiving user receives a nonerroneous packet,
    it only needs to wait for a short interframe space (SIFS) period—shorter than
    the DIFS period—before acknowledging the sender. Authors Figures References Citations

    of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio based wireless networks. Spectrum sensing
    is the key enabler for dynamic spectrum access as it can allow secondary networks
    to reuse spectrum without causing harmful interference to primary users. Here
    we propose a set of integrated medium access control (MAC) and physical layer
    (PHY) spectrum sensing techniques that provide reliable access to television (TV)
    bands. At the MAC level, we propose a two-stage spectrum sensing that guarantees
    timely detection of incumbents while meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirements
    of secondary users. At the PHY level, we introduce FFT-based pilot energy and
    location detection schemes that can detect a TV signal on a TV channel at levels
    as low as -116 dBm. We have evaluated these schemes through simulation and prototyping
    and show their effectiveness, reliability, and efficiency. These mechanisms are
    also part of the current IEEE 802.22 draft standard which is based on cognitive
    radio technology. Published in: 2007 2nd International Conference on Cognitive

    FL, USA SECTION I. Introduction Most of the radio frequency spectrum is allocated,
    although much of it is unused. The enormous growth in the wireless industry has
    come from using only a small part of the wireless spectrum, nominally less than
    10% under spectrum, 3 GHz. There is growing evidence of scarcity and overcrowding
    in these bands reflected, for example, by the price paid for 3G cellular spectrum
    (€ 90 billion in Europe). However, measurements have shown that other parts of
    the spectrum - although allocated - are virtually unused, and known widely as
    spectrum white spaces. These white spaces vary from place to place and time to
    time. With recent developments in Cognitive Radio (CR) [1][2][3] techniques, it
    becomes possible to harness these spectrum white spaces without causing harmful
    interference to incumbent users. Such dynamic spectrum sharing enabled by CRs,
    coupled with spectrum regulation to provide tiered access rights, is expected
    to dramatically increase the utilization of spectrum. and enable a whole new class
    of appliation. Tiered access right may be described as incumbent users endowed
    with pre-emptive access to their spectrum, whereas the secondary CRs have access
    rights for opportunistic usage in spectrum white spaces on a non-interfering basis.
    A key building block in any CR system is the spectrum sensing function, which
    consists of (a) sensing algorithms to quickly and robustly detect the presence
    of incumbent signals, and(b) (b) well-designed coordination and communication
    protocols. Since incumbent users must be detected at a power level of an order
    of magnitude (or more) below thermal noise floor, long sensing (also known as
    integration or quiet) times may be required thus precluding the support of real-time
    applications by the wireless network. In this paper we focus on two breakthrough
    spectrum sensing technologies based on pilot detection that provides quick and
    robust sensing, and that together with novel MAC schemes proposed provide a means
    for the wireless network to support QoS sensitive applications without disruptions
    while protecting incumbents from harmful interference. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows. In Section II we provide an overview of spectrum sensing
    requirements in the context of the CR-based IEEE 802.22 standard [6]. In Section
    III we delve into the various specifics about spectrum sensing with respect to
    signal processing, baseband and MAC layer support. We then propose spectrum sensing
    algorithms and associated MAC protocols that jointly enable an effective and cohesive
    spectrum sensing function. The performance evaluation of these schmes is then
    given in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes this paper. SECTION II. Spectrum
    Sensing Requirements Spectrum sensing is the process of periodically and dynamically
    monitoring a given radio spectrum band (e.g., VHF and UHF TV bands) in order to
    determine its availability for use on a non-interfering basis. Spectrum sensing
    is a mandatory functionality in any CR-based wireless system that shares spectrum
    bands with primary services, such as the IEEE 802.22 standard [5][6], which proposes
    to reuse vacant spectrum in the TV broadcast bands. Given its more advanced stage
    development, in this section we describe the main requirements for spectrum sensing
    in e 802.22 standard. Throughout the rest the paper, we also use IEEE 80.22 as
    an example application of the proposed spectrum sensing mechanisms, although their
    underlying ideas could also be applicable to other wireless systems. A. Incumbents
    to Protect The spectrum sensing mechanisms in 802.22 are designed to protect to
    two types of incumbents, namely, the TV service and wireless microphones. In particular,
    wireless microphones are licensed secondary users of the spectrum, and are allowed
    by FCC to operate on vacant TV channels on a non-interfering basis (please refer
    to Part 74 of the FCC rules)1. Contrary to detection of TV transmission which
    takes place over 6 MHz channels (in the USA) with high transmit power, detection
    of wireless microphone operation is much harder as they transmit at a much lower
    power (typically 50 mW for a 100 m coverage range) and occupy much smaller bandwidths
    (200 KHz). B. DFS Timing Requirements The Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) timing
    parameters define the requirements that the secondary wireless system must adhere
    to in order to effectively protect the incumbents. Table 1 illustrates the key
    DFS parameters defined within 802.22, and which are based on the DFS model ordered
    by the FCC for the 5 GHz band [8]. Four key parameters are the Channel Detection
    Time (CDT), the Incumbent Detection Threshold (IDT), the Probability of Detection
    (PD) and the Probability of False Alarms (PFA). The CDT defines the time during
    which an incumbent operation can withstand interference before the 802.22 system
    detects it. It dictates how quickly an 802.22 system must be able to detect an
    incumbent signal exceeding the IDT with a probability of detection greater or
    equal to PD and probability of false alarm lower than or equal to PFA. Once the
    incumbent signal is detected at a signal level higher than IDT, two other new
    parameters have to be considered, namely, Channel Move Time (CMT) and Channel
    Closing Transmission Time (CCTT). The CCTT is the aggregate duration of transmissions
    by 802.22 devices during the CMT. Table 1- Selected DFS Parameters The DFS parameters
    are critical to the design of efficient spectrum sensing mechanisms that offer
    the required protection to the incumbents, while causing minimal impact on the
    operation of the 802.22 network. SECTION III. Proposed Spectrum Sensing Mechanisms
    The topic of spectrum sensing algorithms for detection of incumbent signals has
    recently been receiving a lot of attention [6][17][18]. Within IEEE 802.22, a
    number of techniques such as energy detection (full bandwidth and pilot), ATSC
    field sync detection, cyclostationary detection, spectral correlation, multi-resolution
    spectrum sensing and analog auto correlation have been proposed and evaluated
    via simulations using captured real-world ATSC signals. In this paper, we propose
    a novel method based on detecting the pilot energy and location that can be used
    with either one or multiple sensing dwells (windows2), and hence fits well with
    the MAC sensing architecture by allowing the QoS of secondary services to be preserved
    despite the regularly scheduled sensing windows. At the MAC layer, existing work
    has not addressed the impact of spectrum sensing on QoS support to secondary users
    [12][13][14]. The IEEE 802.11h [4] standard includes basic mechanisms to quiet
    channels, but does not deal with the protocol mechanisms to synchronize quiet
    periods of overlapping networks or to guarantee seamless operation in the presence
    of incumbents. The two stage sensing, incumbent detection and notification, and
    synchronization schemes described in this section, however, have been designed
    for operation in highly dynamic and dense networks and have been adopted in the
    current draft of the IEEE 802.22 standard [6]. Different variations of these schemes
    are also used in the Cognitive MAC (C-MAC) protocol introduced in [15]. A. Spectrum
    Sensing Algorithms In keeping with the general rule of IEEE 802, the 802.22 draft
    standard cannot specify receiver algorithms. However, 802.22 is a special case
    in which spectrum sensing is a very important feature of the standard even though
    its actual implementation will be in the receivers. Hence, the objective of the
    802.22 group is to define requirements for sensing that have to be met by all
    manufacturers. This specification of sensing requirements is ongoing [9]. As presented
    in Section II, the principal metrics for characterizing a sensing algorithm are
    PD and PFA. In our discussion throughout the rest of this paper, we use Probability
    of Missed Detection (PMD) instead of PD. The PMD is the probability of failing
    in detecting an incumbent user which is present on the sensed channel, and is
    defined as PMD which 1 - PD. Both PMD and PFA are functions of the received SNR
    and threshold. Ideally, one would like to have PMD = 0.0 and PFA = 0.0. However,
    in a practical situation these will be hard to achieve and it might be more reasonable
    to allow acceptable ranges for PFA of 0.01 – 0.1 and PMD of 0.05 – 0.10. From
    the incumbent protection point of view, a higher PFAis more tolerable than a higher
    PMD. There are two main approaches to spectrum sensing: energy detection and feature
    detection. Energy detection is used to determine presence of signal energy in
    the band of interest, and is followed by feature detection to determine if indeed
    the signal energy is due to the presence of an incumbent. Since 802.22 will be
    implemented in the TV bands, the digital incumbent signals could be either ATSC
    (North America), DVB-T (Europe), or ISDB (Japan). In this paper we consider feature
    detection only for ATSC. The ATSC signal has a number of features that could be
    exploited for feature detection algorithms: PN 511 sequence: The ATSC signal has
    a 511-symbol long PN sequence that is inserted in the data stream every 24.2 ms.
    Since this is quite infrequent, averaging over more than one field would be necessary
    for detection, leading to longer detection times. Pilot: The ATSC signal uses
    a 8-VSB (Vestigial Side Band) modulation with signal levels (−7,−5,−3,−1,1,3,5,7).
    A DC offset of 1.25 is added to this at baseband to effectively create a small
    pilot signal to enable carrier recovery at the receiver. Segment-synch: the ATSC
    data is sent in segments of 828 symbols. At the beginning of each segment a 4-symbol
    sequence (5,−5,−5,5) is sent. Detection of this sequence can be used in a feature
    detector. Cyclostationarity: Since the ATSC signal is a digital signal with a
    symbol rate of 10.76 MHz, cyclostationary detectors may be used as a feature detector.
    The main problem with any feature detection method for ATSC is the requirement
    of detection at a very low signal level (-116 dbm - see IDT in Table 1). Most
    of the synchronization schemes designed for ATSC receivers fail at these low signal
    levels and the detector may require large number of samples to average over for
    a reliable detection. In Section IV. A we present simulation results of a feature
    detection algorithm based on detecting the ATSC pilot. The ATSC VSB signal has
    a pilot at the lower band-edge in a known location relative to the signal. For
    this description, we will assume that the signal to be sensed is a band-pass signal
    at a low-IF of 5.38 MHz with the nominal pilot location at 2.69 MHz and is sampled
    at 21.52 MHz. However, the basic steps can be implemented with suitable modifications
    for any IF and sampling rate. The essential features of the proposed method are
    as follows: Demodulate the signal to baseband by the nominal frequency offset
    of f c =2.69 MHz Hence, if x(t) is the real, band-pass signal at low-IF, y(t)=x(t)
    e −J2 f c t is the complex demodulated signal at baseband. Filter y(t) with a
    low-pass filter of bandwidth, e.g., 40kHz (±/-20kHZ). The filter bandwidth should
    be large enough to accmmodte any unknown frequency offsets. Down-sample the filtered
    signal from 21.52 MHz to 53.8 KHz, to form the signal z(t) . Take FFT of the down-sampled
    signal z(t) . Depending on the sensing period, the length of the FFT will vary.
    For example, a a 1 ms sensing window will allow a 32-point FFT while a 5 ms window
    will allow a 256-point FFT. Determine the maximum value, and location, of the
    FFT output squared. Signal detection can then be done either by setting a threshold
    on the maximum value, or by observing the location of the peak over successive
    intervals. Instead of the FFT, other well-known spectrum estimation methods, such
    as the Welch periodogram can also be used in step (4) above. The basic method
    described above can be adapted to a variety of scenarios as described below: Multiple
    fine sensing windows, e.g. 5 ms sensing dwells every 10 ms. The 256-point FFT
    outputs squared from each sensing window can be averaged to form a composite statistic
    as well as the location information from each measurement can be used to derive
    a detection metric. If a single long sensing window, e.g. 10 ms is available,
    a 512-point FFT or periodogram can be used to obtain better detection performance.
    The parameters of the sensor can be chosen depending on the desired sensing time,
    complexity, probability of missed detection and probability of false alarm. Detection
    based on location is robust against noise uncertainty since the position of the
    pilot can be pinpointed with accuracy even if the amplitude is low due to fading.
    Various combing schemes can be developed for both pilot-energy and pilot-location
    sensing. Pilot-energy sensing: For a single sensing window, the FFT output is
    simply squared and the maximum value is compared to a threshold. For multiple
    sensing dwells, there are 2 possibilities: (i) the decision from each dwell is
    saved and a “hard-decision” rule is applied to declare “signal detect” if the
    number of positives is greater than a certain number, or (ii) the square of the
    FFT output of all dwells is averaged and the maximum level is compared to a threshold.
    The choice of threshold in all cases is determined by the desired PFA. Pilot-location
    sensing: This is usually used for multiple dwells. The location of the maximum
    value of the FFT output squared is compared between multiple dwells. If the distance
    is less than a prescribed threshold, the signal is declared detected. Another
    method is to count the number of times a particular frequency bin is chosen as
    the location of the maximum: if greater than a certain threshold, the signal is
    declared detected. B. Spectrum Sensing at the MAC In order to maximize the reliability
    and efficiency of the spectrum sensing algorithms described in the previous subsection,
    and meet the CDT requirement for detecting the presence of incumbents, the network
    can schedule network-wide quiet periods for sensing. During these quiet periods,
    all network traffic is suspended and stations can perform sensing more reliably.
    In 802.22, for example, the base station (BS) is responsible for managing and
    scheduling these quiet periods. To meet these requirements while satisfying the
    QoS requirements of the secondary network, we propose a two stage sensing (TSS)
    management mechanism. The TSS mechanism enables the network to dynamically adjust
    the duration and the frequency of quiet periods according to the sensing windows
    required by the sensing algorithms (see Section III.A) in order to protect the
    incumbents. In the first stage, multiple short quiet periods are scheduled to
    attempt to assess the state of the sensed radio spectrum without causing impact
    to the secondary network performance. In the second stage, more time consuming
    quiet periods can be scheduled in case the target spectrum needs to be sensed
    for a longer period of time. In addition to the TSS which provides timely detection
    mechanism, we also introduce a notification mechanism through which devices (e.g.,
    the consumer premise equipments (CPEs) in IEEE 802.22 terminology) can report
    the results of the sensing process back to the BS (see Section III.B.2). To ensure
    the effective use of quiet periods to improve sensing reliability, nearby networks
    must also synchronize their quiet periods. In Section III.B.3, we discuss how
    coexisting 802.22 cells can synchronize their quiet periods. The TSS, notification,
    and synchronization mechanisms proposed here have been incorporated into the current
    802.22 draft MAC standard. In the next subsection we present these schemes within
    the context of 802.22, and evaluate their performance in Section IV.B. 1 Quiet
    Periods Management and Scheduling The TSS quiet period management mechanism has
    different time scales, namely, a short (or fast) sensing period that can be scheduled
    regularly with minimal impact on the users'' QoS, and a long (or fine) sensing
    period that can be used to detect a specific type of incumbent signal. The short
    and long sensing periods correspond to the first and second stage of the TSS,
    respectively. The TSS presented here is a more general and enhanced version of
    the MAC sensing scheme introduced in [15][16]. Within IEEE 802.22, the first stage
    of TSS is termed as intra-frame sensing, while the second stage is called interframe
    sensing. Intra-frame Sensing:This stage uses short quiet periods of less than
    one frame size3. The 802.22 MAC allows only one intra-frame quiet period per frame
    and it must be scheduled always at the end of the frame. This is important to
    ensure nearby 802.22 cells can synchronize their quiet periods, as discussed in
    Section III.B.3. Based on the results of spectrum sensing done over a number of
    intra-frame quiet periods, the BS decides whether to schedule an interframe quiet
    period over multiple frames in order to perform more detailed sensing. Inter-frame
    Sensing: This stage is defined as taking longer than one frame size and it is
    used when the sensing algorithm requires longer sensing durations. Since a long
    quiet period may degrade the performance for QoS sensitive traffic, the allocation
    and the duration of the inter-frame sensing stage should be dynamically adjustable
    by the BS in a way to minimize the impact on the users'' QoS. The TSS mechanism
    in IEEE 802.22 is illustrated in Figure 1. A first stage involving several intra-frame
    sensing periods can be followed by a longer inter-frame sensing period, if needed
    to detect the specific signature of a signal detected during the first stage.
    Considering the fact that incumbents in TV bands do not come on the air frequently,
    only the intra-frame sensing stage will be used most of the times, and so QoS
    is not compromised. The longer inter-frame sensing stage will step in only when
    required. Figure 1 The TSS mechanism Show All In 802.22, the BS broadcasts the
    schedule and the durations of the intra-frame and inter-frame quiet periods in
    the superframe control header (SCH), which is transmitted at the beginning of
    every superframe. This method incurs minimal overhead and allows the scheduling
    of quiet periods well in advance, which enables a tight synchronization of quiet
    periods amongst neighboring systems. The BS can also schedule quiet periods on
    an on-demand basis using management frames specified in the 802.22 draft [7].
    One of the major benefits of the TSS mechanism is allowing the CR network to meet
    the stringent QoS requirements of real time applications such as voice over IP,
    while ensuring the required protection to the incumbents. B.2 Incumbent Detection
    and Notification Once an incumbent is detected on an operating channel, say channel
    N, or in an adjacent channel (e.g. N+1 and N-1), the secondary system must vacate
    the channel, while satisfying the DFS requirements (CMT and CCTT) described in
    Table 1. In a cell-based system, such as 802.22, detection of an incumbent must
    be notified in a timely fashion to the BS, so it can take proper action to protect
    the incumbents4. A number of mechanisms are described in the 802.22 draft standard
    to deal with these situations. For example, a CPE may notify the BS by using the
    UCS (Urgent Coexistence Situation) slots available within the MAC frame. Since
    the allocation of the UCS window is known to all CPEs, it can be used even when
    CPEs are under interference. As far as access method goes, both contention-based
    and CDMA can be used during the UCS window. Alternatively, the BS can poll CPEs
    to obtain feedback. In this case, the polled CPE can send a notification back
    to the BS, or else if no response is received from CPEs, the BS can take further
    actions to assess the situation such as scheduling additional quiet periods or
    even immediately switching channels. 3 Synchronization of Quiet Periods Self-coexistence
    amongst multiple overlapping CR networks is a key feature not only to efficiently
    share the available spectrum, but also to ensure the required protection to the
    incumbents. For instance, multiple secondary networks may operate in the same
    geographical region, and in case nearby networks share the same channel, it is
    paramount that they are able to synchronize their quiet periods, since transmissions
    during sensing windows could increase PFAconsiderably. For the case of the 802.22
    standard, it provides a comprehensive coexistence framework to enable overlapping
    networks to exchange information in order to share the spectrum and also synchronize
    their quiet periods. At the core of this framework is the Coexistence Beacon Protocol
    (CBP), which is based on the transmission of CBP frames (beacons or packets) by
    CPE and/or BSs. The CBP packets are transmitted the end of a frame. During these
    windows. CPEs in overlapping areas can send CBP packets using a contention- based
    access mechanism. These packets may be received by neighboring BSs or by CPEs
    in neighboring cells, which forward them to their corresponding BSs. The CBP packets
    carry information needed for establishing time synchronization amongst neighboring
    cells, as well as the schedule of the quiet periods. For the purpose of synchronization,
    CBP packets carry relative timestamp information about their networks. Mathematically
    speaking, when BSi, responsible for network i , receives a CBP packet from network
    j , controlled by BS j it shall adjust the start time of its superframe if, and
    only if, the following convergence rule is satisfied: ∣ ∣ ∣ (Frame_Numbe r j −Frame_Numbe
    r i )×FDC+ Trasmission_Offset−Reception_Offset ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ FS×FDC+GuardBand×SymbolSize
    2 View Source Where Frame_Numberis the frame number within the superframe, FDC
    is the frame duration code (equal to 10ms), FS is the number of frames per superframe
    (equal to 16), GuardBand is a few OFDM symbols long to account for propagation
    delays, SymbolSize is the size of an OFDM symbol, and Reception_Offset and Transmission_Offset
    are the index of the symbol number within the frame where the CBP packet was received/transmitted,
    respectively. By this mechanism, it has been shown [10] that co-channel networks
    are able to synchronize their quiet periods resulting in the arrangement depicted
    in Error! Reference source not found.. This way, sensing can be made with high
    reliability. SECTION IV. Performance evaluation We have evaluated the proposed
    spectrum sensing algorithm and MAC layer mechanism for supporting spectrum sensing
    via simulations. The MAC has been implemented spectrum the OPNET network simulator.
    For the spectrum sensing algorithms, we have a simulation platform as well as
    have built a real-time prototypical sensor that can detect digital TV signals
    at a low signal level of −116dBm, as per required (see Table 1). A. Spectrum Sensing
    Algorithms Simulations were performed using the sensing algorithm described in
    Section III with the 12 signals specified by the IEEE 802.22 committee [19]. These
    signals cover the range of real-world signal conditions with respect to frequency
    offsets and multipath fading and hence are a good test for any sensing algorithm.
    The sensing time used was a multiple of 5 ms dwells, which allowed the use of
    a 256-point FFT. Figure 3 shows the PMD versus SNR curve for a PFA of 5%, for
    a single 5 ms sensing window, using the pilot-energy sensing method described
    earlier. The results for all 12 signals, as well as the average over these signals
    are shown. It is clear that there is a wide variation in the performance of the
    pilot-energy detector and this is because of multipath fading attenuates the pilot
    on some of these signals. Nevertheless, an average PMD = 0.1 can be achieved at
    SNR = −18 dB, which is 33 dB below the threshold of visibility of 15 dB for a
    DTV signal in AWGN. Figure 2 Synchronization of quiet periods Show All Figure
    3 Performance of pilot-energy detection with 5 ms sensing time Show All Figure
    4 shows the performance of the pilot-energy detector when 6 sensing dwells of
    5 ms each are used, for a PFA = 4%. With this increased sensing time, the average
    performance improves so that PMD = 0.01 at SNR= −20 dB. Figure 4 Performance of
    pilot-energy detection with 5 ms X 6 sensing window Show All Figure 5 shows the
    performance of the pilot-location detector with PFA = 3%. This detector works
    as follows: the location of the maximum of the FFT-output squared averaged over
    the first 3 dwells is compared to the location of the maximum of the FFT-output
    squared over the next 3 dwells. If these 2 locations are within one frequency-bin
    apart, the sensor declares a detection. This method gives a performance of PMD
    = 0.01 at SNR = −19 dB which is about 1 dB worse than the pilot-energy detector.
    Figure 5 Performance of pilot-location detection for 5 ms × 6 sensing time Show
    All However, the threshold for the pilot-location detector is completely independent
    of the noise-level and hence is robust to uncertainties in the measurement of
    noise at the sensing receiver. Figure 6 shows the sensingperformanceof pilot-energy
    detector and Figure 7 shows the performance of the pilot-location detector, with
    a 2 dB noise uncertainty, i.e. the noise variance was assumed to have an uniform
    distribution over [-2 dB, 2 dB]. The pilot-energy detector has an increased PFA
    of 0.21, whereas the performance of the pilot-location detector is essentially
    unchanged. Figure 6 Performance of pilot-energy detector with 2 dB noise uncertainty
    Show All Figure 7 Performance of pilot-location detector with 2 dB noise uncertainty
    Show All B. Spectrum Sensing at MAC In this section we evaluate the MAC layer
    mechanism for supporting spectrum sensing. For all the MAC simulation, the OFDM
    symbol size is fixed at 310µsec, each symbol has 1536 data carriers, and the modulation/coding
    used is 64-QAM rate 2/3, providing a capacity of about 19.8Mbps per 6MHz TV channel.
    The MAC frame size is 10ms, the superframe contains 16 MAC frames, and the packet
    size is 1Kbyte. 1 Impact of the TSS Mechanism on Performance To evaluate the impact
    of TSS on the overall system efficiency, we consider 1 BS and a total of 127 CPEs.
    We fix the duration of each intra-frame sensing to 1ms, and program the BS to
    allocate an intra-frame sensing window every 4 MAC frames. Considering that CDT
    is 2sec and the MAC frame size is 10ms, this would result in approximately 200
    frames per CDT. In turn, this results in about 50 MAC frames carrying an intra-frame
    sensing window per CDT, or around 50ms of intra-frame quiet periods for sensing
    per CDT. Also, note that this is done for each channel in use by the secondary
    network. Figure 8 shows the efficiency of the protocol with and without the TSS
    scheme and for different number of channels5. Here, efficiency is defined as the
    fraction of the channel capacity that is used for the actual payload transmission
    (i.e., capacity made availableat the MAC service access point). For these simulations,
    each channel is carries constant bit rate traffic where the upstream aggregate
    traffic is fixed to 3Mbps while the downstream traffic is varied from 2Mbps to
    22Mbps. As we can see, for low to medium loads the TSS has nearly no impact on
    performnance. Only at high loads will the quiet periods impact the capacity. Even
    so, the overall impact is not sizeable. B.2 Network Resilience Here we study the
    capability of the MAC in guaranteeing protection to incumbent services while seamlessly
    resuming communication in vacant channels. This includes the joint application
    of the incumbent detection (sensing), notification and recovery (IDRP) mechanisms.
    For this analysis, we consider the scenario depicted in Figure 9 consisting of
    1 BS and multiple nodes (i.e, CPEs) For this simulation, we impose that both stages
    of the TSS scheme are always executed. At a random point in time during the simulation
    run, a TV station begins operating co-channel with the secondary network and interferes
    with the nodes as shown in Figure 9. Through the TSS and polling mechanisms, the
    BS realizes (within CDT) that the nodes are not communicating and then initiates
    the recovery procedure bytransmitting a channel switch command to all nodes. Figure
    10 shows the instantaneous throughput curves for nodes 5 and 6, and how this is
    affected by periodic sensing (dips in the curve). Figure 8 Efficiency of the TSS
    scheme Show All Figure 9 Simulation scenario Show All As we can see from the highlighted
    portion of this figure, which indicates the appearance and detection of the TV
    signal, node 5''s throughput is unaffected since it is able to correctly receive
    the channel switch command from the BS. Node 6, however, does not receive the
    command from the BS, but is nevertheless able to restore normal communication
    through the IDRP protocol, as it knows the backup channel (in this case, channel
    B) used by the BS. In this simulation, the backup channel B is in fact a set of
    three contiguous bonded TV channels, which explains the significant increase in
    instantaneous throughput. The entire notification and recovery procedure for the
    whole network takes at most two MAC frames, which is much less than required by
    CMT and CCTT. Figure 10 Impact of incumbent appearance in network resilience Show
    All 3 Synchronization of Quiet Periods Synchronization of quiet periods is critical
    to the reliable and efficient spectrum sensing in the presence of multiple secondary
    networks. We have conducted extensive simulations to study how quickly and reliably
    overlapping networks converge to the same superframe start time, and therefore
    can easily align their quiet periods by using the information received through
    the CBP packets. The results are shown in Figure 11. The simulation consists of
    a number of networks (x-axis), placed randomly in square area (50×50, 100×100,
    and 150×150 km), with random start times and fixed range of 25 km. Each network
    periodically issues CBP packets as described in Section III.B.3, and synchronizes
    according to the convergence rule. On the y-axis is the convergence time in units
    of superframe. As can be seen, even with a large number of networks the convergence
    is very quick, even though the synchronization operation is completely distributed
    in nature. Figure 11 Convergence time in the synchronization of quiet periods
    [16] Show All SECTION V. Conclusions This paper proposes PHY and MAC layer sensing
    techniques that enable efficient and reliable access to TV channels. By combining
    the proposed two-stage sensing mechanism at the MAC, with the proposed FFT-based
    sensing method to detect the pilot energy and location at the PHY, a secondary
    CR network can reliably detect a TV signal at very low signal levels. It has been
    shown that the pilot location detection is more robust to uncertainties in the
    measurement of noise at the sensing receiver than the pilot-energy detection.
    The MAC simulations indicate that the two-state sensing mechanism has nearly no
    impact on the cell''s performance at low or medium loads, and only a small impact
    on the cell''s performance at high loads. Furthermore, the simulation results
    also show that synchronization of the quiet periods amongst cells can be achieved
    in a timely manner. Although not described in this paper, we have built a real-time
    prototypical sensor using our proposed sensing method that can detect digital
    TV signals at a low signal level of −116dBm, and hence reliable satisfy the sensing
    requirements for reliable operation in TV bands. Authors Figures References Citations

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio networks challenge the traditional
    wireless networking paradigm by introducing concepts firmly stemmed into the Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) field, i.e., learning and reasoning. This fosters optimal resource
    usage and management allowing a plethora of potential applications such as secondary
    spectrum access, cognitive wireless backbones, cognitive machine-to-machine etc.
    The majority of overview works in the field of cognitive radio networks deal with
    the notions of observation and adaptations, which are not a distinguished cognitive
    radio networking aspect. Therefore, this paper provides insight into the mechanisms
    for obtaining and inferring knowledge that clearly set apart the cognitive radio
    networks from other wireless solutions. Published in: IEEE Communications Surveys

    Publisher: IEEE I. Introduction The core idea of cognitive radios is based on
    the cognitive cycle, according to which radios must be able to observe their operating
    environment, then decide how to best adapt to it, and act accordingly. As the
    cycle repeats, the radio should be able to learn from its past actions. The principle
    rests on the radio''s ability to observe, adapt, reason, and learn. Sign in to

    access capabilities can be exploited by many wireless network architectures including
    sensor networks. Thus, cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSN) has emerged as a
    promising solution to address the spectrum-related challenges of wireless sensor
    networks (WSN). Among others, determination of the optimal packet size is one
    of the most fundamental problems to be addressed for the practical realization
    of CRSN. The existing optimal packet size solutions devised for wireless, sensor,
    and CR networks are not applicable in CRSN regime. Hence, the objective of this
    paper is to determine the optimal packet size for CRSN that maximizes energy-efficiency
    while maintaining acceptable interference level for licensed primary users (PU)
    and achieving reliable event detection at the sink. The energy-efficient optimal
    packet size is analytically formulated and its variation with respect to different
    network parameters is observed. Results reveal that PU behavior and channel BER
    are the most critical parameters in determining the energy-efficient optimal packet
    size for CRSN. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications ( Volume:

    I. Introduction The main aim of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) is to exploit the
    instantaneous spectrum availability in order to improve spectrum utilization by
    opening licensed spectrum to unlicensed users. Cognitive Radio (CR) [5] is introduced
    as an intelligent wireless communication technology that enables DSA. CR uses
    its unique capabilities of monitoring spectrum bands and detecting available channels
    to enable the usage of static allocated spectrum. Furthermore, by dynamically
    adjusting its operating parameters, it can utilize available channels [1]. These
    capabilities of CR can be applied to many wireless networks to address unique
    challenges such as communication over a crowded spectrum, e.g., ISM bands, interference
    minimization, resilience to jamming. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures

    Cognitive radio and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) enable wireless users to share
    a wide range of available spectrums. In this paper, we study joint spectrum allocation
    and scheduling problems in cognitive radio wireless networks with the objectives
    of achieving fair spectrum sharing. A novel Multi-Channel Contention Graph (MCCG)
    is proposed to characterize the impact of interference under the protocol model
    in such networks. Based on the MCCG, we present an optimal algorithm to compute
    maximum throughput solutions. As simply maximizing throughput may result in a
    severe bias on resource allocation, we take fairness into consideration by presenting
    optimal algorithms as well as fast heuristics to compute fair solutions based
    on a simplified max–min fairness model and the well-known proportional fairness
    model. Numerical results show that the performance given by our heuristic algorithms
    is very close to that of the optimal solution, and our proportional fair algorithms
    achieve a good tradeoff between throughput and fairness. In addition, we extend
    our research to the physical interference model, and propose effective heuristics
    for solving the corresponding problems. Previous article in issue Next article

    1. Introduction Over the past few years, the world has experienced a very rapid
    proliferation of wireless devices. The traditional static spectrum access approach,
    which assigns a fixed portion of the spectrum to a specific license holder or
    a wireless service for exclusive use, is unable to manage the spectrum efficiently
    any longer. On one hand, certain parts of the spectrum are heavily used, such
    as the 2.4 GHz band and the 5 GHz band, which leads to serious interference and
    therefore poor network throughput. On the other hand, a significant amount of
    spectrums remain under-utilized or not utilized at all, which has been shown by
    recent studies and experiments [2]. The most efficient and direct method to solve
    the above problems is to allow wireless users to share a wide range of available
    spectrums. Emerging cognitive radio technology and the Dynamic Spectrum Access
    (DSA) approach enable unlicensed wireless users (a.k.a secondary users) to sense
    and access the under-utilized spectrum opportunistically even if it is licensed,
    as long as the licensed wireless users (a.k.a primary users) in such a spectrum
    band are not interfered. A network composed of wireless users with cognitive radios
    and dynamic spectrum access capabilities is called a cognitive radio wireless
    network or a DSA wireless network [2]. How to efficiently and fairly share the
    available spectrums is a fundamental and challenging problem in cognitive radio
    wireless networks [2]. In a multihop wireless network, a wireless user usually
    refers to a transmitter and receiver pair (a wireless link) [11]. The spectrum
    sharing problem usually involves two coupled problems: the spectrum allocation
    problem and the scheduling problem. The spectrum allocation problem seeks a solution
    which allocates available spectrum bands to the users for packet transmissions.
    The scheduling problem looks for a solution which determines when these users
    can access the allocated spectrum bands. The objective is to achieve a good tradeoff
    between throughput and fairness while ensuring interference-free transmission
    at any time. In this paper, we present optimal algorithms as well as fast heuristic
    algorithms to solve the joint spectrum allocation and scheduling problems in multihop
    cognitive radio wireless networks. Specifically, our contributions are summarized
    as follows: 1. We propose a novel Multi-Channel Contention Graph (MCCG) to precisely
    characterize the impact of interference in a cognitive radio wireless network.
    2. We study the joint spectrum allocation and scheduling problems, which have
    never been seriously addressed before in the context of multihop cognitive radio
    wireless networks. We present optimal algorithms as well as fast heuristic algorithms
    to solve these problems and evaluate their performance by extensive simulations.
    3. We take account of both the protocol and the physical interference models [7],
    making our solutions more comprehensive and more suitable for practical scenarios.
    If each wireless user is assumed to transmit at a fixed power level, the protocol
    model can be used to address interference. However, if users have the power control
    capability, the physical interference model should be considered. The rest of
    this paper is organized as follows. We discuss related work in Section 2. The
    system model is described in Section 3. We define the problems to be studied in
    Section 4. The proposed spectrum allocation and scheduling algorithms are presented
    in Section 5. We present numerical results in Section 6 and conclude the paper
    in Section 7. 2. Related work The cognitive radio wireless networks have recently
    attracted lots of research attention. The most related work is [26], in which
    Zheng et al. developed a graph-theoretic model to characterize the spectrum access
    problem and devised a set of heuristics to find high throughput and fair solutions.
    In [24], the concept of a time-spectrum block was introduced to model spectrum
    reservation, and protocols were presented to allocate such blocks. A centralized
    spectrum allocation protocol called Dynamic Spectrum Access Protocol (DSAP) was
    proposed in [5]. In DSAP, spectrum management is conducted in a central entity
    called DSAP server which can obtain a global view of network by exchanging information
    with users. In [6], a distributed spectrum allocation scheme based on local bargaining
    was proposed for cognitive radio wireless ad hoc networks. In [25], the authors
    derived optimal and suboptimal distributed strategies for the secondary users
    to decide which channels to sense and access with the objective of throughput
    maximization under a framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
    (POMDP). Cross-layer schemes have also been proposed for cognitive radio wireless
    networks. In [20], Wang et al. considered the joint design of dynamic spectrum
    access and adaptive power management. They proposed a power-saving multi-channel
    MAC protocol (PSM-MMAC), which is capable of reducing the collision probability
    and the waiting time in the awake state of a node. The authors of [11] proposed
    the Asynchronous Distributed Pricing (ADP) scheme to solve a joint spectrum allocation
    and power assignment problem. In [23], a novel layered graph was proposed to model
    spectrum access opportunities, which was used to develop joint spectrum allocation
    and routing algorithms. In [21], two design methodologies were explored: a decoupled
    (layered) design and a collaborative (cross-layer) design. The authors implemented
    the idea of collaborative design by proposing joint routing, scheduling and spectrum
    allocation algorithms. A Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming based algorithm
    was presented to solve a joint spectrum allocation, scheduling and routing problem
    in [10]. In addition, the authors of [22] presented distributed algorithms for
    joint spectrum allocation, power control, routing, and congestion control. Maximum
    throughput and fair resource allocation (channel assignment, scheduling) has also
    been studied for traditional multihop wireless mesh networks in [1], [18], [19].
    The differences between this work and previous works are summarized as follows:
    First of all, resource allocation in a cognitive radio wireless network is quite
    different from that in traditional multihop wireless networks such as 802.11-based
    wireless mesh networks due to its special features such as dynamic channel availability,
    channel heterogeneity and so on (refer to [2] for details). Second, fairness is
    a major concern of this work. However, the schemes proposed in [10], [20], [21],
    [23], [25] achieve different optimization goals such as minimizing power consumption,
    maximizing throughput and minimizing bandwidth usage. Third, this paper focuses
    on the joint spectrum allocation and scheduling problems. However, scheduling
    has not been well addressed by [5], [6], [11], [21], [22], [23], [25], [26]. Fourth,
    we propose algorithms to optimally solve the formulated problems. However, only
    heuristic algorithms were proposed in [5], [6], [10], [11], [20], [21], [23],
    [26], which cannot provide any performance guarantees. In addition, we consider
    both the protocol and physical interference models. However, in most of previous
    works on spectrum allocation [5], [6], [21], [23], [24], [26], only the protocol
    interference model has been considered. 3. System model We consider a multihop
    cognitive radio wireless network composed of static secondary users, each of which
    refers to a transmitter and receiver pair (i.e., a wireless link). The network
    can be either a traditional single radio wireless network or an emerging multi-radio
    wireless network [16] in which each node is equipped with multiple transceivers.
    The available spectrums are divided into a set of orthogonal spectrum bands, which
    are also called channels. We assume that a user can dynamically access a channel
    to deliver its packets, but can only work on one of the available channels at
    one time. Any proposed spectrum sensing schemes [2] can be used to detect the
    locally available channels. Half-duplex operation is assumed to prevent self-interference,
    i.e., one transceiver can only transmit or receive at one time. Moreover, we only
    consider unicast communication, i.e., a single transmission is intended for exactly
    one receiver. In addition, any two transmissions with a common intended receiver
    are not allowed to be made simultaneously since collisions will corrupt the packet
    receptions. We say a user (link) is incident to another user if they share a common
    transceiver. We also say a user is incident to itself (this is a technical agreement
    which will make future description easier). We address wireless interference based
    on both the protocol model and the physical model [7]. In a multi-channel network,
    interference should be defined on user-channel pairs. In the protocol model, it
    is assumed that each transmitter transmits at a fixed transmission power. So there
    is a fixed transmission range and a fixed interference range (which is typically
    2–3 times of the transmission range [16]) associated with each user. These two
    ranges may vary with the channels [26]. Two user-channel pairs and are said to
    interfere with each other if (1) user i is incident to user k, or (2) and or ,
    where and represent the transmitter and the receiver of user i respectively, gives
    the Euclidean distance between two nodes, and denotes the interference range of
    user i on channel j. Condition (2) implicitly covers the constraints enforced
    by half-duplex operation, unicast communication and collision. However, if user
    i is incident to user k and even if , we say user-channel pairs and interfere
    with each other, since two incident users cannot work on different channels at
    the same time. This case is not covered by condition (2) and is the reason for
    having condition (1). If two user-channel pairs interfere with each other, they
    cannot be active simultaneously, otherwise the corresponding transmissions will
    fail. Let be the set of concurrent user-channel pairs with the same channel j
    and user-channel pair , then transmissions on user i over channel j can be successful
    if (1) ⧹ where is the channel gain for the transmitter and the receiver of user
    i on channel j, which depends on path loss, channel fading and shadowing; is the
    power level at the transmitter of user i; is the thermal noise power at the receiver
    of user i which is normally a constant. The left hand side of the inequality is
    called the Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) at the receiver of user
    i and is a given threshold determined by certain physical layer Quality of Service
    (QoS) requirements such as Bit Error Rate (BER). This is introduced in [7] as
    the physical model for concurrent wireless transmissions. Here, we assume that
    each user transmits at a fixed rate on a specific channel even if it can adjust
    its transmission power. Similar as in [5], a spectrum server is assumed to manage
    the spectrum allocation and scheduling in the network. It can collect information
    (including traffic demand and channel availability information) from all users
    periodically. Based on the collected information, the server computes a spectrum
    allocation and scheduling solution and broadcasts it to all the users at the beginning
    of each scheduling period. All the users will then access the spectrum according
    to the received solution. The control messages may also be exchanged over a common
    control channel using an extra control radio (no need to be a cognitive radio)
    if they are available for each node. In this case, the cognitive radios are only
    used for data transmission which can be conducted concurrently with the control
    information exchange. The server recomputes the scheduling and channel allocation
    solution whenever it finds out that the channel availability or traffic demands
    change. 4. Problem definition In this section, we will describe the necessary
    notations and formally define the optimization problems to be studied. Suppose
    that we are given a set of N users indexed from 1 to N and a set of C channels
    indexed from 1 to C. Then we can identify the set of possible user-channel pairs,
    denoted as . Here, a user-channel pair is in if and only if channel j is available
    to user i. The total number of user-channel pairs is bounded by . We are also
    given a vector , specifying the traffic demand of each user, which is determined
    by a routing algorithm in the network layer. However, routing is out of scope
    of this paper. We introduce the notion transmission mode to assist the computation.
    A transmission mode is composed of a subset of user-channel pairs which can be
    active concurrently. Whether concurrent transmissions are allowed or not can be
    determined based on the interference models described in the last section. Since
    every element of a transmission mode is a user-channel pair, once a transmission
    mode is identified, a spectrum allocation is automatically determined for the
    set of users contained in those user-channel pairs. We employ a matrix to represent
    the set of transmission modes, where M is the total number of possible user-channel
    pairs, and T is the number of transmission modes. Each row of the matrix corresponds
    to a transmission mode and each column corresponds to a specific user-channel
    pair in . If transmission mode t includes user-channel pair , then . Otherwise,
    . For ease of presentation, we always append a special all-zero row at the end
    of which represents a transmission mode that does not contain any user-channel
    pair. The average data rate of user i can be computed as , where is the fraction
    of time that transmission mode t is activated and is the capacity of user (link)
    i on channel j which is usually a constant. In a scheduling-based wireless system,
    there will be a specific transmission mode activated for each time slot. Suppose
    that all possible transmission modes are given. The scheduling problem is to determine
    the frame length and the number of active time slots of each transmission mode
    in one frame. If the value of is computed for each transmission mode, a frame
    length can be easily determined by finding the smallest positive integer L such
    that is an integer for each transmission mode. In this way, the joint spectrum
    allocation and scheduling problem is transformed into a problem of finding all
    possible transmission modes and the active time fraction for each transmission
    mode. In our optimization problems, we seek a rate allocation vector which specifies
    the rate allocated to each user i, all possible transmission modes along with
    a transmission schedule vector which specifies the active time fraction for each
    transmission mode t. A rate allocation vector and a transmission schedule vector
    are said to be feasible if the rate allocated to each user is no more than the
    average link data rate which can be achieved by the corresponding transmission
    schedule vector. Now we are ready to define the joint spectrum allocation and
    scheduling problems. Definition 1 MASS The MAximum throughput Spectrum allocation
    and Scheduling (MASS) problem seeks a feasible rate allocation vector , all transmission
    modes along with a feasible transmission schedule vector such that the throughput
    is maximized. It has been shown that simply maximizing throughput may seriously
    starve some users in the network [9]. So fairness must be carefully addressed.
    The traffic demands for users may be quite different. Hence, addressing fairness
    simply based on the value of rate allocated to each user without taking into account
    its traffic demand is not a good idea. We define a new variable called Demand
    Satisfaction Factor (DSF). The DSF of a user is defined as the ratio of the rate
    allocated to that user over its traffic demand, which indicates how much a traffic
    demand is satisfied according to a rate allocation vector. Therefore, we will
    have a DSF vector corresponding to each rate allocation vector , where , . The
    fair spectrum allocation and scheduling problems are defined as follows. Definition
    2 MMASS A feasible rate allocation vector ( ) is said to be a feasible max–min
    fair rate allocation vector if for any other feasible rate allocation vector (
    ), , where and are the DSF vectors corresponding to and respectively. The Max–min
    fair MAximum throughput Spectrum allocation and Scheduling (MMASS) problem seeks
    a feasible max–min fair rate allocation vector , all transmission modes along
    with a feasible transmission schedule vector such that the throughput is maximized.
    Definition 3 PASS The Proportional fAir Spectrum allocation and Scheduling (PASS)
    problem seeks a feasible rate allocation vector ( ), all transmission modes along
    with a feasible transmission schedule vector such that the utility function is
    maximized, where is the DSF vector corresponding to . So far, we have only defined
    the joint spectrum allocation and scheduling problems under the protocol interference
    model. The corresponding optimization problems under the physical interference
    model are almost the same as their counterparts under the protocol model except
    that a feasible power assignment needs to be determined for each transmission
    mode. By feasible, we mean that on each channel, the SINR constraint (constraint
    (1)) must be satisfied at each receiver and the power level assigned to each user
    must be in the range of . Due to the space limit and redundancy, we omit the corresponding
    problem definitions. 5. Proposed spectrum allocation and scheduling algorithms
    In this section, we will first introduce a novel graph model, Multi-Channel Contention
    Graph (MCCG), to characterize the impact of interference under the protocol model.
    Based on it, we will present algorithms to solve the problems defined in Section
    4. Then we will discuss the extension to the physical interference model. 5.1.
    Multi-channel contention Graph (MCCG) In an MCCG , every vertex corresponds to
    a user-channel pair in . There is an undirected edge connecting two nodes in if
    their corresponding user-channel pairs interfere with each other, which can be
    determined based on conditions described in Section 3. Note that if two users
    i, k are incident to each other, then there will be undirected edges between every
    two user-channel pairs which contain i and k, respectively because they always
    interfere with each other no matter which channels are considered. Next, we use
    a simple example to illustrate how to construct an MCCG. In this example, we have
    five users (transmitter–receiver pairs), , and two channels, channel 1 and channel
    2, available to each user, which are shown in Fig. 1a. In the figure, we have
    , where R and I are the transmission and interference range of each user respectively.
    We can obtain the corresponding MCCG which is shown in Fig. 1b. In the figure,
    each vertex corresponds to a user-channel pair, for example, vertex corresponds
    to user-channel pair . Here, we can see that there are edges between nodes and
    , and , and , and and , because user a is incident to user b. Moreover, there
    is an edge between node and because any user can only work on one channel at one
    time. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. MCCG: (a) a set of users; (b)
    the corresponding MCCG. The importance of the MCCG lies in the fact that a transmission
    mode corresponds to an independent set in the MCCG. Since our objective is to
    improve throughput and fairness, we only need to consider the subset of transmission
    modes corresponding to Maximal Independent Sets (MISs) of . The MCCG turns out
    to be a very useful tool for spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks with
    multiple channels. For example, it can be used to find all possible transmission
    modes for our joint spectrum allocation and scheduling problems. In addition,
    the Max-Sum-Bandwidth (MSB) spectrum allocation problem studied in [26] can be
    transformed to the maximum weight independent set problem on the MCCG, which can
    be efficiently solved by some approximation algorithms in the literature [8].
    Note that the MCCG is an extension of the well-known contention graph proposed
    in [15] for single-channel wireless networks and it is completely different from
    the other graph models introduced for multi-channel wireless networks [23], [26].
    5.2. Proposed algorithms for the protocol model Our algorithms are essentially
    two-step methods: in the first step, construct the MCCG and identify transmission
    modes; in the second step, formulate the problems defined in Section 4 as Linear
    Programming (LP) or Convex Programming (CP) problems, and solve them using existing
    algorithms [3], [4]. If a set of transmission modes is given, the MASS problem
    and the MMASS problem can be formulated as LPs, and the PASS problem can be formulated
    as a CP, which will be shown later. If the given set includes all possible transmission
    modes, then by solving those LPs and CP, we can obtain optimal solutions. Otherwise,
    if the given set only include a subset of all transmission modes, then we will
    end up with approximate solutions. In the rest of this section, we will first
    present algorithms to find a set of transmission modes and then present LP and
    CP formulations for the three optimization problems. As discussed before, a transmission
    mode actually corresponds to an independent set in the MCCG and only those MISs
    are needed to be taken into consideration. So, if we can identify all possible
    MISs in the MCCG, then we can obtain optimal solutions. The algorithm in [14]
    and several other existing algorithms can actually find all MISs in a graph very
    efficiently. Therefore, our optimal algorithm for the MASS problem is to apply
    the algorithm in [14] to find all MISs in the MCCG firstly and then solve the
    corresponding LP. Similarly, we can have the optimal algorithms for the MMASS
    and PASS problems. However, it is well known that the number of all MISs in a
    graph may grow exponentially with the graph size. If we take all MISs as the inputs
    for the LPs and the CP, it may take exponentially long time to solve them. Therefore,
    we propose a polynomial time heuristic to compute a good subset of MISs (transmission
    modes) in a given MCCG. Intuitively, a good subset needs to have good diversity,
    because if only a small subset of user-channel pairs is included, it may lead
    to biased solutions in the second step. Furthermore, the user-channel pair whose
    transmission capacity is relatively large and whose corresponding user has relatively
    high traffic demand should be given higher priority. Our algorithm is formally
    presented as Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1. Computing transmission mode subset Empty

    during the execution of the algorithm. is output as the subset of all transmission
    modes and is guaranteed to cover every node in at least once due to Step 2. Array
    X is used to maintain a counter which counts how many times a node has been included
    in some MISs of so far. The weight of each node v in is given as , where gives
    the corresponding user of node v (note that every node in corresponds to a user-channel
    pair) and gives its traffic demand. is the capacity of the user-channel pair corresponding
    to v. The weight function implements the idea that we prefer to select the user-channel
    pair whose transmission capacity is relatively large and whose corresponding user
    have relatively high traffic demand. Moreover, based on the weight function, if
    the number of times a user-channel pair is covered is relatively small, it will
    get more chances to be selected. In this way, a good selection diversity can be
    achieved. In the algorithm, q is a tunable parameter. We observe that the larger
    the value of q is, the more MISs will be added into , which will lead to better
    solutions but longer computation time. Obviously, Algorithm 1 is a polynomial
    time algorithm. Its running time is dominated by Step 2, which can be accomplished
    in time, where M is the total number of possible user-channel pairs which is bounded
    by . After obtaining a set of transmission modes, we can solve the optimization
    problems defined above by solving an LP or a CP, which are presented as follows.
    In the following formulations, we have the aforementioned rate allocation variables
    or to represent the rate or the DSF of user i respectively, and the scheduling
    variables . The feasibility of rate allocation and scheduling described in Section
    4 are guaranteed by constraint (3) or (8) which are actually equivalent. The summation
    of all scheduling variables should be equal to 1, which is ensured by constraint
    (4). Only non-negative values are allowed for all those variables and the value
    of must be in , which are enforced by constraints (5), (6), (11). User-channel
    pair capacity ( ) and traffic demand of each user ( ) are given as inputs. : MASS
    (2) subject to: (3) (4) (5) (6) : Max–min (7) subject to: (8) (9) : MMASS subject
    to: (10) The MASS problem can be solved by solving in which the objective function
    is set to maximize the throughput. The maximum throughput solution can serve as
    a benchmark to evaluate the fair solutions provided by solving the corresponding
    MMASS and PASS problems. In order to solve the MMASS problem, we need to solve
    two LPs sequentially. First, we solve and obtain a max–min DSF value . Because
    of constraint (9) and the objective function of , we can guarantee that for any
    feasible DSF vector , . Next, we feed to as a parameter. Constraint (10) in guarantees
    that in the computed and its corresponding DFS vector , we have . The objective
    of is to maximize the throughput. Therefore, solving and together can provide
    a max–min fair maximum throughput solution. The PASS problem can be formulated
    as a CP because it has the similar linear constraints as the MASS problem and
    the MMASS problem, and its objective is to maximize a concave utility function.
    CP: PASS subject to: (11) Our two-step algorithms are summarized as follows: Step
    1, construct the MCCG and apply the algorithms proposed in [14] or our Algorithm
    1 to find all or a subset of transmission modes (which lead to optimal and suboptimal
    solutions, respectively); Step 2, solve for the MASS problem, solve / for the
    MMASS problem, or solve for the PASS problem. Note that the LP for MASS problem
    only include variables and constraints, where N and T are the number of users
    and the number of transmission modes respectively. The LPs for the MMASS problem
    and the CP for the PASS problem have the similar complexities. So normally, they
    can all be efficiently solved by the existing algorithms. Our two-step algorithms
    are suitable for cognitive radio wireless networks, in which the available channels
    to each user may vary frequently. Every time when an existing channel becomes
    no longer available to a user or a new channel becomes available to a user, we
    do not have to go through the whole two-step procedure to compute a completely
    new solution. We can simply eliminate those transmission modes including the user-channel
    pair which is no longer available from the current transmission mode set, or add
    one or more transmission modes including the newly available user-channel pairs
    to the existing set. Then we solve the corresponding LP or CP. In other words,
    we do not have to re-run Algorithm 1 to find a new set of transmission modes every
    time when the channel availability changes. In this way, we can obtain a new solution
    based on the updated channel availability in a time-efficient fashion. Of course,
    if substantial changes occur in the system after a certain period of time, in
    order to guarantee high performance, the whole two-step algorithm should be re-executed
    to compute a completely new solution. 5.3. Proposed algorithms for the physical
    model If we assume that every node has the power control capability, the physical
    model should be used to address interference. In this case, we are unable to model
    the impact of interference using the MCCG because the one-to-one interference
    relationships among user-channel pairs are unavailable in the physical model.
    Therefore, the algorithms in [14] or our Algorithm 1 cannot be applied to find
    a set of transmission modes. To our best knowledge, there is no algorithm in the
    literature which can identify all transmission modes under the physical model.
    However, a good subset of transmission modes can be identified efficiently by
    revising our Algorithm 1. Here, every time when we try to decide if a specific
    user-channel pair (note that a node v in Algorithm 1 corresponds to a user-channel
    pair) can be selected to set S in Step 2 of Algorithm 1, instead of checking if
    it conflicts with another node in which has already been selected to S, we verify
    the feasibility by solving . However, the user of a user-pair in the current S
    is incident to user i, we can conclude that cannot be selected to S and no LP
    needs to be solved. : (12) subject to: (13) ⧹ (14) In , is the variable which
    specifies the power level for user l on channel j. denotes the current set of
    user-channels in S containing the same channel j. Again, and give the transmitter
    and the receiver of a given user respectively. If a feasible solution can be obtained
    by solving , then we can conclude that user-channel pair can be added to the current
    set S. This is because that in a feasible solution, the SINR constraint defined
    in the physical model is guaranteed to be satisfied for each user according to
    constraint (13) and the computed power level of each user is ensured to be in
    the range according to constraint (14). Eventually, the solution given by can
    be used as the power assignment for the corresponding transmission mode. Even
    though we only need to obtain a feasible power assignment or to test if there
    exists a feasible solution, it is always good to minimize the total power consumption
    which is achieved by the objective function (12). In addition, the same weight
    function in Algorithm 1 can be used to determine which user-channel pair has the
    highest priority to be selected. After identifying a set of transmission modes,
    we can then compute the rate allocation and scheduling solution by solving , or
    . 6. Numerical results In our simulation, we considered multihop cognitive radio
    wireless networks with stationary nodes randomly located in a region. We randomly
    chose N users (links) from a network in each run. For the protocol model, the
    transmission range and corresponding interference range of each user were set
    to and [16] for all channels, respectively. For the physical model, we set the
    thermal noise power , the SINR threshold and the maximum transmission power [17].
    The channel gain, was simply set to for all channels, where is the Euclidean distance
    between transmitter u and receiver v. All LPs were solved by using CPLEX 9.0 [13].
    We implemented the barrier method introduced in [4] to solve all CPs by setting
    the related parameters as follows: , and . Intuitively, the following parameters
    may have significant impacts on system performance: the number of users (N), the
    total number of channels (C), the number of channels available to each user (
    ), the capacity of user-channel pair ( ), the traffic demand on each user ( )
    and the tunable parameter in Algorithm 1 (q). We studied their impacts by setting
    these parameters to different values in different simulation scenarios. The DSF
    of each user ( ), the throughput ( ) and the value of the utility function ( )
    were employed as performance metrics. In addition, the users were sorted in the
    non-descending order of their DSF values. The simulation results are presented
    in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10. In
    all the figures, MASS, MMASS and PASS represent our algorithms for the MASS problem,
    the MMASS problem and the PASS problem respectively. We present network throughput
    and utility function results in Fig. 9, Fig. 10 for all simulation scenarios.
    In the first nine scenarios, we evaluated our algorithms proposed for the protocol
    model. In scenario 1, we conducted simulations on the network given in Fig. 1a.
    In that example, , and . Moreover, we set , . The traffic demand for each user
    was set to a random number uniformly distributed in [12, 24] Mbps. The results
    are presented in Fig. 2. We actually run both our optimal algorithms, and heuristic
    algorithms by setting q to 1 and 2. However, we do not present results of heuristic
    algorithms because they are exactly the same as the optimal solutions. In scenarios
    2–4, we performed simulation runs on a network with 10 nodes randomly distributed
    in a area. 10 users were randomly selected. The other parameters were set as follows:
    , . In addition, was set to a random number uniformly distributed in  Mbps (i.e.,
    ) and was randomly chosen from  Mbps. Note that these two rate values are typical
    data rates specified by IEEE [12]. We also executed both our optimal and heuristic
    algorithms by setting q to 1 and 2. The corresponding results are presented in
    Fig. 3. We conducted another set of simulation runs (scenarios 5–7) on the same
    network with the same settings except that the traffic demand for each user was
    increased to a random number uniformly distributed in [12,24] Mbps. We presented
    the corresponding results in Fig. 4. In scenario 8, we tested our heuristic algorithms
    ( ) on a larger network with 30 nodes randomly distributed in a area. Accordingly,
    30 users were randomly selected. In addition, we had , . The other settings are
    the same as those in scenario 2. The only difference between scenario 9 and scenario
    8 is that the traffic demand for each user was set to a random number uniformly
    distributed in [12,24] Mbps instead of  Mbps. The corresponding results are presented
    in Fig. 5, Fig. 6. In the last three scenarios, scenarios 10–12, we evaluated
    the heuristic algorithms proposed for the physical model. In these scenarios,
    all user-channel pairs were assumed to have a capacity of 36 Mbps and the traffic
    demand for each user was set to a random number uniformly distributed in  Mbps
    (i.e., ). The results are presented in Fig. 7, Fig. 8. The other settings of these
    three scenarios are the same as those in scenarios 3, 4 and 8 respectively. Download

    image Fig. 10. Utility function values in different scenarios. From Fig. 3, Fig.
    4, Fig. 9, we can see that the performance achieved by our heuristic algorithms
    (with ) is almost the same as that of the optimal solutions with regards to both
    throughput and fairness. In addition, adding more transmission modes for consideration
    by increasing parameter q from 1 to 2 does not provide a noticeable throughput
    improvement no matter which algorithm is used. As expected, we observe that the
    MASS algorithms perform best in terms of throughput but suffer from a severe unfairness
    on rate allocation among users in all simulation scenarios. For example, in scenario
    5 (Fig. 4a), the traffic demands of about half of users are not satisfied at all
    ( ). However, all the other users obtain very high DSF values. Fig. 10 shows that
    the values of utility function given by the MASS algorithm are always very small,
    which also illustrates its unfairness on rate allocation. The MMASS algorithms
    give the max–min DSF values which can be clearly observed from the results of
    all scenarios. Compared to the MASS algorithms, the PASS algorithms offer very
    close throughput in all scenarios (Fig. 9). The average throughput given by the
    PASS algorithms is 96.3% of the maximum achievable throughput. Moreover, they
    always give the best utility function values (Fig. 10), which indicates their
    efficiency in fairness. 7. Conclusions In this paper, we have studied the joint
    spectrum allocation and scheduling in cognitive radio wireless networks. Specifically,
    under the protocol interference model, we proposed a novel Multi-Channel Contention
    Graph (MCCG) to characterize the impact of interference. We have formally defined
    the MASS problem, the MMASS problem, and the PASS problem. For each problem, we
    presented an optimal algorithm and a fast heuristic algorithm based on the MCCG.
    In addition, we proposed fast and effective heuristics to solve those problems
    under the physical interference model. Our numerical results have shown that the
    performance given by our heuristic algorithms is very close to that of the optimal
    solutions. Furthermore, a good tradeoff between throughput and fairness can be
    achieved by our PASS algorithms. References [1] M. Alicherry, R. Bhatia, L. Li,

    Femtocell is envisioned as a highly promising solution for indoor wireless communications.
    The spectrum allocated to femtocells is traditionally from the same licensed spectrum
    bands of macrocells. In this case, the capacity of femtocell networks is highly
    limited due to the finite number of licensed spectrum bands and also the interference
    with macrocells and other femtocells. In this paper, we propose a radically new
    communication paradigm by incorporating cognitive radio in femtocell networks.
    The cognitive radio enabled femtocells are able to access spectrum bands not only
    from macrocells but also from other licensed systems (e.g. TV systems) provided
    the interference from femtocells to the existing systems is not harmful. It results
    in more channel opportunities for femtocells. Thus, the co-channel interference
    in femtocells can be greatly reduced and the network capacity can be significantly
    improved. Because of the difference from other traditional wireless networks,
    we argue the traditional spectrum sharing schemes such as coloring methods are
    not efficient to femtocell networks especially for dense deployment scenarios.
    We formulate the downlink spectrum sharing problem in cognitive radio femtocell
    networks, and employ decomposition theories to solve the problem. Simulation results
    indicate that cognitive radio enabled femtocells could achieve much higher capacity
    than the femtocell networks which do not employ agile spectrum access. Simulation
    results also show that our proposed scheme without any iteration can achieve almost
    twice of the average capacity by coloring method when the number of available
    channels is less than five. Moreover, our proposed scheme can converge very fast
    with a typical value of only five iterations, and it can achieve around two percent
    extra average capacity than the fixed power control scheme. Published in: IEEE

    Publisher: IEEE I. Introduction In mobile wireless networks, the demand for higher
    data rates and lower power consumptions is continuously increasing, while the
    capacity provided by the existing macrocell networks is limited. Studies on wireless
    usage have shown that more than 50% voice calls and 70% data traffic originate
    from indoors [2]. Specifically, a recent study in healthcare found that 40% of
    all cellular minutes used by staff were between care providers within the same
    building [3]. This phenomenon motivates the research and development for femtocell
    networks, where each femtocell base station (FBS) is installed at each customer''s
    home or office. The FBS is a short-range, low-cost, and low-power base station.
    It can communicate with macrocell networks by broadband connections such as digital
    subscriber line (DSL), cable modem, or a separate wireless backhaul channel [4],
    [5]. Femtocells can provide high data rates and Quality of Service (QoS) with
    low transmission power for consumers. For example, the study in [5] demonstrates
    that the transmission power can be saved about 34 and 77 dB in different fading
    environments. As a result, network operators may experience less traffic on their
    expensive macrocell networks, and can focus their resources on the truly mobile
    users [5], [6]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations

    (CR) have mainly focussed on opportunistic spectrum access and spectrum utilization.
    However, CR technology will have a significant impact on upper layer performance
    in wireless networks, particularly in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). In this
    paper, we study topology control and routing issues in CR-MANETs and propose a
    distributed prediction-based cognitive topology control (PCTC) scheme to provision
    cognition capability to routing in CR-MANETs. PCTC is a middleware-like cross-layer
    module residing between CR module and routing. It uses cognitive link availability
    prediction, which is aware of the interference to primary users and user mobility,
    to predict the available duration of links. Based on the link prediction, PCTC
    captures the dynamic changes of the topology and constructs an efficient and reliable
    topology, which is aimed at mitigating rerouting frequency and improving end-to-end
    network performance such as throughput and delay. Simulation results are presented
    to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    Publisher: IEEE I. Introduction Cognitive radio (CR) [1] is an enabling technology
    that allows cognitive users (CUs, i.e., unlicensed users or secondary users) to
    operate on the vacant parts of the spectrum allocated to primary users (PUs, i.e.,
    licensed users). CR is widely considered as a promising technology that deals
    with the spectrum shortage problem caused by the current inflexible spectrum-allocation
    policy. It is capable of sensing its radio environment and adaptively choosing
    transmission parameters according to sensing outcomes, which improves CR system
    performance and avoids interfering with PUs [2]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) have to
    contend with environments that are usually harsh and time-varying. Industrial
    wireless technology, such as WirelessHART and ISA 100.11a, also operates in a
    frequency spectrum utilized by many other wireless technologies. With wireless
    applications rapidly growing, it is possible that multiple heterogeneous wireless
    systems would need to operate in overlapping spatiotemporal regions. Interference
    such as noise or other wireless devices affects connectivity and reduces communication
    link quality. This negatively affects reliability and latency, which are core
    requirements of industrial communication. Building wireless networks that are
    resistant to noise in industrial environments and coexisting with competing wireless
    devices in an increasingly crowded frequency spectrum is challenging. To meet
    these challenges, we need to consider the benefits that approaches finding success
    in other application areas can offer industrial communication. Cognitive radio
    (CR) methods offer a potential solution to improve resistance of IWSNs to interference.
    Integrating CR principles into the lower layers of IWSNs can enable devices to
    detect and avoid interference, and potentially opens the possibility of utilizing
    free radio spectrum for additional communication channels. This improves resistance
    to noise and increases redundancy in terms of channels per network node or adding
    additional nodes. In this paper, we summarize CR methods relevant to industrial
    applications, covering CR architecture, spectrum access and interference management,
    spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access (DSA), game theory, and CR network (CRN)
    security. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics ( Volume:

    I. Introduction Wireless technologies have been named as an appealing alternative
    for distributed control systems, automotive systems, industrial and factory automation,
    and other interconnected embedded systems [1]–[3]. They offer several advantages
    over traditional wired communication systems such as enhanced physical mobility,
    fewer infrastructure requirements, less risk of cable damage, reduced connector
    trouble, and simplicity of upgrading [4], [5]. It has been established that industrial
    and factory environments pose significant challenges for wireless communications.
    Industrial applications set high requirements for reliability while these applications
    also operate in environments that are arguably more prone to interference [1],
    [6]. Coexistence is also an increasingly important aspect when implementing industrial
    wireless sensor networks (IWSNs). With industrial applications no longer confined
    to controlled factory environments and extending to applications such as building
    automation, smart grids, and consumer utility use monitoring and control, these
    networks must be tolerant to coexisting with other industrial and consumer wireless
    systems. Any candidate radio system must maintain the required quality of service
    (QoS) in a coexisting environment and favorable transmission quality when functioning
    as a standalone system [7]. As the use of wireless networks continues to increase
    with growing consumer interests and with initiatives such as the Internet of Things,
    radio spectrum is becoming a scarce commodity and practitioners will need to consider
    new approaches to coexistence and the utilization of temporarily free bands. Sign

    Location: Dalian, China 1. Introduction With rapid increasing of mobile devices
    and their requirements for the spectrum, the limit available spectrum becomes
    a constrained resource. However, according to Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) Spectrum Policy Task Force [1] [2]: at any given time and location, much
    of the prized spectrum lies idle. Therefore, the current static spectrum assignment
    policy needs to be improved to meet the requirements. As a result, Dynamic Spectrum
    Access (DSA) is proposed to solve these spectrum inefficiency problems. Recently,
    many researchers focus their works on DSA and cognitive radio (CR) searching for
    efficient solutions to the problems. For example, the Defense Advanced Research
    Projects Agency (DARPA) Next Generation (XG) project [3] [4] in the United States
    and the End-to-End Reconfigurability (E2R) program in Europe are working towards
    devising techniques for realizing different aspects of cognitive radio devices
    [9]. In the view of FCC, there is no other advance “holds greater potential for
    literally transforming the use of spectrum in the years to come than the development
    of software-defined radio and cognitive radios or ‘smart’ radios” [5]. Sign in

    Abstract: Wireless networks play a major role in smart grid applications such
    as automatic meter reading, remote system monitoring, remote home/customer site
    monitoring, and equipment fault diagnosing. Many smart grid applications face
    harsh environmental conditions but have high reliability and low latency requirements.
    Many communication challenges posed by the smart grid applications require careful
    research and customized communication and networking solutions. For example, huge
    amount of data related to monitoring and control will be transmitted across smart
    grid wireless communication infrastructures, with intensive interference and increasing
    competition over the limited and crowded radio spectrum for the existing wireless
    networking standards. The opportunistic spectrum access with cognitive radios
    is a promising wireless technology to improve the frequency/spectrum utilization
    by detecting unoccupied spectrum holes of primary users and assigning them to
    secondary users. The versatile features of cognitive radio technology satisfy
    the requirements of smart grid communications. On the other hand, there are growing
    needs of multimedia applications via smart grid communication infrastructures
    that require large bandwidth and network resources. To meet the requirements of
    this important paradigm in smart grid communications, in this paper, we investigate
    the technical challenges and the solutions of cognitive radio networking with
    multimedia applications for smart grid communication infrastructures, and present
    a guideline for future smart grid multimedia communication infrastructure design.

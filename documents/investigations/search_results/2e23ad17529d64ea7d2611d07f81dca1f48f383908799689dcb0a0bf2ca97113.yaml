    phenotyping (HTP) has unlocked new prospects for non-destructive field-based phenotyping.
    Autonomous, semi-autonomous, or manual platforms equipped with single or multiple
    sensors collect spatial and temporal data, resulting in massive amounts of data
    for analysis and storage. The enormous volume, variety, and velocity of HTP data
    generated by such platforms make it a ‘big data’ problem. Big data generated by
    these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived and retrieved for
    analysis. The analysis and interpretation of these large datasets is quite challenging.
    Sophisticated data collection, storage, and processing are becoming ubiquitous,
    and newer areas of application are emerging constantly. One such relatively new
    domain is plant stress analytics. ML algorithms are a very promising approach
    for faster, more efficient, and better data analytics. ML being inherently multidisciplinary
    draws inspiration and utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision
    theory, optimization, and visualization. Most current applications of ML tools
    in plant sciences have focused on using a limited set of ML tools (SVM, ANN).
    A good understanding of which, when, and how various ML tools can be applied will
    be very informative to the plant community to leverage these ML tools. Advances
    in automated and high-throughput imaging technologies have resulted in a deluge
    of high-resolution images and sensor data of plants. However, extracting patterns
    and features from this large corpus of data requires the use of machine learning
    (ML) tools to enable data assimilation and feature identification for stress phenotyping.
    Four stages of the decision cycle in plant stress phenotyping and plant breeding
    activities where different ML approaches can be deployed are (i) identification,
    (ii) classification, (iii) quantification, and (iv) prediction (ICQP). We provide
    here a comprehensive overview and user-friendly taxonomy of ML tools to enable
    the plant community to correctly and easily apply the appropriate ML tools and
    best-practice guidelines for various biotic and abiotic stress traits. Previous

    in Agriculture To meet the future demand of food, feed, fiber, and fuel, crop
    production must be doubled by 2050i Crop yields are limited inherently by plant
    stresses (biotic and abiotic), and plant breeders have protected yield from plant
    stress losses by incorporating resistance genes and developing more climatically-resilient
    cultivars. Plant breeders and researchers rely on plant phenotyping for accurate
    and precise trait collection and use of genetic tools to achieve their research
    goals. Plant phenotyping is defined as the application of methodologies and protocols
    to measure a specific trait, ranging from the cellular level to the whole plant
    or canopy level, related to plant structure and function [1]. Agriculture research
    programs phenotype large populations for several traits throughout the crop growth
    cycle. This challenge to phenotype multiple traits and large populations is exacerbated
    by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials.
    Until recently, traditional methods of phenotyping have not kept pace with the
    available high-throughput genotyping tools. The bottleneck in phenotyping has
    driven intense efforts by the scientific community of agriculture researchers
    and engineers to adapt newer technologies in field phenotyping. A classic example
    is high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), which has unlocked new prospects for non-destructive
    field-based phenotyping in plants for a large number of traits including physiological,
    biotic (includes living factors such as fungi, bacteria, virus, insects, parasites,
    and weeds, etc.) and abiotic (includes non-living factors such as drought, flood,
    nutrient deficiency, and other environmental factors) stress traits 2, 3. Both
    ground and aerial HTP platforms, equipped with multiple sensors are being used
    in agriculture to measure multiple plant traits at varying growth stages rapidly,
    precisely, and accurately (Figure 1A, Key Figure). Examples of these HTP platforms
    include deployment in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) [4], triticale (× Triticosecale
    Wittmack L.) [5], and maize (Zea mays L.) [6]. Recent advances in sensors for
    imaging plants 7, 8, ranging from remote sensing including spectroradiometry [9],
    Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) [10], visible to far-infrared [11], hyperspectral
    12, 13, 14, 15, thermal 16, 17, fluorescence 16, 18, and 3D laser scanning [19]
    to trichromatic (RGB) [20] imaging in conjunction with advanced autonomous vehicles,
    have truly opened up the possibility of high-throughput stress phenotyping (HTSP).
    Autonomous platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [21] and ground robots
    [22] equipped with multiple sensors can take pictures in near real-time of the
    entire experimental plot several times per day, or over the entire season from
    germination to maturity, resulting in massive amounts of data for analysis and
    storage. Making sense of all these collected data can be done effectively using
    ML tools (see the supplemental information online). It is important to emphasize
    that for ML tools data can be collected from complex, integrated imaging platforms
    or from simple(r) methods such as crowd-sourced cell phone images. Download :

    and prediction (ICQP); (ii) to give an overview of general issues in ML to develop
    a strategy for wider application and adaptability in agriculture; (iii) to contribute
    to a technical framework for the application of ML in plant breeding to solve
    practical problems, especially plant stress phenotyping using digital imaging;
    and (iv) to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various ML algorithms
    in stress phenotyping with the aim of enabling further exploration of these tools
    for facilitating practical use in plant breeding. Phenotyping Data and ML The
    enormous volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of imaging and remote-sensing
    data generated by such real-time platforms represent a ‘big data’ problem. The
    data generated by these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived
    and retrieved for analysis. Although the analysis and interpretation of such (image-based)
    big data are challenging, the ensuing possibilities that can impact on agricultural
    production make it a promising approach for HTP and HTSP. ML approaches present
    a scalable, modular strategy for data analysis, especially for the new application
    domain of ‘plant stress analytics’. Recent studies on HTSP using images obtained
    from UAV-based platforms to detect weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) [23],
    maize [21], and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) [24] using ML algorithms have
    paved a new path for better stress management practices on spatial and temporal
    basis. ML is an inherently multidisciplinary approach to data analysis that draws
    inspiration, and borrows heavily, from probability theory, statistics, decision
    theory, visualization, and optimization. ML approaches are typically useful in
    situations where large amounts of data are available, relating inputs (e.g., image
    data) to output quantities of interest (e.g., stress phenotypes). One of the major
    advantages of using ML approaches for plant breeders, pathologists, physiologists,
    and biologists is the opportunity to search large datasets to discover patterns
    and govern discovery by simultaneously looking at a combination of factors instead
    of analyzing each feature (trait) individually. This was previously a major bottleneck
    because the high dimensionality of individual images (coupled with the huge number
    of such images) makes them extremely difficult to analyze through classical techniques.
    Another key challenge is that the underlying processes for linking the inputs
    to the outputs are too complex to model mathematically. This is particularly the
    case for plant stress phenotyping, where it is challenging to efficiently model
    the holistic effect of genetic, agronomic, economic, meteorological, and human
    factor inputs on stress and, ultimately, yield. ML methods have been applied with
    spectacular results to similar problems [25] previously presumed to be impossible
    to model. Examples include numerous success stories in various domains ranging
    from computer vision (e.g., face recognition), speech processing (e.g., Google
    voice, Apple''s Siri) and natural language processing (e.g., IBM Watson), consumer
    predictive analytics (e.g., Netflix movie recommender system) to bioinformatics
    (e.g., personalized genomics, drug design, and genome annotation) [26], cell biology
    [27], and disease tissue classification in medicine 28, 29. The success of ML
    tools is attributed to their ability to identify a hierarchy of features and generalized
    trends from available data. These tools have also proved particularly adept at
    integrating disparate and often redundant data to draw coherent (and often non-intuitive)
    patterns for identification and quantification. Finally, current progress in ML
    has resulted in scalable, robust, and flexible software tools (R packages, Matlab
    toolboxes, and software packages such as Theano, Caffe for archetypal ML algorithms)
    30, 31, 32, 33 that make the application of ML to disparate disciplines straightforward.
    The advances have percolated into agricultural research, where there has been
    an increasing research effort to apply ML approaches in diverse species, such
    as horticultural crops and forest tree species. This has been driven in part by
    the increased investment by commercial companies and the decreasing cost of imaging/sensor
    platforms. ML-Enabled HTSP In light of these developments, it is clear that ML-enabled
    HTSP will benefit plant breeders, physiologists, entomologists, pathologists,
    extension workers, and farmers by allowing screening of different stresses in
    an accurate, precise, and speedy manner (Table 1). This will also directly enable
    the acceleration of the gene discovery process as well as the introduction of
    novel selection protocols for complex quantitative traits such as biotic and abiotic
    stresses and yield. ML-enabled HTSP will also enhance our understanding of pathogen–plant
    interactions [34] as well as the interaction of plants with other stresses. Table

    stress [60] What is ML? ML refers to a group of computerized modeling approaches
    that can learn patterns from the data so as to make automatic decisions without
    programming explicit rules. The main idea of ML is to effectively utilize experiences
    or example scenarios to discover underlying structures, similarities, or dissimilarities
    present in data to explain or classify a new experience or an example scenario
    properly. A key ability of ML tools is their ability to generalize trends and/or
    patterns from available data. There are a large number of choices of ML tools.
    It is important for an application expert to make a judicious choice on a specific
    ML method to deploy for his/her specific problem. We advocate that the practitioner
    should (carefully) down-select from the plethora of ML choices based on the type
    and amount of available data and problem formulation. In the context of plant
    stress phenotyping, we identify four distinct classes of problem formulation:
    (i) identification/detection, (ii) classification, (iii) quantification/estimation,
    and (v) prediction (Figure 1B,C). Furthermore, preprocessing steps such as dimension
    reduction, clustering, and segmentation can also be crucial for successful decision-making.
    Structure of a ML Process Typically, a large fraction of the dataset, known as
    the ‘training dataset’, that represents the entire population is used for calibrating
    the model. The remaining dataset is used to test the calibrated model, and is
    termed the ‘testing dataset’. The next step after training is to validate the
    learnt model on a new set of data (from different or same population). Once the
    accuracy and precision of the model is high enough, it can be used on a routine
    basis to identify, classify, quantify and predict particular stress features.
    We discuss this process in greater detail next, particularly focusing on clarifying
    the choice of ML tools to use based on two different points of view, namely the
    learning process (how are features learnt) and the modeling objective (what is
    being learnt). The Learning Process – Supervised versus Unsupervised The first
    point of view concerns whether or not the ML model is provided with the labels
    to the data it uses for model training. Here, a label is a trait (such as diseased
    plant or type of crop plant) that is associated with an image. For example, suppose
    the objective of a ML model is to distinguish between maize, soybean [Glycine
    max (L.) Merr.], and sunflower plants after collecting a large number of images.
    If the model is trained with a set of such images where each is labeled as soybean,
    maize or sunflower, the learning process is termed ‘supervised’. Alternatively,
    if the training images are provided without any label, the learning process is
    ‘unsupervised’. Note that although some ML tools can be trained either in a supervised
    or an unsupervised manner, some can be trained in both ways. With the supervised
    learning process, a model essentially tries to learn a map between the input dataset
    and the corresponding output labels. For the given example, it means that a model
    trained in a supervised manner learns how to map all the soybean examples to the
    soybean label, and so on. Support vector machines (SVM) and regular artificial
    neural networks (ANN) are among the prominent examples of supervised schemes.
    By contrast, an unsupervised method does not have specific output labels associated
    with input images. It identifies structures or features present in the images,
    such as the presence of tassels in maize, or the presence of trifoliate leaves
    in soybean. In many cases, the features identified in the unsupervised process
    may not be meaningful to a human user. Various clustering, mixture models, and
    dimension-reduction techniques fall under this category. Often ML models can be
    developed by using partly labeled data. This training scheme is known as ‘semi-supervised’
    learning. The Modeling Objective – Generative versus Discriminative A second point
    of view for ML method categorization is the modeling objective: whether the model
    being trained is to distinguish between two different data patterns or to be able
    to learn and generate similar patterns synthetically. In the context of the previous
    example, a maize and soybean plant can be distinguished based on the presence
    or absence of tassels or pods. A model developed with only this difference would
    be termed a ‘discriminative model’. Naturally, many supervised methods such as
    SVM and ANN fall under this category. However, such a model does not learn other
    features of the objects. Thus, a discriminative model that distinguishes a soybean
    plant from a maize plant based on the presence of tassels fails to differentiate
    between an image of a maize plant and that of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]
    plant. Therefore, a discriminative model is typically built for a predetermined
    specific task. On the other hand, a model that captures the overall data pattern
    such that it is able to generate synthetic images is known as a ‘generative model’.
    It follows that a single generative model can be useful for many decision tasks
    at the same time. Mixture models, hidden Markov models, and Boltzmann machines
    are prominent examples of generative models. Given a large volume of data, discriminative
    models usually perform better than generative models, especially for classification
    tasks, such as distinguishing images of soybean plants from a maize plant. However,
    generative models can achieve slightly better performance compared to discriminative
    ones with low training data volume. In addition, generative models tend to be
    more robust to overfitting issues (i.e., a model learns training data too well
    and performs very poorly for unseen test data). Figure 1D schematically illustrates
    the categorization of several ML methods into classes of generative versus discriminative,
    and supervised versus unsupervised. Although it seems that supervised models are
    more likely to be discriminative in nature, and generative models should not need
    output labels for training, there are examples of unsupervised discriminative
    models and supervised generative models. For example, the widely popular K-means
    clustering technique usually follows an unsupervised training scheme. Even so,
    it is not possible to generate new data examples reliably using only the cluster
    centers and groupings. Most of the unsupervised generative techniques can be learned
    in a supervised manner when the target class information is incorporated as one
    of the data features. Apart from such variations (as shown in Figure 1D), many
    of the ML tools have minor variations based on particular aspects such as underlying
    model structure (e.g., linear vs nonlinear) and training algorithm. The Role of
    Preprocessing in ML-HTSP The crucial step for the successful deployment of ML
    methods is careful preprocessing of the image data. There are multiple examples
    where a careful choice of preprocessing of the collected image datasets has resulted
    in substantial improvements in ML performance. Preprocessing can vary from very
    simple operations including image cropping, contrast enhancement, and removal
    of background to significantly more complex operations such as clustering and
    dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). However, the
    overarching principle of preprocessing the data is ‘concentration of information’.
    That is, the original datasets may contain a large quantity of unnecessary or
    conflicting information that can result in poor ML performance. By preprocessing,
    the signal-to-noise ratio (ratio of useful to useless information) is improved.
    This directly enhances the ability of the ML model to easily recognize useful
    patterns or trends and to separate the data into appropriate classes. Preprocessing
    is the stage where domain knowledge is crucial. The domain expert identifies features
    in the image that are relevant or important for training the model. For example,
    the removal of background (soil, dirt, and tags, etc.) from the foreground to
    identify the plant canopy is generally a crucial step. Following this, a variety
    of image processing tools can be used to convert these raw datasets into a more
    relevant dataset that contains the extracted features. Examples of preprocessing
    operations include: (i) segmentation of images; (ii) contrast enhancement to detect
    edges; (iii) thresholding images into binary data; (iv) converting one image format
    into other [RGB to greyscale; RGB to hue saturation value (HSV)]; (v) de-noising
    images using filters [band-pass, low-pass, fast Fourier transform (FFT)]; (vi)
    extracting features at different scales using image transforms (FFT, wavelet transforms,
    Haar transforms, Hough transforms, Radon transforms); (vii) pixel-based classification;
    (viii) clustering of images into classes; and (ix) dimensionality reduction of
    images. Several of the ML tools discussed here can in fact be applied to these
    preprocessing stages. There are several examples of the utility of such preprocessing
    steps. For early site-specific weed management (ESSWM) in wheat, a UAV-based platform
    was equipped with a visible-range camera to capture ultra-high resolution images.
    Otsu''s thresholding method was then used to differentiate wheat crop plants from
    weeds [23]. In sunflower, a quadrocopter equipped with RGB and multispectral sensors
    was used to detect weeds to optimize herbicide application. A pixel-based classification
    approach was used for weed identification. Similarly, image segmentation 21, 24,
    35 followed by automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) was used in sunflower
    and maize to identify spatial and spectrally consistent objects. ML Approaches
    to ICQP Identification of Stress Identification methods involve detection of a
    specific stress amid other potential stresses in the field. Here, preprocessing
    of image data is crucial. This is especially important for applications involving
    high-throughput imaging, where plant stressors (such as weeds, nutrient, disease,
    and insects) must be automatically identified. In the past, ML methods such as
    SVM, neural networks (NNs), kernel methods, and instance-based approaches have
    been used to detect various stresses. The SVM method has been used successfully
    in a variety of scenarios for stress identification in plants. SVM Methods SVM
    methods have been applied to a variety of plants for disease and stress identification.
    They are deployed in the citrus industry to contain citrus greening (caused by
    phloem-limiting bacteria), also known as Huanglongbing (HLB). Early identification
    is crucial for effectively controlling the spread of HLB. ML was used for the
    identification and estimation of HLB based on fluorescence imaging spectroscopy
    data of leaf samples [36]. The images were preprocessed (segmented) and the extracted
    features were used as an input to SVM. In another example, two aerial imaging
    platforms were compared for the identification of HLB diseases in an infected
    citrus orchard. An aircraft sensing platform equipped to capture hyperspectral
    images and a UAV platform equipped with a multiband imaging camera were used,
    and images obtained from both platforms were segmented and piped to a SVM classifier.
    Results showed that a (non-linear) SVM with kernel worked better than (linear)
    SVM, LDA, and QDA [37]. Similarly, in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), early identification
    of three diseases, Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew, was performed
    using SVM with a radial basis function as kernel [38]. The same idea was deployed
    in cotton to identify damage by green stink bug, bacterial angular blight, and
    Ascochyta blight using a SVM classifier [39], as well as in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) to identify viruses: tomato yellow leaf curl virus and tomato yellow leaf
    curl disease [40]. SVM (combined with a Gaussian process classifier) was used
    for the automatic identification of soil moisture stress using remote visible
    and thermal images in spinach canopies, where the efficacy of using a combination
    of methods was explored. In another study, visible and thermal imaging were combined
    with depth information to automatically identify powdery mildew of tomato plants
    at an early growth stage using a SVM classifier kernel [31]. Variants of the SVM
    method have also proven to be useful for identification. In rice (Oryza sativa
    L.], the hierarchical identification of nutrient deficiency symptoms using scanned
    images was carried out using support vector feature selection (SVFS). Hierarchical
    identification was able to detect the NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium)
    stress effectively with enhanced identification accuracy [41]. Artificial Neural
    Nets (ANN) and Variants Simple image processing, followed by ANN, was used for
    detecting and identifying three orchid seedling diseases: bacterial soft rot,
    bacterial brown spot, and Phytopthora black rot [42]. Discriminant Analysis Spectral
    reflectance data were recorded from healthy and HLB-infected citrus leaves, and
    various classifier methods (discriminative and supervised methods) were used to
    identify infected leaves using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), linear discriminant
    analysis (LDA), and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and soft independent modeling of
    class analogy (SIMCA) [43]. In sugar beets, hyperspectral canopy reflectance was
    used to identify stress symptoms instigated by beet cyst nematode and Rhizoctonia
    crown and root rot [44]. Gaussian Mixture Models Preprocessing followed by the
    application of Gaussian mixture models has been used to identify both biotic and
    abiotic stresses [45]. Canopy images were taken in a stressed wheat field, at
    differential levels of irrigation (abiotic stress) and inoculated with wheat streak
    mosaic virus (biotic stress). K-means Clustering and Variants Water and nutrient
    stress at the crop canopy level have been studied using hyperspectral images that
    were analyzed using simplex volume maximization (SiVM), an unsupervised clustering
    approach. The SiVM algorithm was found to be adept at detecting drought stress
    using hyperspectral images four days before the appearance of symptoms visible
    to the human eye. The unsupervised nature of SiVM also provided useful new insights
    into the data 11, 25. Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering The automatic extraction
    of hyperspectral signatures using the Bayes factor algorithm with Dirichlet-aggregation
    regression (DAR) resulted in rapid, reliable, and data-driven approach for phenotyping
    plants for both biotic and abiotic stresses [11]. In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.),
    the DAR algorithm was used for the presymptomatic prediction of drought stress
    at an early stage using hyperspectral images [46]. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and
    Bayes Classifier Both supervised (Bayesian classifier) and unsupervised (SOM)
    ML approaches were used for segmenting diseased tomato plants. Diseased regions
    on the tomato canopy were identified using the preprocessed tomato images by a
    SOM model [20]. Classification of Stress Classification is an extension of identification;
    however, instead of identifying a particular stress amid different stresses, a
    classifier is used to classify stress into labeled classes on the basis of stress
    symptoms and signatures. Classification methods often include a preprocessing
    step, usually a segmentation step followed by the extraction of features that
    feed into some type of classifier. For instance, drought stress can be classified
    into: no stress, moderate stress, and heavy stress. Examples from various crops
    are presented below illustrating the use of classification algorithms in various
    stresses. ANN A combination of K-means clustering followed by ANN, using fused
    information from RGB and multispectral camera imaging, was used to develop a 3D
    model of leaves to differentiate the two sugar beet diseases, Cercospora beticola
    and Uromyces betae [47]. In another example, thermal and hyperspectral imaging
    were analyzed to identify and classify symptoms caused by three Alternaria species
    in the oilseed brassica. The majority of the available classifiers present in
    Weka (useful data-mining software in java) were tested, and eight classifiers
    were used to make comparisons. The back-propagation neural networks (BNNs) classification
    model displayed the highest prediction accuracy for classifying Alternaria species
    [48]. SVM A SVM-based method was used to classify healthy and unhealthy Arabidopsis
    plants on the basis of symptoms instigated by colonization of the human pathogen
    Salmonella Typhimurium [49]. The SVM model was comprehensively tested on 1200
    individual Arabidopsis plants with positive results [50]. In further work, classification
    error was reduced using SVMs compared to other ML methods such as decision trees
    and ANNs. The classification accuracy of three sugar beet diseases increased with
    increasing disease severity. This is especially true when hyperspectral reflectance-based
    vegetation indices were used with SVM for the automatic classification of disease
    severity of three sugar beet diseases (Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery
    mildew). Another example of the usefulness of SVM was the identification and classification
    of stonefly larvae from images. Haar random forest feature extraction, in combination
    with SVM classifier, was able to differentiate and classify stonefly larvae from
    other insect species [51]. LDA, K-Means, and Coupled Methods ML methods were used
    to classify the presence of aflatoxins, which are toxic compounds produced by
    fungus Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus [52]. Fluorescence (UV illumination)
    and reflectance (halogen excitations) were used as input data in this case. Preprocessing
    was performed to extract features using Guyon''s SVM-RFE, classical Fisher discriminant
    power, and PCA. These extracted features were used as inputs to classifiers such
    as LDA (linear discriminant analysis) and MLP. Another paper classified the RGB
    images into ‘healthy’ and ‘injured’ classes of clover plants that were exposed
    to varying level of ozone. Various pixel-classifying methods were compared such
    as LDA, K-means clustering, FPM-T2 (fit to a pattern multivariate image analysis
    combined with T2 statistics), and FPM-RSS (FPM combined with residual sum of squares
    statistics) [53]. Quantification of Stress There are fewer reports describing
    the use of ML approaches to quantify stresses, and this provides tremendous opportunities
    for plant scientists and breeders. Quantification methods are an extension of
    classification methods where each class is quantified on the basis of stress severity.
    In case of plant diseases, disease severity [54] can be used to quantify various
    diseases. For example, rust severity in wheat can be quantified on a scale of
    0–100% [55]. Quantification algorithms are usually best preceded by a preprocessing
    stage to separate foreground from background, edge detection, and contrast enhancement.
    A good example of the benefit of preprocessing of images for quantification is
    illustrated in [56] where color mapping (converting from native RGB to other non-native
    formats such as HSV) followed by segmentation was used to quantify disease severity
    of PHYVV (pepper huasteco yellow vein virus) on chili pepper (Capsicum annuum
    L.) plants. Examples from various other crops are presented next. SVM Leaf miner
    pest causes major losses in vegetable and ornamental plants. SVM applied to near-infrared
    spectral reflectance using spectrophotometer and digital leaf images of tomato
    plants of damaged leaves was used to successfully quantify damage degree (DD)
    into five levels [57]. Automatic detection method was used to detect and quantify
    Verticillium wilt (VM) on a large scale in olive using hyperspectral sensor and
    thermal camera mounted on aircraft. The spatial distribution of VM was assessed
    at field level and severity classes (0–4 rating scale quantified into 0–100% severity
    level) predicted by LDA and non-linear SVM methods. Both ML methods showed good
    results in detecting and quantifying VM severity in olives (Olea europaea L.)
    [58]. Prediction of Stress The prediction of plant stress at an early stage before
    it is visible to the human eye has substantial implications for the timely and
    cost-effective control of stress. There are very few reported activities on using
    ML for the prediction of stresses, making this the next big frontier for research
    efforts. This has tremendous implications for prescription farming and precision
    agriculture. SVM In predicting rice blast disease, SVM was used for the development
    of a weather-based prediction model [59]. The performance of the SVM-based approach
    was compared to the ANN variants; back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and generalized
    regression neural network (GRNN), and also to conventional multiple regression.
    The SVM-based approach outpaced all the three methods in cross-location and cross-year
    models, indicating their role in early forecasting of plant diseases. Other examples
    include the prediction of drought-induced stress in barley using hyperspectral
    images using an SVM variant, ordinal classification approach [60]. In barley for
    the presymptomatic detection of water stress, DAR algorithm was used on images
    obtained using hyperspectral camera. The DAR algorithm was efficient in predicting
    stress before symptoms were visible to human eye [46]. Strategies for the Development
    of Efficient ML Applications in Plant Breeding ML methods can play an extensive
    role in breeding for stress tolerance and for rapid phenotyping. These approaches
    can be used in decision-making for parent selection to use in hybridization schemes,
    and in generation advancement and selection. An example of an application using
    ICQP is presented below. Identification Use HTP platform [UAV, unmanned ground
    vehicle (UGV)] for taking images of breeding plots in plant stress nurseries,
    and yield tests. Perform image processing and apply ML algorithms. ML identifies
    which stress is present in each breeding plot. Classification Use ML approaches
    to classify stress in each breeding plot. For instance, determine if a genotype
    is resistant or susceptible to a particular stress. This information can be directly
    used in a breeding decision scheme to select stress resistance genotypes. Quantification
    Use ML approaches to quantify the stress. For example, quantification may be on
    a 0–100% scale of expression, such as percent infection severity. Use the information
    generated by ML approach through quantification to make selections to identify
    stress-resistant genotypes for further testing or commercialization. Prediction
    Use ML approaches on prior disease and weather data to make early stage prediction
    on the expression of stresses for breeding and selection decisions. In addition
    to plant stresses, advances have been made in analyzing other traits using ML
    to predict yield 61, 62, 63, biomass 64, 65, root traits 66, 67, and adaptation
    traits [68]. Concluding Remarks and Outlook ML tools provide a very powerful framework
    to assimilate data, and the utility of these tools is especially important considering
    current progress in HTP approaches that easily generate terabytes of data. Appropriate
    choice and usage of ML tools is crucial for obtaining the maximum possible benefits
    of these sophisticated approaches. This review provides a comprehensive overview
    of ML alongside best practices of using these ML tools to enable stress phenotyping
    (Box 1, Box 2). Using advanced ML tools for plant stress phenotyping is a very
    new area, with the plant community focusing on a small number of ML methods (such
    as SVM and ANN). As part of this review, we have identified several future avenues
    for using ML techniques that show tremendous promise but remain currently unutilized
    by the phenotyping community (see Outstanding Questions). Furthermore, the concepts
    discussed here can be applied to data collected across the spectrum of complexity
    and sophistication (from manually captured camera imaging to automated high-throughput
    imaging systems), as well as scale (from individual plant to plot to field). Box
    1 Key Take-Away Points for Practitioners Identification (i) A large variety of
    ML methods have been successfully applied to the disease identification problem.
    This is an area where preprocessing of images will be very useful. (ii) There
    are two ways to frame a disease identification problem for ML based on the amount
    of data available. (a) When statistically significant nominal (healthy) and diseased
    datasets are available, it is best to use supervised discriminative models that
    are trained to distinguish between these classes. (b) In the absence of a statistically
    significant amount of data (or unbalanced data, see next point below), the best
    approach is to learn the nominal model of the un-diseased plant (which is feasible
    due to the availability of data of the healthy plant) using unsupervised methods.
    Then simple outlier detection can be deployed to identify off-nominal (or diseased)
    cases. (iii) We strongly encourage practitioners to refrain from training disease
    identification models using very small datasets. It is especially important to
    be vigilant against unbalanced data for training where one state (usually, the
    healthy state) has much more data instances than the other diseased states.  Classification
    (i) We encourage the practitioner to ensure the statistical significance of the
    available dataset. (ii) Preprocessing of data is crucial, as is using domain knowledge.
    (iii) Current trends are to always use supervised methods, which are mostly discriminative.
    (iv) Be vigilant against the overfitting problem. A best practice is to always
    ensure that regularization option is turned on in any ML method. (v) It is important
    to note that these methods can only distinguish between known/trained classes.
    They cannot be deployed to identify unknown/untrained symptoms (so-called extrapolatory
    mode). (vi) We encourage practitioners to extract and report detection confidence
    out of the classifier.  Quantification (i) There are very few reported applications
    of ML for stress quantification, and this provides tremendous opportunities for
    plant scientists and breeders. Most current work formulates the quantification
    problem as a classification problem with finer resolution. (ii) Our recommendation
    is that unsupervised generative models can be very successful for quantification.
    This can also work with smaller datasets. The basic idea is to learn the nominal
    (healthy state) model. The severity of the diseased state is quantified as the
    distance/offset from this nominal state. (iii) We strongly recommend practitioners
    to explore the use of Bayesian networks, deep neural nets, and latent Dirichlet
    allocation for this class of problems.  Prediction (i) Most prediction applications
    of ML are limited to early detection of disease onset. (ii) Current phenotyping
    approaches can be extended to obtain time-varying traits. Here, more sophisticated
    models can be used with great utility. Examples include HMM methods, dynamic Bayesian
    networks, and recurrent neural networks. Box 2 Precision Phenotyping Using ML
    Algorithms in Agriculture: Best Practices Advances in technology have made HTSP
    feasible. Appropriate ML tools can be used for all four stages (stress identification,
    classification, quantification, and prediction). High-throughput image-based phenotyping
    of plant stress-related traits to complement high-throughput sequencing will assist
    in finding new genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using linkage mapping
    and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) together with training genome-wide
    selection models for various plant stress traits [74]. Specifically, the high-throughput
    phenotypic information on a particular stress can be used in association with
    genotypic information by means of QTL 75, 76, GWAS 77, 78, or expression studies
    to bridge the genotype–phenotype gap. Relating time-series phenotypic data with
    time-series gene expression may provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms.
    Time-series image data 79, 80 obtained in experiments using HTP platforms such
    as UAVs and autonomous rovers (ground robots), integrated into a viable ML pipeline,
    will allow the study of the time-dependent gene turn-on and turn-off mechanisms
    and provide insight into the molecular basis of disease resistance. HTP can also
    be used for phenotyping different fields for the same stress to understand the
    spatiotemporal difference in the expression of stress. The big advantage of ML
    algorithms is that plant scientists can use them proficiently in stress identification,
    classification, quantification, and prediction using tools packaged in the graphical
    user interface (GUI) without knowing the underlying mathematical and computational
    complexities. We advocate the following best practices for maximizing the effectiveness
    of ML tools: ML for Practitioners It is useful to identify which type of ML method
    is best suited by triaging the ML methods based on amount of data available as
    well as the type of data (labeled vs unlabeled). Figure 1C,D will be beneficial
    for this purpose. Discriminative methods work better for labeled and large datasets,
    while generative methods work better for smaller datasets (both labeled and unlabeled).
    It may be worthwhile for practitioners to explore the use of generative unsupervised
    models as a means to identify latent features from datasets. This is an area that
    is relatively unexplored, but holds great promise. Preprocessing is where domain
    knowledge can be leveraged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the data. For
    ML methods that are classified as discriminative and supervised, the use of preprocessing
    before deploying ML tools is essential to substantially improve ML performance.
    In cases where it is difficult to translate domain knowledge into feature crafting,
    unsupervised preprocessing methods should be explored. This may be particularly
    useful for high-dimensional data such as hyperspectral data. The outlook for ML
    tools in agriculture is very promising. A key ingredient for successful large-scale
    application of ML is the seamless integration of data analytics within the data
    collection and curation pipeline. Such a computational ecosystem (that links data
    collection, data storage, and curation with ML-based data analytics) will open
    up tremendous opportunities to accelerate breeding and to solve foundational problems
    in genomics and predictive phenomics. Promising examples of this vision include
    the Integrated Analysis Platform (IAP) [69] and the i-Plant nitiativeii A crucial
    catalyst for such advances will be to foster multidisciplinary research teams
    such that advances in engineering, plant sciences, and informatics can be leveraged
    in a rational way. This review will enable such teams by providing a common language
    of communication related to ML tools. Outstanding Questions Can causal ML models,
    deployed on time-series of images, identify visual precursors to enable early
    detection of stress response? ML methods lead to data-driven discovery of non-intuitive
    patterns. How can these hierarchical patterns be visualized and then physiologically
    interpreted by domain scientists? Advanced supervised ML methods tend to require
    labeling a large volume of training data. Can methodologies such as mechanical
    turking, crowd sourcing, and gamification be used to create a large corpus of
    community-labeled data? Future phenotyping efforts will be characterized by heterogeneous
    (visual/non-visual), multiscale (plant/plot/field), asynchronous data collected
    by a variety of sensors connected via the internet of things (IOT). How to develop
    best practices for a robust, scalable, and integrated ML pipeline that enables
    seamless assimilation? The ICQP paradigm comprehensively characterizes the spectrum
    of problems in plant stress phenotyping, thus enabling the design and deployment
    of appropriate ML tools. How can this paradigm be applied to other problems in
    plant biology, such as physiogenetic drivers of yield, and soil microbiome–plant
    root interaction studies? Acknowledgments This work was supported by Iowa State

    \ Chergui1 and Mohand Tahar Kechadi1,2* \nAbstract \nRecent advances in Information\
    \ and Communication Technologies have a signifi-\ncant impact on all sectors of\
    \ the economy worldwide. Digital Agriculture appeared \nas a consequence of the\
    \ democratisation of digital devices and advances in artificial \nintelligence\
    \ and data science. Digital agriculture created new processes for making \nfarming\
    \ more productive and efficient while respecting the environment. Recent and \n\
    sophisticated digital devices and data science allowed the collection and analysis\
    \ of \nvast amounts of agricultural datasets to help farmers, agronomists, and\
    \ professionals \nunderstand better farming tasks and make better decisions. In\
    \ this paper, we present \na systematic review of the application of data mining\
    \ techniques to digital agriculture. \nWe introduce the crop yield management\
    \ process and its components while limiting \nthis study to crop yield and monitoring.\
    \ After identifying the main categories of data \nmining techniques for crop yield\
    \ monitoring, we discuss a panoply of existing works \non the use of data analytics.\
    \ This is followed by a general analysis and discussion on the \nimpact of big\
    \ data on agriculture.\nKeywords: Digital agriculture, Data analytics, Crop management,\
    \ Big data, Data \nmining, Machine learning\nIntroduction\nDA, (also called digital\
    \ farming or smart farming)1 [78, 105, 130], is a modern approach \nthat uses\
    \ digital and smart devices [sensors, cameras, satellite, drones, the Global Posi-\n\
    tioning System (GPS)] in conjunction with Data Mining (or data analytics) to improve\
    \ \nproductivity and to optimise the use of resources. Digital Agriculture (DA)\
    \ comes as a \nresponse to the increasing demand for improving productivity while\
    \ reducing farming \noperational costs. Moreover, the improvement of productivity\
    \ should not be done at \nany cost, e.g., overuse of natural resources and chemical\
    \ products. DA can, for example, \nmanage crop growth by finding appropriate fertilisation\
    \ program for each farming field \nand can help farmers to reduce their operational\
    \ costs and respect the environment by \nrefining their farming operations based\
    \ on the needs of each part of the farming field.\nSince agriculture has a direct\
    \ and significant impact on the population and therefore \nits economic environment,\
    \ DA in its turn should be viewed as the next natural step to \n*Correspondence:\

    \ the environment, by taking \nadvantage of the recent technological advances\
    \ in digital devices, communications sys-\ntems, and artificial intelligence.\
    \ These allow us to construct multidimensional domains, \nwhere the farms and\
    \ farmers are their central subjects. Figure 1 shows the agriculture \necosystem\
    \ and its direct impact on other sectors of the economy.\nBesides, since DA involves\
    \ the development, adoption and iteration with digital tech-\nnologies [39], and\
    \ Artificial Intelligence (data analytics, ...), these developments and \ninteractions\
    \ should be well-defined (laws, regulations and policies) to guarantee rights\
    \ \nand benefits of all the involved actors (farmers, farm holders’, data owners’,\
    \ developers \nand analysts, technology vendors’,...) [70, 77, 78, 92, 113, 146].\n\
    DA can be regarded as a data driven form of farming, in which decision-making\
    \ pro-\ncesses are based on explicit information derived from data collected through\
    \ various \nsources [148]. DA and Precision Agriculture (PA) seem to refer to\
    \ the same thing, how-\never, as stated in [148], DA involves the development\
    \ and adoption of modern technolo-\ngies in both collecting the data and its analysis\
    \ in various farming contexts, while PA \ntakes into account only the in-field\
    \ variability [147]. DA aims to exploit advanced digital \ndevices, ranging from\
    \ a simple sensor to complex robots, to offer the required farmland \ntreatment\
    \ with high accuracy. DA can be applied in almost all agricultural fields. For\
    \ \ninstance, in crop production: DA allows accurate management of crops, which\
    \ includes \nfields, wasteland, crop, pest, and irrigation management, soil classification,\
    \ etc. In Ani-\nmal production: DA allows monitoring the animal over its whole\
    \ life cycle, its food \nquantity, health control and protection from diseases,\
    \ and so on. Fishery, animal Hus-\nbandry, livestock and dairy farming are some\
    \ examples [14]. In Forestry: We can effi-\nciently manage forests by supporting\
    \ the environmental and sustainable decision [36]. \nDA can help in detecting\
    \ unhealthy trees, air pollution, discriminate different tree spe-\ncies, protect\
    \ the wildlife, etc. From the economy point of view, the application of DA for\
    \ \nforest management enhances the wood quality and its production, which can\
    \ augment \nprofits; reduce waste and maintain the environment [138].\nAddressing\
    \ DA from all the above mentioned views is a challenging task and cannot \nbe\
    \ achieved without the participation of specialists from all these sectors. In\
    \ this study, \nFig. 1 The interlocked sectors involved in DA\nPage 3 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nwe focus\
    \ on the use of Big Data in crop management, it is, not only one of the pillars\
    \ in \nagriculture but also it can profoundly affect biodiversity. Moreover, crop\
    \ growth is a very \ncomplex process involving various endogenous and exogenous\
    \ factors. Recent advances \nin digital technologies allow us to collect data\
    \ about all these factors. DA has the ability \nto elucidate the correlations\
    \ and interactions of these factor to help farmers and agrono-\nmists optimise\
    \ the productivity while reducing the side effects on the environment. DA \nexhibits\
    \ several benefits to agriculture as shown in Figure  2. These benefits were dis-\n\
    cussed in [10, 13, 70, 98, 104, 112, 113, 130, 135, 148] and summarised in the\
    \ following:\n• DA provides a farmer with useful information to support their\
    \ decision-making pro-\ncesses, such as soil and weather monitoring and prediction,\
    \ weed and pest monitor-\ning, crop yield dynamic predictions, etc.\n• DA can\
    \ sustain the environment and improve the products’ quality, since it provides\
    \ \nhigh quality information and measurements for optimal farming operations on\
    \ each \nfield.\n• DA can provide farmers advanced management methods against\
    \ climate change and \nother environmental challenges. The farmer can continuously\
    \ monitor crop growth \nand protect them against diseases.\n• DA offers valuable\
    \ feedback to farmers and good assessment of risks, to minimise \nmicrobiological\
    \ or disaster-related risks.\n• DA can provide prediction and assistance to farmers\
    \ against adverse weather inci-\ndence, disasters and market instability by assessing\
    \ the loss at the farm level.\n• Farmers/agronomists can benefit from advanced\
    \ models to understand the market \nand forecast which products could be more\
    \ profitable.\nThe contributions of this study are in the investigation of big\
    \ data analytics applications \nto crop production. Crop farming is a complex\
    \ task, and it depends on many factors that \nshould be taken into account. To\
    \ optimise the operational cost and reduce the impact \non the environment, the\
    \ big data analytics emerges as one of the most cost effective \napproaches nowadays.\
    \ The contributions, therefore, include the following:\nFig. 2 Role of DA in crop\

    \ of data analytics and big data on DA based on previous works, we \nconducted\
    \ a systematic review approach that consists of three steps: (1) collection of\
    \ \nrelated work, (2) selection of relevant work, and (3) examination and analysis\
    \ of the fil-\ntered related work.\nIn the first step, we performed keyword-based\
    \ research and We gathered a large \nnumber of studies from well-known and popular\
    \ online sources (Web of Science, Sco-\npus, IEEEXplore, ACM, etc.). We used a\
    \ combination of keywords from the two sets \n(Big data, data mining, data analytics,\
    \ machine learning, Internet Of Things, sensors) \nand (Digital agriculture, smart\
    \ farming, precision agriculture, agriculture, farming). We \ngathered more than\
    \ 327 articles. In the next steps, We selected a small number of arti-\ncles,\
    \ which are considered relevant for further analysis, based on their ideas, methods,\
    \ \ndata types and sources, addressed problems, proposed solutions, tools used\
    \ and quality \nof the results.\nThrough the literature analysis, the study aims\
    \ to find responses to the following \nresearch questions and discuss findings\
    \ in the following sections.\n• What is the process of DA for crop management?\n\
    • What are the various data types generated by farms and used in DA applications\
    \ for \ncrop management?\n• What role does big data analytics play in DA?\n• How\
    \ are big data analytics used for crop management?\n• What are the influences\
    \ of the farm’s scale on the application of DA?\n• How big is the data used in\
    \ the proposed DA solutions’?\n• What are the challenges facing the DA?\nPage\

    Related work\nDespite that DA and Big Data being relatively recent research fields,\
    \ their scientific lit-\nerature is rich and covers several concepts. As DA is\
    \ at the cross boundaries between \nagriculture and ICT, three major dimensions\
    \ have emerged as of a very high importance; \ntechnology, social economics and\
    \ ethics, and decision-making based on Machine Learn-\ning. The first dimension\
    \ focuses on the use of advanced technologies to improve prac-\ntices and productivity\
    \ [56, 124]. In Ref. [124], the authors studied the impact of sensor \nnetworks\
    \ in agriculture, including remote sensing technologies, wireless devices, and\
    \ \nother IoT devices. Ref. [56] reviewed some developments in remote sensing\
    \ within Big \nData processing and management in agriculture. The second dimension\
    \ concerns legal, \nethics, social and economic factors of DA, to provide insights\
    \ into the impact of digit-\nised information and its analysis on the farm management;\
    \ farmer identity, skills, pri-\nvacy, production, and value chains in food systems\
    \ [39, 70, 77, 78, 92, 113, 146, 148]. The \nthird dimension focuses on the application\
    \ of big data analysis and machine learning \n(ML), to optimise and forecast the\
    \ production and the use of resources. In this paper, we \nonly consider this\
    \ dimension.\nVarious studies have been conducted on the application of data analytics\
    \ to crop yield \nmanagement. For instance, [71] presented a systematic review\
    \ on crop yield prediction \nusing ML techniques, and extracted major ML algorithms,\
    \ features and evaluation met-\nrics used in those studies. Ref.[35] discussed\
    \ the yield estimation by integrating agrarian \nfactors in ML techniques. This\
    \ allowed them to show a strong relationship between crop \nyield and climatic\
    \ factors. Ref. [103] Provided a systematic review on the use of com-\nputer vision\
    \ and AI to enhance the grain quality of five crops (maize, rice, wheat, soy-\n\
    bean and barley), disease detection and phenotyping. Ref. [64] reviewed the application\

    \ 9:123 \nof big data analysis in some fields of agriculture. It highlighted solutions\
    \ to some key \nwell-known problems, used tools and algorithms, along with input\
    \ datasets. The authors \nconcluded that big data analytics in agriculture is\
    \ still at its early stage, and many bar-\nriers need to be overcome, despite\
    \ the availability of the data and tools to analyse it. To \nmeasure the level\
    \ of usage of big data in DA, the authors defined big data metrics (low, \nmedium,\
    \ high) for each of its dimensions (volume, velocity, and variety). However, while\
    \ \nit is a very simple model, it is not easy to specify thresholds, as some dimensions,\
    \ such \nas volume and velocity depend on technological advances. Ref. [12] presented\
    \ a review \non the use of ML methods to detect biotic stress in crop protection.\
    \ The authors ana-\nlysed the potential of these techniques and their suitability\
    \ to deal with crop protection \nfrom weeds, diseases and insects. In addition,\
    \ they provided very good instructive exam-\nples from different fields of DA.\
    \ An earlier similar study was presented in [89], where \nthe authors studied\
    \ four very popular learning approaches; Artificial Neural Network \n(ANN), Support\
    \ Vector Machine (SVM), K-means, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). \nRef. [25] presented\
    \ a survey on data mining clustering methods applied to food and agri-\ncultural\
    \ domains. It first described major techniques of unsupervised classification,\
    \ then \nit examined some existing techniques applied to agriculture products;\
    \ like fruit clas-\nsification, wine classification, analysis of remote sensing\
    \ in forest images and machine \nvision.\nThis study is not just an update of\
    \ previous surveys. The main objective is to examine \nthe effectiveness of big\
    \ data analytics in crop yield monitoring and discuss the challenges \nof such\
    \ paradigm shift in the agriculture domain. Moreover, It is important to under-\n\
    stand the sources of datasets, their types, and which ML techniques are more suitable\
    \ to \nanalyse them.\nDA: it’s all about data\nDigital Agriculture (DA) relies\
    \ heavily on the data sources and techniques used to col-\nlect it. This data\
    \ is then organised in agricultural data warehouses and analysed [93]. The \n\
    results of this data analysis provide significant insights to farmers and agronomists\
    \ about \nhow to improve the production, minimise the farming operational costs,\
    \ manage risks, \nand protect the environment. The process of deploying DA is\
    \ derived from data science.\nDigital agriculture process\nFigure  4, adopted\
    \ from the knowledge pyramid DIKW, shows a data-driven process, \nwhich is at\
    \ the heart of DA. This usually shows how data from past experiences and \nmodels\
    \ serve as input to techniques of mining and analysis to help in future decisions\
    \ \nand acting accordingly. The newly collected data will be used to further refine\
    \ the pro-\ncess and adapt it to an ever-evolving agricultural world.\nThis is\
    \ a data-driven methodology derived from the overall knowledge discovery pro-\n\
    cess. The first phase, data collection, is crucial to the validity of the whole\
    \ analysis. One \nneeds to carefully identify the type of data that should be\
    \ collected and the approach \nof gathering it and maintain it through its whole\
    \ life cycle. This is even more complex \nin DA, as the data is issued from various\
    \ and heterogeneous sources, and contains a \nnumber of factors of uncertainties.\
    \ The second phase, data representation and analysis, \nis very sophisticated,\
    \ as there is no common standards in the way the data should be \nPage 7 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nintegrated,\
    \ consolidated, to derive a unified representation that is suitable for its analy-\n\
    sis, and in the choice of the analysis techniques. Finally, the decision-making\
    \ is a labori-\nous task, where the extracted knowledge will be associated to\
    \ the expertise of farmers \nand agronomists, farming constraints and regulations\
    \ to derive new management pro-\ncesses with the view to improve productivity\
    \ and quality of products, reduce and their \nimpact on the environment. Figure\
    \  5 depicts a diagram presenting the DA process for \ncrop yield monitoring,\
    \ as explained below.\n• Data collection and preparation It is important to identify\
    \ the data types and attrib-\nutes based on the problem at hand (e.g., crop management),\
    \ and the level of granu-\nlarity of the data. The required data sources should\
    \ also be identified and assessed for \ntheir data quality. As mentioned above,\
    \ the data is then prepared for analysis. This \nincludes data integration, representation,\
    \ selection, transformation, etc.\nFig. 4 DA– a data-driven process\nFig. 5 Big\

    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n• Data analysis\
    \ the complex nature of the agricultural data requires an elaborative \nanalysis\
    \ approach, ranging from methods of feature selection or extraction to various\
    \ \nlearning algorithms to discover models, patterns (or knowledge in general\
    \ term) for \ndata analysis. These will be evaluated against the expected quality\
    \ of results and their \nsuitability to a decision-making process.\n• Decision-making\
    \ The main goal of the DA process is the decision-making. Any deci-\nsion should\
    \ follow the state-of-the-art practice, be justifiable and scientifically sound.\n\
    Digital agriculture data\nIn agriculture, Very large amounts of data can be collected\
    \ from various sources. These \ninclude sensors, weather stations, satellite imagery,\
    \ drone imagery, and many other \ninstruments. The datasets include weather data,\
    \ farm records, environmental condi-\ntions, soil parameters (nutrients, texture,\
    \ moisture, and so on. The data is usually rich, \nlarge, very complex, and heterogeneous.\
    \ Therefore, its analysis is not straightforward.\nThe heterogeneity is not only\
    \ expressed by the data types and formats, but it can be \ncollected using different\
    \ equipment of different quality. In addition, historical data may \nbe described\
    \ with different sets of attributes compared to very recent data. This can pre-\n\
    sent inconsistencies in naming conventions and measures when the data is collected\
    \ \nfrom different locations and times. Moreover, the data can be static and historical,\
    \ which \nis considered as offline data, and can be online weather data collected\
    \ at regular intervals \n(streams of data values), such as weather data (e.g.,\
    \ every 15 minutes), satellite imagery, \nwhich is characterised of being spatio-temporal,\
    \ such as Geo-spatial data, Moderate-\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\
    \ images, etc.\nAs mentioned earlier, the data collection is not well tackled\
    \ in the literature. Most \nof the studies assume that the data is known already,\
    \ and the experimental setup was \nalready in place. Therefore, more effort is\
    \ allocated to the data analysis and interpreta-\ntion rather than on the complete\
    \ environmental parameters and conditions. In the fol-\nlowing sections, we discuss\
    \ the data analysis process. This discussion is structured based \non the main\
    \ categories of the data analysis; classification, and clustering [24]. Note that,\
    \ \nfor high quality results, the data needs to be pre-processed, as discussed\
    \ in the previous \nsection. The pre-processing includes cleaning (dealing with\
    \ missing values, redundant \ndata, noise and outliers), data transformation,\
    \ dimensionality or data reduction, and so \non.\nClassification for crop monitoring\n\
    Big Data analytics system architecture is depicted in Fig.  5. While this system\
    \ is tar-\ngeted specifically to crop yield management, it can be adapted to any\
    \ data-driven appli-\ncation. This architecture implements faithfully what we\
    \ have highlighted in the previous \nsections. In this section, we will focus\
    \ on the data analysis layer of the architecture, \nmoreover, we will pay attention\
    \ to the data types and their sources, techniques of data \nacquisition, the learning\
    \ algorithms. The main objective of the crop management data \nanalysis is to\
    \ get some insights about the crop monitoring problems and show the poten-\ntial\
    \ of DA through big data analytics, also called data mining. Data mining and its\
    \ tech-\nniques are involved in several roles in crop production. Farmers may\
    \ want to know the \nPage 9 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data  \
    \         (2022) 9:123 \n \nfuture yield of their crop, specific areas of their\
    \ farms suffer from the spread of weeds \nor under-nutrition. Researchers can\
    \ look for information such as plant growth patterns, \noptimum growing conditions,\
    \ best pest and disease control environment and so on. Data \nmining offers panoply\
    \ of sophisticated techniques required to meet all of these needs.\nThere are\
    \ two major categories of data analysis: Classification and Clustering. In the\
    \ \nwork of [24], authors studied applications of data mining techniques in crop\
    \ manage-\nment and proposed a classification of these applications. They found\
    \ that the classifi-\ncation and clustering are the main used categories, where\
    \ the classification includes \nprediction, detection, protection, and categorisation).\
    \ The choice between classification \nor clustering analysis is very simple. If\
    \ the models or classes we are looking for were \nknown in advance and we have\
    \ an annotated data to support the training of the learn-\ning algorithms, then\
    \ classification is the right choice. However, the annotated data is not \nalways\
    \ available and easy to generate, and in many cases we do not know even which\
    \ \nmodels or patterns we are looking for. In these situations, clustering analysis\
    \ is the right \nalternative.\nIn this section, we focus on the studies that use\
    \ classification methods for their data \nanalysis. Clustering analysis will be\
    \ covered in the next section. We structure these clas-\nsification studies based\
    \ on the application objectives or targets which arecategorisation, \nprediction,\
    \ detection, and protection.\nCategorisation\nWhile the classification main objective\
    \ is to assign a given object into one of the pre-\ndetermined classes, in the\
    \ agricultural world, the use of classification process may vary \ndepending on\
    \ the stakeholders interests. In this study, we report four different applica-\n\
    tions (or targets) which are widely used in agriculture categorisation, prediction,\
    \ detec-\ntion, and protection.\nCategorisation aims at defining the classes (or\
    \ class labels) based on the simple recog-\nnition of similarities that exist\
    \ across a set of entities. For example, categorisation can \nbe used to classify\
    \ small fruit from fruit with normal to big size, to make an estima-\ntion of\
    \ yields; which may have an economic impact if the farmer wants to make different\
    \ \npackages or prices for each type of fruit separately. It can also be used\
    \ to classify dam-\naged crops from good ones in order to estimate losses, or\
    \ to prepare for the harvest and \nmarketing. Categorisation can also be applied\
    \ for crop mapping (e.g., poor, average, high \nyield), which aims to provide\
    \ information on farmed fields given a specific type of crops, \nor to identify\
    \ a type of crops that are more suitable for a particular field. Based on the\
    \ \ninput data, categorisation can help improve the farming operations based on\
    \ the mean-\ningful categories (classes) predefined in advance.\nProducing accurate\
    \ crop maps is essential for effective agricultural monitoring [131]. \nCategorisation\
    \ approaches can be applied to study regional crop distribution within or \npost\
    \ growing season. For this purpose, it can offer:\n• A good understanding of how\
    \ crops are distributed at early stage of their develop-\nment; allowing for an\
    \ opportune decision making and management, as well as \nadjusting crop planting\
    \ structure, is crucial. Besides, the timely available of (spatial \nPage 10 of\
    \ 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \nor maps)\
    \ distribution of crop types is required for statistical and economic purposes\
    \ \n[131].\n• The availability of crops maps is critical for the diverse agricultural\
    \ monitoring activi-\nties, such as crop acreage estimation, yield modelling,\
    \ harvest operation schedules \n[131, 144], etc.\nMoreover, categorisation has\
    \ been applied for agricultural field mapping [31], to quan-\ntify the cropping\
    \ intensity for small-scale farms [58], to identify and map crops and to \nretrieve\
    \ the area of major cultivation [100] and to classify land-cover and crop [76].\
    \ \nTable  1 highlights the major fields, ideas and tools used for crops categorisation.\
    \ We can \nsee that data issued from satellites and remote sensing, and the features\
    \ with vegetation \nindices especially NDVI and EVI, the RGB colours, are the\
    \ most used.\nCrop yield prediction\nThe estimation of crop yield is crucial in\
    \ DA, as it enables efficient planning of resources. \nEconomically, an early\
    \ and accurate prediction of yields can help decision-makers to \nreact to the\
    \ crops market. Moreover, crop yield prediction permits the study of factors \n\
    that influence and affect the production, such as climate and weather, natural\
    \ soil fer-\ntility and its physical structure and topography, crop stress, the\
    \ incidence of pests and \ndiseases, etc.\nThe prediction of crop yields has been\
    \ the subject of many studies. Ref. [71] presented \na literature review on crop\
    \ forecasting, where the authors highlighted the most used \nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms along with the applied metrics and measures. In this sec-\ntion,\
    \ we examine the learning algorithms that have been used in crop yield prediction\
    \ \nfrom different views: data types, the pre-processing methods, and features\
    \ or the predic-\ntor variables used in each study. Tables  2 and  3 summarise\
    \ some relevant studies.\nThe crop yield forecasting approaches follow two major\
    \ types of sources of data. The \nfirst type is related to the sources that have\
    \ direct impact on the crops. These sources are \nsoil data, weather data, environmental\
    \ parameter data. These are usually used to predict \ncrop yield [27, 34, 42,\
    \ 46, 51, 73]. The second type of sources are the use of advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and tools like satellite multi/hyper spectral images, remote sensing and \n\
    sensors to collect the data [62, 83, 102, 114, 152]. Some advanced studies use\
    \ both types \nof data sources [1, 40, 54, 59, 65, 67, 68, 97, 120, 121].\nThe\
    \ forecasting models based on the first type of data sources provides a pre-season\
    \ \nestimation of the yield, even before the beginning of the crop season. This\
    \ allows farmers \nto decide which strategy to both optimise the farming operations\
    \ and crop production. \nThese decisions include choosing seeds and crop type,\
    \ type of fertiliser and its applica-\ntions. Moreover, This data can also be\
    \ used for some crop monitoring during the grow-\ning season.\nThe monitoring\
    \ systems based on the second type of data analysis - data imagery \nobtained\
    \ from satellite, cameras, scanner, sensors - allow for on-season estimation \n\
    (emergence, detect stress conditions of crop, harvest dates, ...). These models\
    \ are com-\nplex since they have to analyse the data that consists of both spatio-temporal\
    \ and non-\nspacial. While the spatial data is of high resolution, some images\
    \ can be of very poor \nPage 11 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data\

    \ as a major menace for food security in many regions of the \nworld since it\
    \ causes serious crops losses. While the detection of crop diseases correctly\
    \ \nand timely when they first appear is crucial in crop monitoring, this remains\
    \ a difficult \ntask. One of the solutions to deal with this issue is to use data\
    \ analytics approach. This \nwill reduce yield losses and prevent farmers to take\
    \ effective reactive actions. Forewarn-\ning can be seen as the outputs of data\
    \ mining process. Usually, this consists of examining \nthe features of a newly\
    \ presented case and assigning it to a predefined class.\nSeveral interesting\
    \ efforts have been developed to prevent crops losses due to dis-\neases, Tables\
    \  4 and 5 summarise some major studies. Ref. [7] presented an overview of \n\
    ML techniques for crop disease classification. In addition, it presented to a\
    \ case study \nwhere a deep learning algorithm was successfully used. Ref. [45]\
    \ provided a review on \nadvanced ANN techniques to process hyper-spectral data\
    \ for plant disease detection. \nRecently, deep learning approaches have been\
    \ emerged and widely used for plant dis-\nease detection and classification, with\
    \ a variety of network architectures (CNN, AlexNet, \ngoogLeNet, CaffeNet, DenseNet,\
    \ Inception, LeNet, VGGNet,...) and training methods \n(shallow, deep, from scratch)\
    \ [9, 16, 21, 28, 38, 63, 79, 82, 125, 139, 143, 150, 155]. More-\nover, [127]\
    \ presented an interesting study on the potential of the use of deep learning\
    \ for \nplant stress phenotyping.\nCrop protection, that consists of disease,\
    \ stress, and weed detection, aims to offer tools \nthat detect plants disease\
    \ caused by various biotic (pathogen, insect, pest, and weed) \nor abiotic (temperature\
    \ stress, nutrient deficiency, toxicity, herbicide) variables [126]. \nThe earlier\
    \ the stress, disease or their symptoms are detected, the greater the chance of\
    \ \nreducing the disease spread within a field. This has gained significant advantage\
    \ from the \nadvances in image collection and processing and their analysis using\
    \ ML algorithm. The \nstate-of-the-art is very rich. The large majority of studies\
    \ carried out so far were using \nimage processing, consequently image-based data\
    \ and classification techniques. These \nare capable of detecting disease at the\
    \ scale of leaf, canopy or field [126].\nDisease detection at a leaf level uses\
    \ images collected using digital cameras, which are \nstored in data warehouses.\
    \ For instance, PlantVillage database [6, 9, 21, 28, 63, 79, 88, \n106, 125, 129,\
    \ 150] is created for this purpose. The objective of this repository is to build\
    \ \nclassifiers with high accuracy. The basic classifiers can simply assign to\
    \ an unseen image \na label healthy or infected, while more elaborated classifiers\
    \ can identify the disease - in \nother words, classify unseen images to disease\
    \ classes. However, this approach has some \nlimitations. First, it depends on\
    \ the quality of the images, as when taken in natural envi-\nronment, these images\
    \ are subject to different degrees of light, shadow, dust and leaves \noverlapping\
    \ and requires sophisticated image processing, which is not an easy task. Sec-\n\
    ond, usually the datasets sizes are small, which affect the learning phase of\
    \ the classifiers \nPage 16 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data  \

    \ potential of some advanced learning algorithms such as deep \nlearning. Data\
    \ augmentation (rotation, light shade’s variation, colour inversion, transla-\n\
    tion and changes in intensity and so on) is one of the methods used to overcome\
    \ this \nproblem to artificially increase the number of images [6, 9, 21, 63,\
    \ 79, 129, 150], but it \ndoes not always work. Transfer learning is another solution\
    \ to scarce/small data-set, \nwhere the knowledge obtained from solving a task\
    \ in a given domain is transferred to \nthe target domain in which the dataset\
    \ is small [6, 11, 28]. The transfer learning can only \nbe efficient if the source\
    \ and target domains share some similarities in terms of diseases \nand their\
    \ symptoms, for example. Moreover, it is very challenging to transfer knowledge\
    \ \nfrom representations learned using RGB images to a target task using multi-spectral\
    \ \nimages from UAV or satellite [126].\nThird, this approach cannot detect more\
    \ than a single disease at a time, and the detec-\ntion of diseases if the symptoms\
    \ are manifested in another area than leaves. Plant can-\nopy based-image was\
    \ proposed as a solution to this problem. The idea is to collect data \nrelative\
    \ to disease in situations where single-leaf phenotypes alone would not provide\
    \ \nsufficient information. Such features include the size, the height, the structure,\
    \ and \nbranching of canopy [126]. The canopy-based detection uses UAV equipped\
    \ with (multi/ \nhyper) spectral cameras and sensors to collect the data [32,\
    \ 49, 80, 82, 136, 143, 153, \n155]. Then data needs to be processed to extract\
    \ features which are usually related to \nvegetation indices like NDVI and EVI\
    \ or colours like RGB and NIR. The benefit from \nUAV images comes with cost on\
    \ complexity of analysis since images taken by UAV are \nsusceptible to occlusion,\
    \ overlapping, and atmospheric effects. Also, UAV is not able \nto fly at higher\
    \ altitudes, which decreases the quality of the collected images. To cover \n\
    larger zones and fields, satellite-based remote sensing and images has been proposed\
    \ as \na very good alternative [15, 81, 109, 156]. However, the problem with satellite\
    \ remote \nsensing is the revisit time, which is 16 days on average, which makes\
    \ protection applica-\ntions difficult, and some diseases can spread rapidly in\
    \ fields before they are detected. \nMoreover, passive sensors cannot penetrate\
    \ clouds [149]. The integration of these data \nwith additional data sources like\
    \ field surveys, contextual information of field and crop \nrotation can improve\
    \ the accuracy [15, 81, 109].\nDetecting diseases only from one data source based\
    \ on digital images or sensor data is \nnot sufficient. Besides, variations in\
    \ symptoms may lead to false positives due to dynamic \nnature of plant changes\
    \ [126]. Consequently, the appearance-based identification of dis-\neases is not\
    \ reliable enough to accurately detect unhealthy plants, especially in the early\
    \ \ngrowth stages. The use of multi-data sources can improve the accuracy of the\
    \ detection. \nFor instance, the use of physiological features and morphological\
    \ characteristics (growth \nattributes, yield-related features, soil) [66], or\
    \ the employment of satellite-based images \nand canopy-based images [156], where\
    \ the disease can be identified at the plant canopy \nlevel and at the field level.\n\
    Crop maturity monitoring\nCrop maturity is a kind of crop yield prediction, but\
    \ it is based on image data. This tech-\nnique has been used in fruit detection,\
    \ like apples, tomatoes, oranges, etc, and provides \nan early estimation of yield.\
    \ It is also used for crop monitoring to provide information \nto farmers with\
    \ the view to plan their farming operations, adjust management practices \nPage\
    \ 21 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n\
    \ \nbefore harvesting, etc. Such intelligent systems for monitoring crop implement\
    \ the data \nmining process incorporating machine vision and image processing\
    \ methods among \nwith advanced learning algorithms, such as CNN, SVM and ANN.\
    \ Unlike crop yield \nprediction process described above, this process is based\
    \ on a single-data source; digital \nimages [5, 23, 52, 75, 108, 122] or sensor\
    \ based-images [117, 123, 153]. Table  6 summa-\nrises such techniques. The challenges\
    \ of these systems are more or less the same as those \nof systems for crop disease\
    \ detection and protection. For instance, images with differ-\nent illumination\
    \ and lighting angles, complex surroundings and backgrounds, noise, the \npresence\
    \ of clouds, etc.\nClustering for crop monitoring\nClustering techniques are not\
    \ widely employed in DA, few efforts have been deployed to \ninvestigate the potential\
    \ of these techniques for zones’ delineation within a field. There \nare several\
    \ reasons for splitting an agricultural field into zones. Some traditional reasons\
    \ \ninclude crop diversification within a field, crop-rotation, facilitating the\
    \ management \ntasks, and more recently we defined the zones based on yield maps.\
    \ This usually helps \nto improve the overall crop yield of the field, by managing\
    \ the zones more effectively. \nTherefore, delineation of Management zones (DMZ)\
    \ is a very important task for farming \noperations since determining zones of\
    \ low-or-high yields, and understanding the rea-\nsons behind low yields, can\
    \ help come up with specific solution for each zone with the \nview to increase\
    \ the yields. In addition, it has other economic benefits, because we can \ntarget\
    \ each zone with the right amount of fertilisers, water, and other nutrients.\n\
    According to [69], delineation of management zones is an effective way to manage\
    \ the \nvariability of soil within a field, such that each zone will receive specific\
    \ management. In \n[145], a management zone is defined as a subregion of a field\
    \ that has a relatively homo-\ngeneous combination of yield-limiting factors,\
    \ for which a single rate of a specific crop \ninput is appropriate to reach maximum\
    \ efficiency of farm inputs. In [53], it is defined as \na subregion of a field\
    \ that is relatively homogeneous with regard to soil attributes.\nDMZ is a complex\
    \ spatial problem, which is addressed in the literature from several \nperspectives.\
    \ This has attracted interest from many researchers [61, 85, 87, 110, 140]. A\
    \ \nliterature review has been presented in [90], where the authors discussed\
    \ the delineation \nof soil management zones from the variable-rate fertilisation\
    \ point of view. many other \nstudies presented the delineation based on various\
    \ criteria. Some techniques that have \nbeen used include topographic maps, direct\
    \ soil sampling, non-invasive soil sampling by \nelectrical conductivity equipment,\
    \ soil organic matter or organic estimated by remote \nsensing, and yield maps\
    \ built using data collected over several seasons/years [99].\nFigure  6 depicts\
    \ the general process of delineation of management zones designed \naccording\
    \ to methodologies followed by the majority of the literature.\nThe majority of\
    \ problems that are related to crop management imply the management \nof fields\
    \ and zones. Therefore, the collected data is usually characterised by geographic\
    \ \ncoordinates and time associated with each sample, which leads to the use of\
    \ data min-\ning techniques that are more suitable for spatial and temporal datasets.\
    \ It is well rec-\nognised that agricultural datasets are typically spatio-temporal,\
    \ as the data is always \nassociated with location and time. However, these datasets\
    \ contain a significant amount \nof noise, outliers, and even missing values.\

    \ noise, imprecisions, and even outliers in the data. Satellite imagery also faces\
    \ huge \nimprecision and noise (such as clouds, ...).\nBecause of the type of\
    \ the datasets, which is spatio-temporal, it is not surprising \nto notice that\
    \ the majority of the clustering algorithms used are of type partitional. \nK-means\
    \ and Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) are considered among the most popular clustering \ntechniques\
    \ and heavily used to cluster agricultural data [17, 18, 84, 134, 137, 142, 151,\
    \ \n154]. The FCM approach has an advantage over K-means, as it deals better with\
    \ impre-\ncision and noisy data. Moreover, other types of clustering algorithms\
    \ have also been \nproven to be efficient in DA, such as density-based and hierarchical-based\
    \ clustering \ntechniques applied to DMZ [48, 116].\nAs mentioned above, besides\
    \ its huge importance in crop management, delineation \nof management zone (DMZ)\
    \ has received much attention, as the data is now available \nnot only from traditional\
    \ sources but also from refined sources, including advanced data \npre-processing\
    \ techniques. In addition, the recently collected data integrates knowledge \n\
    of experts and farmers experiences on their fields, which improves significantly\
    \ the qual-\nity of the data [84, 141]. Advanced imaging enhancement techniques\
    \ improve further \nthe data quality, and they offer the ability to track the\
    \ development of crops and provide \na Geo-referenced data that can describe the\
    \ spatial and the temporal variability of soil \nand crops variables at high resolution,\
    \ covering large areas [17, 84, 101, 132, 133, 141, \n151].\nSystematic analysis\n\
    In the following we will explore the application of data analytics in DA and its\
    \ extension \nto big data, and illustrate the practical challenges that hinder\
    \ the full adoption of DA by \nfarmers.\nDA in (small /large) scale farming\n\
    Farming can be carried out on a small or large-scale fields depending on several\
    \ fac-\ntors like land size, capital, farmer skills, level of use of machinery\
    \ and technology, etc. \nAccording to FAO3 and Grain4, over 90% of all farms worldwide\
    \ are of small-scale hold-\ning on average 2.2 hectares (from 0.6 to 10 hectares),\
    \ except for Northern America \nwhere small farms have an average size of 67.7\
    \ hectares5. Small-scale farms represent \n25% of the world’s farmland today,\
    \ where 73.12% are located in developing countries.\nFig. 6 The delineation management\
    \ zones process\n3 http:// faost at3. fao. org/ faost at- gatew ay/ go/ to/ home/.\n\
    4 https:// grain. org.\n5 According to the criterion put forward by Lincoln University\
    \ in Nebraska, which defines a small farm in the US as one \nwith an annual turnover\
    \ of less than US$50,000)\nPage 24 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big\
    \ Data           (2022) 9:123 \nIn [10] the authors described three categories\
    \ of smart farming technology, which are \ncomplementary:\n• Data acquisition\
    \ technologies: they are used to acquire the data that is related to the \nfarm.\
    \ These include remote sensing, weather data, etc.;\n• Data analysis and evaluation\
    \ technologies: these technologies usually take as input \nthe data that has been\
    \ collected so far and deliver insight to the farmer. These include \ncomputer-based\
    \ visualisation and decision models, farm management and informa-\ntion systems;\n\
    • Precision application technologies: these are focusing on variable-rate application\
    \ \nand guidance technologies.\nThe application of smart technologies and data\
    \ analytics for crop management are not \nrestricted to one kind of farm. Nowadays,\
    \ every farm should adopt smart technologies, \nas they are needed for variable\
    \ rates applications (irrigation, pesticides, fertilisers) [72, \n102, 154] while\
    \ protecting the environment.\nThe size of the farm determines how these technologies\
    \ will be used. Large farms tend \nto develop their smart technology to monitor\
    \ their farming land, or to afford some of the \nexisting sophisticated systems\
    \ like CropX as they hold the scale and margins. While small \nfarms tend to rent\
    \ sophisticated machinery and smart applications on demand, especially \nwith\
    \ the proliferation of cloud technologies that makes these smart applications\
    \ reason-\nable, the work of [30] is an example among others, of a smart irrigation\
    \ system designed \nfor smallholders. Besides, some technologies are more suitable\
    \ for large-scale farms like \ndrones and aerial vehicles used to monitor crops\
    \ which are not as profitable or efficient \nfor small scales because they have\
    \ less difficulty visualising their crops. On the other side, \nlarge-scale farms\
    \ are responsible for 70% of current deforestation6, the largest share of \nagriculture-related\
    \ greenhouse-gazes emissions, agricultural water use and habitat disrup-\ntion\
    \ resulting in biodiversity loss. Generally, small-scale farms require considerably\
    \ fewer \nexternal inputs and cause minor damage to the environment.\nTable  7\
    \ summarises the main differences between small and large-scale farming from \n\
    several perspectives. However, DA can be applied to any kind of farm without restric-\n\
    tion. Yet, we have found that the number of papers that addressed large-scale\
    \ farms is \nalmost the same as works on large-scale farms.\nTechnologies for\
    \ data acquisition Table  7 can be used to all types of farms, such as \nremote\
    \ sensing, imagery data systems, and so on. The acquired data, over the years,\
    \ can \nlead to the phenomenon of Big Data. If pre-processed and stored properly,\
    \ this will give \na significant competitive advantage to farms that collected\
    \ them, whether they are small \nor large. Some of the applications and data analyses\
    \ that can be performed of the col-\nlected are summarised in the Tables  1,  2,\
    \  3, 4 and  5,  6.\nDA and big data\nBig data is not just characterised by the\

    \ techniques to deal with large volumes of data (volume), various types of data\
    \ \nattributes (variety or heterogeneity), and be able to analyse the new data\
    \ as soon as it \nis collected (velocity) are extremely challenging tasks. Moreover,\
    \ many other character-\nistics can be found in some big data-driven applications,\
    \ these include veracity, value, \nviscosity, veracity, visualisation, etc. In\
    \ this study, we added veracity, as the data, col-\nlected by various instruments\
    \ and sensors, is of different quality, which creates a huge \nchallenge to the\
    \ data pre-processing task, and therefore its analysis. In the following, we \n\
    discuss the impact of Big Data challenges on DA.\n• Velocity: many studies that\
    \ have been examined do not consider the data velocity \nduring their data collection.\
    \ In DA, the frequency of collecting data depends on its \nsource and the problem\
    \ for which the data was collected. Some applications need \nreal-time data and\
    \ others do not. For instance, crop yield prediction does not need \nreal-time\
    \ data or data streams. It is performed at ad-hoc, while crop protection and \n\
    disease detection require high quality sensors and imagery data connected to effi-\n\
    cient methods of data analysis, which need continuous control.\n• Variety: this\
    \ is very common in agricultural datasets, as multiple sources were used \nto\
    \ collect all the necessary information about the farm and farming operations.\
    \ The \ndata values can be a simple number such as temperatures to more elaborated\
    \ such as \nimagery data, NDVI, soil texture, etc. This makes the definition of\
    \ distance measures \nand other parameters of the learning algorithms very difficult.\n\
    • Veracity: Agricultural data contains many missing values and collected from\
    \ various \nsources of varying quality. The data is very noisy, and more importantly\
    \ it contains \nmany missing values. Therefore, it is very challenging to clean\
    \ and prepare it for the \nanalysis. This was the case in the work conducted by\
    \ [37], and also in [93–96, 107] \nwhere data was collected from very large farming\
    \ areas.\nTable  8, summarises a set of representative papers reported in the\
    \ paper according to \ntheir usage of big data. For each paper, we identify the\
    \ type, the size, the heterogeneity \nof data used, and the frequency of its collection.\
    \ Also, we consider the number and type \nof ML algorithms used, the complexity\
    \ of the proposed analysis algorithms and devices \nused to collect data, data\
    \ analysis applied to a given crop and problem to solve. One \ncan notice while\
    \ the data analysis algorithms and techniques were heavily used and var-\nied,\
    \ the rigorous process of knowledge discovery was not followed, usually the data\
    \ is \nrelatively small either in size (small observations) or the data has few\
    \ dimensions (for \ninstance, considering only weather data, or fertiliser, without\
    \ taking into account other \nfactors).\nFrom Table  8, we can extract three classes\
    \ of applications according to their usage of \nbig data: Full usage (the data\
    \ contains all the characteristics of big data), light usage (the \ndata contains\
    \ some characteristics), non-usage (the data does not contain any character-\n\
    istic of big data).\nTo examine the degree of use of the big data concept and\
    \ to figure out which of its \ndimension is more present, we conducted a statistical\
    \ study where we classify works \naccording to their employment of the 4Vs of\
    \ big data.\nPage 27 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data         \

    \  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nFigures  7 and  8 show that\
    \ no work has a full employment of big data (4Vs). One can \nnotice that the agricultural\
    \ data is multidimensional and heterogeneous (variety). More-\nover, we have found\
    \ that the prediction applications display more use of big data, there \nexist\
    \ studies that have used three dimensions such as DMZ applications. It is worth\
    \ not-\ning that these applications, either prediction or delineation of zones,\
    \ have the potential \nto use big data to provide stable and accurate results.\n\
    If we put aside the volume dimension (V1) (see Figure  7, only 7% of the reviewed\
    \ \nstudies used (V2, V3 and V4), and 32% of studies just employed data mining\
    \ techniques \nfor agriculture problems. The most employed data mining techniques\
    \ are for prediction, \nincluding yield prediction, forecasting, prediction of\
    \ fertiliser applications, etc.\nDA practical challenges\nThere exist a number\
    \ of challenges and obstacles impeding the potential benefit of DA. \nIn [104],\
    \ the authors studied the barriers that prevent the adoption of smart farming\
    \ \nin their country, Brazil. Some of these barriers include lack of integration\
    \ and compat-\nibility between different agriculture systems, lack of advanced\
    \ data manipulation of data \nobtained from different equipment, poor telecommunications\
    \ infrastructure on rural \nareas, and finally, the lack of training in deploying\
    \ and using new technologies. These \nbarriers are common to the majority of countries\
    \ in the world.\nFig. 7 Distribution of works according to the used Big Data dimensions’\n\
    Fig. 8 Percent of employment of big data dimensions\nPage 30 of 37\nChergui and\
    \ Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \nFrom the Table  7, we\
    \ can see that over 73% of crop farms are located in developing \ncountries. So\
    \ that, the investment in high and sophisticated DA technologies is not \nthere.\
    \ Most of the main technologies used in DA systems (GPS, UAV, auto-steering and\
    \ \nvariable rate technology) are designed for relatively large-scale farms located\
    \ in devel-\noped countries [10] or designed by developed countries. Some of these\
    \ technologies are \nbecoming available recently. For instance, since 2018 African\
    \ scientists can have access \nto free and open-source satellite data as a result\
    \ of a deal signed by the African Union \nwith the European Commission’s Copernicus\
    \ programme.\nAs DA is relatively new technology, there is a lack of standards\
    \ and common solutions \nfor data collection, preparation and storage. In addition,\
    \ there is a lack of data for many \nreasons, farmers did not record their data\
    \ and it takes time to build significant historical \ndatasets [20, 39, 77, 78,\
    \ 92, 146]. Another major barrier is that many farmers are relying \nmore on their\
    \ expertise and refusing to adopt these new and complex technologies [10]. \n\
    Moreover, the transition from their traditional practices and farming habits to\
    \ these \ntechnologies comes with a cost and energy (training and learning new\
    \ skills).\n[20] States that the legal and regulatory frameworks around the collection,\
    \ sharing and \nuse of agricultural data contributes to a range of challenges.\
    \ Many laws potentially influ-\nence the ownership, control of and data access.\
    \ Ref. [74] presented a set of socio-ethical \nimperatives associated with the\
    \ use of data in agriculture, including dependency risks, \ndata concentration,\
    \ potential lock-in effects, and the peril of transformation of farmers \ninto\
    \ information tools, in addition to the sustainability challenges.\nFinally, according\
    \ to [47], the real economic value of the use of big data in farming is \nstill\
    \ unknown, especially for small-scale farming. Consequently, it will be hard to\
    \ con-\nvince them to switch from process-driven towards data and machine learning\
    \ driven. \nThis is reaffirmed in [20], where the authors stated that on one side,\
    \ farmers are enticed \nwith promises of increased profits and farming efficiency,\
    \ on the other hand the proofs \nare not there yet.\nConclusion\nDigital agriculture\
    \ (DA) is a data-driven approach that exploits the hidden information \nwithin\
    \ the collected data to gain new insights; transforming the farming practices\
    \ from \nintuitive-based decision-making to informed-based decision-making. DA\
    \ relies on effi-\ncient data collection practices, efficient data preparation\
    \ and storage techniques, effi-\ncient data analytics, and efficient deployment\
    \ and exploitation of the gained insights to \nmake optimal farming decisions.\n\
    In this study, we presented a systematic review of the potential use of the data\
    \ mining \nprocess in crop production and management and highlighted serious gaps\
    \ which can be \nconsidered in future studies. The majority of the current practices\
    \ were dominated by \nstatistical analyses and small machine learning systems.\
    \ However, these can only give \nsome ideas within a very limited view of the\
    \ overall system. Agricultural data-driven \napplications collect a significant\
    \ amount of data from various sources. This constitutes \nan excellent opportunity\
    \ to the field to answer numerous research and practical ques-\ntions that were\
    \ not possible before. Nevertheless, despite all the advantages that can \nbe\
    \ gained from DA, there are several other challenges and obstacles that need to\
    \ be \nPage 31 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022)\
    \ 9:123 \n \naddressed, among them lack of data, lack of skills, and lack of maturity\
    \ and standards so \nthat it can be adopted and deployed quickly and easily.\n\
    In this study, we cover approaches that deal the entire process of data mining;\
    \ from \ndata collection to knowledge deployment. We cover this process from big\
    \ data view, \nwith more focus on crop monitoring and management in an attempt\
    \ to understand the \nchallenges that DA is currently facing. We defined the research\
    \ questions addressed by \nthe study and provided a classification of data mining\
    \ techniques used in the field. For \neach class, a set of representative existing\
    \ works have been reviewed, and an analytical \nstudy has been provided to highlight\
    \ the category of machine learning method applied \nand for which purpose. We\
    \ discussed the big data concepts and its current impact on \nDA, and showed that\
    \ from the data analyst’s view, the transition towards DA is ready \nto embrace\
    \ big data analytics concepts. This provides new opportunities of investment \n\
    into these challenges and allows for a efficient ways of managing crops. Besides,\
    \ it will \nprovide farmers with new insights into how they can grow crops more\
    \ efficiently, while \nminimising the impact on the environment. It also promises\
    \ new levels of scientific dis-\ncovery and innovative solutions to more complex\
    \ problems.\nAbbreviations\nANN \n Artificial Neural Network\nBC \n Bayesian classifier\n\

    \ and suitability for a high level of automation while\novercoming the shortcomings\
    \ of passive systems limited by atmospheric conditions, changes in light,\nviewing\

    \ be the next generational leap forward in\nprecision agriculture, with platforms\
    \ exploiting LIDAR 3D scanning/shape proﬁling as\nwell as more sophisticate techniques.\n\
    RS is generally deﬁned as the measurement of objects at remote distances to acquire\n\
    useful information indirectly by radiance or irradiance of electromagnetic energy\
    \ from the\nsurface of the Earth [6]. RS techniques are opposite to proximal sensing,\
    \ which measures\nspectral features obtained by handheld or contact devices. Information\
    \ on the scanned\nobject, e.g., plant health, is retrieved by processing and analysing\
    \ the acquired raw data\nand some additional environmental conditions. RS can\
    \ detect plant conditions and analyse\nthe spatial degree and patterns of plant\
    \ characteristics using a noncontact method. Electro-\noptical sensors are typically\
    \ differentiated between active and passive depending on\nwhether energy is emitted\
    \ from the device or not: In active sensors, signals are emitted,\nand their reﬂection/backscattering\
    \ is measured, whereas in passive sensors, ambient\nirradiance such as solar radiation\
    \ is exploited to detect the phenomenon of interest. Active\nRS instruments include\
    \ Radar and LIDAR, while passive sensors include various detectors\nand imaging\
    \ cameras which measure the reﬂected solar radiation in the wavelength\nregions\
    \ of the visible spectrum (VIS: 400–700 nm), near-infrared (NIR: 700–1100 nm),\n\
    shortwave infrared (SWIR: 1100–2500 nm) and thermal infrared (TIR: 3–15 µm) in\
    \ the\nelectromagnetic spectrum.\nMost of the literature in the early detection\
    \ of plant disease had focused on MSI and\nHSI techniques due to the maturity\
    \ and implementations of these technologies. MSI and\nHSI have been applied to\
    \ many kinds of crops to detect diseases. These two methods\nconcentrate on the\
    \ differences in the spectral signatures of infected and healthy plant\nleaves.\
    \ For some crop diseases, early detection is important for farmers to yield the\n\
    products economically and efﬁciently. As there are typically no visible symptoms\
    \ at early\nstages of most diseases and fungi located on abaxial leaves, most\
    \ visible sensors cannot\ndetect early stages of diseases because the signatures\
    \ are not sufﬁciently differentiated.\n2.1. Plant Biology in Relation to Sensors\n\
    Plant health monitoring for precision agriculture encompasses the classiﬁcation\
    \ and\nquantiﬁcation of the disease. Classiﬁcation can be divided into two levels\
    \ of increasing\ncomplexity: Detection and identiﬁcation [1]. Detection is the\
    \ distinction of healthy from\nunhealthy, and identiﬁcation is the diagnosis of\
    \ a speciﬁc disease or symptom. Quantiﬁca-\ntion deﬁnes the spread and severity\
    \ of the disease. The classiﬁcation of plant diseases and\nstress is based on\
    \ abiotic and biotic factors, shown in Table 1, and how they relate to plant\n\
    physiological processes [7].\nTable 1. Typical abiotic and biotic stress factors.\n\

    the leaf or canopy reﬂectance in the visible (VIS, 400 nm to 700 nm), near-infrared\

    \ of plant’s resistance to stress is very desirable from a breeding perspec-\n\
    tive. Traditional methods of plant breeding are complex, extremely time-consuming\
    \ and\nlabour-intensive [21]. The selection of resistant cultivars is dependent\
    \ on identifying the\nrelevant plant traits through genotyping and phenotyping\
    \ methods, although this method\nis also costly and slow, hence referred to as\
    \ the phenotyping bottleneck [22]. The use of\noptical imaging methods as a new\
    \ phenotyping method is suggested as an innovative\ntechnique to overcome the\
    \ phenotyping bottleneck and improve breeding [22,23]. The\nphenotyping of soybeans\
    \ has been successfully demonstrated using ﬂuorescence spec-\ntroscopy, demonstrating\
    \ the beneﬁt and accuracy of optical, non-destructive methods [24].\nThe use of\
    \ thermography is promoted as a useful method to improve phenotyping for\ndrought\
    \ adaption in maize [25]. Emerging techniques of extracting phenotypic parameters\n\
    through LIDAR shape proﬁling have been developed using the leaf area density and\
    \ height\nas key measurements [26]. Used in parallel with a thermal sensor, further\
    \ insight into\nthe plant health can be gained by established spectral reﬂectivity\
    \ indicating desirable\nphenotypic parameters. Similarly, LIDAR shape proﬁling\
    \ is used to assess to the canopy\nand above-ground biomass as part of a high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping platform, delivering\na non-destructive method and high correlation\
    \ between the above-ground biomass and\nthe LIDAR predicted volume and canopy\
    \ height and providing vertical analysis of the\nbiochemical properties, as explored\
    \ with HSI LIDAR fusion by the authors of [27,28]. The\nanalysis of LIDAR’s application\
    \ to phenotyping is less mature: While acknowledging the\nvariety and depths of\
    \ information supplied by LIDAR in a short time frame at a low cost,\nparticularly\
    \ in relation to plant structure, the authors of [29] warned of inherent ﬂaws\
    \ in\nthe methodology, the susceptibility of the technique to laser obscuration,\
    \ inefﬁciencies\nin retrieving physiological traits and incomplete plant representation.\
    \ These factors sug-\ngest that, in phenotyping, a LIDAR sensor will need to be\
    \ paired with a complimentary\nhyperspectral sensor to overcome the limitations.\n\
    2.4. Soil Monitoring\nBeyond health monitoring, RS techniques in fusion with GPS\
    \ and GIS are used to mon-\nitor soil-related stressors and assist with land management.\
    \ Crop yield can be effectively\nrelated to the soil conductivity from which the\
    \ electrical conductivity can be projected from\nbands in VIS at 498 nm, 501 nm,\
    \ 600 nm, 603 nm, 636 nm, 639 nm, 642 nm, 666 nm and\n669 nm and in the NIR at\
    \ 738 nm, 741 nm, 744 nm and 747 nm [16,30,31]. The information\nin these narrow\
    \ bands is suited for HSI sensor detection gathered before seeding and can\nbe\
    \ correlated to soil properties such as moisture content, fertility, salinity,\
    \ productivity\nestimates and other soil chemical properties. Measurements conducted\
    \ during the growth\nseason allow the detection of biotic and biotic stresses\
    \ that impact crop yield, as discussed.\nLeaf area index (LAI) is one of the main\
    \ variables used as an indicator of crop growth and\nyield as it correlates to\
    \ the canopy reﬂectance. HSI has been validated by recent studies as\npreferable\
    \ in LAI measurement to MSI as narrow band indices provide a better evaluation\n\
    of LAI than in the broad range [17,32].\nIncreasingly, studies are investigating\
    \ RS applications for soil analysis utilizing MSI\nand HSI. Notably, using a UAV\
    \ platform and HSI, a study demonstrated a method for\nﬁeld-scale soil salinity\
    \ monitoring, a major indicator of soil degradation and arable land\nloss, and\
    \ outperformed the analysis conducted using satellite based MSI [33]. UAV-based\n\
    HSI to determine soil moisture content as a key indicator of nutrient potential,\
    \ on the other\nhand, highlights the emerging focus on artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) algorithms such as the\nrandom forest method and extreme learning as a\
    \ means of soil moisture content estimation\non a regional scale [34].\nThe practices\
    \ of reducing soil erosion, enhancing water management and improving\ncrop yields\
    \ are crucial concerns in conservation agriculture. Three crop management\npractices—lowest\
    \ possible soil disturbance, permanent soil cover and crop rotations—are\nproposed\
    \ by conservation agriculture based on the Food and Agriculture Organization\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 171\n6 of 39\n(FAO) deﬁnition [35]. The fertility of cultivated\
    \ soils is related to the organic matter (OM)\ncontents. Soil organic carbon (OC)\
    \ content is forecasted by reﬂectance measurements, which\nare carried out in\
    \ the lab with dried soil samples or in the ﬁeld utilising spectroradiometers\n\
    or satellite imaging. Remote sensors attached to drones can capture spatial images\
    \ at\nspeciﬁc altitudes to forecast soil OC on large-scale farmlands with bare\
    \ soil before sowing\nseason. For example, a drone integrated with infrared and\
    \ visible light sensors captured\naerial images to discover soil degradations\
    \ by studying the appearance of gullies in the\nsoil [36]. This was carried out\
    \ by comparing the updated images with a set of historical\nimages and satellite\
    \ photographs. A ﬁne spatial resolution image was used to quantify the\narea of\
    \ soil erosion through a slow and cost-effective process. Emerging techniques\
    \ are used\nto collect topographic data by drones to measure the quantity of soil\
    \ volumes reduced via\nerosion. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and images from\
    \ drones and ground-based sensors\nare fused to obtain topography exploiting Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) processing. Digital\nsurface models obtained with each of\
    \ these methods are subtracted from an interpolated\npre-erosion surface model\
    \ to evaluate the volumetric soil loss.\n2.5. Classiﬁcation Indices\nThe relationship\
    \ between the collected data and classiﬁcation of plant disease is\nusually characterized\
    \ by a vegetation index (VI), as outlined in Table 2, which highlights a\nspeciﬁc\
    \ change in the spectral reﬂectance to distinguish between healthy leaves and\
    \ those\nsubject to abiotic and biotic stresses. Similarly, the use of hyperspectral\
    \ vegetation indices\nspeciﬁc to HSI was proposed [37].\nTable 2. Common vegetation\

    \ Bidirectional Reﬂectance Distribution Function Measurement\nThe plant health\
    \ assessment from spectroscopic sensors focuses on correlating the\nreﬂectance\
    \ to photosynthesis to assess health. Therefore, the plant health assessment\n\
    heavily relies on being able to take accurate measurements from the leaves. Understandably,\n\
    in RS, the reﬂectance of the leaf can be inﬂuenced by the angle of leaf relative\
    \ to the\nsensor, the ambient lighting spectrum and the intrinsic surface characteristics\
    \ of the leaf\nitself. Inherently, the viewing angle and angle of illumination\
    \ affect the brightness of the\ncanopy, and subsequently, the crop identiﬁcation,\
    \ LAI and disease detection. The use of\nthe canopy’s bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution function (BRDF) can help to analyse\nthe measurements made at non-optimal\
    \ angles considering the surface characteristics of\nleaf [38]. The BRDF is a\
    \ measurement of the ratio of radiance from a small beam of radiation\ncompared\
    \ to the incident ﬂux density [38].\nIn practise, the BRDF model is comprised\
    \ of an equation correlating the surface\nphysical properties to the observed\
    \ reﬂectance as the light is subjected to scattering due to\nthe canopy structure\
    \ as depicted in Figure 3 [39]. The radiance is a function of the viewing\nSensors\

    \ methods have been used for disease detection in plants. They\nare invasive,\
    \ slow, proximal methods which are ill-suited to large ﬁeld applications. A\n\
    small overview is given below.\n3.1.1. Serological Assays\nSerological assays\
    \ are an early disease detection technique that are used to detect\nviruses. As\
    \ the most prevalent assay, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can\n\
    detect bacteria at 100 Colony Forming Units (CFU) per mL−1 depending on the sample\n\
    organism [1,42,43]. The advantage of serological assays is the range of diseases,\
    \ bacteria\nand fungi that can be detected. The technique is disadvantaged by\
    \ expense, destructive\ntesting, low sensitivity, low detectability of diseases\
    \ and storage of antibodies leading to\ncontamination [44].\n3.1.2. Nucleic Acid-Based\
    \ Methods\nNucleic acid-based methods are DNA- or RNA-based detection methods\
    \ that generally\nrely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) variant techniques [1].\
    \ An example of one of these\nmethods is quantitative PCR (qPCR), a methodology\
    \ that needs a sample to extract DNA,\nwhich then needs to be stored, ampliﬁed\
    \ and replicated [1]. The technique fundamentally\nintroduces errors as a result\
    \ of the complexity of the methodology [45]. The unfeasible\nnature of large-scale\
    \ testing can lead to false negatives due to the nonuniform spread of\ndisease\
    \ in plants, thereby creating a misinformed projection of plant disease spread.\
    \ These\ntechniques are advantageous in comparison to serological assays, with\
    \ higher accuracy,\nfaster detection times (within minutes, and lower cost [46].\
    \ Whereas molecular techniques\nare speciﬁc and efﬁcient, they are disadvantaged\
    \ by uneven disease distribution, poor\nsensitivity in certain materials and small\
    \ sample sizes, which may not capture the true\nextent of the situation. PCR-based\
    \ methods lack suitability for in-ﬁeld operation and\nare also expensive and time-consuming\
    \ [44,45]. These techniques are contrasted by the\nevolution of RS in precision\
    \ agriculture applications as they inherently overcome the\ndrawbacks of PCR-based\
    \ and visual inspection methodologies.\n3.2. Fluorescence Spectroscopy\nFluorescence\
    \ spectroscopy is considered a cost-effective, fast and sensitive method [47].\n\
    The principles of ﬂuorescence spectroscopy are based on the leaf properties reacting\
    \ to\nlight. When light is absorbed by the leaf, three processes occur in competition:\
    \ Photochem-\nistry (photosynthesis PSII), heat dissipation and re-emitted ﬂuorescence\
    \ [12]. Since these\nprocesses occur competitively, an increase in one of these\
    \ processes causes a decrease in the\nother one or two. Using this principle,\
    \ changes in the chlorophyll reﬂectance are monitored\nby handheld ﬂuorometers,\
    \ with deviations correlated to plant stress. Fluorescence spec-\ntroscopy uses\
    \ an artiﬁcial light source to initiate the electron movement, which, in turn,\n\
    generates luminescence [44]. The relative intensity of the reﬂected light is then\
    \ indirectly\nrelated to plant diseases.\nFluorescence is particularly sensitive\
    \ to external light, impacting in-ﬁeld applica-\ntions [48]. However, the introduction\
    \ of Pulsed-Amplitude Modulation (PAM) artiﬁcial\nexcitation light helps ﬁlter\
    \ ambient light from the measured chlorophyll ﬂuorescence.\nFluorescence sensors\
    \ are also critiqued as inefﬁcient in detecting asymptomatic diseased\nleaves\
    \ [45], are sensitive to leaf auto-ﬂuorescence [49] and decrease control over\
    \ the spread\nof a disease. Table 3 gives an overview of some of the research\
    \ conducted using ﬂuorescence\nspectroscopy in the detection of plant diseases.\n\

    \ research and time of testing.\n4. Remote Sensing\nEmerging RS techniques rely\
    \ on detecting anomalies in photosynthetic parameters.\nThese alterations in pigment,\
    \ chemical concentrations, nutrient, water uptake, cell structure\nand gas exchange\
    \ can then be observed by the subsequent change in reﬂectance character-\nistics\
    \ of the leaf or canopy [9]. The anomalous behaviour is then related back to a\
    \ biotic or\nabiotic stress. It must be emphasised that the observed and quantiﬁed\
    \ changes in spectral\nreﬂectance have an indirect relationship with the plant\
    \ stressors. The data gleaned from\nthe sensors are typically compared using one\
    \ of the many vegetation indices and undergo\nsigniﬁcant data analysis to be classiﬁed\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy, and between\nspeciﬁc diseases. Each extra step\
    \ invariably introduces uncertainty into the methodology.\nThe results in the\
    \ literature are highly nonuniform and difﬁcult to compare quantitively as\nthe\
    \ research is speciﬁc to a crop and disease combination and subject to external\
    \ factors.\nA unique spectral signature associated with each biotic or abiotic\
    \ stress would enable a\ndirect causal link between reﬂectance and for example\
    \ water stress (abiotic). However, the\nabsorption qualities of pigments and their\
    \ overlap, for example, are affected by external\nelements, such as the leaf internal\
    \ structure, water content and surface properties. There-\nfore, no single wavelength\
    \ is unique to a single pigment concentration [9,57]. The lack of\nsuccess in\
    \ this approach has led researchers to use correlation analyses to deﬁne distinctive\n\
    pathogen-speciﬁc spectral signatures, including a spectral index and ratio with\
    \ discrimi-\nnant analyses [9,58]. Conclusive optimal spectral signatures are\
    \ clearly unsupported by\nthe literature. However, the same studies still show\
    \ good agreement with the sensitivity of\ncertain spectral regions with high absorptions,\
    \ corresponding to abiotic and biotic factors\nlike pigmentation [57]. A generalised\
    \ approach to plant health monitoring using sensors\n(in this case, hyperspectral)\
    \ is shown in Figure 5.\nSensors 2021, 21, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n10 of 40 \n \n\

    4.1. Multispectral Imaging\nMultispectral imagery (MSI) uses sensors that measure\
    \ reﬂectance across a broad\nband of the electromagnetic spectrum. The broad band\

    dimensions), which is represented by the pixel resolution of the sensor, compiles\
    \ the data\nof all the measured wavelengths (the Z axis) [16]. HSI is a reﬂectance-based\
    \ technique\nthat offers more continuous coverage of the spectrum range than MSI\
    \ (typically between\n350–2500 nm) and can have a spectral resolution of <1 nm\
    \ [11].\nSensors 2021, 21, 171\n12 of 39\nIn the HSI model, different surfaces,\
    \ such as the tree canopy or food crops, are\nrepresented by ﬁrst- and second-order\
    \ spectral statistics. The ﬁrst- and second-order\nstatistics of the spectral\
    \ reﬂectance of each surface type can then be transformed in the\nspectral image\
    \ process. In this process, the mean vector and covariance matrix of each\nsurface\
    \ reﬂectance type or class are used to evaluate the system’s performance. The\
    \ HSI\nmodel is composed of the image condition module, the sensor module and\
    \ the processing\nmodule.\nThe image condition module describes the radiation\
    \ transfer in the atmosphere as this\naccounts for the absorption, reﬂection and\
    \ scattering that will affect the HSI performance.\nAs a result of these inﬂuences,\
    \ the radiance at the sensor, Lλ, is composed of three main\nelements: Direct\
    \ reﬂection; path radiation, Lλ, path; and radiation reﬂected outside of the\n\
    target, as shown in Figure 7 [70].\nLλ = Lλ,s·X + Lλ, path +\n\x10\nLλ,1 − Lλ,path\n\
    \x11\n·Xe\n(2)\nwhere Lλ,s is the radiation at the surface, X is the vector of\
    \ the surface reﬂectance, Xe is the\nvector from the background and the ﬁnal term,\
    \ (Lλ,1 − Lλ,path)·Xe, eliminates the direct\nreﬂection. The mean, Lλ, and the\
    \ covariance, ∑Lλ, can subsequently be calculated.\nIn the sensor module, the\
    \ incident radiation passes through a detector, is ampliﬁed\nand is then evaluated\
    \ for all of the spectral and spatial characteristics. The sensor module\ncontains\
    \ a spectral model, a spatial model and an error model.\nThe mean and covariance\
    \ of the spatial model is related to the reduction in radiation\nand image degradation\
    \ based on the coefﬁcient of radiation reduction, A, the number of\nbands, σ,\
    \ and the weight matrix, Ws.\nLs\nLλ = A·Lλ\n(3)\n∑\ns\nLλ = [WsσA]\n(4)\nThe\
    \ spectral model contains the centre wavelength as well as the adjacent wavelengths\n\
    radiation [70]. The effect of these adjacent wavelengths needs to be accounted\
    \ for in the\nmean, S, and the covariance, ∑S, where B is a linear transformation\
    \ matrix of the spectral\nresponse functions.\nS = B·A·Lλ\n(5)\n∑\nS\n= BWsA∑Lλ\

    \ = (1 + erad) 2B·WsA∑Lλ ATBT + ∧dark + ∧pho + ∧read + ∧quant\n(8)\nThese mean\
    \ and covariance statistics for the three main models make up the spectral\nsignal\
    \ statistics from which the data processing can extract useful data.\nThe performance\
    \ metrics of the HSI system is made up of three algorithms. One\ncompares the\
    \ spectral characterization accuracy based on the mean difference between\nthe\
    \ starting known reﬂectance and the received reﬂectance of the target. The second\n\
    compares the probabilities that the sensor makes a detection opposed to a false\
    \ detection.\nThe third calculates the total error based on the total probabilities\
    \ of a false alarm or missed\ndetection [70].\nIn both MSI and HSI, the images\
    \ are improved by lowering the unwanted intensity\nand improving the deﬁnitions\
    \ of object boundaries by means of nonlinear diffusion for\ngreater classiﬁcation\

    \ plant genotypes to be characterized and the\nstages of the disease to be automatically\
    \ identiﬁed and displayed, and displays the spectral\ndeviations over time, which\
    \ is useful for tracking the growth cycle of crops. The image\nprocessing involved\
    \ in HSI is comprised of ﬁle reduction and sub setting, usually through\nprincipal\
    \ component analysis (PCA), then deﬁning the spectral library, the known data\
    \ set\nwhich the data will use to then classify. There are many HSI image classiﬁers\
    \ that use AI\nalgorithms as well as vegetative indices for plant disease classiﬁcation\
    \ [81].\nAs depicted in Table 6, several studies have criticized the functionality\
    \ limitations of\nMSI sensors in capturing surface properties both in spatial\
    \ and spectral aspects [16]. By\ngathering data of adjoining narrow bands, HSI\
    \ sensors can discern ﬁner features that may\nbe overlooked by the broad-band\
    \ approach of MSI [16]. As a result, there is an increased\nclassiﬁcation accuracy\
    \ in the use of HSI in comparison to MSI [83–85]. Because the HSI\ntechnique captures\
    \ all of the wavelengths at each point, wavelength band selection can\noccur in\
    \ post-processing, instead of narrowing the band selection before data collection\
    \ as\nin MSI. This is especially advantageous for researchers and where gaps in\
    \ the literature\nexist. In comparison to ﬂuorescence-based models, HSI demonstrated\
    \ a disease detection\nerror of 11% relative to the 16% achieved by ﬂuorescence-based\
    \ models. A combined\napproach further reduced that error to only 6% [86].\nHSI\
    \ is disadvantaged by high cost, system fragility and complexity [16,69,87]. The\n\
    restriction of the monitoring to narrow bands is to be further investigated since,\
    \ depending\non the scope of the application, wide-band measurements are more\
    \ expensive, and the\nlarge data volume creates data overlap and strain on the\
    \ system [11]. The literature is\ndeﬁnitive in relating optimal spectral ranges\
    \ to crop stresses, and the entire spectrum is\nnot needed provided the application\
    \ is sufﬁciently deﬁned. Excessive data also impact the\nsystem in terms of data\
    \ storage capacity, are computationally expensive and saturate radio\ndatalinks\
    \ [17]. Excessive data are somewhat offset by pre-processing feature extraction\n\
    techniques. These feature extraction methods typically comprise independent component\n\
    analysis, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), PCA, kernel PCA, derivative analysis,\
    \ locally\nlinear embedding, lambda by lambda correlation plots, partial least\
    \ squares, vegetation\nindices and isometric feature mapping, as brieﬂy described\
    \ in Table 2 in the classiﬁcation\nindices section and broadly in application\
    \ in Table 7 [37,87]. These techniques reduce the\ndimensionality of the data\
    \ and data redundancy and extract the useful data without identi-\nfying the redundant\
    \ wavelengths. Using R2 values, the 15–20 hyperspectral narrowband\n(HNB) can\
    \ achieve the same classiﬁcation accuracy of the 240 HNB [88]. The optimal HNBs\n\
    are selected based on the corresponding physical signiﬁcance in vegetation. This\
    \ approach\nis necessary when considering Hughes’ Phenomenon, in which each of\
    \ the HNBs require\ntraining samples to ensure conﬁdence in the classiﬁcation\
    \ [88]. Researchers need to balance\nthe need for more HNBs, and therefore large\
    \ training data, by removing overlapping HNBs\nwithin the system.\nA review of\
    \ the application of neural networks to HSI data was conducted, demon-\nstrating\
    \ the accuracy in disease detection by HSI [49]. The removal of the approximately\n\
    88% redundant data from HSI by data mining was performed by the authors of [37]\
    \ to\nreduce data redundancy and dimensionality without eliminating unique data.\
    \ HSI is\nrelatively expensive due to its composition of narrow band ﬁlters, very\
    \ sensitive detectors,\nspectrometers and 2D sensor arrays [16].\nIn disease detection,\
    \ HSI is clearly advantageous in being able to acquire large amounts\nof data\
    \ from which a lot of useful information can be extracted. However, there is limited\n\
    maturity in the image processing systems, which limits feature extraction. Hence,\
    \ few\ngood automated systems are found in the literature [81]. Additionally,\
    \ the HSI is still\nrelatively expensive and requires substantial expertise to\
    \ utilize, and the application to\nassess plant disease severity has not been\
    \ fully explored and lacks adequate methods to\nprocess multiple diseases [81].\n\

    \ technique in plant disease detection which exploits surface\ntemperature measurements\
    \ of leaves/crops/canopies to identify deviations indicative\nof abiotic or biotic\
    \ stress. Thermographic cameras target the thermal infrared spectra,\nconverting\
    \ the pixels into temperature values, and the relative condition is then related\
    \ to\nthe leaf transpiration and water content [11]. Thermography is suitable\
    \ for use in proxi-\nmal and remote sensors and for pre-symptomatic diagnosis\
    \ [100,101]. At a canopy level,\nthermography techniques are useful in wet conditions\
    \ and in the detection of diseases that\noccur heterogeneously. However, the application\
    \ of thermography is vulnerable to envi-\nronmental conditions and lacks precision.\
    \ Diagnosis of plant diseases from thermographic\nmeasurements of leaf transpiration\
    \ is not very clear, although the implementation of sensor\nfusion is suggested\
    \ as a future development [102]. Additionally, research has highlighted\nthe suitability\
    \ of infrared thermography in the detection of water stress across different\n\
    genotypes, such as maize, soybean and cotton [103,104].\nSensors 2021, 21, 171\n\
    17 of 39\n4.4. LIDAR\nActive measurement systems like LIDAR are suggested as an\
    \ alternative to the short-\ncomings of passive systems [105,106], as the latter\
    \ are limited by the availability of ideal\nambient lighting, impact of atmospheric\
    \ conditions, changes in illumination and viewing\nangles and canopy structure,\
    \ among other factors. Laser-based techniques mostly avoid\nproblems associated\
    \ with light, allowing for night measurements. One of the key beneﬁts\nof LIDAR\
    \ is its ability to take measurements during the day and night, a driving factor\n\
    for its implementation in NASA’s Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights,\
    \ Days\nand Seasons (ASCENDS) mission. In this case, Differential Absorption LIDAR\
    \ (DIAL)\nmade it possible to the gap in knowledge of oceanic carbon sinks at\
    \ night [107]. As LIDAR\nmeasures range, height errors are reduced while spatial\
    \ reﬂectance properties and leaf\nbiochemistry can be obtained. In fact, several\
    \ sources of bias are removed due to this\ninteraction of the surface and atmosphere\
    \ [107]. Additionally, with a small laser footprint,\nLIDAR measurements can be\
    \ taken between gaps in thick clouds. LIDAR systems in air-\nborne platforms offer\
    \ greater ﬂexibility in capturing data; have a high rate of data delivery,\nincrease\
    \ elevation accuracy, particularly in difﬁcult terrain; and are capable of a high\
    \ level\nof automation [108].\nPractical difﬁculties of in-ﬁeld implementations\
    \ such as complex canopy structures,\ncolour variations, textures, lighting conditions,\
    \ shadows and heavy post-processing costs\nare key limitations of VIS-based crop\
    \ monitoring systems, which have led to the develop-\nment of a dual LIDAR UGV-based\
    \ system acting in a pseudo stereo vision as an alternative\nlow-cost, high-accuracy\
    \ system [109]. Hyperspectral data combined with LIDAR shape\nproﬁling on a UAV\
    \ platform is utilized to quantify the photosynthetic processes in forest\nvegetation\
    \ [110]. Using data fusion, the 3D LIDAR point cloud data and hyperspectral\n\
    reﬂectance data are combined to predict the biochemical traits present at the\
    \ canopy level\nthat are highly correlated. Despite difﬁculties in the vertical\
    \ estimation of biochemical\ntraits, research has concluded that the fusion of\
    \ spectral imagery and LIDAR has a wide\nset of applications, including biochemical\
    \ traits, tree species mapping and biomass estima-\ntion [110]. This is undercut\
    \ by the difﬁculty in combining the two sets of disparate data,\nonly achieved\
    \ with signiﬁcant advanced image processing. Using DIAL technology in\nan airborne\
    \ platform, local biomass and carbon levels can be estimated. By integrating\n\
    a LIDAR plant height detecting sensor with a passive optical NDVI sensor, the\
    \ system\ncan better estimate biomass and explore complex in-ﬁeld relationships\
    \ in tall fescue [111].\nUnlike the carbon dioxide wavelength approach described,\
    \ these methods typically re-\nvolve around using LIDAR volumetric measurements\
    \ and canopy height measurements to\ndetermine variations.\nCarbon Dioxide Absorption\
    \ Spectroscopy\nUsing DIAL, it is possible to detect nonvisible symptoms of agricultural\
    \ diseases\nbased on the CO2 concentration over the canopy. Ambient CO2 over canopies\
    \ does not\nchange in the early morning or at night, whereas it decreases signiﬁcantly\
    \ at midday (about\n12 pm) with a changeable amount of 411−2.5 = 408.5 ppm [112].\
    \ Therefore, it is important\nto detect the changeable amount by sensors because\
    \ it is an indication of CO2 absorption\nfrom plants. The amount of absorbed CO2\
    \ is maximized by healthy plants. However, the\namount of absorbed CO2 is reduced\
    \ by stressed plants. Sensors are required to measure\nthese small changes. Stressed\
    \ plants are caused by a lack of water, excess of fertilisers,\nincreased salt\
    \ in the root zone and diseases. In addition, CO2 absorption consumed by\nplants\
    \ is necessary to generate food and energy for their growth and cellular respiration.\
    \ In\nﬁeld conditions, CO2 concentration over or in the canopy is extremely dynamic\
    \ due to the\ndiffusion and turbulence processes.\nCarbon dioxide sensors for\
    \ the agricultural sector have a few distinctions among the\nconventional industrial\
    \ sensors regarding the determination of environmental parameters.\nThe sensors\
    \ are essential for performance under extraordinary conditions of temperatures,\n\
    pressure and humidity. The agricultural environment is difﬁcult to completely\
    \ deﬁne,\nSensors 2021, 21, 171\n18 of 39\nwith numerous microorganisms and other\
    \ biological species impacting the parameters\nunder study [113]. The agricultural\
    \ sensors need to be capable of handling highly variable\nprocessing and of supporting\
    \ users in interpreting the calculation data as clearly as possible.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of monitoring CO2 is becoming signiﬁcant in various agriculture applications,\n\
    e.g., CO2 soil respiration, gas exchange, observing atmospheric gas, in the alcohol\
    \ and\nbeverage industry [114], the scanning of biogas composition [115] and the\
    \ identiﬁcation of\nfreeze damage in orange fruits [116]. The sensitivity of CO2\
    \ concentration detection is a\npowerful invention which we can apply to measure\
    \ the anomalies of CO2 concentration\nassociated with stressed plants. In Table\
    \ 8, the ﬂuorescence-based model is compared with\nthe how LIDAR measurements\

    \ from laser scanners has little been stud-\nied. Multispectral laser scanners\
    \ give a comprehensive array of wavelengths for current\ntechnical enhancements\
    \ [117,121,122].\nSeveral vegetation applications primarily based in laboratory\
    \ conditions have been im-\nproved using multispectral laser systems. The dual-wavelength\
    \ Spectral Ratio Biospheric\nLIDAR, which indicates the modiﬁcations of ratio\
    \ between the red and near-infrared wave-\nlength regions from a phenology cycle\
    \ of a tree canopy, was studied by Rall and Knox [123].\nThe Multi-wavelength\
    \ Airborne Polarimetric LIDAR, which utilises a dual wavelength\n(532 nm and 1064\
    \ nm), can differentiate reﬂected spectrum among tree species [124]. Others\n\
    have proposed the Multispectral Canopy LIDAR approach, designed as a prototype\
    \ of\nthe airborne sensor which employs a single tuneable laser to allow the measurement\
    \ of\nNDVI and PRI [125]. A multispectral LIDAR system was developed, based on\
    \ a labora-\ntory prototype, to measure at four wavelengths (556 nm, 670 nm, 700\
    \ nm and 780 nm) to\ndetect nitrogen stresses on rice leaves by modifying the\
    \ optical properties and reﬂected\nspectrum [126]. However, excluding systems\
    \ that include a scanning mechanism, all of\nthe systems have not been obviously\
    \ operated in the ﬁeld, which limits their instant value\nand feasibility for\
    \ in situ calculations of vegetation canopies [126]. The capacity of laser\nreﬂectance\
    \ ratios (in the range of 9–11 µm wavelength) has been illustrated in research\
    \ in\norder to distinguish healthy and stress plants. However, particular biochemical\
    \ properties\nand different types of stress were not distinguished by the relationships\
    \ between these\nratios [127]. Leaf biochemical properties are potentially measured\
    \ by a multispectral laser\nscanner, although the study was carried out with a\
    \ tiny number of samples [128]. The\naccuracy of LIDAR measurements is limited\
    \ to shorter ranges in comparison to imaging\nsensors. Some factors, i.e., remarkable\
    \ ﬂuctuations of laser energy on the focal plane and\nsome nonlinear propagation\
    \ inﬂuences (bleaching and thermal blooming), are caused by at-\nmosphere turbulence,\
    \ which also generates serious attenuations of laser beams propagating\nin the\
    \ atmosphere [129–131].\nThe integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) LIDAR\
    \ technique transmits (at\nleast) two laser pulses with similar wavelengths, as\
    \ demonstrated by NASA’s space-based\nASCENDS mission platform to detect CO2 and\

    \ removes the scattering effects of thin\nclouds and surface scattering and is\
    \ also used in conjunction with the DIAL technique [107].\n4.6. Bistatic LIDAR\

    \ beam at the detector can discern\nthe characteristics of the medium the beam\
    \ passed through [105]. The use of the DIAL\nmeasurement principle takes advantage\
    \ of the wavelength-selective absorption properties\nof molecular species. LIDAR\
    \ can be classiﬁed as monostatic or bistatic based on the use\nof a single aperture\
    \ (monostatic) or separate apertures (bistatic) to transmit and receive.\nMost\
    \ common DIAL systems are monostatic (single-pulsed), but these require complex\
    \ and\nexpensive components to detect the very weak backscatter by aerosol particles\
    \ [132]. As the\nbistatic LIDAR layout reduces cost, size, weight and power compared\
    \ to monostatic LIDAR\none, a bistatic LIDAR system has been proposed as a cost-effective\
    \ solution that can be\nintegrated on small drones for the early detection of\
    \ crop diseases [132,133]. The extension\nof this method to the agricultural sector\
    \ was evaluated to measure CO2 concentrations\nassociated with photosynthesis\
    \ and respiration [105,134].\nSensors 2021, 21, 171\n20 of 39\nThe bistatic LIDAR\
    \ system consists of a transmitter that emits a continuous wave or\npulsed laser\
    \ beam of precisely known power characteristics. The amount of laser energy\n\
    that arrives from the transmitter, which is less than the emitted LIDAR radiation\
    \ because\natmospheric molecular/aerosol concentrations absorb or scatter the\
    \ radiation (as shown in\nFigure 9), is measured by the receiver. Generally, the\
    \ power of a transmitted laser beam is\nattenuated and scattered by the atmosphere\
    \ before it is received by the detector. Rayleigh,\nMie and nonselective scattering\
    \ are the primary wavelength attenuation types. Direct and\nscattered light from\
    \ the sun or other sources also affects the receiver measurement.\nTwo individual\
    \ wavelengths are used in the DIAL technique. They are divided in\nthe “on” and\
    \ “off” absorption lines. The on-absorption line is chosen corresponding to a\n\
    major vibrational band of the targeted molecular species. The off-absorption line\
    \ is selected\nclose to the ﬁrst wavelength but away from the vibrational band\
    \ of the targeted molecular\nspecies so that the difference in cross-sections\
    \ ∆ψ ≜ ψ(λON) − ψ(λOFF) is maximised [135].\nApplying the DIAL principle allows\
    \ these parasite factors to be neglected as they affect\nboth wavelengths used\
    \ by the system. This relationship of attenuation effects of different\naerosol\
    \ and molecular species is typically calculated by Beer–Lambert’s law as given\
    \ by:\nτλ = PRX\nPTX\n= e−γ·z\n(14)\nwhere the transmittance, τλ, is characterized\
    \ by the ratio of received power, PRX, to trans-\nmitted power, PTX. Here, γ is\
    \ the scattering coefﬁcient and z is the path length.\nγ(λ) = αm + βm + αa + βa\n\
    (15)\nThe scattering coefﬁcient is made up of α(λ), a molecular αm and aerosol\
    \ absorption\ncoefﬁcient, αa; and scattering coefﬁcient, β(λ), a molecular, βm\
    \ and aerosol scattering\ncoefﬁcient, βa, at a selected wavelength. The scattering\
    \ caused by visible light (δVIS) can\nbe neglected based on Sabatini et al. [108].\
    \ Molecular scattering (βm), aerosol absorption\n(αa) and aerosol scattering (βa)\
    \ are also ignored due to DIAL measurement principle. The\nmolecular absorption\
    \ (αm) is calculated as followed:\nαm(λ, l) = ∑\nλ2\nZ\nλ1\nσi(λ, P, Θ) · dλ ·\n\

    \ of the laser diode band\nwidth [nm]; σi(λ, P, Θ) = absorption cross-section\

    \ as a\nfunction of wavelength (λ) in nm and the baseline of transmitted beam\
    \ (l) in cm [cm−1].\nThe connection between photodetector energy for the master\
    \ wavelength, PRx(λON), and\nfor the non-master wavelength, PRx(λOFF), in a direct\
    \ path can be calculated as [131]:\nRON/OFF = PRx(λON)\nPRx(λOFF) = τON\nτOFF\n\

    \ 2021, 21, 171\n21 of 39\nThe DIAL measurements mainly focus on molecules vibrational\
    \ absorption associated\nwith laser wavelengths. This signal analysis enables\
    \ an estimate of the CO2 concentra-\ntion. Various DIAL systems can be integrated\
    \ with RS systems due to the emergence of\nlightweight, powerful laser sources\
    \ and systems. Active monostatic conﬁgurations are\nemployed with DIAL conﬁgurations\
    \ for atmosphere sounding that measures not only the\nelastic backscatter produced\
    \ along the external path but also the radiance of the illuminated\nEarth surface\
    \ in the direction of the airborne system. In addition, numerous DIAL systems\n\
    have been improved to measure the concentration/column density of different signiﬁcant\n\
    molecule species based on the development of powerful tuneable lasers [131,136–152].\n\
    LIDAR Laser Beam Propagation in the Atmosphere\nThe performance of LIDAR is underpinned\
    \ by the attenuation of the laser beam\nthrough the atmosphere based on the characteristics\
    \ of the atmosphere and the power and\nwavelength of the beam. At low output powers,\
    \ these propagation behaviours are linear,\nwhile at sufﬁciently high output powers,\
    \ the behaviours are nonlinear [153]. The linear be-\nhaviours include absorption,\
    \ scattering and atmospheric turbulence. The nonlinear effects\ninclude thermal\
    \ blooming, beam trapping, bleaching and atmospheric breakdown [153].\nMolecular\
    \ line absorption is a dominant cause of attenuation dependence on the laser\n\
    wavelength. In this case, the laser encounters one (or several) molecular species\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁed wavelength as it propagates through the air. The energy from\
    \ the laser is then\nattenuated by the molecular species in its path. Knowing\
    \ how the wavelength corresponds\nto a certain molecular species (high-resolution\
    \ data is available in programs such as HI-\nTRAN), the attenuated energy can\
    \ be calculated and used to determine concentrations of\nvarious molecular species\
    \ present in the medium.\nContinuum absorption describes a type of molecular absorption\
    \ as a result of molecu-\nlar clusters. A part of this type of attenuation is\
    \ atmospheric scattering, where a directional\nchange leads to a reduction in\
    \ the beam intensity, especially over large paths. There are\ndifferent types\
    \ of scattering, which are characterized by the physical size of the scatter.\n\
    In small air molecules, attenuation leads to Rayleigh scattering, and for aerosol-sized\n\
    molecules, it leads to Mie scattering. For even larger-scale molecules, the scattering\
    \ can be\ndescribed by diffraction.\nRayleigh scattering often has a much larger\
    \ effect on the propagation than molecular\nabsorption in the VIS and NIR and\
    \ is characterized by the scattering cross section in the\nequation below [153].\n\
    σs =\n\x10\ne2\nm\n\x112\nω4\n6ε2\n0πc4[\n\0ω2\n0 − ω2\x012 + (Γω)2]\n(19)\nwhich\
    \ characterizes the scattering of a single dipole radiator by the electron charge,\
    \ e,\nthe natural frequency, w0, and a damping coefﬁcient. Mie scattering considers\
    \ the case\nwhere the wavelength of the laser beam is scattered by particles of\
    \ similar sizes. The size,\ndielectric constant, shape and absorptivity of the\
    \ particle is accounted for in Mie scattering.\nTo calculate the atmospheric attenuation\
    \ coefﬁcient, it is important that the quantities of all\nthe different sizes\
    \ of aerosol particles are known, which can be difﬁcult. Mie scattering is\ndependent\
    \ on atmospheric conditions such as humidity [153].\n− dI\nI = Kπa2NAdz\nA\n=\
    \ Nσ(a, λ)dz\n(20)\nwhich describes the decrease in beam intensity as a factor\
    \ of the attenuation factor, K,\nand the Mie attenuation coefﬁcient. Propagation\
    \ through the effects of precipitation is\nsigniﬁcantly attenuated and is dependent\
    \ on the speciﬁc atmospheric condition, which the\nauthors of [154] explored.\n\
    The beam is also subjected to propagation through atmospheric turbulence where\n\
    turbulence energy is introduced in large scales. Turbulence is inherently nonhomogeneous\n\
    and non-isotropic, making it difﬁcult to model with dynamic vertical proﬁles dependent\n\

    \ is of research interest for both HSI–LIDAR data fusion in agriculture\napplications.\
    \ The most recent developments have used the laser propagation principles in\n\

    \ of challenging\nenvironments in agriculture applications.\n5. Food Quality Analysis\n\
    5.1. Fluorescence Spectroscopy\nFluorescence spectroscopy was used to estimate\
    \ the ripeness of mandarins [47,159].\nHere, the fruit maturity was indicated\
    \ by ratio of sugar content to acid content through\nﬂuorescence spectroscopy\
    \ analysis of the peel. The ratio of sugar to acid content strongly\ninﬂuenced\
    \ the taste, making it a much more desirable quality to analyse instead of size\n\
    and ﬁrmness [159]. Research has also explored pigmentation and ﬂavonoids in apples\n\
    as an indicator of fruit quality with the utilization of a ﬂuorescence sensor\
    \ [23]. The\nstudy concluded that chlorophyll ﬂuorescence was a good gauge of\
    \ food quality related\nproperties, ﬂavanols, anthocyanins and chlorophyll in\
    \ apples. The use of ﬂuorescence\nspectroscopy was found to help monitor the ripening\
    \ process and, more subjectively, to\nassess the colour quality (determined by\
    \ the anthocyanin measurement) for market viability.\nProximal sensing using ﬂuorescence\
    \ spectroscopy was used in monitoring grape maturity\nby the authors of [160,161].\
    \ Again, the anthocyanin measurement was emphasised for\nmaturity. The advantages\
    \ of the spectroscopy approach was highlighted through a more\ndetailed maturity\
    \ grading of peaches [162].\n5.2. Multispectral Imaging\nBy incorporating MSI\
    \ data obtained from a UAV with a handheld ﬂuorescence spec-\ntrometer, researchers\
    \ were able to assess grape maturity, acidity and sugar content [161].\nA comparison\
    \ of MSI with HSI in analysing the presence of canker disease on grapefruit\n\

    \ MSI\nwas also used in the assessment of apple ﬁrmness [163] and of ﬁrmness and\
    \ maturity in\npeaches [164]. Airborne MSI and thermal imaging was used to assess\
    \ fruit water stress and\nquality of peaches, oranges and nectarines in relation\
    \ to different irrigation regimes based\non the PRI [165].\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 171\n24 of 39\n5.3. Hyperspectral Imaging\nBeyond disease classiﬁcation and\
    \ quantiﬁcation, HSI is increasingly used to assess\nfood quality under constrained\
    \ laboratory conditions (proximal sensing). In comparison to\nMSI, HSI is especially\
    \ useful in identifying the optimal wavelengths [76,99] to correlate\nthe reﬂectance\
    \ change to a biotic change, as demonstrated with the detection of bruise\nspots,\
    \ fungal and faecal contamination of apples by the authors of [99,166–169], as\
    \ well\nas the identiﬁcation of chilling injury in cucumbers [170], fungi in corn\
    \ [171], and bruises\nin strawberries [172] and even in relation to the quality\
    \ of chicken carcasses [77]. To truly\ntake advantage of the HSI capabilities,\
    \ it is essential to examine the available information\nin the spatial dimensions\
    \ and use HSI more extensively in RS canopy-scale applications.\nUsing a combination\
    \ of HSI and LIDAR on a UGV platform, it was found that the maturity\nof mangoes\
    \ could be assessed based on the detection of dry matter in peaches, greatly\n\
    improving in situ measurements [173].\n5.4. LIDAR\nLIDAR sensor applications in\
    \ fruit quality are currently focused on counting and\ntracking the fruit. A unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicle (UAV)-based platform utilizing a multi-\nsensor approach of LIDAR,\
    \ MSI, thermal imaging and navigational sensors was used to\nextract plant health\
    \ data [174] including the plant morphology, canopy volume, NDVI, LAI\nand fruit\
    \ counts. Multi-sensor data fusion approaches allowed researchers to rebuild the\n\
    canopy dimensions and differentiate between the heights of different species of\
    \ trees, a\nkey indicator in plant phenotyping. MSI and LIDAR were also used to\
    \ accurately identify\nplant stressors. Additionally, using a support vector machine\
    \ classiﬁer, the UAV platform\ncould count and track the fruit of the cultivars.\
    \ This helps predict the yield and informs the\ngrowers’ decision-making.\n6.\
    \ Remote Sensor Platforms\nTrue exploitation of RS for precision agriculture invariably\
    \ lies with the application to\na canopy scale to fully appreciate the spatial\
    \ information advantages, especially for large\nagriculture areas. Whereas the\
    \ in situ and RS sensor technologies have been extensively\ntested in heavily\
    \ controlled circumstances, in-ﬁeld airborne applications are increasingly\ndemonstrating\
    \ their usefulness in time saving both in processing and for large areas, spatial\n\
    information and accuracy. One potential drawback is the diminishing resolution\
    \ of MSI,\nHSI and LIDAR sensors as the distance between the sensor and target\
    \ area is increased.\nHowever, this can be actively managed as part of the ﬂight\
    \ mission planning. Gleaning\nthe reﬂectance of the entire canopy also introduces\
    \ factors such as the variation in leaf\nlayers (LAI); the orientation of the\
    \ leaves, called the leaf angle distribution (LAD); weather;\nshadows and non-leaf\
    \ elements like soil [57]. These factors complicate the relationships\nbetween\
    \ spectral reﬂectance and plant health.\nThe prevalence of agricultural robots\
    \ or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) is notable\nin applications such as seed\
    \ identiﬁcation, ﬁeld scouting and harvesting [175–177]. Of\ninterest, in the\
    \ scope of this review, the in-ﬁeld information can be used in health assess-\n\
    ments. UGV platforms need to perform in complex, variable environments while being\n\
    multipurpose and cost-effective to be viable. As a result, UGV platforms typically\
    \ feature\nadvanced sensors, including obstacle avoidance, high-accuracy navigation\
    \ systems and\n3D mapping systems. Computer vision-based or stereo-based cameras\
    \ are commonly\nused for relative positioning and determining the crop row locations,\
    \ building maps and\ncollision avoidance [178], with the trend of advocating the\
    \ use of 3D LIDAR sensors that\nbetter adapt to complex outdoor environments.\
    \ Resolving this localization and navigation\nproblem is central in the effectiveness\
    \ of UGVs [179]. This approach was applied to maize\nplants but was limited by\
    \ the resolution of the sensor, as seen in Figure 11. The approach\nwas able to\
    \ detect the plant and the ground to map their locations using the point cloud\n\
    and use machine learning to identify different plant species.\nSensors 2021, 21,\

    \ at carrying heavy sensors (>50 kg). As a result, the UGV design must have\n\
    a low centre of gravity for platform stability but requires elevated sensors to\

    \ resolutions, thus increasing the number of suitable\napplications for precision\
    \ agriculture. The distinction between platform suitability is\nheavily biased\

    remote sensing platform are summarized in Table 9. Ground and handheld platforms\

    \ platforms such as aerial and satellite in large part due to low operational\n\
    cost, high resolution and mission ﬂexibility. The ﬂexibility of UAV was highlighted\
    \ for\nvineyard diseases that occur in small heterogenous areas, which are observable\
    \ only for\nbrief periods [69]. Detecting plant disease and monitoring food quality\
    \ are of signiﬁcant\ninterest in vineyards. It is noted that, in heterogenous\
    \ environments, in comparison to\nthe UAV platform, imagery resolution using aerial\
    \ and space-based platforms is low and\nprovides an inaccurate representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld [183].\nUAV-based platforms in precision agriculture have been used\
    \ and validated for the\ndetection of water stress [184], biomass estimation [185],\
    \ measurement of the LAI [186]\nand detection and classiﬁcation of plant diseases\
    \ [187]. UAV-based visual sensors have\nshown high levels of accuracy in the disease\
    \ detection of a variety of species [177]. A\nUAV with MSI high-resolution cameras\
    \ was used to characterize the progression and\nseverity of rice diseases through\
    \ NDVI, showing its success as a quick and accurate disease\ndetection and highlighting\
    \ the ﬂexibility of the UAV platform and advances in resolution\nenabling the\
    \ method to monitor and assist in plant breeding [188]. Recently, a UAV-based\n\
    platform was developed utilising multispectral and hyperspectral cameras for plant\
    \ health\ndetection [189]. The results were used in conjunction with UGV platforms\
    \ to estimate yield\nand to isolate infected plants, with the potential for removal\
    \ of weeds and unhealthy plants\nthrough a UGV robotic arm. Measuring the water\
    \ stress is a common application for UAVs\nin precision agriculture, with the\
    \ combined use of thermal, hyperspectral and ﬂuorescence\nsensors being experimentally\
    \ validated and used to improve irrigation practises [190].\nThere are a variety\
    \ of different UAV platforms, including ﬁxed wing, single rotor, multirotor\n\
    and balloon, offering different capabilities and suitability to precision agriculture.\
    \ There are\nadvantages and disadvantages of each of the distinct UAV platforms\
    \ in the implementation\nof MSI, HSI, thermal sensors and other active sensors\
    \ [18]. Largely, the study concluded\nthat integrating sensors to the UAV is needed\
    \ to overcome weight, navigation and vibration\nconsiderations.\nPlant disease\
    \ detection techniques are driven by governing body regulations such as\nthe European\
    \ and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) to avoid crop yield\n\
    losses. An example of this work demonstrates how MSI data from a UAV platform\
    \ can be\ncombined with proximal sensors to assess fruit quality [161]. The high\
    \ spatial resolution of\nUAV imagery in the range of 1–10 cm accuracy [183,191],\
    \ as well as the low operational\ncost and ﬂexibility of the platform, have led\
    \ to use in small farm applications [192]. A\nstudy also compared UAV, aerial\
    \ and space-based platforms, using MSI to determine the\nNDVI of two Italian vineyards\
    \ [183]. The study characterised the comparative RS platforms\nperformance, as\
    \ shown in Tables 9 and 10. The UAV platform obviously suffered from\nrange, endurance\
    \ and payload performance in comparison to the others. However, the\nstudy extolled\
    \ the ﬂexibility, resistance to cloud cover, high resolution and precision of\n\
    the UAV platform, particularly in relation to fragmented farm areas. The cost\
    \ analysis\nperformed by the same study found that UAVs were cost-effective in\
    \ image acquisition for\nareas smaller than 5 hectares [183].\nUGV and UAV Cooperative\

    \ techniques used in plant health monitoring sensors.\nFuture work in data analytic\

    \ clearly trends toward a multiple sensor\ndata fusion approach in the health\
    \ monitoring of crops. The use of appropriate techniques\nto collate the data\
    \ from different sensors in order to improve the classiﬁcation accuracies is\n\
    of signiﬁcant interest. As observed in the section concerning HSI–LIDAR (3D scanner)\
    \ data\nfusion, the data collected does not really overlap. The HSI system measures\
    \ the reﬂectance,\nwhich is used to discern information about the photosynthetic\
    \ efﬁciency, and the LIDAR\n3D scanner usually measures the heights of the crop\
    \ to measure biomass. The combination\nof these results provides more information.\
    \ However, both HSI and bistatic LIDAR are a\nmeasure of photosynthetic efﬁciency,\
    \ and with their combination, there is opportunity to\nshare information between\
    \ the sensors to better improve each technique.\nThe application of meta-reasoning\
    \ to the data analysis techniques is an emerging\ntechnique designed to measure\
    \ the efﬁciency of the data analysis. Meta-reasoning examines\nand controls the\
    \ resources and time that the data analysis takes for each task. This optimizes\n\
    the decision-making and quality of the result.\n7.1. Partial Least Squares Regression\n\
    Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) uses a linear multivariate model to relate\
    \ and\nmodel the structure of two data matrices [196]. PLSR accuracy increases\
    \ with the number of\nobservations and variables, even when the data is noisy,\
    \ collinear or incomplete. In this way,\nPLSR overcomes the problem of overﬁtting\
    \ encountered with increasing observations [197].\nThe spectral PLSR method was\
    \ shown to quickly and accurately predict the photosynthetic\ncapacity. However,\
    \ this accuracy is susceptible to variation in the genotypes of a single\nspecies\
    \ of crop [198]. PLSR was used to determine the nitrogen and phosphorus content\n\
    in barley plants using HSI of the canopy, with an accuracy of 81% for phosphorus,\
    \ 74%\nfor nitrogen and 75% for predicting the growth stage [98]. However, in\
    \ cucumber leaves,\nthe phosphorus content was not able to be accurately determined\
    \ by PLSR methods with\nan in situ spectroradiometer due to a high nonlinearity\
    \ correlation, resulting in the use of\nSVM and ANN [55]. In determining the plant\
    \ biochemical properties, it was found that\nPLSR was an effective methodology\
    \ but was less accurate than SVR. However, SVR was\nless accurate when the data\
    \ became highly collinear [199].\n7.2. Principal Component Analysis\nPCA is used\
    \ as predictive modelling tool in correlating large sets of data. PCA reduces\n\
    the dimensionality of the data and minimizes data loss by the creation of uncorrelated\n\
    variables the maximize variance [200]. The PCA transforms the current set of data\
    \ to a new\ncoordinate system. Then, a covariance matrix is developed, which,\
    \ in turn, determines the\neigenvectors and eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are\
    \ then used to classify the data.\nPCA is a common data analysis method in plant\
    \ disease detection. The PCA method\nwas used in the detection of diseases in\
    \ the Catharanthus roseus leaves, which highlighted\nthe beneﬁts of PCA as an\
    \ unsupervised clustering method that does not require a priori\ndata set knowledge\
    \ [52]. Research conducted on greenhouse pepper plant diseases using\nMSI found\
    \ that PCA was not as effective in binary plant health detection and required\
    \ im-\nplementation of a method using a priori knowledge [62]. This discrepancy\
    \ in performance\nwas blamed on the small colour difference between healthy and\
    \ diseased leaves, since PCA\nis reliant on the variance of the data.\n7.3. Self-Organizing\
    \ Maps\nA Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) that\
    \ takes high\ndimensional data and transforms it into a 2D map that places similar\
    \ data points closer\ntogether [201]. As in most ANN, the SOM operates in a training\
    \ mode dependent on\ntraining sample data sets and a mapping mode that converts\
    \ new inputs into the visible\nmap space. The quality of the training data set\
    \ in similarity to the expected types of data\ndetermines the efﬁcacy of SOM.\
    \ The SOM is a rectangular grid which uses an iterative\nprocess to move the nodes\
    \ of the grid toward the data where the grid moves toward the\nSensors 2021, 21,\

    \ the classiﬁcation and groupings, the algorithm training is complete. This is\
    \ a\nnonparametric algorithm, where the closeness to a number of known K points\
    \ and voting\nprocess are used to classify the new data. Euclidean distance function\
    \ is a common method\nto evaluate the closeness to the nearest points\nd =\nv\n\
    u\nu\nt\nk\n∑\ni=1\n(xi − yi)2\n(28)\nThe KNN is simple and easy to implement.\
    \ However, the method becomes inefﬁcient\nwhen analysing large amounts of data.\n\
    7.7. Regions of Interest\nRegions of interest (ROI) segmentation is used to deﬁne\
    \ the borders or boundaries\nof an object and to describe an area in a compartmentalized\
    \ way. ROI segmentation is\nessential for applying machine learning techniques\
    \ for plant disease detection. In one study,\nresearchers investigated the ROI\
    \ applications based on colour variance between healthy\nand diseased parts of\
    \ the plants [208]. The study found that the use of ROI techniques\ncould achieve\
    \ early disease detection at a rate of 91% and overcome the challenges of\nindistinct\
    \ diseases boundaries. The use of ROI in the disease detection process, after\
    \ image\nacquisition and some pre-processing, involves segmenting the images by\
    \ means of ROI,\nwhich then leads to feature extraction and classiﬁcation via\
    \ means of SVM, as shown in\nFigure 5 [209]. This technique uses boundary and\
    \ spot detection algorithms to locate an\ninfected area, usually through K-Means\
    \ clustering. From the clusters, the ROI are selected.\n8. Conclusions\nThis review\
    \ examined current and likely future electro-optical remote sensing applica-\n\
    tions for precision agriculture, with a focus on novel methods for early detection\
    \ of plant\ndiseases and the increasing adoption of spectral analysis in food\
    \ quality assessment. The\nway in which plant diseases spread and cause subsequent\
    \ deterioration of the plant deter-\nmines the efﬁcacy of each of the detection\
    \ techniques discussed. For in situ applications,\nthe sensitivity of thermography\
    \ and ﬂuorescence to ambient light reduces the accuracy\nand practicality of these\
    \ techniques. Techniques reliant on spectral information must\nundergo a complex\
    \ analysis to eliminate erroneous data due to the complex interactions\nwith the\
    \ environment. In consideration of the discussed techniques and their advantages\n\
    and disadvantages, the evidence clearly points to a data fusion approach that\
    \ combines\nmultiple spectral techniques to improve the classiﬁcation accuracy\
    \ and to reduce the effects\nof external/environmental factors impacting the quality\
    \ of data collected. Whereas the\nnarrow band approach of HSI allows greater ﬂexibility\
    \ in distinguishing spectral areas of\ninterest, the HSI sensor is particularly\
    \ susceptible to erroneous data due to data overlap and\nis a costly/complex solution.\
    \ The MSI system, in contrast, requires greater understanding\nof the spectral\
    \ bands of interest before implementation. The added value of emerging\nLIDA-based\
    \ systems is in their greater ﬂexibility in capturing data as LIDAR systems\n\
    are not as limited by atmospheric conditions, changes in light, viewing angle\
    \ or canopy\nSensors 2021, 21, 171\n31 of 39\nstructure. The implementation of\
    \ a low-cost, lightweight bistatic LIDAR system on a RS\nplatform should be considered\
    \ for future research, especially in the context of HSI-LIDAR\ndata fusion. LIDAR\
    \ is noted for its wide-ranging applications across all sensor platforms\nand,\
    \ in combination with hyperspectral imaging, would likely be the most robust of\
    \ the\nremote sensors. Driven by market demands, future work should be aimed toward\
    \ food\nquality analysis using various combinations of remote sensors. The greatest\
    \ hinderance for\nRS techniques is their indirect nature in correlating spectral\
    \ or molecular data to a deﬁnitive\ndiagnosis. The adoption of AI techniques for\
    \ the spatially and temporally distributed big\ndata acquired by RS is one of\
    \ the biggest impacting factors on the accuracy of plant disease\ndiagnosis. Comprehensive\
    \ comparative studies of AI-based data fusion techniques in the\nprecision agriculture\
    \ context are needed to determine the best combination of sensors,\nplatforms\
    \ and crops, especially in the multi-sensor approach. Among the various sensor\n\
    platforms, UAVs clearly ﬁll a gap between the limitations of handheld and rover-carried\n\
    sensors in large areas and of high-altitude and satellite sensor resolutions.\
    \ The overall\naccuracy and resolution of UAV based sensors in precision agriculture\
    \ should be further\ninvestigated, emphasising the disparities between leaf level\
    \ and canopy level data acquisi-\ntion. A multi-sensor approach, taking advantage\
    \ of both traditional techniques and the\nemerging beneﬁts of LIDAR-based in-ﬁeld\
    \ CO2 absorption measurements, is an area that\nrequires further research to be\
    \ able to improve early plant disease detection, soil analysis,\nphenotyping and\
    \ fruit quality analysis. These multi-sensor systems will adopt AI-based\ndata\
    \ fusion algorithms to efﬁciently and accurately process the variety of spatially\
    \ and\ntemporally distributed data acquired in the ﬁeld.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract: Predicting crop yields is one of the most challenging tasks in agriculture.
    It plays an essential

    role in decision making at global, regional, and ﬁeld levels. Soil, meteorological,
    environmental,

    and crop parameters are used to predict crop yield. A wide variety of decision
    support models are

    used to extract signiﬁcant crop features for prediction. In precision agriculture,
    monitoring (sensing

    technologies), management information systems, variable rate technologies, and
    responses to inter-

    and intravariability in cropping systems are all important. The beneﬁts of precision
    agriculture

    involve increasing crop yield and crop quality, while reducing the environmental
    impact. Simulations

    of crop yield help to understand the cumulative effects of water and nutrient
    deﬁciencies, pests,

    diseases, and other ﬁeld conditions during the growing season. Farm and in situ
    observations

    (Internet of Things databases from sensors) together with existing databases provide
    the opportunity

    to both predict yields using “simpler” statistical methods or decision support
    systems that are already

    used as an extension, and also enable the potential use of artiﬁcial intelligence.
    In contrast, big

    data databases created using precision management tools and data collection capabilities
    are able

    to handle many parameters indeﬁnitely in time and space, i.e., they can be used
    for the analysis of

    meteorology, technology, and soils, including characterizing different plant species.

    Keywords: crop models; artiﬁcial intelligence; big data; IoT; yield inﬂuencing
    variables; yield

    forecasting; data fusion

    1. Introduction

    The concept of this Special Issue is based on the practice and scientiﬁc results
    of

    crop yield prediction in precision farming. The deﬁnition of precision farming
    according

    to the ISPA (International Society for Precision Agriculture) is the following:
    “Precision

    Agriculture is a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyses temporal,
    spatial

    and individual data and combines it with other information to support management
    deci-

    sions according to estimated variability for improved resource use efﬁciency,
    productivity,

    quality, proﬁtability and sustainability of agricultural production” [1]. Precision
    agriculture

    needs to have more efﬁcient and clearer results related to the topic of yield
    prediction. This

    Special Issue published eight research papers and one review article. This Special
    Issue’s

    aim was to discuss various yield prediction methods, the adaptation of big data,
    and the

    use of interseason databases from different platforms in crop yield forecasting.
    Studies

    focused on applications regarding prediction methods, data fusion, and the adaptation
    of

    big data were submitted.

    2. Papers in the Special Issue

    The review paper of this issue aims [2] to identify the alternatives to traditional

    estimation methods in vineyard forecasting. Articles were reviewed using PRISMA
    as

    a guideline based on the research topic, methodology, data requirements, and practical

    applications. Relevant scientiﬁc works already published on the topic were searched
    for

    in the Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, IEEE, MDPI, and PubMed databases.
    The

    vineyard yield estimations mainly depend on the computer visions, image processing

    2 of 4

    algorithms, data-driven models based on vegetation indices, and pollen data and
    on

    relating climate, soil, vegetation, and crop management variables that can support
    dynamic

    crop simulation modelling. The methods have advantages and shortcomings, but they

    still lack real application in a commercial production. The authors’ opinion is
    that the

    methods must be as simple as possible and use as little data as possible, preferably
    with

    data the producers can access quickly, easily, and cheaply. The synergistic use
    of proximal

    and remote sensing with artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) can be one of the best alternatives
    to

    estimating a vineyard’s yield. Other options for vineyard yield estimations are
    laser, radar,

    radio frequency, and ultrasonic data. Despite these methods, the most critical
    parameters

    are the spatial variability and heterogeneity in decision making.

    The second paper [3] in the Special Issue shows different sensors that can be
    merged

    with other systems to improve fusion methods, such as optical, multispectral,
    hyperspectral,

    thermal infrared, light detections, and radar. The study highlights different
    platforms

    that can be used as a source of the fusion of technologies, e.g., robots, satellites,
    and

    aerial monitoring systems. The study’s aim was to present the data fusion techniques

    for site-speciﬁc crop parameter monitoring, such as nitrogen, leaf area index,
    biomass,

    chlorophlyll content. . . etc. This study reviewed 250 research articles which
    explored the

    spatio-temporal data fusion on combining data with ﬁne spatial resolution. Nowadays,
    the

    fusion of sensor technologies efﬁciently classiﬁes the crop type, the phenological
    status,

    and parameters for site-speciﬁc crop monitoring. The authors concluded that the
    major

    constraint of data fusion is the multimodality of data from different types of
    sensors,

    systems, noise, poor resolution, or ﬂaws. However, the assessment of the advanced
    models

    for crops is still in the development stages.

    A linear model has been created based on multiple linear regression analysis (MLR),

    and a non-linear model has been built using artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) to
    predict the

    potato yield of very early varieties [4]. Phytophenological and meteorological
    data were

    used for modelling. The authors used some forecast error metrics such as global
    relative

    approximation (RAE), root mean square error (RMS), mean absolute error (MAE),
    and

    mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in the validation stage. The MAPE value
    for the

    neural model, amounting to 7.2%, proved the high prediction quality in the implementation

    of forecasts. However, the authors highlighted the inﬂuence of the independent
    variables,

    and a greater number of experiments should be carefully considered and taken into
    account

    to increase the dataset. For building models, it is recommended to adapt the full
    database

    of experiments.

    The objective of the study [5] was to assess the effect NP fertilizer placement
    depth,

    in conjunction with the year, on the number of maize plants after emergence using
    the

    additive main effects and a multiplicative interaction model. The number of plants
    after

    emergence per unit area decreased along with the increase in NP fertilizer placement
    depth

    in each of the examined years. The results obtained from the additive main effects
    and

    multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analyses are very useful in terms of the development

    and recommendation of the most optimal NP (and starter) fertilizer placement depths
    con-

    cerning the productivity in maize’s growing season. These agrotechnological management

    practices could be regularly employed in the future to delineate predictive, more
    rigorous

    recommendation strategies.

    Moreover, the AMMI method was used to identify the stability of maize hybrids
    and

    optimized site-speciﬁc precision nutrient strategies [6]. The results of the ANOVA
    showed

    that genotype, year, and fertilizer levels had various effects on grain yield,
    oil, protein,

    and starch content. FAO340 had the maximum grain yield on different fertilizers
    (NPK

    and N), and FAO350 had the maximum protein content. To gain the best performance
    and

    maximum yield of maize in terms of protein and oil content, FAO350 is recommended
    for

    protein and FAO340 for oil content. The parameters of grain yield, oil content,
    protein

    content, and starch content affected by NPK fertilizer provide the stability of
    grain yield

    parameters. Depending on the given fertilizer application, farmers can use the
    various

    hybrids to obtain a stable yield.

    The sixth paper developed a new Fresh Fruit Bunch Index (FFBI) model [7] based
    on

    the monthly oil palm fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yield data, which correlates directly
    with the

    Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), to model the impact of pas El Nino events in Malaysia
    in terms

    of production and economic losses. The FFBI derived monthly FFB yields from 1986
    to

    2021, in the same way the ONI is obtained from monthly sea surface temperature.
    The

    FFBI showed signiﬁcantly higher correlation with ONI compared to FFB yields (adjusted

    R-squared of 0.93 and 0.83), while the FFBI model had a smaller error based on
    residual

    analysis. The developed method provides an improved model to measure the impact
    of El

    Nino events in the oil palm industry.

    One of the most important issues in crop yield predictions is temporal and spatial

    yield variation at the within-ﬁeld scale. The seventh paper in this SI shows 48
    wheat yield

    monitor maps from 23 ﬁelds to build linear-mixed models for predicting yield,
    which were

    tested using leave-one-ﬁeld-out cross-validation [8]. The authors selected many
    vegetation

    indices in this work, but they concluded that there were only marginal differences
    in the

    performance of the different indices tested. This paper clearly describes that
    the predictions

    using longer-term average yields are generally more accurate than predictions
    of yield for

    single years. Data from the peak stage were given the best performance. Combining
    data

    from the same vegetation index but from multiple stages did not improve the predictions.

    Most indices showed good performance of the spatial pattern of wheat yield, but
    only

    modest accuracy in terms of predictions of actual yield within ﬁeld.

    The objective of the eighth paper was to access the ability of the Ceres-Maize
    model

    to predict yields in long-term experiments at different nitrogen rates [9]. The
    model was

    calibrated with data from a long-term experiment ﬁeld trial. The range of the
    predicted

    data of maize yield was between 6671 and 13,136 kg ha−1. In several cases, the
    DSSAT-

    CERES Maize model accurately predicted yields, but it was sensitive to seasonal
    effects

    and estimated yields inaccurately. The simulated results of the model followed
    the increase

    in yields with increasing nitrogen dose.

    The ﬁnal published paper [10] presents a pumpkin yield estimation method using

    images acquired by a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). The algorithm is fully automated

    and robust. This work consists of an orthomosaic generation, a colour model collection

    using a random subset of the data, coluor segmentation, and counting of pumpkin
    blobs,

    together with assessing the number of plants. The lowest F1 score (0.970) for
    the validation

    process shows the high efﬁciency and precision of the method. Moreover, the UAV
    images

    can be used for yield estimations of pumpkin, but it requires choosing the optimal
    growth

    stage(s) to be able to count the plants reliably.

    3. Conclusions

    The articles presented in this Special Issue cover a wide range of yield prediction

    methodology of various crops in precision agriculture. The new, innovative perspective
    of

    the crop yield prediction is based on artiﬁcial intelligence with big data [11],
    which can help

    to model the spatial distribution of site-speciﬁc yields and to explore the inﬂuencing
    factors

    at different seasonal impacts. Future developments, such as of intelligent and
    autonomous

    systems, are a major necessity for the expansion of technology and data fusion
    to provide

    precise data and more accurate yield estimation over the forecasted years. Precision
    farming,

    which takes into account ﬁne spatial and temporal resolution management units,
    requires

    accurate and reliable crop yield models [9]. We can conclude that the predictions
    over

    multiple years are valuable for spatial patterns in yield [8]; however, there
    is a limited

    number of tools to help make more accurate management decisions.

    \ data analytics, robots, remote sensing,\nthe Internet of Things, decision support\
    \ systems and artiﬁcial intelligence have transformed the\nagricultural sector.\
    \ In the greenhouse sector, these technologies help farmers increase their proﬁts\n\
    and crop yields while minimizing the production costs, produce in a more environmentally\
    \ friendly\nway and mitigate the risks caused by climate change. In greenhouse\
    \ farming, especially in the\nMediterranean region, a lack of knowledge and qualiﬁed\

    \ little\nopportunity for speciﬁc training on greenhouse production in cutting-edge\
    \ technologies. To gain\ninsight into this problem, questionnaires for greenhouse\
    \ farmers and intermediaries were developed\nin multiple choice format and ﬁlled\
    \ in by the stakeholders. A statistical analysis was performed, and\nthe results\

    who run small farms, in most cases, have a lack of knowledge, especially on how\
    \ to manage climate\ncontrol systems or fertigation systems. The majority of farmers\
    \ were elderly with a low level of\neducation, which makes it difﬁcult to be aware\
    \ of the training issues, due to distrust and a lack\nof innovation culture. Therefore,\
    \ their strategy was usually survival with cost control. However,\nyoung graduates\

    1. Introduction\nThe current human population growth trend, combined with evolving\
    \ consumption\nhabits, rising demand and food waste, is putting an unprecedented\
    \ strain on agricultural\nsystems and natural resources. As a result, one of the\
    \ biggest problems that humanity will\nface in the 21st Century is food supply\
    \ [1–3]. In Greece, greenhouse crops are one of the\nmost dynamic primary production\
    \ sectors, and at the same time, this is a cultivation system\nto which most precision\
    \ farming technologies and techniques can be directly applied.\nToday, Greece\
    \ has about 61,000 acres of greenhouses, while climate change in dif-\nferent\
    \ parts of the country is the factor that determines their geographical distribution\n\
    (Figure 1). Almost half (45%) of the greenhouse areas are found in Crete: in Ierapetra,\n\
    about 15,500 acres (25% of the whole country) and 11,100 acres in the wider area\
    \ of Messara\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10536. https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910536\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10536\n\
    2 of 22\nand the rest of Crete. Respectively, there are 9000 acres in the Peloponnese\
    \ and 26,000 acres\nscattered throughout Greece with special reference to Attica\
    \ and Central Macedonia [4].\nFigure 1. Regional distribution of greenhouses in\
    \ Greece in 2018 [5].\nOf the total number of installed greenhouse units in Greece,\
    \ 30% are modern and ca-\npable of producing safe high-quality products while\
    \ ensuring high yields by using modern\ntechnologies and automating a large part\
    \ of their production process. The main reasons for\nthe increase of automation\
    \ in greenhouses are the ever-increasing production size (creation\nof larger\
    \ units), increased labour costs (which is still 30–35% of the total production\
    \ costs),\nthe lack of specialised personnel, the unhealthy conditions in which\
    \ workers often work,\nthe need for specialisation in the production of agricultural\
    \ products, the need to produce\nsafe and quality products, as well as saving\
    \ money and time (verticalisation of work).\nThe slow adaptation to modern ways\
    \ of practising agriculture is largely due to the\nunsatisfactory integration\
    \ of new techniques and technologies in the production process [6].\nThe introduction\
    \ of systems based on the measurement and management of information\ncan contribute\
    \ to the optimal management of crops [7]. The modern model of agricultural\nproduction\
    \ no longer requires maximisation of production, but maximization of net proﬁt,\n\
    i.e., rational management of all inputs and outputs of the system [8]. To this\
    \ end, the concept\nof precision farming or smart farming, based on the use of\
    \ Information and Communication\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10536\n3 of 22\nTechnologies\
    \ (ICTs) for the precise control of all inputs and accurate output planning in\
    \ the\nfarming system, has been developed and has received a signiﬁcant global\
    \ response [9].\nIn the context of the general economic crisis, the Greek agricultural\
    \ sector has suffered\na signiﬁcant blow in terms of reduced demand for products\
    \ and limited necessary resources\n(water, soil and energy) for its development.\
    \ At the same time, it suffers strongly from\nthe consequences of market instability,\
    \ as well as the effects of climate change, which\nexacerbates the frequency and\
    \ severity of extreme weather events, resulting in reduced\ncrop yields, lost\
    \ production and a further decline in agriculture income [10–12].\nIn particular,\
    \ the term precision agriculture refers to an area where sensor technology\nbrings\
    \ new capabilities that solve old problems. According to a recent report by the\
    \ Food\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), between 2005\
    \ and 2015, natural\ndisasters cost USD96 billion in damage to agricultural and\
    \ livestock production. The FAO\nargues that combining agriculture with Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) technologies is essential,\nas global food production must increase\
    \ by 70% by 2050 to feed 9.6 billion people [13].\nThe goals of precision agriculture\
    \ are to increase production per area while reducing the\nresources used (man-hours,\
    \ water, energy, pesticides and fertilisers) [14].\nAgriculture remains a place\
    \ where IoT applications have not yet been widely used,\nwith an estimated global\
    \ turnover at EUR 12.7 billion for 2019 and EUR 20.9 billion for\n2024 [15].\n\
    Catastrophic weather, disease and pests adversely affect agricultural production\
    \ and\ncause huge economic losses annually. Unfortunately, traditional treatments\
    \ incur additional\ncosts for growers and are largely ineffective. However, in\
    \ precision agriculture, the integra-\ntion of sensor–controller technologies\
    \ and IoT applications can lead to a signiﬁcant increase\nin efﬁciency. Combining\
    \ the collection of primary data via wireless sensor networks\nand their processing\
    \ by Decision Support Systems (DSSs) that monitor the microclimate\nconditions\
    \ of the crop can reduce the resources consumed, predict the spread of pests\n\
    and contribute to disease prevention and optimised production. The result is improved\n\
    management, better food quality and lower costs. Investing in technology solutions\
    \ and\nprecision agriculture leads to the modernisation of time-consuming and\
    \ tedious processes\nand is an extremely attractive option as it can offer better\
    \ living conditions and reduced\nworkload, thus attracting new generations of\
    \ farmers and scientists in rural areas [16,17].\nThe current technology used\
    \ in greenhouses for sustainable production are mainly\nclosed hydroponics systems\
    \ (substrates), irrigation control systems (fertigation) and cli-\nmate control\
    \ systems (shading screen, natural and forced ventilation, fan and pad systems,\n\
    heating systems and fog systems). The adoption of smart farming technologies by\
    \ green-\nhouse farmers is low. Their acceptance is scarce due to distrust and\
    \ a lack of innovation\nculture [18]. In some cases, they use remote control management\
    \ systems, but this is\nquite rare.\nThe region of research is the area included\
    \ within the administrative boundaries of the\nRegional Units of Greece, mostly\
    \ Crete, the Peloponnese and Attica, where the greenhouses\nare concentrated.\
    \ This work aims to reﬂect the current level of education of farmers and\nintermediaries\
    \ in intelligent greenhouse technologies, as well as their educational needs\n\
    and how training will contribute to the adoption of intelligent agriculture techniques\
    \ in\nGreece and other European countries [19,20].\nThe present paper is organised\
    \ as follows. Section 2 describes the sampling, collection\nand processing of\
    \ the raw data. Section 3 presents the results of the farmers’ and intermedi-\n\
    aries’ questionnaires and the statistical analysis. Finally, Section 4 presents\
    \ the conclusions\nof the research.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Sampling\n\
    The University of Patras and GeoTechnical Chamber of Greece (GeoTEE) designed\n\
    two open and closed types of questionnaires, addressed to farmers and intermediaries\n\
    (agriculturalists, farming schools and associations, cooperatives, VET organisations,\
    \ cham-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10536\n4 of 22\nbers of commerce and local governments\
    \ and development agencies) for greenhouses\nthroughout Greece [21,22].\nThe sampling\
    \ method was stratiﬁed with a division of the farmers’ cooperatives of\nGreece\
    \ per region and then sorted by cluster category. The sample number was determined\n\
    per cluster [23] in combination with the breakdown of cooperative units by regional\
    \ unit\nfollowing Bayesian statistical methods [24]. The survey was carried out\
    \ in the physical\npresence of the researcher at the site of the investigation.\n\
    2.2. Data Collection and Processing\nThe research was conducted using two questionnaires\
    \ and covering all relevant pa-\nrameters of training for greenhouse farmers.\
    \ The key stakeholders reached within their\ndomain included staff, members, trainers,\
    \ farmers, innovative initiatives, farming schools,\nVET organisations, etc.,\
    \ so that they captured the main issues of training in each sector.\nFor the research,\
    \ 47 questionnaires from farmers and 43 from intermediaries were\ncollected. The\
    \ distribution was from all over Greece, but mainly from areas with a high\nconcentration\
    \ of greenhouses (Crete, the Peloponnese and Attiki). The questionnaires were\n\
    disseminated using Google Forms and collected using Google Spreadsheets. The data\
    \ were\ngathered and grouped per question.\nThe data collected included information\
    \ on the farm, farmer and intermediary charac-\nteristics, institutional, production\
    \ and market-related factors. Socioeconomic and demo-\ngraphic variables of the\
    \ respondents included the farm household head’s gender, level of\neducation,\
    \ marital status, household size, occupation, access to climate information and\n\
    its source, access to credit and income, among others. The full lists of the parameters\
    \ are\ngiven in Tables 1 and 2.\nThe data were summarized into descriptive statistics\
    \ to provide users with the frequen-\ncies of each variable in the dataset. To\
    \ further help the readers understand for the collected\ndata, suitable measures\
    \ of central tendency were performed. These measures provide a\nnumerical index\
    \ of the average score in the distribution [25]. In addition to these measures,\n\
    the dispersion of the data was considered in order to present how uniformly respondents\n\
    answered the questions [26]. These measures provided the variability or the amount\
    \ of\nchange in the data with the most common measure to be the standard deviation,\
    \ which\ndetermines whether a particular data value is close to or far from the\
    \ mean. The descriptive\nstatistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS [27],\
    \ and the results are presented in\nTables 3 and 4 [28,29].\nThe three top concerns\
    \ for greenhouse farming were: knowledge, technology and type\nof crop. Use of\
    \ energy, fertigation, costs and selling prices were also common concerns.\nTo\
    \ summarize the survey’s ﬁndings, greenhouse cultivation lacks updated techno-\n\
    logical knowledge due to time, skills and attitude constraints. There is an awareness\
    \ of\navailable solutions, but not of their relevancy and usefulness in their\
    \ cases. Larger farm\nunits and younger farmers are more prone to uptake innovation,\
    \ and this process can be\naccelerated for all farmers using training and consulting\
    \ services.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10536\n5 of 22\nTable 1. Analysis of the\

    The research conducted a descriptive analysis for innovative training on greenhouses\n\
    in Greece. This was conducted using two questionnaires and covering all relevant\
    \ parame-\nters of training for greenhouse farmers so that they captured the main\
    \ issues of training\nin this sector. Training offered should be related to sustainable\
    \ agriculture (reduction\nof consumption and pollutants and increased resilience\
    \ of exploitation) and precision\nagriculture [30].\nThe main problem is that\
    \ many of the farmers were old and had a low level of\neducation, which made it\
    \ more difﬁcult to be aware of training opportunities, and they\npresented scarce\
    \ acceptance of such issues due to distrust and a lack of innovation culture.\n\
    The farmers had high uncertainty regarding the training process due to insufﬁcient\
    \ reliable\ninformation and little data on the market assuming great production\
    \ risk. Therefore, their\nstrategy was usually survival with important cost control.\
    \ Recently, young graduates have\nbeen returning to agriculture, and they are\
    \ open to training activities and innovation.\nAll the ﬁgures that follow are\
    \ based on the the raw data processing.\n3.1. Farmers\nThe main farmer age groups\
    \ were 41–54 and below 40 (Figure 2) [31]. In addition,\nthe farmers mainly had\
    \ a secondary and tertiary level of education (Figure 3). It is worth\nmentioning\
    \ that younger farmers were more educated than older farmers, and they were\n\
    mainly agriculturalists [32].\nThe small and medium-to-small size of farmlands\
    \ in Greece was an important ﬁnding\n(Figure 4). The main cultivation in Greek\
    \ greenhouses is vegetables with minor cultivations\nbeing ornamentals (ﬂower\
    \ crops) and strawberries (Figure 5). In addition, the main\ncriterion by which\
    \ farmers decided on the type of crop they would grow the next season in\nthe\
    \ greenhouse corresponded to a commercial agreement that had been concluded or\
    \ the\nneeds of the market. A secondary criterion was the judgement of the farmer\
    \ or the usual\ncultivation in the wider area (Figure 6).\nFigure 2. Farmer age\
    \ groups.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10536\n12 of 22\nFigure 3. Farmer level of\
    \ education.\nFigure 4. Farmer exploitable area in ha.\nFigure 5. Main cultivation.\n\
    Multispan greenhouses are the most common type in Greece (Figure 7). Most farmers\n\
    classiﬁed their greenhouses into average categories in terms of technological\
    \ development\n(Figure 8). The distribution of the product is mainly done directly\
    \ or through a group of\nproducers or a cooperative (Figure 9).\nSustainability\

    \ mostly interested in being trained in irrigation–fertigation–biostimulant\n\
    indigenous Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs)–nutrient analysis and automation/\n\
    greenhouse digitalization (Figure 10). Traditional face-to-face learning was the\
    \ preferred\nform of training, followed by knowledge sharing mechanisms and virtual/blended\
    \ learning\n(Figure 11).\nFigure 10. Level of interest in training in thematic\

    \ media for\na learning platform were live teachers/seminars and presentations.\
    \ Farmers believed\nthat traditional face-to-face learning and knowledge sharing\
    \ mechanisms were the most\nefﬁcient training methods (Figure 13).\nFigure 12.\

    3.2. Intermediaries\nThe intermediaries believed that farmers were moderately\
    \ trained to use the tech-\nnology already installed in their greenhouses (Figure\
    \ 14). In addition, the intermediaries\nbelieved that cutting-edge technologies\
    \ had been adopted moderately by the farmers\n(Figure 15).\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 10536\n16 of 22\nFigure 14. Level of farmers’ technology training.\nFigure\
    \ 15. Cutting-edge technologies’ adoption.\nIntermediaries believed that irrigation/fertigation\
    \ systems and greenhouse microcli-\nmate recording and control systems were the\
    \ greenhouse crop technologies that should be\nimmediately adopted by farmers\
    \ to improve their income (Figure 16). It was apparent that\nintegrated crop management\
    \ systems were the preferred greenhouse system suggested to\nthe producers (Figure\
    \ 17) [33].\nFigure 16. Technologies for immediate adoption.\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 10536\n17 of 22\nFigure 17. Suggested greenhouse systems.\nThe intermediaries\
    \ estimated that the contribution to the production of competitive\nproducts in\
    \ domestic and international markets, increasing agricultural income and im-\n\
    proving the quality of life of farmers were the most expected effects of greenhouse\
    \ crops\n(Figure 18). In addition, they indicated that greenhouse crops would\
    \ have a greater impact\non the country’s economy if farmers had a better level\
    \ of knowledge, and information\nand modernization of greenhouses and the use\
    \ of state-of-the-art technologies acted as\nincentives for young entrepreneurs\
    \ (Figure 19).\nFigure 18. Expected effects of greenhouse cultivations.\nFigure\
    \ 19. Level of impact of greenhouse cultivations on the country’s economy.\nThe\
    \ intermediaries suggested that the main criteria by which farmers decided on\
    \ the type\nof crop they would grow in their greenhouse were crops that corresponded\
    \ to a commercial\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10536\n18 of 22\nagreement that had\
    \ been concluded and the market demand due to environmental conditions\n(Figure\
    \ 20). They also stated that decisions with the sole aim of surviving without\
    \ a long-term\nplan and inability to borrow from financial institutions were the\
    \ main obstacles to the adoption\nof cutting-edge technologies by greenhouse farmers\
    \ (Figure 21).\nFigure 20. Crop selection criteria.\nFigure 21. Cutting-edge technologies’\
    \ adoption obstacles.\nAccording to the intermediaries, irrigation–fertigation–biostimulant\
    \ indigenous AMFs–\nnutrient analysis was the most interesting thematic area for\
    \ farmers to be trained (Figure 22).\nFurthermore, they supported that the lack\
    \ of a culture of change and difficulties to manage\nlearning/training software\
    \ were the basic training problems faced by greenhouse farmers\n(Figure 23).\n\
    Figure 22. Interest in thematic areas.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10536\n19 of\
    \ 22\nFigure 23. Training problems greenhouse farmers are facing.\nIn conclusion,\
    \ the intermediaries believed that live teachers/seminars, videos and\npresentations\
    \ were the most appropriate forms of training for farmers (Figure 24). Inter-\n\
    mediaries also perceived that practical courses/exercises and agriculturalist’s\
    \ visits to\nfarms/educational excursions were the most effective training methods\
    \ (Figure 25).\nFigure 24. Rating of training forms.\nFigure 25. Training method\
    \ efﬁciency.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10536\n20 of 22\n4. Conclusions\nFarmers’\
    \ digital and environmental skills are very important for successful greenhouse\n\
    farming. Producers who run small farms, in most cases, lack knowledge, especially\
    \ on\nhow to manage climate control systems or fertigation systems. Along the\
    \ value chain,\nﬁrst, the market (production schedule, demand and price), followed\
    \ by available resources\n(water, energy and labour, mainly) and, ﬁnally, the\
    \ management of the production process\ncan affect greenhouse farming. The main\
    \ issue in innovation uptake by greenhouse farmers\nwas at ﬁrst the high uncertainty\
    \ due to insufﬁcient reliable information. On the one hand,\nproducers had little\
    \ data on the market and assume the risk of producing without the\nnecessary guarantees.\
    \ Therefore, their strategy was usually survival with signiﬁcant cost\ncontrol.\
    \ On the other hand, the technical training of farmers on control and the automation\n\
    of processes in the greenhouse (precision agriculture) was very basic. Finally,\
    \ the lack of\nqualiﬁed personnel able to adopt new knowledge was a key factor.\n\
    The main issue in the technology adaptability of greenhouse farmers was the lack\
    \ of\ntechnical training and distrust. In general, greenhouse farms did not employ\
    \ enough quali-\nﬁed personnel as most of the farms were small, and ﬁnding the\
    \ free time for training actions\nwas a big challenge. Additionally, many farmers\
    \ were older with a low level of education,\nwhich made it more difﬁcult to become\
    \ aware of the training issues. In some cases, young\nfarmers with a degree were\
    \ working in agriculture, and they were open to participating in\ntraining activities\
    \ for innovation and knowledge in greenhouse farming systems.\nThere was a low\
    \ offer of speciﬁc training in greenhouse production systems. The train-\ning\
    \ offered should be related to sustainable agriculture (reduction of consumption\
    \ and\npollutants and increased resilience of exploitation) and precision agriculture\
    \ technologies.\nThis work was an investigation on greenhouse farmers’ training.\
    \ The data provided\ninformation regarding the needs for greenhouse farmers’ training\
    \ in smart farming tech-\nnologies, which are the core of development. The issue\
    \ has to be further investigated,\nin relation to the organisation and operation\
    \ of greenhouse farmers, addressing the different\ndimensions of sustainability:\
    \ environmental, social and economic.\nOur ﬁndings have signiﬁcant policy implications\
    \ in terms of encouraging technology\nadoption and spread in Greece. Improving\
    \ greenhouse technology training could be a\nkey step in encouraging technology\
    \ acceptance and diffusion; new information lowers\nproduction costs, boosts farm\
    \ proﬁts and exposes farmers to new technologies. Agricul-\ntural training and\
    \ farm visits have also been found to be favourably connected with the\nadoption\
    \ of better farming techniques. Farmers’ participation in such programs, without\
    \ a\ndoubt, helps to increase their ability and motivates them to replicate such\
    \ innovations.\nHowever, for resource-poor farmers, it is critical to give subsidies\
    \ and connect them to new\ntechnologies; our research demonstrated that farmers\
    \ who receive subsidies and ﬁnancing\nare more likely to embrace contemporary\
    \ technology. Farmers must be provided with\nthe necessary input packages to increase\
    \ their rate of adoption of improved technologies,\nin addition to receiving broad\
    \ exposure to ﬁeld demonstrations, farm visits and training.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    rights and content Under a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • A
    semantic knowledge model, AquaONT, is proposed to represent the essential knowledge
    of an aquaponics system. • An ontological approach is considered to model aquaponics
    practice in an Industry 4.0 context to facilitate access of data and interoperability.
    • The ontology model is validated through experimental test cases related to control
    parameters, design configuration, and product quality. Abstract Aquaponics, one
    of the vertical farming methods, is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics.
    To enhance the production capabilities of the aquaponics system and maximize crop
    yield on a commercial level, integration of Industry 4.0 technologies is needed.
    Industry 4.0 is a strategic initiative characterized by the fusion of emerging
    technologies such as big data and analytics, internet of things, robotics, cloud
    computing, and artificial intelligence. The realization of aquaponics 4.0, however,
    requires an efficient flow and integration of data due to the presence of complex
    biological processes. A key challenge in this essence is to deal with the semantic
    heterogeneity of multiple data resources. An ontology that is regarded as one
    of the normative tools solves the semantic interoperation problem by describing,
    extracting, and sharing the domains’ knowledge. In the field of agriculture, several
    ontologies are developed for the soil-based farming methods, but so far, no attempt
    has been made to represent the knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system in the form
    of an ontology model. Therefore, this study proposes a unified ontology model,
    AquaONT, to represent and store the essential knowledge of an aquaponics 4.0 system.
    This ontology provides a mechanism for sharing and reusing the aquaponics 4.0
    system’s knowledge to solve the semantic interoperation problem. AquaONT is built
    from indoor vertical farming terminologies and is validated and implemented by
    considering experimental test cases related to environmental parameters, design
    configuration, and product quality. The proposed ontology model will help vertical
    farm practitioners with more transparent decision-making regarding crop production,
    product quality, and facility layout of the aquaponics farm. For future work,
    a decision support system will be developed using this ontology model and artificial
    intelligence techniques for autonomous data-driven decisions. Previous article

    modelingDecision support system 1. Introduction The gradual decrease in farmlands
    due to ongoing trends of increasing population, rapid urbanization, anomalous
    environmental changes, diminishing water supply, and resulting food security issues
    have attracted much attention towards vertical farming (VF) practices [1]. In
    principle, VF is a simple concept that involves growing crops in vertically stacked
    layers. It is essentially a controlled-environment agriculture model, which aims
    to optimize indoor soilless farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics,
    and aeroponics. As one of the modern VF methods, aquaponics has the potential
    to be the future of agriculture as a sustainable farming method with high yield
    and low water consumption. Aquaponics is the combination of a recirculating aquaculture
    system (RAS) and a hydroponics system (soilless growing of plants), that work
    together in an integrated environment [2]. Being a symbiotic process, the design
    and management of an aquaponics system are challenging, when scaling it up to
    a commercial level. However, through the introduction of automation, smart strategies,
    and connectivity, the aquaponics system''s feasibility can be strengthened. With
    the advent of agriculture 4.0—the agricultural counterpart of Industry 4.0—modern
    vertical farms can leverage disruptive digital technologies such as the internet
    of things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPS), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), big data and analytics (BDA), autonomous robot systems
    (ARS) and ubiquitous cloud computing (UCC) to achieve sustainable intensification.
    Aquaponics 4.0 system is a digital farm based on a smart farming concept that
    uses all these technologies to bring improvements in systems'' design and operation
    by ensuring autonomous monitoring and control and intelligent data-driven decisions
    in the fast-processing pervasive environment [3]. The realization of aquaponics
    4.0 brings flexibility and adaptability to the system; however, it requires efficient
    data integration and information flow among different domains. Data can be of
    two types: i) data created by people, which are mainly distributed through the
    Web (social networks, emails, online television, online broadcasting, etc.) or
    available in form of books, documents, and computer files; and ii) data generated
    by multiple heterogeneous sources such as sensors, IoT devices and suggested services.
    This mixed traffic of data needs to be stored, categorized, mined, and processed
    to extract useful knowledge and utilize it to solve complex real-world problems
    such as managing complex processes. The continuous evolution of digital technologies,
    however, has led to complex systems’ architectures – generating enormous volumes
    of data with diverse formats. The exponential increase in data size is causing
    interoperability issues making data integration and knowledge extraction complex
    and difficult [4]. Recent research has shown that semantic web technology (SWT)
    plays a key role in solving the problems of data heterogeneity, interoperability,
    interpretation, and integration [5], [6]. To ensure reliable semantic modeling,
    knowledge management, and data integration, ontologies are considered promising
    tools. Ontologies are used to store information from multiple sources and provide
    an automatic process known as reasoning to infer new knowledge that has not been
    explicitly incorporated [7]. They are commonly employed in the development of
    a knowledge base - one of the building blocks of a decision support system. Besides,
    ontologies have appeared as an alternative to relational databases (RDB) and are
    considered as more powerful than RDB because; i) accessibility of the data is
    simple in ontologies – it is easy to define changes, and 2) Inference of new knowledge
    from existing models is carried out using reasons in ontology, whereas in RDB
    one needs to create every single link manually to infer new knowledge – making
    RDB difficult to manage in case of knowledge modeling of big data [8]. So far,
    no attempt has been made to develop an ontology model for the aquaponics 4.0 system.
    Therefore, this study aims to create an ontology “AquaONT” for the aquaponics
    4.0 system by utilizing web ontology language (OWL). AquaONT stores aquaponics
    4.0 knowledge gathered from domain experts, literature, databases, and IoT devices
    installed at the farm. It also builds the semantic relevance among fundamental
    elements of an indoor soilless vertical farm, such as optimal environmental parameters,
    system configuration, and product qualitative aspects. It can provide the optimal
    solution for the operation of IoT devices based on contextual data received from
    the farm, updates on crop quality along with respective causes and treatments,
    and design configuration of grow beds concerning crop characteristics, when integrated
    with the suitable interface. The practical implementation of AquaONT in the context
    of engineering design (parametric design automation of aquaponics grow beds based
    on crop characteristics) can be found in a study which is the extension of this
    work and hence, it is suggested to have a look at it [9]. Overall, the current
    work can be used as a semantic framework to build agricultural applications that
    will allow vertical farming practitioners to access each dimension of aquaponics
    knowledge for more precise decision-making regarding crop production and facility
    layout in aquaponics farms. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are
    listed as follows. • Review of the knowledge modeling approaches and current state-of-the-art
    ontology models in the agriculture sector. • Description of the domain-specific
    concepts and sub-concepts of aquaponics 4.0 farm and relationships between them.
    • Populating the respective knowledge domains with data and information from multiple
    sources to enable automatic decision-making related to various aspects such as
    process, design, environment, and quality control. The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows. Section 2 presents a detailed literature review focusing on the general
    concepts of an aquaponics 4.0 system, knowledge modeling, and research contributions
    related to ontology-driven smart systems and agricultural ontologies. The research
    methodology used to develop AquaONT is discussed in Section 3 followed by its
    detailed formulation in Section 4. The implementation and validation of AquaONT
    are presented in Section 5. In Section 6, a detailed discussion of the work is
    provided. Finally, the concluding remarks and future directions are presented
    in Section 7. 2. Literature review 2.1. Aquaponics 4.0 historical landscape The
    historical interaction between industrial revolution and aquaponics evolution
    is depicted in Fig. 1. Aquaponics technology was first implemented towards the
    end of the 19th century where indigenous tools were used to develop the system
    and can be referred to as aquaponics 1.0 [10]. Intensive research was conducted
    afterwards to determine the efficiency of aquatic plants at filtering and consuming
    the nutrients in wastewater from aquaculture farms and several electrical devices
    such as water pumps, aerators, and fish feeders were installed, which can be marked
    as aquaponics 2.0 [11]. Around the 1970s, technologies like robotics, information
    technology (IT), embedded systems, and software engineering were integrated with
    the aquaponics system to enable precision farming, which can be marked as aquaponics
    3.0 [12]. The research regarding the implementation of industry 4.0 concepts in
    aquaponics systems started towards the end of 2016 [13]. This can be marked as
    the beginning of aquaponics 4.0—a digital aquaponics farm that involves remote
    monitoring and control of ecosystem parameters, a high degree of automation, and
    intelligent decision-making to ensure high crop yield and quality. Download :

    technologies in an aquaponics system. 2.2. Knowledge modeling conceptual overview
    According to Davenport et al., knowledge is a high-value form of information combined
    with experience, context, and interpretation that is applied to decisions and
    actions [15]. To store and represent this knowledge, modeling techniques are employed
    [16]. Based on fundamental theories of knowledge base technology, knowledge modeling
    and manipulation techniques can be classified into four groups such as 1) linguistic
    knowledge base; 2) expert knowledge base; 3) ontology; and 4) cognitive knowledge
    base, and their detailed description can be found at reference [17]. For situations
    in which large data acquisition systems are used, i.e. aquaponics 4.0 systems,
    ontologies are employed as they support the creation of customized rich web-based
    data platforms and ease data accessibility to interested parties. Therefore, for
    this study, an ontology-based knowledge modeling and manipulation technique is
    employed to model knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system. 2.3. Overview of ontology
    modeling Ontology is a branch of metaphysics that is related to the philosophy
    of the “being”. Ontology can be defined as a formal, explicit specification of
    a shared conceptualization, where “conceptualization“ refers to an abstract model
    of some phenomena in the world that can be identified by its relevant and explicitly
    defined concepts and constraints [18]. Ontologies provide mechanisms to represent
    shareable heterogeneous data among domains, in the form of knowledge models that
    vary due to the complex and dynamic nature of a system. An ontology is typically
    formulated as a tuple, , where C (concept) is a set of instances, I (instance)
    is the object in the domain, OP (object property) is the relationship between
    two concepts or instances, and DP (datatype property) links instances with literals
    (integer or string) [19]. Most researchers classify the ontologies in four categories:
    1) application ontologies; 2) domain ontologies; 3) representation ontologies;
    and, 4) generic ontologies based on generality levels and conceptualization [20],
    [21], [22], [23]. In this study, a domain ontology is proposed, representing the
    concepts that are valid only in a specific domain—the aquaponics domain. Detailed
    insights into ontology, its architecture, related computational tools such as
    SWRL and SPARQL can be found at [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. To develop an ontology
    model, Protégé1 is employed, which is an open-source ontology editor and framework
    developed at Stanford University [29]. 2.4. Ontology-driven smart systems The
    recent advancements in big data, IoT, and cloud computing have spurred the rise
    of artificial intelligence (AI) in various sectors such as agriculture, aquaculture,
    manufacturing, healthcare, etc. AI is all about data analysis, which is roughly
    classified into two categories: data-driven and rule-based [30]. Traditionally,
    many smart devices and services use a set of rules for situation recognition and
    inference. These rules are extracted from the long-term experiences and knowledge
    of human experts (human learning). Semantic modeling (ontology) is a representative
    technique for this approach - performed on already-built semantic models (a set
    of rules in semantic language) and new data [31]. Today, the focus is more on
    data-driven approaches such as machine learning and deep learning - extensively
    used in image recognition and natural language processing because of their high
    accuracy. Both approaches, however, have their drawbacks and benefits. In semantic
    modeling, rules should fit the real phenomena consistently. The rules may become
    obsolete if circumstance changes dynamically and drastically. In machine learning,
    assumptions are made on the data reflecting the whole phenomena we are interested
    in. The analysis becomes meaningless if assumptions made are not satisfied [32].
    Recently, ontologies are increasingly being used in combination with machine learning
    and deep learning techniques to model smart ecosystems such as smart homes, smart
    farms, smart factories, power grids [20], [33], [34], [35], [36], [46], [74],
    [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85]. The main applications
    include solving the interoperability issues, detecting the cyber-attacks, remote
    monitoring and controlling of system’s parameters and entities, analysis of big
    data, creating and analysis of digital twin models, prediction of patient’s disease,
    checking the accountability of AI systems, improving the monitoring of industrial
    operations, enhancing the flexibility of control solutions in human-robot collaborative
    cells, and optimizing the design parameters for maximum reliability and minimum
    cost. Examples of how ontology and machine learning or deep learning technologies
    are used in these applications are context modeling, semantic filtering, automatic
    ontology population, utilization of background knowledge stored in ontology models,
    developing intelligent decision support systems, and ontology-based learning and
    applications. Table A1 given in Appendix A provides a summary of relevant publications,
    where ontologies are used in combination with digital technologies. The idea of
    combining machine learning, AI, and ontology modeling techniques is relatively
    new in the agricultural field and hence, there are only a few studies available,
    which are mentioned towards the end of section 2.5. Most of these studies have
    either focused on enabling smart services (monitoring and control) in IoT-based
    farming systems or detection of cyber-attacks using ontology models. None of these
    studies has directly used machine learning in combination with ontology modeling.
    There could be various reasons for that: i) Agricultural data is vast and scattered
    and no unified model is available to keep that data in one place, ii) Agricultural
    sector is a slow adopter of technology, owing to the increasing complexity of
    IT (information technology), and iii) Presence of complex biological processes,
    environmental parameters and living organisms. Therefore, the notion of presenting
    examples of different domains (table A1), where ontology is used in combination
    with smart technologies is to highlight the significance of the ontology modeling
    approach and how it can be used in different capacities to bring improvements
    in a variety of systems. 2.5. Agricultural ontologies Ontologies have been a dominant
    research area for the representation, storing and management of agricultural knowledge.
    For instance, AGROVOC, initially published in the early 1980 s is the renowned
    agricultural thesaurus [37]. AGROVOC is the amalgamation of a controlled RDF vocabulary
    with around 32,000 concepts covering several areas of interest, such as food,
    nutrition, farming, fisheries, forestry, and the environment. Another prominent
    ontology model is crop ontology (CO), which was designed to provide a structured
    and controlled vocabulary for significant crops'' phenotypes for food and agriculture
    research [38]. Several ontologies are developed to represent specific aspects
    of a crop or a system. For example, Aree et al. proposed an ontology model for
    Thai rice, aiming to present a plant ontology prototype and specify crop growth
    data [39]. In the study by Maleerat et al., domain ontology based on agricultural
    expertise retrieval framework “ARGIX” was constructed in Protégé with the idea
    of improving the performance of information retrieval using simple query terms
    and association rules mining method for inference [40], [41]. Suresh et al. developed
    a farming ontology with extensible vocabulary to support the dataset with agricultural
    aspects related to production, geography, and meteorology [42]. Hifza et al. extended
    this ontology to include several other classes, such as water, pesticide, nutrients,
    and seed to assist farmers in decision-making related to rice crops [43]. To represent
    the technical knowledge of the agriculture operations field, Elcio et al. presented
    a formal task ontology model [44]. The field operations associated with task agents,
    agent roles, input resources, task and sub-task decomposition, control-flow, task
    concepts, attributes, and relations were defined. Most recently, Aydin et al.
    proposed a generic ontology-based data acquisition model to create data acquisition
    forms based on model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern, with the notion to
    publish and use agricultural open data platforms [45]. A tool OWL2MVC was developed
    that integrates the hazelnut ontology to illustrate the proposed model''s effectiveness
    for generating data acquisition forms. Ontologies are also developed to enable
    smart farming services. For instance, Chukkapalli et al. developed a member farm
    and co-op ontologies for a connected cooperative smart farming ecosystem to provide
    a more accurate and data-driven dimension to precision agriculture [35] AI applications
    are employed to use the information gathered from the cloud for diagnosing the
    critical conditions of the farm such as crop diseases, soil condition, water level,
    etc. Sai et al. developed a smart farm ontology (incorporates users, sensors,
    and systems in a farm) for implementing an attribute-based access control (ABAC)
    to evaluate access control requests in farms dynamically[46]. Sivamani et al.
    proposed a vertical farm ontology (VFO) model to enable a smart service based
    on ubiquitous sensor networks [47]. Their research concentrates more on the monitoring
    and controlling of the internal and external environment parameters. This work
    was extended to link VFO with web services aiming to assist different entities
    related to hardware, user, service, and environmental factors [48]. In the study
    by Kim et al., an ontology using context modeling technique is designed for an
    intelligent service in a vertical farm by integrating several environmental and
    control factors, which were validated for different scenarios [49]. The contributions
    mentioned above have established the philosophical foundations in representing
    agricultural knowledge, but most of the models are designed for soil-based methods.
    For soilless VF, such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics systems, limited
    or no research is conducted in relation to knowledge representation through ontology
    models. Moreover, the current models are limited to the representation of knowledge
    concerning a single product type and its growth data, monitoring, and controlling
    of environmental parameters, usage of pesticides, and seed plantation. Nevertheless,
    no heed has been paid to integrate and specify the heterogeneous metadata related
    to crop quality and soilless VF design. With these observations in mind, this
    work aims to present an ontology model for representing and storing multidimensional
    knowledge of an aquaponics 4.0 system with a notion to use it for developing further
    applications using machine learning models, which will assist aquaponics practitioners
    in decision-making related to aquaponics farms. 3. Methodology for ontology development
    To represent and model the essential knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system, an
    ontology is developed. There are multiple methodologies to create an ontology
    from scratch. In this study, the “methontology” approach is employed to formulate
    and evaluate AquaONT. This approach presents a well-structured framework to develop
    ontologies from scratch by enlisting and tracking the activities necessary in
    an ontology development process [50]. These activities are classified into six
    stages: ontology specification, knowledge acquisition, knowledge conceptualization,
    knowledge formalization, ontology evaluation, and ontology verification and validation,
    which are presented in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (187KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Methontology approach for ontology development,
    adapted from [50], [51]. First, ontology''s scope is specified in the ontology
    specification stage by describing and assembling the general aspects such as ontology
    domain, the purpose of ontology, its intended users, level of formality, and several
    key terms. A conceptual model is then developed in the second phase – involving
    organization and modeling of the raw data gathered in accordance with the scope
    during the knowledge acquisition stage in a more formal and structured form. A
    glossary of terms (GT) describing physical and conceptual objects related to each
    knowledge domain is created in tabular or graphical form. A conceptual model (taxonomy)
    is converted to a formal model (computable) in the ontology formalization phase,
    using an ontology editor such as Protégé. Domain-specific concepts and sub-concepts
    are defined in this stage. Finally, to test the correctness and coherence and
    detect the incompleteness, inconsistencies, and redundancies, formal ontology
    is evaluated. The evaluation process is carried out during each phase, between
    the phases, and at the end and it involves validation and verification [51]. Verification
    refers to “building the system right” and involves a technical process that ensures
    that the ontology is built correctly as per the requirements established during
    the specification phase [50]. Whereas, validation refers to “building the right
    system.” It ensures that the ontology corresponds to the system that it represents
    and guarantees that the designed ontology performs correctly with an acceptable
    level of accuracy by checking the quality of the solutions when the system is
    queried [50]. The validated and verified ontology model is then used in different
    applications for automatic decision-making. 4. Formulation and evaluation of AquaONT
    Following the steps mentioned in section 3, formulation, and evaluation of AquaONT
    is carried out. Each stage is comprehensively described in the following sub-sections.
    4.1. Ontology specification An informal ontology specification document written
    in natural language and describing the clear and concise purpose and scope of
    an ontology was generated for AquaONT before its formalization, see Table A2 in
    Appendix A. The purpose of AquaONT was specified in this document, which is to
    structure, model, and store the aquaponics 4.0 system’s knowledge, and use it
    to enable data-driven decisions for farmers by developing a functional decision
    support system. These decisions will be related to determining the optimal growth
    environment, assessing the system configuration based on product characteristics,
    and evaluating the quality of products based on the environment-based contextual
    data. 4.2. Knowledge conceptualization To organize and store the gathered knowledge,
    a conceptual model representing the upper-level hierarchy of AquaONT is developed,
    see Fig. 4. The resources used to gather the knowledge for AquaONT include i)
    literature, which provided the information about optimal environmental parameters,
    optimal growth parameters, qualitative aspects of the product, and standard operation
    of the aquaponics farm; and ii) the aquaponics 4.0 system established as a learning
    factory (AllFactory) at the University of Alberta, which provides real-time contextual
    data [52]. For AquaONT, six knowledge domains are identified for creating a conceptual
    model such as consumer product, production system, production facility, ambient
    environment, product quality, and contextual data. The common dependencies among
    and within knowledge domains are identified as the relationships and are illustrated
    in the model. Several GT e.g., Crop, Fish, Digital_System, Qualitative_Value_Assessment,
    and relationships between these terms, e.g., Product_Quality “is_Determined_by”
    Quality_Aspects, are identified for AquaONT. Download : Download high-res image

    the upper-level ontological model of AquaONT. 4.3. Ontology formalization The
    upper-level ontological knowledge model developed for AquaONT during the conceptualization
    stage is formalized and implemented using Protégé 5.5. Six “classes” or “concepts”
    were created for the six knowledge domains mentioned in the previous subsection,
    and accordingly, “subclasses” were formed, see Fig A.1 of Appendix A. The relationships
    between these classes and subclasses were specified using “object properties.”
    Instances of classes are modeled using “individuals,” and attributes are stipulated
    using “data properties.” In the next sub-sections, all the contents are distinctly
    presented and explained. 4.3.1. Domain-specific concepts 4.3.1.1. Consumer product
    concept A product is the outcome of any production system. In an aquaponics 4.0
    system, the notion of the Consumer_Product class is to provide an abstract view
    of the type, growth status, and growth parameters of ready-to-harvest crops and
    fish, which are primary products in this case [53], [54]. The hierarchical tree-like
    structure of this class is shown in Fig. 5. Crop as an indispensable part of any
    aquaponics system is further defined to include subclasses such as Crop_Growth_Parameters
    (optimal humidity, light intensity, water temperature, air temperature, pH, carbon
    dioxide (CO2), etc.), Crop_Type (leafy green vegetables such as lettuce, basil,
    mint, cabbage, and cilantro), and Crop_Growth_Status (the growth rate of a specific
    crop from seed to ready-to-harvest crop). The second product in the aquaponics
    system is fish, which plays a vital role in supplying nutrients for the healthy
    growth of plants in the RAS. The subclasses Fish_Species (fishes used in aquaponics
    system), Fish_Growth_Parameters (water pH level, ammonia content, amount of dissolved
    oxygen, etc.), and Fish_Growth_Factors (growth rate, feeding rate, stocking size,
    etc.) are specified under the class Fish. Download : Download high-res image (521KB)

    elements of crop and fish. 4.3.1.2. Ambient environment concept For the healthy
    growth of crops and fish in an indoor aquaponics 4.0 system, it is necessary to
    ensure that environmental parameters (water and atmospheric) are within the optimum
    range [55]. The Ambient_Environment concept is modeled in this regard to specify
    the threshold of indoor influenceable environmental parameters according to the
    tolerance range of crop and fish considered under the subclasses Optimal_Water_Parameters
    and Optimal_Atmospheric_Parameters. The hierarchical diagram of this concept is
    given in Fig. 6. In an aquaponics system, the living organisms can exist only
    if water and atmospheric parameters such as temperature, pH, electroconductivity,
    ammonia, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and nitrite level, water hardness, light intensity,
    humidity, and CO2, water level, water flowrate, alkalinity, and salinity are within
    the optimal range or else they may perish [55]. Download : Download high-res image

    showing a variety of atmospheric and water parameters. 4.3.1.3. Contextual data
    concept The IoT-based system has many heterogeneous environments that consist
    of several devices generating context information/data. Therefore, it is necessary
    to integrate, store and share this information between system entities for which
    ontologies are used [56]. The contextual information is usually gathered from
    sensors through proper connectivity channels and is utilized to enable data-driven
    decisions [14]. Hence, contextual information plays a vital role in a ubiquitous
    environment. The Contextual_Data concept in AquaONT specifies the set of environmental
    parameters and crop growth status at a particular location at a scheduled time
    interval. The hierarchical structure of this concept is shown in Fig. 7. Three
    subclasses are identified for this concept include Sensed_Indoor_Parameter, Current_Outdoor_Parameter
    and Current_Product_Status. The instances of these subclasses are populated by
    importing cloud data of farm in ontology model using transformation rules. Download

    Production system concept An indoor aquaponics 4.0 system consists of various
    mechanical and electrical components. The Production_System concept is devised
    to model the knowledge of these components under the subclasses Digital_System
    and Mechanical_System, shown in Fig. 8. The mechanical system of the aquaponics
    4.0 farm is comprised of NFT (nutrient film technique) grow channels for plant
    growth represented under subclass Hydroponic_Unit and the fish tanks for fish
    habitat and biofilters for the breakdown of ammonia mentioned under subclass Aquaculture_Unit.
    The design of these systems is dependent on the physical characteristics of plants
    and fishes, such as height and width [9]. The subclass Digital_System lists sensors,
    controllers, and other electronic and network devices that are employed in an
    aquaponics 4.0 farm to achieve autonomous services, such as remote monitoring
    and control [57]. Download : Download high-res image (650KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Production system concept with digital and mechanical
    components in aquaponics 4.0 farm. 4.3.1.5. Product quality concept The Product_Quality
    concept models and stores the qualitative product aspects, quality control standards,
    and quality assessment criteria and links these attributes with the knowledge
    represented under Consumer_Product, Production_System, and Ambient_Environment
    classes. The diagram showing the hierarchical structure of this concept is depicted
    in Fig. 9. The Subclass Qualitative_Aspects represents the quality attributes
    of both fish and crops such as products'' physical aspects (size, shape, color,
    structure, transparency or turbidity, etc.) and nutritional value (well-balanced
    ratio of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals, etc.) as standardized by local
    and international food associations [58]. The Quality_Control subclass defines
    the set of procedures adopted to ensure that product meets the desired quality
    standards set in subclass Qualitative_Aspects. It involves two main areas; product
    inspection and product handling. The last subclass defined under this concept
    is Qualitative_Value, which classifies the product as a good or bad quality product
    by comparing the information from product inspection with qualitative aspects.

    aspects. 4.3.1.6. Production facility concept The main purpose of an indoor aquaponics
    4.0 system is to increase crop yields by maintaining optimal conditions, even
    in the middle of the urban areas [59]. Production_Facility concept shown in Fig.
    10 is designed to specify the location of the aquaponics 4.0 farm. Download :

    facility concept showing the interactions of farm facility and other domains.
    In this study, the production facility is the AllFactory. The crop grow area in
    the facility is divided into multiple sections referred to as crop sectors to
    grow a variety of crops. For instance, Sector_01 is allocated to grow lettuce,
    and Sector_02 is assigned to grow cabbage. Each crop sector has its digital system
    composed of sensors, control devices, controllers, and network access points.
    4.3.2. AquaONT instances For AquaONT, a total of 310 instances/individuals are
    defined for different classes and subclasses. For example, the instances defined
    for Ambient_Environment class are Optimal_Light_Intensity, Optimal_Humidity, Optimal_Temperature,
    and so forth. Likewise, to classify the product quality, instances defined are
    Good_Quality_Crop (crop meeting the required qualitative aspects) and Poor_Quality_Crop
    (crop lacking the desired qualitative aspects). To further express the outstanding
    quality issues, potential causes, and recommended solutions in the context of
    poor-quality lettuce, instances are specified as shown in Fig. 11. Instances are
    also defined for subclasses of Production_Facility, Consumer_Product, Production_System,
    and Contextual_Data concepts. For the Contextual_Data concept, the instances are
    real-time data coming from sensors and control devices. For the Production_System
    concept, the defined instances give information about operating voltages, equipment
    identifiers, suppliers along with a sector-wise description of all the sensors,
    devices, and control architecture installed in the AllFactory. The list of instances
    of some other classes is given in Fig A.2 of Appendix A. Download : Download high-res
    image (282KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Instances for subclasses
    of Product_Quality concept specifying qualitative requirements. 4.3.3. Object
    and datatype properties The domain-specific concepts defined for AquaONT are related
    to each other, and their relationships are represented through the property module,
    which consists of two types of properties viz object property and the datatype
    property. Object properties represent the ontological relationships that link
    different classes (concepts) together [60]. In AquaONT, 139 object properties
    are defined to represent all the interactions between classes and subclasses.
    Fig A.3 and A.4 in Appendix A show object properties of AquaONT and relationships
    between classes and subclasses respectively. Object property assertions are also
    applied to develop relationships between different instances [87]. For example,
    in AquaONT, to determine the solution, causes, and quality issues of a poor-quality
    product, the instances of subclass Recommended_Solution are linked with the instances
    of Quality_Issues through object property is_Recommended_for, and instances of
    Quality_Issues are linked with instances of Potential_Causes through is_Consequence_of.
    The second type of property is the datatype property that links an instance to
    an RDF literal. RDF literals can be in the form of Boolean or integer values,
    as well as string variables [60]. For AquaONT, 53 datatype properties are created,
    and they are used with 575 different literals. The list of datatype properties
    of AquaONT is given in Fig A.5 of Appendix A with Fig A.6 shows the relationship
    between some of the instances and attributes. 4.3.4. Standards, restrictions,
    and rules After creating the instances for subclasses of domain-specific concepts,
    these are assigned numerical and qualitative values through datatype properties.
    These values conform to the standards defined in literature or local bodies. For
    example, in AquaONT, the optimal values for instances of Ambient_Environment class
    were taken from the literature [10]. The value of Optimal_Light_Intensity is PPFD
    (photosynthetic photon flux density) 600–900 nm wavelength and in terms of PAR
    (photosynthetic active radiation), it is 5 to 17 mols/m2/day. For other indoor
    environmental parameters, the values of instances are defined in the same way.
    Likewise, for assessing the qualitative aspects of the products, the data was
    taken from the Health Canada database [61]. To enable the knowledge retrieval
    process, the real-time data from AllFactory is then compared with these standard
    values using a data query engine. Restrictions refer to the constraints in the
    ontology model. In ontologies, there are three main types of restrictions that
    can be placed on classes: quantifier restrictions, cardinality restrictions, and
    “hasValue” restrictions [29]. In AquaONT, only cardinality constraints are imposed
    using the object restriction creator to limit the number of sensors employed to
    get variable data. In Protégé, rules are usually written in the SWRL editor, which
    is a built-in development environment to work with SWRL. As multiple scenarios
    occur at the aquaponics farm, for which rules are created within the AquaONT model.
    4.4. Ontology verification and validation Different types of built-in reasoners
    are available to evaluate an ontology model in Protégé for its consistency and
    coherence. The most used reasoners for ontology evaluation are “Pellet” and “HermiT”
    [62]. For AquaONT, both reasoners are tested with selection based on the empirical
    results obtained. After testing, HermiT v.1.4.3.456, a Protégé built-in reasoner,
    is employed for verification and validation of AquaONT because it processed the
    ontology in 2098 ms - lower than for “Pallet”, which is 3450 ms. The computation
    is done with no errors, showing the consistency and coherence of AquaONT. To further
    verify it, the DL queries were created and executed after the reasoner classification
    [63]. Examples of DL queries and corresponding results for AquaONT are shown in
    Fig. 12. Download : Download high-res image (329KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 12. DL queries for verification of AquaONT. The first DL query is about
    finding the potential cause of one of the quality issues mentioned in the query
    (class expression) tab. The result shows that the potential cause of Low_Iron_Content
    of lettuce is High_pH_Level, which is an individual in AquaONT. The second DL
    query is related to checking whether the given value of humidity is optimal or
    not. The result of this search shows that 60%–80% is the Optimal_Relative_Humidity,
    which is an individual of humidity. Nevertheless, it is also possible to search
    for AquaONT according to other scenarios. The results of these queries depict
    the correctness of the captured knowledge and requirements set during the specification
    stage. Likewise, the validation of AquaONT was performed, which is discussed in
    section 5. 5. Validation and implementation of AquaONT As stated, AquaONT is developed
    to capture and store the essential knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system, which
    then can be retrieved and used in other applications to make informed decisions
    for a variety of applications related to aquaponics systems, from systems’ design
    and preparation to systems’ control and monitoring. A framework in which AquaONT
    is currently utilized is shown in Fig. 13. This framework has two primary purposes:
    1) The first one is to structure how the data is acquired and stored in the ontology
    model as it populates its instances and to validate that the appropriate knowledge
    is being retrieved; and, 2) The second one is to give an insight that how AquaONT
    can be integrated with the aquaponics 4.0 farm through an interface (decision
    support system) to control operations and ensure intelligent decision-making regarding
    design, quality, among others as required by the user. The framework consists
    of four building blocks including 1) data generation and communication, 2) knowledge
    representation and modeling, 3) knowledge extraction and validation, and 4) knowledge
    application and decision-making. Download : Download high-res image (734KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Overview of the implementation of AquaONT
    in aquaponics 4.0 systems. An aquaponics 4.0 system reflects a context-rich environment
    that has entities that generate data related to indoor environmental parameters
    and crop growth characteristics. Hence, the real-time data from these entities
    is gathered and transmitted to an accessible cloud database, which along with
    other databases such as for product quality populate the instances of AquaONT
    concepts. The existing and inferred knowledge can be extracted from AquaONT and
    applied to enable autonomous decision-making and control farm operations through
    an interface, which is part of future work (the fourth building block of the framework).
    A variety of test cases in relation to the aquaponics 4.0 farm and the capacity
    of AquaONT mentioned in section 1 were then considered to validate the accuracy
    of ontology. To achieve this, AquaONT was uploaded in Apache Jena Fuseki 3.16.0,
    which is a SPARQL server to retrieve the desired information using the SPARQL
    query language. These test cases are explained below. 5.1. Test case 1 One primary
    function of AquaONT is that it will allow users to keep track of indoor environmental
    conditions at the farm. In case, if conditions are not adequate, AquaONT will
    tell users what to do in that scenario. To validate this, we have performed a
    simple test case using the historical data of the aquaponics 4.0 farm (AllFactory)
    available on the cloud [3]. The farm has different crop sectors, with each sector
    has a distinct crop with its particular atmospheric parameters and water conditions.
    This means each crop sector has its set of wireless sensors and control equipment.
    The historical data used is related to the growth of Little Gem Romaine Lettuce,
    which is located in sector 1. A sector can be defined as a location where vertically
    stacked NFT grow channels are being kept and sector 1 is the place where Lettuce
    is being grown. The cloud data is imported in AquaONT, which is then compared
    to the knowledge stored in it, and the required information is retrieved by running
    SPARQL queries. One simple example of this test case is shown in Fig. 14. Let’s
    say a user wants to know what to do under certain indoor temperature conditions.
    For instance, the temperature value in the farm has exceeded 18℃. The query and
    corresponding results for this case are shown in Fig. 14. Download : Download
    high-res image (669KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Test case
    1—SPARQL query 1 and results (Temperature variations in aquaponics 4.0 farm).
    From the results, it can be seen that AquaONT has given several suggestions to
    a user on what to do in a particular scenario. For example, it has suggested a
    user turn off the heater in sector 1, which is represented by GHH01:OFF. This
    is because the optimal temperature to sustain the aquaponics 4.0 ecosystem is
    18℃–30℃ and for the healthy growth of the lettuce crop, the temperature should
    be kept between 16℃–19℃. Whereas, the temperature in the farm at the moment is
    24℃, higher than needed for the growth of Lettuce. A similar pattern is followed
    for other temperature values (lower and optimal temperature) to see if the AquaONT
    is giving the correct information that corresponds to real-world phenomena. Every
    time, the query produces the same results for the given conditions, proposing
    the validation of AquaONT. These results, later on, can be integrated with some
    applications such as expert systems or decision support systems to control the
    environmental conditions at the farm. In addition to that, these results can also
    allow new farmers or aquaponics startups to get information on which type of sensors
    and electronic equipment is most suitable for their aquaponics 4.0 farms before
    building the physical system. 5.2. Test case 2 To further validate AquaONT, another
    simple test case is conducted considering a different class and scenario. This
    test case reflects another primary function of AquaONT, which is to allow users
    to get information on different qualitative aspects of crops or fish involved
    in the process. A simple example of this test case is shown in Fig. 15. When considering
    growing a certain crop in an aquaponics 4.0 farm, a few elements are important
    to be known beforehand: i) what quality issues in lettuce crop any practitioner
    can encounter; ii) what can be the causes of the particular quality issue, and
    iii) what treatments should be employed to solve this particular quality issue.
    Each crop has standardized qualitative aspects in terms of nutritional value and
    physical characteristics recommended by local food authorities that need to be
    met to ensure a marketable product. Hence, the answers to all these questions
    can be found through the knowledge stored in AquaONT, which is imported from literature,
    databases, and food agencies. Running simple queries, results show the potential
    quality issues for selected crops, i.e. quality issues for the lettuce crops in
    Fig. 15. For each potential quality issue, AquaONT provides the user with information
    on the cause and treatment of that issue. For instance, one potential quality
    issue of the lettuce crop is inadequate length or width at a certain period of
    its growth cycle or at the time of harvesting. The primary cause of this issue
    could be lower calcium content in the nutrient solution, for which the suggested
    treatment is to add calcium chloride. This kind of information will guide a user
    on what necessary steps should be taken before start growing the lettuce crop.

    Fig. 15. SPARQL query 2 and results for test case 2. Another scenario for this
    case study could be if a user is already growing a certain crop in an aquaponics
    4.0 farm and wants to compare the quality of the crop with the standards available.
    Let’s say that this user has a crop inspection system installed at the farm, from
    where it is gathering real-time data on crop height and width. This data can be
    populated in the instances of AquaONT. Upon running the query, the user will get
    information on whether the crop is of adequate dimensions or not along with causes
    and treatments. For this scenario, a proper interface is needed with which AquaONT
    needs to be integrated. The aforementioned test cases and queries are created
    considering the capacity of AquaONT mentioned in section 1 in order to search
    and extract useful knowledge of real-time events happening at the farm. Upon analysis
    of final results after query execution, it was observed that AquaONT provides
    accurate information each time the particular query is executed, which proposes
    the validation of AquaONT. Further, these results can be utilized to reconfigure
    and supervise the aquaponics 4.0 system accordingly by integrating AquaONT with
    an external interface or application. 6. Discussion Driven by rapid advancements
    in AI due to big data, IoT, cloud computing, machine learning and deep learning,
    the agriculture sector is shifting towards a smart farming ecosystem to balance
    the increase in food demands. Not only that, modern farming techniques such as
    hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics are being employed to increase crop yield,
    optimize plant growth, and improve crop quality. Within the scope of this study,
    we focused on the aquaponics system, that couples RAS with hydroponics. Research
    has shown that the design and management of an aquaponics system are complex due
    to the presence of living organisms such as plants and fishes, complex biological
    processes, and diverse environmental parameters [10]. To deal with these issues,
    the concept of aquaponics 4.0 is introduced in this paper. Aquaponics 4.0 system
    is a digital farm based on Industry 4.0 technologies. It consists of smart sensors
    and IoT devices that bring automation in the system and provide data-driven applications
    to improve farming practices with minimal human and natural resources and enable
    farmers to make optimal decisions for the farms. Developing such a highly digitized
    system, however, requires efficient data integration and knowledge management.
    With its growing number of devices and their diversity, along with the big data
    from divergent sources, the reality of IoT is challenging current approaches and
    technologies for smarter integration of data, applications, and services in the
    agricultural domain. Providing interoperability among IoT devices and other heterogeneous
    big data sources is one of the most fundamental requirements to support object
    addressing, tracking and discovery, and information representation, storage, and
    exchange. While the Web is seen as a convenient platform for integrating things,
    the Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) can further improve its capacity to understand
    things’ data and facilitate their interoperability along with enabling the knowledge
    management and data exchange in a machine-interpretable way. This synergy between
    SWT and IoT domains gives rise to the birth of a new appellation; known as the
    semantic web of things (SWoT) [4]. To develop this semantic web stack for IoT,
    metamodels such as ontologies play a key role in facilitating semantic integration
    and aggregation of data generated by different sources. Moreover, ontologies can
    connect and qualify unstructured, semi-structured or structured data formats without
    any need for standardization. They streamline the process of identifying core
    concepts, improving classification results to collate critical information. Considering
    the complexity of the aquaponics 4.0 system with different data sources and the
    unavailability of a unified knowledge model, AquaONT — aquaponics 4.0 ontology
    — is proposed in this paper. AquaONT is designed to store and model the knowledge
    of the aquaponics 4.0 system. It gives a full description of concepts concerning
    remote monitoring and controlling of environmental parameters, production facility
    layout based on crop selection, and product quality to analyze the quality issues
    and suggest the desired treatments. AquaONT also enables semantic interoperability
    among multivariate data sources. The knowledge from AquaONT can be retrieved and
    used to make intelligent decisions regarding farm operations and system design
    by integrating it with an external interface (decision support system). The final
    service and quality of application, however, depends on the quality of the knowledge
    base, which is usually constructed from ontology models [64], [65]. With a unified
    knowledge model for aquaponics 4.0 system, such as AquaONT, it is possible to
    get insights on what are the optimal environmental parameters for growing different
    types of crops, what are the optimal growth parameters for fish, and what are
    the optimal water and atmospheric parameters for sustaining aquaponics 4.0 farm.
    This information will assist farmers in deciding which sensors and IoT devices
    are most suitable for their farm and their choice of the crop before building
    it. This will in turn allow farmers to avoid wasting money on the wrong sensors
    and IoT devices. Even if the farm is already running and growing a certain crop,
    AquaONT will assist in finding out if the parameters are within the range by collecting
    the data from sensors and comparing it with standard values. If integrated with
    some external interface, the knowledge from AquaONT can be exploited to control
    parameters and processes in the aquaponics 4.0 farm. In aquaponics systems, the
    design of grow bed is directly dependent on the type of crop to be planted [9].
    Each crop has certain width and height at optimal water and environmental conditions
    that impact the design of grow beds in terms of the spacing between plants and
    between channels. Hence, the same configuration of grow bed cannot be used for
    different crops. The correct design configuration of grow bed enables plants to
    absorb the right amount of nutrients, ensuring healthy crops, high crop yields,
    and enhanced farm productivity [66]. With the AquaONT-driven decision support
    platform, it is possible to visualize the impact of crop characteristics on grow
    bed design that assists farmers to decide on what design configuration of an aquaponics
    grow bed is suitable for their crop choice and space availability before building
    a physical system. Such an ontology-driven platform can also enable parametric
    design automation by retrieving the data from the ontology model and integrate
    it with some CAD software. This kind of platform can save a lot of money by preventing
    farmers from choosing the wrong materials and saves a lot of time as a new design
    of the system can be built with just one click due to parametric modeling. Another
    significance of AquaONT is that it can provide information on quality issues,
    causes and recommended treatments for different crops and fish species, which
    will assist farmers to take necessary steps before building a system to avoid
    quality issues. At the moment, AquaONT can only be applied to NFT based aquaponics
    4.0 farms that grow leafy green vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, parsley,
    basil, and cabbage. But it can easily be expanded to include aspects and knowledge
    of other aquaponics 4.0 systems such as deep-water culture (DWC) and media-based
    aquaponics. For this purpose, the “Production_System” class will be modified to
    include subclasses, instances and attributes related to the design configuration
    of aquaculture and hydroponic units. For instance, DWC uses more water for the
    hydroponics portion of the equipment with a ratio of about seven times as much
    water for plants as for the fish [67]. Hence, the design of grow bed, the capacity
    of fish tanks, and the specifications of biological and mechanical filters will
    be different from that of NFT- based aquaponics 4.0 system. This information is
    required to be modeled in AquaONT before using it for different aquaponics systems.
    The rest of AquaONT classes for different aquaponics setups will remain the same
    if leafy green vegetables are to be grown. In case, other crops such as fruits,
    root and flower vegetables are to be considered, then all other classes of AquaONT
    will have to be expanded. Overall, the concepts of AquaONT can be extended and
    reused in different aquaponics 4.0 systems. Other approaches such as empirical
    and theoretical, can be utilized to model the aquaponics 4.0 system [68]. These
    modeling techniques serve different objectives. For instance, an empirical approach
    that uses statistical models can be employed to perform analysis on historical
    data from previous experiments. This approach is useful to estimate potential
    factors affecting fish and crop production in the aquaponics systems, which can
    further be used in future experiments - making the utilization of costly research
    assets more effective. A theoretical approach such as mathematical modeling or
    system dynamic (SD) modeling can be employed to understand and optimize the farm
    for effective management and control of complex processes. The theoretical approach
    offers various benefits over the statistical approach. For instance, with theoretical
    models, it is possible to perform process simulation considering the hypothesis,
    comparative analysis of simulation results with observed data, evaluation of proposed
    model and hypothesis, and optimization of the system, whereas statistical models
    just confirm the hypothesis with no clear evidence of underlying processes [68].
    Developing a theoretical model, however, requires different parameters that usually
    comes from the empirical model [68]. A theoretical approach such as SD modeling
    is widely employed in literature to model the aquaponics system with many aims.
    These include understanding the dynamic behavior of different aquaponics processes
    such as crop and fish growth, waste production and filtration, greenhouse climate
    and hydroponics; evaluating the performance of multis-stage RAS; and estimating
    the energy-efficient greenhouse parameters [69], [70], [71]. SD modeling has proven
    an effective tool as it provides a simulation platform to represent real-world
    entities in the form of equations, which allows to understand and anticipate changes
    in complex systems. There are also few drawbacks of this modeling approach. For
    instance, to develop a complete dynamic model for a system, sub-models of all
    the contributing entities have to be built and then integrated to ensure process
    synchronization, which is a time-consuming process. In case, if a new entity must
    be added later on, a new dynamic model has to build for this entity and link with
    other sub-models. Moreover, different sub-systems and their dynamic models introduce
    complexities driven by time and spatial scales and multiple interactions among
    the factors [72]. With ontology modeling, however, it is easy to expand ontologies
    by incorporating new entities as classes and linking them with existing classes.
    But to exploit the full potential of the ontology model, it needs to be integrated
    with an external interface. While ontologies offer various advantages concerning
    storing knowledge and solving interoperability issues, they also face various
    challenges. For instance, knowledge is described as a priori in ontology models,
    making them less adaptable to systems where the notion is to predict and analyze
    behaviors of different environments and users [73]. These challenges can be resolved
    by integrating machine learning techniques with the ontology models in different
    applications. This is because machine learning supports the prediction and analysis
    of systems using classification, clustering, and association identification techniques
    – bringing adaptability in ontology-driven systems. However, one problem with
    machine learning models is that they struggle to explain the rationale for decision
    making, where multi-domain semantic modeling and rule-based reasoning can excel
    [32]. The idea of using cloud data and underlying essential semantic knowledge
    with learning algorithms preserves the interoperability and re-usability of classification
    processes and brings intelligence to systems. However, combining machine learning
    and ontology modeling is not sufficiently addressed in the agricultural domain,
    but there are several applications available in other domains, which are explained
    in section 2.4. These applications focus on improving cybersecurity, patient monitoring,
    design improvement, digital twin analysis, etc. Regarding ontology-driven IoT
    and AI systems for the agriculture sector, only a few studies are available which
    are explained towards the end of section 2.5. These applications mainly focus
    on cyber-attack detection and monitoring and controlling of IoT based farms. The
    reason behind limited research work in the agricultural sector in the context
    of ontology-driven AI systems or a combination of ontology modeling and machine
    learning approaches could be the complex dynamics of agricultural operations and
    the presence of complex biological processes. In this essence, AquaONT is a first
    step towards introducing an ontology model that can be integrated with machine
    learning models to bring intelligence in aquaponics 4.0 farms by autonomously
    managing the farm operations and providing solutions for farm design. 7. Conclusions
    An ontology model “AquaONT” is presented to model and store the knowledge of the
    aquaponics 4.0 system – a digital farm that uses smart technologies to improve
    the system’s design and operations. AquaONT provides information for optimal operation
    of IoT devices by comparing contextual data coming from a farm with standard/ideal
    data from experts, taking corrective actions on qualitative issues of crop and
    fish, and design configuration of grow beds based on crop characteristics, when
    integrated with the suitable interface. This information can assist farmers and
    users in clear decision-making regarding IoT devices, sensors, and other components
    necessary for farm development. To achieve remote control of the aquaponics 4.0
    farm’s operation, AquaONT can be integrated with the external interface, which
    will exploit the AquaONT knowledge to control the electronic devices installed
    at aquaponics 4.0 such as heaters, lights and fish feeders or humidifiers, etc.
    The knowledge of AquaONT can be extracted and used to get an insight into crop
    characteristics and their impact on the design of aquaponics’ grow beds, which
    can be used to make a decision support platform for parametric design automation.
    We will develop an autonomous decision support system in future work by integrating
    AquaONT and intelligent techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and
    computer vision for controlling farm operations and crop quality. Moreover, it
    is also possible to investigate the monetary benefits of parametric design automation
    of grow beds. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they

    • The adoption of new digital technologies in the agri-food value chain has been
    influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. • Data mining of Twitter content is
    useful to analyse the perceptions towards new digital technologies in the agri-food
    sector. • About 80% of the tweets regarding digital transformation of the agri-food
    sector showed a connection to positive emotions. • Understanding of the new digital
    technologies within the sector is related to sustainability and climate change
    concerns. • USA, India, UK, and Nigeria show higher number of tweets that relate
    new digital technologies to the agri-food sector. Abstract CONTEXT The agri-food
    system is undergoing pervasive changes in business models, facilitated by the
    use of digital technologies. Although today it is almost inevitable for any business
    to adopt some level of digital transformation to strengthen their competitiveness,
    this transition in the agri-food sector could be more complex, given its characteristics.
    OBJECTIVE The aim of the study is to analyse worldwide the perceptions of new
    digital technologies in the agri-food sector expressed within social media platforms,
    identifying the differences that may exist between them regarding its objectives
    and social acceptance. METHODS This paper examines the information regarding digital
    transformation process in the agri-food sector disseminated worldwide on Twitter.
    For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather tweets and descriptive and content
    analyses, including a sentiment analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software.
    RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector
    is broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these information
    flows, being companies and digital solution providers the most active users and
    academics and governmental institutions the most visible. Artificial Intelligence
    was the most mentioned technology, that together with the Internet of Things,
    Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production
    efficiencies, crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology,
    it was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies and
    marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the concept of sustainability.
    The sentiment analysis showed a generally positive tone, indicating social acceptance
    regarding the starting phase of the adoption of these technologies. The study
    also identified differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement
    with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic
    was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the sector all over
    the world. SIGNIFICANCE Our results demonstrate that data harvested from Twitter
    provide useful insight into perceptions of digital transformation and different
    digital technologies in the agri-food value chain across different countries.

    mining 1. Introduction The process of innovation development and adoption is perceived
    as complex, dynamic and uncertain (Silvestre and Ţîrcă, 2019). However, it is
    considered essential to enhance firms'' sustainable performance, to achieve the
    Sustainable Development Goals (Sachs et al., 2019). In this regard, sustainable
    innovation adopted by firms and the entire supply chain must include the adoption
    of new digital technologies aimed at improving the health of the planet and people,
    as well as efficiency and firm performance (Mondejar et al., 2021). Additionally,
    innovation in the agri-food sector has also been described as imperative to respond
    to new challenges related to sustainability, changing demand, and increased competition.
    The COVID-19 pandemic has also brought to light a need to build resilient food
    systems, motivating innovative collective actions along the entire agri-food chain
    (Bakalis et al., 2020). The use of new digital technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain Technologies,
    provides new opportunities to face these threats. Today, it is almost inevitable
    for any company to adopt some level of digital transformation to strengthen its
    competitiveness (Lu, 2017; Verhoef et al., 2021). Digital transformation is changing
    the way companies conduct business because it affects operational routines and
    creates new ways to network with customers, suppliers, and stakeholders (Cheng
    and Wang, 2021). It is evident that the development of this new business model
    requires the strengthening and redefining of firms'' capabilities (Matarazzo et
    al., 2021; Tortora et al., 2021). However, the transition towards digitalization
    could be complex in the agri-food sector, characterised by small and medium-sized
    enterprises (SMEs), and problems of generational renewal (Żmija et al., 2020),
    as well as a supposedly low level of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) skills and engagement (Marshall et al., 2020). Some authors have addressed
    the broad topic of digital transformation in agriculture, but most of them are
    focused on technical aspects of specific productions, such as improving productivity
    or logistic processes (Hunt and Daughtry, 2018; Rutten et al., 2013; Wathes et
    al., 2008; Wolfert et al., 2017). The social science field has recently started
    investigating various aspects of digital agriculture in relation to farm production
    systems, value chains, and food systems as a whole, regarding technology adoption
    and adaptation, farmers'' skills and attitudes, or policy processes (Klerkx et
    al., 2019). Although there is data available regarding the innovation management
    of companies, there are few studies regarding digital transformation processes
    in this sector, and most of them are focused on the adoption of particular technologies
    by farmers (Haberli et al., 2019; Yoon et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2021). Furthermore,
    the recent COVID-19 pandemic has forced companies, including the rural actors,
    to look into digital solutions to continue functioning, but our knowledge about
    its effect on the sector is still limited (Galanakis et al., 2021). Hence, a wider
    perspective including the overall societal acceptance of the digital transformation
    process of the agri-food sector is required to understand the adoption level,
    the importance and dynamics of different technologies, as well as the role played
    by different agents involved in the diffusion and adoption of this digital transformation,
    which will serve to define policy interventions promoting it (Parra-López et al.,
    2021; Rijswijk et al., 2021). To fill this gap, the present study aims to explore
    worldwide the public perceptions towards different new digital technologies in
    the agri-food sector and identify the putative differences regarding its social
    acceptance. We address this objective using the content published on this topic
    within a popular social media platform. In this regard, social media has become
    a usual tool to express opinions and sentiments or just share relevant information,
    changing the way in which people communicate (Li and Kent, 2021). This phenomenon
    presents opportunities and challenges for companies that are increasingly adopting
    social media as a communication channel, changing the ways they operate and relate
    to stakeholders (Paniagua et al., 2017). For these reasons, social media data
    has become a popular information source for academic research and other actors.
    Although it has been mainly focused on the analysis of food consumer behaviour
    (Mishra and Singh, 2018; Mostafa, 2013; Pindado and Barrena, 2020), Twitter has
    been also used as an entry point for understanding perceptions of specific digital
    innovations in the agri-food sector by the “industry, farmers, and the broader
    public” (Duncan et al., 2021, p. 1185). Among different social media platforms,
    Twitter was selected to conduct this study because it is not only one of the most
    popular social platforms, but it is also easy to find topics, trends, attitudes,
    and sentiments on it (Chamlertwat et al., 2012). Through Twitter data analysis,
    the main objective of this research is to assess the digital technology development
    stage in the agri-food sector, identifying differences between different technologies
    regarding its social acceptance across different countries. We analyse and compare
    the level of engagement towards different types of digital technologies, given
    their different technological intelligence functions and their disruptive character
    (Yang et al., 2021a). The research technique starts with Twitter data collection
    performed through the Twitter API (Academic Research access level). Keywords such
    as “digital transformation”, “artificial intelligence” or “agri-food” were used
    in the search query. The analysis of Twitter data to extract intelligence combined
    descriptive and content analysis, considering frequencies and the study of sentiments
    and emotions. The findings of this study will help us to acquire insights into
    the current and future digitalization trends in the agri-food sector and calibrate
    the influence of social networks'' impacts. In this regard, it will be possible
    to extract suggestions in order to improve the communication strategy regarding
    innovation adoption by different actors of the agricultural sector. The paper
    is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review of research work
    done in the use of social media data in the agri-food sector and offers an overview
    of the digital transition of the sector. Section 3 shows the research procedure
    and methodology, and Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 presents the discussion
    and conclusions, including managerial and research implications and future research
    perspectives. 2. Background 2.1. Digital transformation of the agri-food sector
    Innovation in our society is considered necessary to solve the current global
    challenges. In that regard, it has been argued that innovation systems need to
    be mission-oriented, trying to focus research and investments on solving critical
    problems, providing a solution or a concrete approach (Mazzucato et al., 2020).
    This view has also reached agricultural innovation systems, enabling a food system
    transformation (Klerkx and Begemann, 2020; Klerkx and Rose, 2020). Among other
    concepts, digital technology implementation and development (i.e., digital transformation)
    is one of the main pillars supporting the achievement of these challenges in the
    agri-food system (Shepherd et al., 2020). This kind of technology can be also
    considered as part of the Key Enabling Technologies (European Commission, 2009),
    which are seen as drivers for innovation applicable in multiple industries. The
    digital transformation process is a complex phenomenon discussed by experts, researchers,
    policymakers, and entrepreneurs, and it is considered to be a radical change in
    economy and production on a global scale (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019; Verhoef et
    al., 2021). In the recent academic literature it is possible to identify three
    phases in the digital transformation process: digitization, digitalization, and
    digital transformation (Brenner and Hartl, 2021; Verhoef et al., 2021). The concept
    of digitization refers to the conversion of information into digital formats by
    computers, in a bid to enhance efficiency (Loebbecke and Picot, 2015). Digitalization
    entails a deeper transformation that changes value creation activities or existing
    business processes, such as enhancing customer experiences, communication and
    distribution (Leviäkangas, 2016; Ramaswamy and Ozcan, 2016). Finally, digital
    transformation is the most pervasive phase, that involves the emergence of entirely
    new business models considered new to the focal firm or industry (Brenner and
    Hartl, 2021; Verhoef et al., 2021). It can be also argued that the digital transformation
    process could be different depending on the size and sector of the companies concerned
    because it is determined by some important characteristics, such as knowledge,
    R&D intensity, and technological assets (Aboelmaged, 2014; Chatterjee et al.,
    2021). In relation to these assets, (Garzoni et al., 2020) introduced a four-level
    approach to SMEs'' engagement in the adoption of digital technologies: digital
    awareness, enquirement, collaboration, and transformation. This outlook could
    be even more complicated when the diversity and complexity of the new digital
    technologies are taken into account (Ciarli et al., 2021). These can be categorised
    into four groups regarding their main application: efficiency technologies (e.g.,
    Cloud Computing), connectivity technologies (e.g., IoT), trust disintermediation
    technologies (e.g., Blockchain), and automation technologies (e.g., AI and Big
    Data) (Brenner and Hartl, 2021; Lanzolla et al., 2020). The implementation of
    these technologies in the agri-food sector has been happening for decades, however,
    it was mainly considered behind the concepts of precision agriculture, smart farming,
    digital agriculture, agriculture 4.0 or farm management decision systems (Klerkx
    et al., 2019). All of these terms could be part of the digital transformation
    because implies that management tasks in any part of the food system are based
    on data obtained from the use of different technologies (Duncan et al., 2021;
    Eastwood et al., 2019). However, Wolfert et al., (2017) discern between precision
    agriculture and smart farming, considering that the former is only focused on
    in-field variability but does not takes into account data. This idea could be
    refutable, given that precision agriculture involves a range of technologies that
    generate data to help in decision making (Bronson and Knezevic, 2016; Duncan et
    al., 2021). Nowadays, it seems that these enabling technologies have reached the
    whole food supply chain as part of the so-called Industry 4.0 (Lezoche et al.,
    2020; Trivelli et al., 2019). On the one hand, although positive effects of this
    revolution in the agri-food system in terms of the increased efficiency, productivity,
    and sustainability could be expected, there is a discussion about its socio-ethical
    implications (Eastwood et al., 2019) and the possible disagreement with agroecological
    approaches to reach a responsible innovation in the sector (Rotz et al., 2019).
    Moreover, there is a concern about the inequity in the design of digital farming
    innovations (Bronson, 2019) and the unequal relationships of power that the digital
    revolution could promote between players in the food system (Bronson and Knezevic,
    2016), or even its potential to directly include and exclude these players from
    the generated benefits (Klerkx and Rose, 2020). On the other hand, it has been
    reported that digital technologies could accelerate post-COVID-19 recovery (Rowan
    and Galanakis, 2020). In fact, the last report from the (World Bank, 2021) outlines
    how digital technologies based on data are springing up in transforming sectors,
    among which we can find agriculture. However, evolving from digitization to digital
    transformation appears to be challenging in the sector. Some reviews have identified
    the most common barriers to the adoption of digital technologies in the agri-food
    sector (Annosi et al., 2020; Giua et al., 2020; Jespersen et al., 2013). Some
    of them are related to firms'' internal resources, such as farm business characteristics,
    size, infrastructure, and financial availability (Bronson, 2019; Lawson et al.,
    2011). Other challenges are related to external resources, data complexity, transfer,
    and privacy, internet connectivity, the lack of appropriate incentives, and a
    suitable adequate legislative operating environment (Kernecker et al., 2020; Pivoto
    et al., 2019). Regarding firm factors, the development of specific competencies,
    named dynamic capabilities, is also considered essential to achieve the digital
    transformation of businesses (Matarazzo et al., 2021; Warner and Wäger, 2019).
    Finally, factors related to farmers'' personal characteristics, such as age, education,
    skills and knowledge of using ICT, perceived profitability, environmental-related
    behaviours, availability of time, or simply the willingness to implement new technologies,
    could be decisive to make possible the adoption of new digital technologies in
    the farming and food sectors, allowing its digital transformation (Alvarez and
    Nuthall, 2006; Bowen and Morris, 2019; Fountas et al., 2015; Tey and Brindal,
    2012). All of these emergent digital technologies have been considered as part
    of the game-changing innovations that will transform food production (Klerkx and
    Rose, 2020). However, given the aforementioned barriers to technology adoption,
    it is reasonable to assume that Agriculture 4.0 is still limited to a few innovative
    firms (Zambon et al., 2019), indicating that the sector could still be in a starting
    phase inside the digital transformation process. Currently, there is a lack of
    awareness about which are the most frequently adopted technologies, their limitations,
    and the conception of the agents involved, as well as those of society, all of
    which could strongly influence this process. More investigations are needed to
    explore if the theory around new digital technologies has been put into practice.
    2.2. Agri-food sector and social media data Nowadays, social media applications,
    such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, among others, are widely used
    in diverse settings and with different purposes. As an increasing number of users
    are moving towards social media platforms, companies find it imperative to use
    social media for brand building in order to create opportunities for customer
    engagement (Schaefers et al., 2021; Shawky et al., 2020). Over the past decade,
    social media has been recognized as a key strategic element of companies'' competitiveness
    (Braojos et al., 2019). For agri-food firms, the usage of social media has grown
    very fast. Indeed, the food industry is at the forefront of innovation in interactive
    marketing (Caiazza and Bigliardi, 2020). As an example, some of the major brands,
    such as Dr. Pepper, Kellogg''s and CocaCola, have experienced increased attention
    from digital marketing within these platforms (Montgomery et al., 2011). However,
    other studies indicate that agri-food SMEs and cooperatives are still on the way
    to achieving effective communication and interaction with their target public
    in the digital environment (Cristobal-Fransi et al., 2020). Leaving commercial
    purposes aside, many issues related to the agri-food sector are likely to be present
    in social media (Stevens et al., 2016). Discussion and interaction of people regarding
    topics such as animal welfare, GMO and food safety are very frequent (Price, 2021).
    This generates an opportunity for different actors in the agri-food system. For
    instance, social media applications are used for learning and collaboration among
    experts, entrepreneurs, farmers (Chowdhury and Odame, 2013; Mills et al., 2019;
    Phillips et al., 2018), and even the education community (Aguilar-Gallegos et
    al., 2021). It provides the opportunity to overcome the physical distance between
    actors and create networks directed to supporting agricultural innovation (Fielke
    et al., 2020). Hence, the analysis of social media data allows for studying real
    events, social interactions, network analysis and user behaviour. In this regard,
    Twitter can be considered one of the most popular microblogging platforms with
    199 million monetizable daily active users and 500 million messages tweeted every
    day (Aslam, 2022), providing the opportunity to interact with the audience without
    restriction and disseminate information rapidly (Moe and Schweidel, 2017). Moreover,
    Twitter data is considered to be “open data” because it allows businesses, practitioners
    or researchers to collect and analyse tweets through its API. Consequently, it
    has been already used for academic research in many fields (Karami et al., 2020)
    in order to analyse the current scenario but also to forecast upcoming trends
    related to any phenomenon in different locations. However, the study of Twitter
    to analyse the digital transformation process in general, and especially in the
    agri-food sector, is at a very early stage. Only a few authors have used social
    media data to analyse attitudes towards new digital technologies without considering
    the agri-food sector, such as public perception of the IoT (Bian et al., 2016)
    or Blockchain Technology (Mnif et al., 2021), the intention to accept robotics
    in the workplace (Sinha et al., 2020) and AI utilisation (Grover et al., 2020),
    in some cases combined with other methodologies. For that reason, our study tries
    to specifically analyse the perception of these technologies in the sector. Another
    important aspect is the possibility to analyse sentiments to gain an understanding
    of the opinions from which the engagement could be addressed (Caetano et al.,
    2018; Veltri and Atanasova, 2015). The emotional component of tweets has been
    used to understand social perception towards a specific phenomenon also in the
    agri-food sector, such as precision agriculture (Ofori and El-Gayar, 2021), consumer
    opinions towards food attributes (Borrero and Zabalo, 2021; Samoggia et al., 2020)
    and new food trends (Pindado and Barrena, 2020). However, these studies do not
    go in depth in the different technologies or the user profile that are key aspects
    of the current study. 3. Research procedure 3.1. Data collection In this research,
    we acquired Twitter data using R software and the Twitter application programming
    interface (API) through the “academictwitteR” package (Gentry, 2015). Twitter
    API, through the Academic Research access level, enables access to the full archive
    of tweets published on Twitter, providing a way to collect tweets and metadata.
    To get this access several requirements must be complied with, and an application
    form must be completed and approved1. To access the Twitter API the API key, API
    secret, access token and access token secret are required. These can be obtained
    from the Twitter Developer Platform. The “academictwitteR” package allows researchers
    to collect tweets containing specified words or sets of words, but it is possible
    to specify more complex queries to incorporate into the API call, such as geographic
    location, URLs and media content (Barrie and Ho, 2021). First, data is stored
    as separate JSON files (JavaScript Object Notation), but after applying a parsing
    method the output data can be stored as Comma Separated Values (CSV) or Excel
    files. Twitter data gathering can be difficult, considering that about 500 million
    tweets are generated per day (Karami et al., 2021). That makes 6000 tweets every
    second, and that makes essential a data sampling process, based on keywords and
    hashtags, as well as a time period restriction to extract relevant information.
    In this way, Twitter data related to new digital technologies in the agri-food
    sector were collected for a period of six months, from October 2020 to March 2021.
    This period of time, furthermore, was selected as representative of COVID-19 pandemic
    disruption in the agri-food sector which seems to have boosted the adoption of
    new digital technologies in the food industry and agriculture (Di Vaio et al.,
    2020; Rowan and Galanakis, 2020). The data collection methodology consisted of
    retrieving tweets containing any of these English words: “digitalization”, “digital
    transformation”, “big data”, “blockchain”, “artificial intelligence”, “AI”, “internet
    of things”, “IoT”, “machine learning”, “smart technologies”, “cloud computing”,
    “smart agriculture”, “agriculture 4.0”, “smart farming”, “digital agriculture”,
    always accompanied by “agri-food”, “agrifood” or “agriculture”. The use of these
    terms as keywords in the search query was based on their popularity and their
    presence in previous works related to digital transformation trends in the agri-food
    sector and the adoption of agriculture 4.0 or smart farming (Annosi et al., 2020;
    Klerkx et al., 2019; Rose and Chilvers, 2018)2. In this way, a majority of messages
    related to the broad topic of digital innovation in the agri-food sector were
    captured. An initial sample of 27,787 tweets was1 obtained, but due to the possibility
    of redundancies, duplicate tweets were removed, leaving 27,500. A filter criterion
    was applied and only geolocalised tweets were considered, obtaining a final number
    of 18,001 tweets that composed the working dataset. Although the above methodology
    to extract information from Twitter has been extensively used to investigate trends
    and public opinions regarding specific topics such as the digital transformation
    of tertiary industries (Sullivan et al., 2021), it is important to point out its
    potential to properly contextualize this research. Mainly, it cannot be considered
    that social media users are representative of the general population due to their
    users tend to be younger and more educated than non-users (Vaccari et al., 2013).
    Consequently, research using this source of information should be interpreted
    according to this self-selection (Mellon and Prosser, 2017). Furthermore, there
    may be other potential biases like the organic nature of the data —instead designed
    data—, bot intervention, dependence on the quality of the search terms, or the
    “the black box of APIs” (Chen et al., 2022). However, this data is especially
    useful to study emerging research topics due to the newness of the data, the inherent
    features of social media discussions (e.g., they are emergent and actual), and
    the easiness to capture data over large time periods (Chen and Tomblin, 2021;
    Groves, 2011; Klašnja et al., 2017). 3.2. Analytical framework We have to consider
    that the captured data and metadata from Twitter is in the form of unstructured
    text (informal expressions) but, at the same time, it is enriched (hashtags, followers,
    users, etc.) compared to traditional data stored in companies'' databases. It
    makes the analysis more challenging, especially without an available methodology,
    although some analytical frameworks have been proposed (Chae, 2015; Mishra and
    Singh, 2018). In this way, it turns out to be necessary to apply some research
    methods to mine intelligence from social media data. The detailed description
    of the proposed analytical framework that includes such methods is depicted in
    Fig. 1. It consists of two methodologies: descriptive analysis (DA) and content
    analysis (CA), the latter encompassing a sentiment analysis. Furthermore, the
    tweets were clustered by country (based on the most active countries in Twitter)
    or divided into six major digital technologies. Concretely, we use a technology
    classification that allows to capture the main I4.0 technologies within the agri-food
    sector discussed by Yadav et al. (2022) namely “Blockchain”, “IoT”, “Big Data”
    and “Cloud Computing”. Furthermore, we also classify the tweets that address “Machine
    Learning” technologies due to their relevance to the agricultural sector, as well
    as “AI” technologies due to this term tend to be used interchangeably with machine
    learning despite it is a specific approach of “AI” (Storm et al., 2020). Download

    Proposed Twitter analytics framework. 3.2.1. Descriptive analysis (DA) The main
    social analytics techniques include a descriptive analysis that allows for establishing
    the nature of both tweets and users when it is applied to analyse information
    coming from Twitter (tweets and metadata). It is based on various metrics and
    statistics, such as the number of tweets, the number of hashtags, unique users,
    retweets and classification of tweets into different types, among others (Bruns
    and Stieglitz, 2013). This analysis is especially useful for intelligence extraction
    in Twitter analyses, given the enormous size and the enriched nature (e.g., users,
    hashtags, and URLs) of Twitter data. A broad but crucial view of the data could
    be obtained as prior knowledge on which to base a more detailed analysis. The
    information regarding the number of tweets per user, replies or retweets of each
    tweet shows the most active or visible users, groups of users regarding their
    activities, and other useful user-related information (Joseph et al., 2017). It
    must be recalled that other metrics could be used to address different problems
    but they must be appropriately selected for each case of study. 3.2.2. Content
    analysis (CA) CA allows for mining intelligence from the captured tweets that
    are in the form of unstructured texts (Krippendorff, 2004). An important step
    in text analysis and classification, previous to the CA, is data pre-processing
    (e.g., cleaning, removing noise), which includes the removal of links, non-Latin
    characters, numbers and users (Pindado and Barrena, 2020). CA can be performed
    by automatic text processing methods, based on text capturing and machine learning
    algorithms. First, text capturing techniques (Weiss et al., 2005) transformed
    the initial unstructured text into formatted data. Then, the techniques that we
    used for mining intelligence were word frequency analysis, term association analysis,
    thematic clustering, hashtag analysis and sentiment analysis (Mishra and Singh,
    2018). Word frequency is based on detecting the number of occurrences of a word
    in a tweet or at the entire dataset level. The hashtag analysis (frequency and
    association) served as an information source about the fields that were more related
    to the topic of interest and demonstrated how popular the topics are and how topics
    are related (Petersen and Gerken, 2021). Sentiment analysis can be considered
    to be part of CA, dealing with people''s opinions, attitudes, and emotions about
    any topic expressed in written texts (Liu, 2015). In general, sentiment analysis
    methods are based on opinion extraction and sentiment classification into positive,
    negative, or neutral categories. The analysis can be performed on an entire tweet
    dataset to reveal the overall sentiment, but it can be also applied to clusters
    or specific sub-groups. One of the most widespread methods is called the dictionary-based
    method, based on using a pre-existing lexicon with information about which words
    and sentences are positive and which are negative (Wilson et al., 2009) so that
    sentiment scores are calculated by pointwise mutual information measures. We followed
    this method using the Syuzhet dictionary (Jokers, 2017), using the “Sentimentr”
    package (Rinker, 2017), which takes into account contextual valence shifters of
    the sentences contained in each tweet. Finally, we conducted an analysis of variance
    (ANOVA) and Tukey''s HSD post hoc test to address significant differences among
    the average emotion scores of each digital technology. 4. Results 4.1. Descriptive
    analysis (DA) Tweet metrics. The collecting method described in the previous section
    resulted in the identification of 18,001 original tweets involved in the use of
    digital technologies in the agri-food sector (without considering retweets). This
    highlights the relevance of Twitter as a way to spread the latest trends about
    digitalization in the sector. Although the number of tweets could be considered
    stable over the analysed period, we can see a decrease in the number of those
    posted during the Christmas season and also a periodic decrease at weekends (Fig.
    2). 45% of tweets in this data collection were retweeted by other users and close
    to 14% of them were replied to. Additionally, 38% of tweets refer to other users
    and address messages to them. We found tweets coming from a total of 142 countries.
    However, there were important differences among them regarding the number of posted
    tweets due to the use of English words in the search query language. The USA was
    the leading country in terms of the number of tweets with 28.6% of the total dataset.
    It was followed by India, the UK and Nigeria, with means of 14.3%, 10.9%, and
    5.6%, respectively. The 25 most active countries represent >90% of tweets in the
    dataset (Supplementary Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (333KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Tweets posted during the analysed period. Regarding
    hashtags (i.e., words or phrases prefixed by #) that highlight certain topics,
    we found 7970 different hashtags in the tweets with 65% of them (11,649 tweets)
    containing one or more hashtags. Additionally, nearly 90% (16,102) of the total
    tweets contained one or more URLs. The most popular URLs were companies'' websites
    and articles about initiatives or examples that described how to implement the
    new digital technologies in agriculture. We also clustered the tweets in terms
    of six popular digital technologies found in the dataset. From 18,001 tweets,
    4125 specifically mention AI technology (23% of tweets). It was followed by blockchain
    and IoT with 7.3% and 6.7%, respectively. Machine Learning and Big Data are less
    frequently mentioned and are present in 4.5% and 3.6% of the tweets, respectively.
    Cloud computing is noticeably the least popular technology (0.3%). It is worth
    mentioning that half of the tweets did not contain a specific mention of any of
    these technologies, they were related to more general concepts such as digitalization
    or smart farming. User metrics. We found 9004 unique users in the dataset. It
    means that each user posted two tweets on average. However, this does not reflect
    reality, because we found important differences regarding the activity of users.
    Indeed, we found that 10% of users accounted for 47% of tweets. The most active
    users were calculated based on the number of posted tweets (Table 1). At the same
    time, we have the most visible users, defined by a higher number of received retweets
    and replies (Table 2). Comparing both kinds of users, we found that they were
    not the same; the users with more tweets were not necessarily the most visible
    ones. The company FarmWise was one of the most active accounts and it was also
    in a good position regarding its visibility (20th position). The most active users
    tend to be companies, mainly from North America, India, or Europe (Table 1). In
    the case of the most visible users, they are mainly individual accounts, some
    of them belonging to governmental institutions, predominantly from Asia and Africa
    (Table 2). Moreover, we found users with different profiles, such as consultants,
    media, or foundations/groups, pointing to different technology adoption phases
    depending on these more dynamic agents. We observed that 7% of unique users identified
    were verified accounts, which are “accounts of public interest”, corresponding
    to significant entities such as academic institutions, governments, politicians,
    news organizations, journalists, companies, activists, as well as other influential
    individuals3. Table 1. Most active users (top 10 users by number of tweets). User

    number of followers —the most basic popularity measure of Twitter users—, we found
    that >70% of the users had between 100 and 10,000 followers (Fig. 3), indicating
    that the majority of users interested in the digital transformation of the agri-food
    sector cannot be considered to be opinion leaders. However, we found 12 users
    with >5 million followers (Fig. 3), mainly accounts of media firms or news agencies.
    It is worth mentioning that the account of the United Nations is involved in this
    topic, as also is Microsoft. Download : Download high-res image (178KB) Download

    the number of followers. 4.2. Content analysis (CA) We performed an in-depth analysis
    tackling tweets'' content through a word, hashtag, and sentiment analysis. Word
    analysis involved word frequency and word combination frequency at the dataset
    and clustered document levels according to tweet location (countries) or six top
    technologies (AI, Big Data, IoT, Blockchain, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing).
    Hashtag analyses included hashtag frequency analysis. Sentiment analysis, including
    polarity and emotion analysis, was conducted of the entire number of tweets and
    clustered documents (by country or technology). Word analysis. The most popular
    words in tweets (once we remove those that were used as keywords in the search
    query) were food (found in 1740 tweets), climate (1606), farmers (1526) and technology
    (1319), among others (Table 3A). We then analysed how many times a particular
    sequence of two words appears in the dataset (Table 3B). This provides information
    regarding those aspects which were getting attention on Twitter related to the
    digitalization of the agri-food sector. It is worth mentioning that words related
    to the COVID-19 pandemic were present in the data set, such as “covid”, “pandemic”,
    “vaccine”, “coronavirus” and “lockdown”. In general, 2.5% of tweets contained
    a reference related to the COVID-19 pandemic, showing a link with the use of digital
    technologies in the agri-food sector. Some of the most frequent word combinations
    were: “impact of covid”, “agriculture market covid” or “producers overcome covid”.

    in the four most active countries: USA, India, UK, and Nigeria. In this case,
    we kept the words that are part of the search query in order to analyse the differences
    regarding the technologies among countries. We showed that AI was the most often
    mentioned technology in these four countries (Supplementary Table 2 and 3). The
    least common technology was the same in all countries; Cloud Computing. However,
    we found differences regarding the popularity of the remaining technologies among
    countries. IoT and Blockchain are the second and third most popular technologies
    in all of them except for Nigeria, where Big Data is more frequent than these
    two technologies. Regarding COVID-19, we found that around 3.2% of tweets in both
    the USA and UK were associated with this pandemic. By contrast, India and Nigeria
    only showed 1.8 and 1.3% of tweets directly related to COVID-19. We further clustered
    the tweets in terms of six popular digital technologies (Blockchain, IoT, Big
    Data, Cloud Computing, AI and Machine Learning) and then conducted word analysis
    (Table 4). When we analysed the association of each technology with COVID-19,
    we found that Big Data, Blockchain and AI seems to be more related to the pandemic
    (close to 3% of tweets) compared with the remaining technologies (lower than 1%
    of tweets). In the case of Cloud Computing, we could not find any reference to
    the COVID-19 pandemic. Table 4. Detailed word analysis (2-word combination frequency)

    5.0 Hashtag analysis. In our dataset 7971 hashtags were found and they appeared
    53,766 times. Moreover, 65% (11,649) of these tweets contained one or more hashtags.
    The most popular hashtags, without considering the digital technologies, were:
    #agriculture, #technology, #farming, #smart, #agtech, #agitech, #futureofag, #digital,
    #innovation, #sustainability, #robotics, #digitaltransformation, #farmers, #datascience,
    #agribusiness, #automation, #food, #startup and #climatechange, among others.
    It has not escaped our notice that hashtags related to the COVID-19 pandemic were
    also present, but to a lesser extent (e.g., #covid19, #covid, #coronavirus, #pandemic).
    Sentiment analysis. Fig. 4 shows the sentiments at the entire dataset level. The
    most important idea was that >80% of tweets (14,691) tended to be slightly positive
    with a score from 0 to 1. Close to 10% were considered neutral (score = 0) and
    only 8% of tweets were slightly negative with a score from 0 to −1. Very few tweets
    showed a relatively strong positive or negative sentiment. Download : Download

    into detail about sentiment analysis, we performed an analysis of emotions, mining
    different kinds of sentiments from the tweets. In Fig. 5, we can see the most
    frequent emotions in the entire dataset. The emotions considered to be positive
    were predominant, especially trust and joy. When we analysed the emotions in the
    clustered documents by technology, we found that they were quite similar to those
    observed for the entire dataset (Fig. 5). However, among technologies, it can
    be highlighted that there was a significantly higher sentiment of trust in tweets
    associated with machine learning compared with the other technologies. Another
    positive emotion, as is joy, was more associated with machine learning and AI,
    followed by blockchain. However, it can be seen that AI is also more significantly
    related to fear, which is a negative emotion, compared with other technologies.

    indicate significant differences (p < 0.05, ANOVA). 5. Discussion and conclusions
    The broad topic of digital transformation in the agri-food sector is addressed
    on Twitter because it was possible to identify >18,000 geolocalised related tweets
    in a period of 6 months. However, compared to the 500 million tweets that are
    sent per day (Karami et al., 2021), this is a very small proportion. We found
    that the USA was the main country involved in this topic, as well as the leading
    country in terms of the number of Twitter users worldwide (Statista, 2021). However,
    we showed that the countries where Twitter is particularly popular (Statista,
    2021) are not necessarily the countries that were tweeting more about digital
    technologies in the agri-food sector. In general, our data indicate that there
    were few countries with a relatively important activity in this regard: USA, India,
    and UK. The analysis also revealed information about the characteristics of the
    users. We found that some of the most active users (higher number of tweets in
    the analysed period) were shown to be companies advertising digital solutions.
    However, these companies did not have a high level of visibility (in terms of
    replies and retweets), indicating that the aim of their social media strategy
    is more related to promotional and advertising activities, rather than to engaging
    with business partners or clients (Juntunen et al., 2020). The most visible users
    were individual users, some of them related to academia, but also governmental
    institutions and politicians. It means that the information tweeted by this kind
    of user was more widespread than those posted by companies. In fact, it is said
    that a user retweets when he has trust in the author (Firdaus et al., 2018), so
    it seems that official or institutional Twitter accounts are more reliable in
    the view of other Twitter users. Indeed, we found that percentage of verified
    accounts (7%) in the dataset is higher than the average of Twitter 2%, which reveals
    that verified accounts with supposed high-credibility play an important role in
    the dissemination of the information regarding the digital transformation of the
    agri-food sector compared to other public discussions (Yang et al., 2021b). However,
    despite the growing interest in digital agriculture within policy circles (Klerkx
    et al., 2019), governmental accounts do not seem to participate actively in the
    discussion of this process within the social media platforms. This is in line
    with the fact that agricultural extension services traditionally have used farmer
    field days and workshops, as well as face-to-face programs, to diffuse agricultural
    innovations (Norton and Alwang, 2020). The use of social media like Twitter has
    started to gain increasing relevance as a diffusion mechanism for governments
    and agricultural extension services but they use these platforms to disseminate
    information in a top-down approach with lower levels of engagement (Phillips et
    al., 2021). Consequently, we found that despite the higher levels of these accounts
    in terms of their visibility they do not fully exploit Twitter as a platform of
    knowledge exchange for the digital transformation of the sector (Klerkx, 2021).
    The analysis also showed that users involved in the digital transformation process
    of the agri-food sector could be less active compared to those interested in other
    topics in terms of the average number of original tweets per user (Chae, 2015).
    Furthermore, the mentions of this topic on Twitter are not concentrated in a few
    users (Chae, 2015). These results, linked to the different profiles of these users
    (e.g., individual users, companies, institutions, media), indicate that a broad
    range of users were generating content on Twitter without clear leadership. This
    could suggest that different actors in the agri-food sector are involved in the
    process of digital transformation, from farmers, producers, through to the food
    industry, the supply chain and finishing in the market. This evidence is supported
    in the literature, where it can be seen that all agri-food related stakeholders
    are making efforts to apply these technologies that play a key role in their operations
    and decision-making (Lezoche et al., 2020). Additionally, it must be considered
    that Twitter supports a variety of communicative practices, and tweets are disseminated
    to converse with individuals, groups and the general public. We found that the
    number of direct conversations regarding digital transformation in the agri-food
    sector is higher than other studies addressing other topics within the sector,
    such as supply chains (Chae, 2015). Moreover, the proportion of tweets that were
    retweeted is high compared to other studies (Boyd et al., 2010; Chae, 2015), indicating
    that the content regarding digital transformation process in the agri-food sector
    is more widespread. Likewise, we found that the percentage of tweets that contained,
    at least, one hashtag is higher than other studies analysing new technologies
    in other sectors (Bougie et al., 2011). All these aspects indicate that tweets
    related to the digital transformation of the agri-food sector seem to be more
    conversational and engaging than random tweet samples or tweets related to other
    topics. This finding reveals how Twitter may serve as a useful platform for collective
    and individual learning regarding the digitalization of this sector (Klerkx, 2021;
    Phillips et al., 2021). Regarding the content, we found that more than half of
    tweets dealt with general aspects of the digital transformation process in the
    sector, such as smart farming or precision agriculture, rather than mention the
    use of specific digital technologies. However, it is interesting to specify that
    a quarter of the tweets were related to AI, which seems to be the most popular
    technology by far. This popularity could come from the conception of AI as an
    umbrella term that encompasses, in many cases, IoT (sensors that collect huge
    amounts of data), Big Data and Machine Learning (algorithms to analyse the data).
    Despite that, our results indicated increasing attention on the potential of AI
    in the agri-food sector. A recent study suggested a more active adoption of AI
    in North America and Europe, although Asia and Africa were also making smaller
    but increasing efforts (Lakshmi and Corbett, 2020), that are in accordance with
    our results. It is also remarkable that Big Data technology, which is considered
    to be at an early stage but with high potential in agriculture (Moysiadis et al.,
    2021), is one of the least mentioned digital technologies, together with Cloud
    Computing. These results contrast with the Future of Jobs Survey conducted by
    the (World Economic Forum, 2020), where business leaders identify the most popular
    technologies that are likely to be adopted by companies in the agriculture, food
    and beverages sector in 2025: IoT and Big Data, followed by Cloud Computing and
    AI. It seems that AI catches more of the attention of the general public compared
    with that of entrepreneurs in the sector and the reason could be that AI for the
    extended agri-food supply chain is only beginning to emerge (Monteiro and Barata,
    2021). The word combination analysis of clustered documents by technologies allowed
    us to differentiate the activities of the agri-food sector that were prone to
    adopt each digital technology. All of them, except for Blockchain, were related
    to the digitalization of the agricultural production and highlighted the smart
    farming or precision agriculture concepts within this digitalization process.
    This idea is in accordance with a growing body of literature that recognizes the
    essential role of digital emerging technologies in precision agriculture (Charania
    and Li, 2020) that allow for the developing of Decision Support Systems based
    on data analysis and data mining. This links with the recurrent idea found in
    these tweets about the potential of these technologies to improve efficiencies,
    crop yields and reduce production costs, especially in the case of AI and IoT.
    However, it seems that Blockchain technology is mainly applied to distribution
    or commercialization because those tweets are more related to the supply chain,
    traceability, and food safety. This evidence is supported in the literature, where
    it is possible to identify Blockchain applicability to improve food quality, safety
    standards and supply chain monitoring and tracking, especially when it is integrated
    with IoT technology (Dey and Shekhawat, 2021; Kamilaris et al., 2019; Torky and
    Hassanein, 2020). When the word combination frequencies were analysed in the most
    active countries, what was said in USA, India and UK could be quite similar, focused
    on the use of these technologies mainly in agriculture. Although comparing India
    with USA and UK could be noteworthy because this country is predominantly engaged
    in smallholder agriculture, India can be considered as an emerging economy focused
    on technology development and the view on how to manage the digital transformation
    in the sector could be closer to those of developed countries (Mondal and Basu,
    2009). However, the speech in Nigeria was different, because most of the tweets
    were focused on a specific initiative to promote climate smart agriculture in
    the country. Those differences can be considered understandable, taking into account
    that the challenges facing the agri-food sector depend on the economic status
    and development level of each country (Anastasiadis et al., 2018). As an example,
    AI technology seems to be unevenly distributed between developed and developing
    economies (Vinuesa et al., 2020). In general, it could be possible to understand
    that they are in different phases of the digitalisation process, although the
    phenomenon of digital transformation goes beyond the binary of developed and developing
    countries (Freidberg, 2017), with an agricultural sector habitually working in
    a global competitiveness context with a major sustainability supply chain requirements.
    The topics linked to the digital transformation process in the agri-food sector
    in Twitter were very diverse, evidenced by the high number of hashtags in the
    data. Some of the most frequent words and hashtags in the dataset were related
    to concern about the environment, such as “climate change” or “sustainable agriculture”.
    This is not surprising, as it has been globally proclaimed that digitalisation
    is of critical importance to environmental sustainability (Wyckoff and Pilat,
    2017). This is in line with the growing expectations about the potential environmental
    benefits of digital transformation in agriculture noted by the literature addressing
    both concepts (Del Río Castro et al., 2021; Isensee et al., 2020). This view is
    close to the concept of S3enterprise that can define Agriculture 4.0: “sensing”
    (detect events, acquire data and measure changes that occur in a physical environment),
    “smart” (analyse situations and make decisions based on the available data in
    a predictive or adaptive manner) and “sustainability” (optimise performance considering
    social, economic and environmental balance) (Miranda et al., 2019). However, the
    empirical evidence that demonstrates the environmental gains as a result of the
    adoption of digital technologies in the agri-food sector is still scarce (Clapp
    and Ruder, 2020; Klerkx and Rose, 2020). Moreover, it was possible to extract
    an idea about the connection between COVID-19 and digital transformation in the
    sector because we found some tweets that regarded the COVID-19 pandemic as a digital
    push (Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2021). It is true that the impacts of the COVID-19
    pandemic and the response mechanisms have been different for large companies,
    SMEs and small scale farming systems (Lopez-Ridaura et al., 2021). In this regard,
    we found that in the USA and UK this idea is more broadly supported in social
    media than in other kinds of countries where the agriculture sector is in a different
    phase of development. However, many tweets coming from Europe and the USA refer
    to the potential of implementing digital technologies in the agri-food sector
    of developing countries to overcome the consequences of the pandemic. Finally,
    trying to analyse the perception of new digital technologies in the agri-food
    sector, we showed that the dataset contained a relatively low sentiment level.
    This finding is not surprising given the content of tweets is mostly focused on
    events, news or advertising, that differs from the kind of tweets that usually
    have stronger sentiments, such as complaints or discussions related to consumer
    behaviour (Pindado and Barrena, 2020). Although we found a weak level of sentiment,
    we did find a trend towards positivity, which is interesting considering the disruptive
    character of these technologies. In fact, the public may perceive digital technologies
    as a threat in the context of improving agricultural efficiencies (Driessen and
    Heutinck, 2015). However, our results are in line with a study performed in Germany,
    where people showed a predominantly positive attitude towards the use of digital
    farming technologies (Pfeiffer et al., 2021). The analysis of specific emotions
    supports the idea of the positive tone in the data because trust and joy showed
    higher scores compared to anger, fear, disgust, or sadness. Most interestingly,
    it was possible to associate some of these emotions with specific digital technologies.
    We showed that AI-related tweets were significantly closer to the emotion of fear,
    which seems negative a priori. However, we realised that the emotion of fear was
    related to the concern about global issues, such as agriculture, food demand or
    climate change, and AI was shown as a way to solve them. The significantly higher
    sentiment of trust in tweets related to Machine Learning, but also to Blockchain
    and AI compared with the remaining technologies was also notable. The general
    trend in Twitter was to express confidence towards the potential use of these
    new digital technologies that could be indicative of a generalised acceptance
    by society, taking into account the early phase of adoption of these technologies
    in the sector. 5.1. Implications Derived from our findings and the proposed approach
    it is possible to draw some implications for government, rural actors, or researchers.
    First of all, we have to realise that the use of social media by the government
    has evolved from the distribution of propaganda to transparent communication and
    engagement with the general public (Bonsón et al., 2019; Mergel and Bretschneider,
    2013). Taking advantage of that new way of interaction, the methodology proposed
    here could be useful to identify attitudes towards governmental opinions, regulations,
    or subsidies regarding the digital transformation process in the agri-food sector.
    Likewise, considering the findings reported in this study, public institutions
    should improve their interaction with agricultural producers and consumers within
    the social media platforms to improve the knowledge exchange and learning mechanisms
    that may boost agricultural digitalization (Klerkx, 2021). In the case of agricultural
    companies and farmers social media may be used to increase brand loyalty and reputation
    (Swani et al., 2014). In that case, the descriptive analysis could indicate their
    popularity and reputation. Sentiment analysis of the tweets mentioning them can
    enable the measurement of how the content of their tweets is perceived by professionals
    or clients. Additionally, this approach allows them to identify what kind of users
    are reacting to their posts, and analyse if they are reaching the target audience
    or if they need to expand their brand community on social media sites (Zaglia,
    2013). Additionally, the research design shows the possibility of using Twitter
    data for research regarding the digital transformation process in the agri-food
    sector. Through the Twitter API, researchers have the opportunity to access Twitter
    data, which is interesting in terms of size, speed, and variety. The analysis
    of social media data has been recently researched (Ghani et al., 2019), showing
    its potential as a new data source, which could complement the existing ones in
    the context of Social Representation Theory (Bäckström et al., 2003; Gaspar et
    al., 2014; Ribeiro et al., 2016). 5.2. Limitations and future research Despite
    the contributions made, this research presents some limitations. Starting from
    the data source, the use of Twitter data may not be strongly demographically representative
    of the general population as users tend to be younger, more educated and live
    in urban areas (Bian et al., 2016; Vidal et al., 2015). However, social media
    data could be useful for researchers as long as their limitations are recognized
    (Chae, 2015; Pindado and Barrena, 2020). Related to the data collection, the selected
    period, keywords, and language, despite being selected to address the specific
    objective of this study, could be considered to be limitations. In this regard,
    future research using Twitter data should use extended periods to corroborate
    the findings revealed here. Moreover, the keywords that we used in the search
    query were carefully selected but could have been different or included a wider
    range of concepts that could be contemplated in future studies. Linked to this
    aspect, we only considered tweets posted in English because it is the predominant
    language on Twitter but retrieving tweets in different languages could contribute
    to the understanding of differences among countries and regions. Likewise, the
    detailed analysis of the geolocation of the tweets could provide relevant insights
    into how the social representations of digital transformation are determined.
    With this overview, we consider that future research related to the transition
    towards digitalization in the agri-food sector should be focused on the factors
    that have an influence on its feasible implementation, such as knowledge or awareness
    of the technologies, their usefulness and perceived adoption costs, given that
    the disruptive digital technologies are in an emergent phase (Klerkx and Rose,
    2020). Finally, we consider that the study of digital technology adoption from
    a social perspective is urgently needed. The progressive adoption of digital technologies
    by firms implies the development of new skills and capabilities that will leverage
    each technology to the fullest to drive innovation and optimise processes. In
    that regard, companies, including the rural alternatives, have to be aware of
    this phenomenon regarding digital transformation that accelerates the shift in
    workforce skills and thus, the analysis of the whole range of factors that could
    act as drivers and barriers to digital transformation would be required. CRediT

    \ Early prediction of winter wheat yield at the regional scale is essential for\
    \ food policy\nmaking and food security, especially in the context of population\
    \ growth and climate change. Agri-\ncultural big data and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) are key technologies for smart agriculture, bringing\ncost-effective solutions\
    \ to the agricultural sector. Deep learning-based crop yield forecast has cur-\n\
    rently emerged as one of the key methods for guiding agricultural production.\
    \ In this study, we\nproposed a Bayesian optimization-based long- and short-term\
    \ memory model (BO-LSTM) to con-\nstruct a multi-source data fusion-driven crop\
    \ growth feature extraction algorithm for winter wheat\nyield prediction. The\
    \ yield prediction performance of BO-LSTM, support vector machine (SVM), and\n\
    least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was then compared with\
    \ multi-source data\nas input variables. The results showed that effective deep\
    \ learning hyperparameter optimization is\nmade possible by Bayesian optimization.\
    \ The BO-LSTM (RMSE = 177.84 kg/ha, R2 = 0.82) model had\nthe highest accuracy\
    \ of yield prediction with the input combination of “GPP + Climate + LAI + VIs”.\n\
    BO-LSTM and SVM (RMSE = 185.7 kg/ha, R2 = 0.80) methods outperformed linear regression\
    \ Lasso\n(RMSE = 214.5 kg/ha, R2 = 0.76) for winter wheat yield estimation. There\
    \ were also differences\nbetween machine learning and deep learning, BO-LSTM outperformed\
    \ SVM. indicating that the\nBO-LSTM model was more effective at capturing data\
    \ correlations. In order to further verify the\nrobustness of the BO-LSTM method,\
    \ we explored the performance estimation performance of BO-\nLSTM in different\
    \ regions. The results demonstrated that the BO-LSTM model could obtain higher\n\
    estimation accuracy in regions with concentrated distribution of winter wheat\
    \ cultivation and less\ninﬂuence of human factors. The approach used in this study\
    \ can be expected to forecast crop yields,\nboth in regions with a deﬁcit of data\
    \ and globally; it can also simply and effectively forecast winter\nwheat yields\
    \ in a timely way utilizing publicly available multi-source data.\nKeywords: yield\
    \ prediction; deep learning; BO-LSTM; remote sensing; meteorological data\n1.\
    \ Introduction\nWheat is one of the top three crops in the world and is an important\
    \ source of calories,\nprotein, and many micronutrients for humans [1,2]. However,\
    \ there are many constraints\nin production that pose serious threats to the stable\
    \ and high yield potential of wheat, for\nexample, increased temperature, increased\
    \ precipitation variability, and frequent extreme\nevents [3,4]. Therefore, early\
    \ prediction of crop yield before harvest is of great value for\nour food security\
    \ and trade.\nTraditional crop yield assessment is carried out through ﬁeld surveys\
    \ during the crop\ngrowing season or based on previous experience of crop growth\
    \ conditions, a method\nthat has reliability issues related to sampling and non-sampling\
    \ errors in data collection\nand data processing due to small samples and limited\
    \ human resources to obtain the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 3194. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12123194\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 3194\n2 of 15\nrequired\
    \ sampling frequency and sample size, and the variability of the climate from\
    \ year\nto year makes traditional yield forecasts inaccurate and unstable [5].\
    \ The development\nof remote sensing technology has enabled large-scale crop yield\
    \ prediction. Researchers\nhave widely used remotely sensed vegetation indices\
    \ and crop yields to build statistical\nregression models for yield estimation.\
    \ Commonly used vegetation indices (VIs) are\nnormalized difference vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), near-\ninfrared reﬂectance of\
    \ vegetation (NIRv), and leaf area index (LAI) [6–8]. Some researchers\nhave also\
    \ used the wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) and solar induced\nchlorophyll\
    \ ﬂuorescence (SIF) to model crop yield estimates [9,10]. Researchers are now\n\
    utilizing non-linear models more frequently for yield estimation because crop\
    \ yield is\nintimately tied to external environmental factors; meteorological\
    \ variables affect crop\ngrowth, development, and ﬁnal yield in a non-linear manner\
    \ and often have complicated\nrelationships [11–14].\nMachine learning and deep\
    \ learning methods are often used to achieve accurate\npredictions of various\
    \ crop yields, especially deep learning, and the application of deep\nlearning\
    \ to estimate crop yields has been a popular algorithm among researchers in recent\n\
    years. Different deep learning models have so far been used to estimate yield\
    \ for various\ncrops, highlighting the importance of deep learning network frameworks.\
    \ Mainstream\ndeep learning models include convolutional neural network (CNN)\
    \ and recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) [15–18]. CNN models can better handle the\
    \ spatial autocorrelation of\nremote sensing images, but they cannot adequately\
    \ consider the complex temporal correla-\ntion [19]. And RNN is a sort of neural\
    \ network that primarily models sequence-type data by\ntaking sequence data as\
    \ input and using the correlation between sequence data to execute\nrecursion\
    \ in the direction of sequence evolution [20]. RNN, however, suffers from gradi-\n\
    ent disappearance, gradient explosion, and inadequate long-term memory capacity\
    \ with\ntime step iteration. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an excellent variant\
    \ of the RNN\nmodel, which not only has the characteristics of the RNN model,\
    \ but also effectively avoids\nthe undesirable situations such as gradient explosion\
    \ and gradient disappearance, etc.\nIt introduces the “gate” control structure,\
    \ sets the internal gate mechanism, trains the\nweights of the input gate, forget\
    \ gate and output gate, realizes the automatic screening\nand fusion of temporal\
    \ features, and has better prediction and ﬁtting performance for\ndata [21,22].\
    \ HAIDER et al. [23] showed that the LSTM neural network model has much\nhigher\
    \ yield estimation accuracy than RNN. JIANG et al. [24] estimated county-level\
    \ maize\nyields based on an LSTM neural network model using maize growth period\
    \ as a time\nseries by combining crop phenology information, meteorological data,\
    \ and remote sensing\ndata. The results showed that the LSTM neural network model\
    \ was able to extract the\nimplied relationships contained in the data series,\
    \ achieve accurate county-level crop yield\nestimation, and provide robust yield\
    \ estimation under extreme weather conditions. Huiren\nTian et al. [25] used LSTM\
    \ to estimate wheat yield with different time steps, evaluating the\ncomparison\
    \ with back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine.\nThe\
    \ results of this study indicated that the LSTM model outperformed BPNN and SVM\n\
    in estimating crop yield and is robust to climate and site ﬂuctuations. Time series\
    \ data as\ndeep learning samples have been extensively studied at this stage [24,26].\
    \ Therefore, the\nsamples used for training deep learning models mainly include\
    \ remote sensing data and\nmeteorological data based on multiple fertility periods\
    \ and long time series, which provide\na basis for further improving the accuracy\
    \ of yield estimation.\nThe network structure of deep learning is complex with\
    \ many hyperparameters, and\nmany scholars use deep learning algorithms to estimate\
    \ crop yield by using empirical\nmethods to determine the values of these hyperparameters.\
    \ The combination of hyperpa-\nrameters is very important to the prediction accuracy\

    \ can improve the training accuracy of the model\nand the generalization ability\
    \ of the test set. In order to speed up the training of neural\nnetworks, save\
    \ training cost, and improve network performance, the optimization of LSTM\nneural\
    \ network model hyperparameters using the Bayesian optimization algorithm is\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 3194\n3 of 15\nproposed. Commonly used hyperparameter optimization\
    \ methods include grid search [27],\nrandom search, and particle swarm optimization\
    \ algorithms [28]. The idea of the grid\nsearch algorithm is exhaustive search;\
    \ the search time of this method increases exponen-\ntially with the number of\
    \ parameters. For the case of more hyperparameters, this method\nfaces performance\
    \ problems. The results obtained by random search vary widely each time,\nand\
    \ there is the problem of poor accuracy. The particle swarm optimization calculation\n\
    is easy to fall into local optimum, resulting in low convergence accuracy. Compared\
    \ to\nother optimization algorithms, Bayesian optimization algorithms are able\
    \ to ﬁnd better\nhyperparameters in a shorter time, compared to other optimization\
    \ algorithms, and are a\nvery effective global optimization algorithm [29–31].\n\
    Based on the current status of the recent studies presented above and the limitations,\n\
    we take winter wheat in Hengshui City as an example. A BO-LSTM neural network\
    \ model\nis proposed to predict winter wheat yield using satellite meteorological\
    \ data on the basis\nof crop phenology. This study’s aims are the following three\
    \ objectives: (i) speed up\nthe training of neural networks, save training costs,\
    \ and improve network performance.\n(ii) Determine which combinations of input\
    \ variables are best for winter wheat yield\nestimation based on the BO-LSTM model.\
    \ (iii) Compare the predictive performance of\nmachine learning (SVM), deep learning\
    \ (BO-LSTM), and linear regression (Lasso). Finally,\nexplore what kind of environment\
    \ our proposed model BO-LSTM is suitable for in order to\nobtain the most accurate\
    \ prediction.\n2. Materials and Data\n2.1. Study Area\nThe study area is located\
    \ in Hengshui, Hebei Province, China, between 115◦10′–116◦34′ E\nlongitude and\
    \ 37◦03′–38◦23′ N latitude, covering two municipal districts, one county-level\n\
    city, and eight counties, as of 2016 (Figure 1). According to the second soil\
    \ census, the city’s\ntidal soil subclass covers 430,000 hectares, accounting\
    \ for 62% of the total land area, which is\nwidely distributed in all counties\
    \ and urban areas and is the main soil type for agricultural\nland. The annual\
    \ precipitation in Hengshui is 5.66 billion cubic metres, with an average\nprecipitation\
    \ of 642.1 mm. It belongs to the continental monsoon climate zone, which is\n\
    warm and semi-arid, and the main types of crops it grows are wheat, corn, sorghum,\
    \ etc.\nBy 2021, the sown area of grain in Hengshui reached 7191.33 km2, of which\
    \ 3333.3 km2 is\noccupied by winter wheat, accounting for about 1/2 of the sown\
    \ area of grain in Hengshui.\nWith a total yield of 4.34 billion kg, so the yield\
    \ of winter wheat has a key inﬂuence on the\neconomic development of Hengshui.\
    \ This study was conducted on winter wheat, which\nis generally sown in early\
    \ October and matures in mid-to-late June of the following year\nin Hengshui.\
    \ The phenological period of winter wheat is mainly divided into six stages,\n\
    sowing (early October), tillering (late-November to mid-December), reviving stage\
    \ (late-\nFebruary–mid-March), jointing (mid-March–mid-April), tasseling (late-April–mid-May),\n\
    and mature milking (late-May–mid-June) [32,33].\n2.2. Winter Wheat Yield and Planting\
    \ Distribution\nThe historical county-level winter wheat yield data record of\
    \ Hengshui City came from\nthe 2005–2019 statistical yearbook sharing platform,\
    \ recording yield data (unit: kg/ha).\nIn Hengshui City, there are two municipal\
    \ districts and one county-level city; there are\n11 counties, since we all consider\
    \ these to be county-level levels. Spatial distribution data\nof winter wheat\
    \ in Hengshui at 250 m spatial resolution from 2005–2019 were provided\nby Chinese\
    \ Academy of Agricultural Sciences [34]. The extraction results were evaluated\n\
    in terms of area quantity and spatial location, and the average relative error\
    \ of area quan-\ntity compared with the statistical yearbook for 20 years was\

    \ and the overall accuracy was 86.8% with a kappa\ncoefﬁcient of 0.69. The results\
    \ indicated that the winter wheat distribution data had a high\nextraction accuracy.\n\

    \ on an exten-\nsion of RNN, which is mainly used to solve the problems that exist\
    \ in traditional RNN, both\ngradient disappearance and explosion. The most fundamental\
    \ difference between RNN\nand LSTM is that the hidden layer of the LSTM network\
    \ is a gated unit, where information\nis added and removed through a ‘gate’ structure\
    \ that learns which information to keep or\nforget during training. The LSTM has\
    \ three types of gate structures: forgetting gates, input\ngates, and output gates\

    \ is the output gate, which determines which information in the cell state\nwill\

    \ state is multiplied by\nthe output of the sigmoid (normalize the output value)\

    \ layer might overﬁt to the training data.\nEpoch indicates the number of iterations\
    \ of the data set during model training. If the\nnumber of iterations is set too\
    \ large, the training time of the model is longer, resulting in\noverﬁtting of\
    \ the model, over-reliance on training data, and poor prediction of unknown\n\
    data, which makes the generalization ability of the model lower. If the number\
    \ of iterations\nis set too small, it will make the model ﬁt poorly and affect\

    \ training set that is used to evaluate the gradient of the loss function and\n\
    update the weights. If the number of iterations is set too large, the training\
    \ time of the\nmodel is long, causing the model to be overﬁtted and overly dependent\
    \ on the training\ndata. The prediction ability of the unknown data is poor, thus\
    \ making the generalization\nability of the model lower. If the number of iterations\
    \ is set too small, it will make the\nmodel not ﬁt well and affect the prediction\
    \ accuracy of the model.\nThe initial learning rate, α, is a relatively important\
    \ hyperparameter in the LSTM\nmodel. When the learning rate is too large, it will\
    \ cause the parameters to be optimized\nto ﬂuctuate around the minimum value,\
    \ thus skipping the optimal solution. When the\nlearning rate is set too small,\
    \ it will affect the convergence speed of the model, resulting in\na slow convergence\
    \ rate. In this paper, α is set to 0.01 based on the empirical value.\nDropout\
    \ means that, during the training process of the model, for the network units,\n\
    they are temporarily dropped from the network according to a certain probability.\
    \ This\nhyperparameter plays a crucial role in preventing model overﬁtting and\
    \ improving the\ngeneralization ability of the model.\nThe key hyperparameters\

    \ and Analysis\n4.1. Performance of LSTM Hyperparameter Combination Output Based\
    \ on Bayesian Optimization\nThis study aims to optimise the hyperparameters of\
    \ the LSTM neural network model\nbased on a Bayesian optimisation algorithm, evaluating\
    \ both the time efﬁciency, “time”,\nand the accuracy, RMSE, of the model after\
    \ tuning the parameters. The ﬁrst three optimal\nparameter combinations were selected,\
    \ along with the corresponding accuracy and time\nconsumption (Table 2). The results\
    \ demonstrate that the minimum RMSE of the Bayesian\noptimised LSTM model on the\
    \ training set is 149.51 kg/ha, and the time efﬁciency of\nﬁnding the optimal\
    \ hyperparameter combination is 14 min. The Bayesian optimisation\nalgorithm makes\
    \ full use of historical information when selecting the optimal hyperparam-\n\
    eter combination, allowing the optimal hyperparameter combination to be found\
    \ within a\nshort time and number of iterations.\nTable 2. Output results of Bayesian\

    4.2. Yield Estimation Performance for Different Combinations of Inputs\nTo evaluate\
    \ the performance of yield estimation from different data sources, we put\ndifferent\
    \ combinations of input variables in a BO-LSTM model for analysis. Figure 4 shows\n\
    the yield estimation performance of BO-LSTM for winter wheat with ﬁve different\
    \ input\nvariables. We found that yield estimates using GPP (R2 = 0.72, RMSE =\
    \ 186.13 kg/ha) alone\nwere more accurate than those using LAI (R2 = 0.67, RMSE\
    \ = 221.32 kg/ha) alone. When\ncombined with meteorological data, the accuracy\
    \ of GPP combined with meteorological\ndata was higher (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 180.66\
    \ kg/ha) compared to the remotely sensed\nvegetation index (R2 = 0.78, RMSE =\
    \ 190.96 kg/ha), because GPP more directly reﬂects the\nprocess of organic matter\
    \ accumulation by vegetation photosynthesis. The yield estimation\naccuracy of\
    \ winter wheat gradually increased as the input data increased, indicating that\n\
    the estimation accuracy of fusing multiple sources of data was better than the\
    \ input from\na single data source. The highest estimation accuracy was achieved\
    \ by integrating all\ndata together (R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 177.84 kg/ha). The addition\
    \ of the data improved\nthe model’s ability to capture spatial heterogeneity in\
    \ yield, capturing more features\nassociated with winter wheat yield. In particular,\
    \ the yield estimation accuracy of the LSTM\nmodel improved signiﬁcantly when\
    \ combined with meteorological data, suggesting that\nmeteorological data provide\
    \ unique and irreplaceable information.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 3194\n10 of 15\nAgronomy\

    \ all county test data for \nHengshui city using the three prediction models.\
    \ Based on the R2 and RMSE values, it can \nbe intuitively seen that the SVM (RMSE\

    \ methods perform significantly better than Lasso (RMSE = \n214.5 kg/ha, R2 =\
    \ 0.76). The potential reason could be that SVM and BO-LSTM methods \ncapture\
    \ the complex and nonlinear relationships between input variables and winter \n\
    wheat yield better than linear regression models. Further, it is found that the\
    \ BO-LSTM \nmodel slightly outperformed the SVM method in estimating winter wheat\
    \ yield in \nHengshui City. This is largely attributed to the fact that machine\
    \ learning non-temporal \nmodels focus on information extraction for unordered\

    \ highlight the advantages of BO-LSTM fusing multi-source data for\nwinter wheat\
    \ yield estimation. The results show that the deep learning model fusing\nmulti-source\
    \ data provides reliable winter wheat yield estimation at the regional scale.\
    \ In\ngeneral, GPP, LAI, and VIs are suitable for large-scale crop yield estimation.\
    \ The estimation\naccuracy can be improved by combining meteorological data. The\
    \ highest estimation\naccuracy is achieved when all predictors are combined and\
    \ entered into the estimation\nmodel, which is very similar to previous studies\
    \ [25,46,47]. Since this paper uses SVM,\nLSTM, and LASSO as the yield estimation\
    \ models, which are regularized, we do not need\nto consider the problem of multicollinearity.\n\
    The Bayesian optimizer can determine an acceptable value very quickly, which is\n\
    especially advantageous when the time complexity of ﬁnding the value of any function\n\
    of the black box function is high, and the Bayesian optimizer does not have a\
    \ limit on the\nsearch ﬁneness. The disadvantage is that the returned result is\
    \ not necessarily the true\nminimum objective function value (grid search may\
    \ not ﬁnd it either), and the result of each\noptimization will vary. Therefore,\
    \ several optimizations are needed when optimizing the\nLSTM hyperparameters with\
    \ Bayesian, and the best optimization result is ﬁnally selected.\nFor the problem\
    \ of different estimation accuracies in different regions (Figure 6), we\nanalysed\
    \ the distribution of winter wheat cultivation over 15 years and found that we\
    \ only\nlisted four of them (Figure 7), and the distribution of wheat cultivation\
    \ in Taocheng, Jizhou,\nAnping, and Rao Yang regions was more scattered with less\
    \ cultivated area. Among them,\nTaocheng District and Jizhou District are the\
    \ city centre of Hengshui City. The marginal\neffects of various factors in cities\
    \ within a certain region affect climate factors, and local\nclimate is difﬁcult\
    \ to obtain accurately compared to other regions, resulting in differences\nbetween\
    \ the meteorological data we obtained and the actual meteorological data [48].\
    \ This\nexplains the large discrepancy between estimated yields and ofﬁcial yield\
    \ records in these\nareas. Our method is therefore more suitable for areas where\
    \ the distribution of cultivation\nis concentrated, far from urban building sites,\
    \ and with relatively little human interference.\nIn the process of analysis,\
    \ we found that there are still some limitations. The ﬁrst\nis that we focus on\
    \ estimating county-level crop yields, which leads to smaller training\nsamples\
    \ due to the difﬁculty of obtaining data. The problem of data scarcity makes\n\
    the learning information aspect of the LSTM neural network model insufﬁcient in\
    \ the\ntraining process. Second, the essence of deep learning is feature extraction\
    \ from data to\ndata, and neural network modelling converts the original input\
    \ variables into high-level\nrepresentations through nonlinear activation and\
    \ squeeze functions. The description and\nmechanistic expression of the crop growth\
    \ process cannot be learned, which weakens the\ntraceability and interpretability\
    \ of the LSTM model. The data-driven crop growth model\nhas great potential. The\
    \ crop growth model can take the crop, environment, and cultivation\ntechnology\
    \ as a whole. The principles and methods of systems analysis can be applied to\n\
    provide theoretical generalizations and quantitative analyses of the physiological\
    \ processes\nof crop growth and development, photosynthetic production, organogenesis,\
    \ and yield\nformation and their feedback relationships to environment and technology.\
    \ Following\nthat, the corresponding mathematical models are developed to carry\
    \ out the dynamic\nquantitative simulation of the crop growth process. Therefore,\
    \ fusing deep learning with\ncrop mechanism models can improve the interpretability\
    \ of deep learning models. To\naddress the problems, our future work focuses on\
    \ expanding the study area to integrate\nprocess-based models and deep learning\
    \ techniques to develop hybrid models. The BO-\nLSTM model provides a data-driven\
    \ approach to crop growth time series feature extraction\nby combining the crop\
    \ weathering characteristics. The spatiotemporal scalability of the BO-\nLSTM\
    \ model is worth exploring in future research. The spatial transfer learning capability\n\
    of the BO-LSTM can be evaluated to quantify the model’s ability to estimate crop\
    \ yields in\nareas without many historical yield records. A deep learning approach\
    \ based on BO-LSTM\nto learn the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of crop growth can\
    \ help to better understand the\nimpact of global climate change on agricultural\

    View PDF View EPUB ABSTRACT Precision agriculture has been developed in order
    to achieve more productive, more profitable and environmentally sound agriculture
    by adjusting the input level in the site-specific manner. Therefore, the delineation
    of management zone in spatially variable farmland was thought to be crucial for
    a site-specific management of crops. Recent introduction of ICT (Information and
    Communication Technology) to precision agriculture however, changed the concept
    of management zone. Advancement in ICT enable to produce prescriptions tailored
    to each field by integrating soil fertility map, quasi real-time crop growth data,
    and weather data. In this review, at first, history of development in the assessment
    of the spatial variability of soil, crop growth, and yield will be mentioned.
    Then, the problem of inter year variability of crop yield is considered, which
    was caused by the interaction between soil properties and fluctuating weather.
    To overcome this temporal variability, integration of soil data, crop data, and
    weather data are indispensable, and crop models play a pivotal role in the solution.
    ICT includes global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), various sensors including
    machine vision, robotic technology, artificial intelligence, internet of things,
    and cloud computer which could realize the big data analysis by using data base
    supplied from public and private domains and raw field data from farms. High performance
    of cloud computer enables to derive an appropriate management zone and prescriptions.
    Agricultural machineries equipped with ICT devices such as GNSS, on-the-go machine
    visions, and sensors such as ECa, are already in market. Automatic material application
    equipment and automatic steering or guidance system have contributed the widespread
    of precision agriculture considerably. The recent advancement of precision agriculture
    research in Japan for paddy and upland field is reviewed as well. KEY WORDS: Site-specific
    management, spatial variability, management zone, soil sensor, crop model 1. Introduction
    Precision agriculture has been developed in order to achieve more productive,
    more profitable and environmentally sound agriculture by adjusting the input level
    in the site-specific manner. The notion of precision agriculture or site-specific
    crop management was initiated in 1980s and was widely recognized after United
    States National Research Council (NRC) defined precision agriculture as ‘ a management
    strategy that uses information technologies to bring data from multiple sources
    to bear on decisions associated with crop production’(NRC 1997). Shibusawa ( 2006)
    regarded precision agriculture in Japan as an important tool not only for site-specific
    crop management but also for community-based agriculture by recording each field
    with specific information using geological information system (GIS). Among the
    development of precision agriculture technologies, delineation of management zones
    has been one of the challenging research targets, which needs multifaceted data,
    such as topography, soil, crop growth and even temporal yield variations. However,
    inter-year yield variation urge us to reconsider the concept of management zone
    itself. The recent revolutionary progress in ICT seems to make a breakthrough.
    Under the changing climate, adhering to the previous concept of rather fixed management
    zones has become unrealistic. Instead, ICT enables to integrate soil map, in-season
    monitoring of crop growth and weather data to give an optimum management strategy.
    Precision agriculture research has been carried out in Japan since 1990’s and
    become recognized by producers after 2010s’ owing to the development of agricultural
    machineries equipped with sensors for soil, crop status, and yield measurement.
    Along with the machinery development, infrastructures for supporting precision
    agriculture has been developed. It enables the use of quasi real-time grid weather
    data which enable the use of crop model. However, recent ICT use in precision
    agriculture have not been totally reviewed. Therefore, in this review, I am focusing
    on the history and forefront of soil-related research on precision agriculture
    at first because the soil properties are sources of spatial variability and often
    the sources of temporal variability of crop yield under different weather of the
    cultivated year. Then, recent advancement in ICT will be mentioned. Development
    of precision agriculture research in Japan is also mentioned. 2. Spatial variability
    of farmland soils 2.1. Geo-statistics and delineation of soil The variability
    of soil properties depends on either the natural process or anthropogenic processes.
    The former is the soil-forming processes, e.g., movement of soil particles with
    a flow of water according to the land slope, the latter is the consequence of
    operation taking place on a farmland such as tillage, application of fertilizer,
    manure and residues, crop rotation, etc. Soil map was delineated by soil surveyor
    before the adoption of computer assisted procedures. However, the introduction
    of geo-statistics gave the theoretical basis for the more objective delineation
    of soil properties (Webster and Burrough 1972). Kosaki, Torii, and Kyuma ( 1982)
    introduced the delineation procedures by using computer, who also showed the usefulness
    of principal component analysis (PCA) in the analysis of the causes of the systematic
    soil variation observed (Kosaki and Juo 1989a). A combination of PCA and cluster
    analysis became indispensable in grouping soil individuals into some clusters
    based on the factors that are responsible for their variation in a non-tutorial
    classification (Kosaki and Juo 1989b). McBratney et al. ( 2000) showed the importance
    of ancillary information such as terrain data, yield data, and electromagnetic
    data, which were analyzed together with soil sample data by geo-statistical techniques
    to minimize the prediction errors for making soil map. As soil sampling and analysis
    are costly, efficacy of soil sampling was also studied by Mallarino and Wittry
    ( 2004), and targeted sampling by employing historic yield maps, crop canopy density
    inferred from aerial photography was recommended rather than grid soil sampling
    (Earl et al. 2003). By exploring the spatial relationships between some soil properties
    and wheat yield, the derived information on the yield class distribution can also
    be used as a guide to suitable sampling interval for soil properties (Bourennane
    et al. 2004). Shaner et al. ( 2008) demonstrated the appropriateness of using
    apparent electronic conductivity (ECa) mapping for an efficient soil sampling
    as well. Wetterlind, Stenberg, and Sorderstrom ( 2008) obtained ECa data and mid
    infrared (MIR) data from satellite and reduced soil sampling costs by reducing
    soil sampling interval. They also measured soil properties using economical near
    infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis for organic matter and clay content to reduce
    the cost of soil analysis. A brief history of digital soil mapping was compiled
    by Minasny and McBratney ( 2016). As for paddy field, geostatistically produced
    soil map inferring spatial variability of paddy field was reported by Yanai et
    al. ( 2000). They also compared the spatial variability and temporal variability
    for some soil properties and suggested the estimation errors for each soil property
    (Yanai et al. 2008). Moritsuka et al. ( 2015) showed the spatial distribution
    of soil properties in the same paddy field as a fingerprint reflecting past field
    organic matter management. However, even if targeted soil sampling is employed
    by the help of ancillary data such as soil map, elevation map, and remote sensing,
    the cost of soil sampling and analysis could not be overlooked. Therefore, the
    proximal soil sensing became an effective tool to understand the spatial variability
    of soil properties in a farm level. 2.2. Proximal soil sensing Estimation of soil
    properties by using sensors had been studied in 1990s either using ECa by Rhoades
    and Corwin ( 1990) or using reflectance technique for soil organic matter by Krishnan
    et al. ( 1980). NIRS in a laboratory environment was further developed by identifying
    the specific wave length for each soil component (Matsunaga and Uwasawa 1992;
    Sudduth and Hummel 1993) and the simultaneous measurement of soil clay and water
    content was shown by Viscarra Rossel and McBratney ( 1998) together with the list
    of some possible sensors for a range of soil properties. Overview of the proximal
    soil sensors for precision agriculture are presented by Adamchuk et al. ( 2004),
    Corwin and Lesch ( 2010), Viscarra Rossel et al. ( 2011), and Mulla ( 2013). The
    most frequently used proximal soil sensor is the electromagnetic sensor to measure
    soil ECa (Figure 1) (Morala, Terron, and Marques da Silvac 2010), which is highly
    correlated with soil texture properties that stands for soil water retention.
    ECa can estimate clay content, CEC and electrolytes in shallow or deep soil profiles,
    and the theory, principle, and guidelines are shown (Corwin and Lesch 2003). Proximal
    sensor data were considered almost always better than mere interpolation of the
    scattered soil sample data because proximal sensing is continuous along the transect
    (Pikki, Soderstom, and Stenberg 2013), and they proposed ‘sensor data fusion’
    which include those data, e.g., ECa, gamma ray spectrometry, elevation, and slope,
    by using partial least squares regression and k-nearest neighbor prediction techniques.
    Figure 1. In-situ measurement by using ECa sensor equipment (EM38). (photo by
    H.Sekiya) Display full size On-line real time spectrometer mounted on a farm tractor
    developed by Shibusawa et al. ( 1999, 2000) was further improved its operation
    speed (Kodaira et al. 2009) and high resolution mapping (Kodaira and Shibusawa
    2013). Although one of the most promising proximal soil sensors was the NIRS sensor,
    interference by soil moisture and particle size on the estimation of soil total
    nitrogen content was a challenge. Christy ( 2008) demonstrated the efficacy of
    principal components regression to use in the calibration of organic matter estimation.
    Recently, NIRS-based portable detector by using LED with back propagation neural
    network (An et al. 2014) and the function of eliminating noises from soil moisture
    and particle size was developed by An X et al. ( 2015) for organic matter estimation.
    Tractor driven Visible and NIR measuring chamber enabled the rapid and high-resolution
    mapping of soil organic C with small standard deviation (Rodinov et al. 2015).
    As for physical properties of soil, Hemmat and Adamchuk ( 2008) reviewed the development
    of sensor systems for measuring soil compaction, and Mouazen and Roman ( 2006)
    developed an in-situ measurement system of bulk density based on on-line measured
    draught, soil moisture etc. As for paddy field, the effectiveness of ECa to predict
    soil properties such as clay content of plow soil was shown (Aimrun et al. 2011).
    Islam et al. ( 2011) estimated the percolation prone zone in a flooded paddy field
    by using ECa measurement under submerged condition, which reflect the soil texture
    of the paddy soil and contribute to the site-specific soil-water management. 2.3.
    Remote sensing of soils Compared with proximal sensing, remote sensing has a merit
    to measure much wider area seamlessly. Mulla ( 2013) compiled the satellite remote
    sensing platform and their spatial resolutions and return frequency, the vegetation
    indices by hyperspectral narrow-band remote sensing. However, owing to the cost
    of measurement, the adoption of satellite remote sensing has been limited only
    to large producers, and weather condition sometimes restrict their wider use.
    However, recent development of UAV-based remote sensing removed these demerits
    and become diffused (Tsouros, Bibi, and Sarigiannidis 2019). As for remote sensing
    of soils, retrieval methods for soil, vegetation and terrain attributes are summarized
    by Mulder et al. ( 2011). They have suggested the importance of integrating proximal
    sensing and remote sensing for making better digital soil map. Other than soil
    attributes such as organic carbon, moisture, etc. which could be estimated directly
    from the reflectance characteristics of soil, Mulder et al. ( 2011) suggested
    the mixing of soil proxies such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
    and other indicators such as Plant Functional Type to know the soil properties
    of natural vegetation. For a better estimation of soil properties by remote sensing,
    many analytical techniques have been developed. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry,
    which has a good indicator of clay contents, was employed for an assessment of
    large arable land area as large as 100,000 ha and deemed suitable to assist the
    adaptation of regional digital soil maps as ancillary data for precision agriculture
    (Soderstrom et al. 2016). 3. Spatial and temporal yield trend and its relations
    to soil variability 3.1. Inter-year spatial variability of crop yield Although
    the spatial variability of soil properties is stable, crop responses are not necessarily
    stable over time, because the growth limiting factors including soil conditions
    may change with the climate of each year. For example, high yield of barley can
    be attained in clayey soil area under drier years while the yield become relatively
    low in the year with abundant precipitation (James and Godwin 2003). The spatial
    and temporal yield map for grain crops for 6 years showed different yield trend
    area, e.g., high and stable, high and unstable, low and stable, and low and unstable
    (Blackmore, Godwin, and Fountas 2003). 3.2. Delineation of field by spatiotemporal
    variability of crop yield and soil attributes Spatial and temporal yield response
    maps could be used to identify the yield-limiting factors in zones where yield
    is either low or fluctuating (Diker, Heermann, and Bordahl 2004). McBratney, Whelan,
    and Ancev ( 2005) mentioned the necessity of incorporation of inter-year spatial
    variability in delineating management zones. However, inter-year spatial variability
    in yield often results in fragmented yield class map, which is inconvenient for
    site specific crop management, because the variable rate application of fertilizers
    may not accurately adjust to the fragmented soil fertility map. Therefore, yield
    class mapping procedures for spatially contiguous yield class map was presented
    by Ping and Dobermann ( 2003) for maize. Guastaferro et al. ( 2010) compared the
    different algorithms for the delineation of management zones for durum wheat and
    result of the analysis of management zones and yield maps over three crop seasons
    revealed the significant yield changes in the spatial yield pattern, because of
    the yearly fluctuation of precipitation. Therefore, the notion of fixed management
    zones is no more realistic for upland crops, and it is recommended to use management
    zones with crop-based in-season remote sensing data as mentioned in Sections 4
    and 5. As for paddy field, Roel and Plant ( 2004) revealed that cluster analysis
    was effective to integrate yield data of direct seeding rice into a spatiotemporal
    yield map. As soil moisture of submerged paddy field during the cropping season
    is relatively constant, the spatial yield variability pattern for transplanted
    rice over time should be smaller than upland crops or direct seeded rice. Therefore,
    the spatial variability of yield may reflect soil nitrogen (N) supplying capacity
    (Figure 2) (Toriyama et al. 2004), which is the major yield limiting factor and
    stable over time. Thus, the yield-based management zone which is a proxy of soil
    N supplying capacity could be utilized for site-specific management of transplanted
    rice. In this way, site-specific crop management system for transplanted rice
    was developed with a yield-based management map (Figure 3) (Toriyama et al. 2004)
    and variable rate application technology (Toriyama et al. 2003), where variable
    rate fertilizer applicator applies calculated amount of fertilizer according to
    the management map data. Figure 2. Variability of the grain yield and N uptake

    From the advent of precision agriculture, farmers have been wondering about the
    way of site-specific crop management, i.e. sensor-based on-the-go management or
    map-based management or integration of the both. On-the-go site specific management
    is based on the crop growth status such as leaf area index (LAI), biomass, nutrient
    status. However, dependence solely on the crop attributes is not appropriate because
    of the lack of information on the variability of soil attributes which may be
    the source of spatial variability. As shown above, map-based management without
    the addition of in-season data is not satisfactory as well because the delineated
    management map is not persistent over years owing to the different growth response
    of crops to soil properties (soil moisture, nutrient availability, and behavior)
    under different weather conditions. Thus, combination of management map with various
    in-season data such as weather data, crop scouting data by remote or proximal
    sensing are necessary, and crop models (e.g., Horie and Nakagawa 1990; Inoue,
    Moran, and Horie 1998; Yoshida and Horie 2009; Sasaki, Toriyama, and Shibata 2005)
    and soil models (e.g. Ten Berge et al. 1997; Er-Raki et al. 2006) may play a pivotal
    role in calculating the optimum rate of fertilizer application and other inputs
    (Figure 4). Figure 4. Map based precision agriculture with the integration of
    in-season monitoring and model prediction. †VRT, Variable Rate Technology by which
    fertilizer or agrochemicals are applied according to the management map Display
    full size 5. Precision agriculture research for rice in Japan Rice used to be
    cultivated in a small paddy field less than 0.3 ha plot in Japan, and thus the
    spatial variability in fertility within each field was negligible. However, large-sized
    fields have increased since 1990s to attain more efficient cultivation, and the
    spatial variability of soil have been realized since then (Toriyama 2001; Toriyama
    et al. 2004) (Figure 2), and yield-based map for soil N variability was shown
    to be useful for site-specific N management (Toriyama 2004) (Figure 3). Sekiya,
    Miyaji, and Hayashi ( 2019) demonstrated the validity of yield map based variable
    application of slow-release N fertilizer for uniform yield of dry direct seeded
    rice. Shibusawa et al. ( 1999) also initiated precision agriculture research by
    using the spectrometer attached to a tractor. Precision agriculture for rice is
    now implemented in some large-scale farmers with large-sized paddy field in Japan
    with the financial support of the Japanese government. Many agricultural equipment
    for use in precision agriculture have already been developed and released, which
    boost the adoption of precision agriculture. Among them, smart rice transplanter
    equipped with ECa sensor for soil fertility and ultrasonic sensor for plow layer
    depth measurement is already in the market, which enable the site-specific application
    of basal fertilizer by on-the-go concept and ECa and plow layer depth data could
    be stored and used for the fertility variability map of the field (Morimoto 2013).
    As for crop scouting, site specific management of rice begun with leaf color chart
    (Furuya 1987), which is now an important tool in small-scale farmers not only
    in Japan but also in Southeast Asia. Buresh and Witt ( 2007) developed a software
    named ‘Nutrient Manager for Rice’ for leaf color chart, which can be used by farmers
    through a mobile phone (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0BAF7F86D4EC551A).
    SPAD meter, or chlorophyll meter, was developed in 1980s and is still widely used
    for monitoring N status of crops (Toriyama 2009). However, recent advancement
    in ICT boosted the development of proximal sensors such as handy-type NDVI sensors,
    which enabled more efficient measurement than contact-type SPAD meter (Sasaki
    2007; Namikawa et al. 2016; Nishida et al. 2018b). UAV or drone have diffused
    even to a farm level, recently. Therefore, low altitude remote sensing of lands,
    soils, and crops are available (Tanaka and Kondo 2019; Tsouros, Bibi, and Sarigiannidis
    2019). Not only the real time sensing of crop growth, quasi real-time agrometeorological
    data of 1 km grid size are also available (Ohno et al. 2016), which assist the
    prediction of the phenological development of rice plant by using crop model (Horie
    and Nakagawa 1990) for an appropriate time of top dressing. The amount of N to
    be applied as top dressing could be determined by using a decision support crop
    model (Sasaki, Toriyama, and Shibata 2005, Toriyama et al. 2004). As the satellite
    remote sensing was effective for sensing the soil organic matter under the submerged
    condition (Shiga, Fukuhara, and Ogawa 1989), estimation of soil humus content
    and field selection for good palatability rice production has been realized (Sakaiya
    and Inoue 2013, Fukusawa and Sakaiya 2019). 6. Precision agriculture research
    for upland crops in Japan Precision agriculture research for upland crops such
    as wheat, potato, sugar beet started in late 1990’s in Hokkaido (Hara 1999). Machine
    vision for assessing crop status was developed and on-the-go crop scouting machines
    equipped with laser machine vision was developed (Hayashi 2015), and showed the
    yield increase by this sensor-based variable fertilization in wheat cultivation
    (Hara, Suda, and Watanabe 2015). Machine vison and UAV are used to monitor the
    wheat growth (Niwa et al. 2018b), and they revealed that soil available N could
    be the yield limiting factor, but it depends on soil types. In the light of recent
    torrential rain falling, submerged upland imagery captured by using UAV just after
    heavy rain fall, when satellite remote sensing being unavailable, is worthwhile
    for determining the priority of field drainage construction (Niwa 2018a). Satellite
    image of wheat at maturing stage was also used to determine the order of operating
    combine harvesters by detecting the degree of maturity as well as the quality
    of the grains (Shiga 2003). As sugar beet and potato are root crops, their aboveground
    growth estimated by satellite NDVI does not directly connected to the yield. Therefore,
    the estimation of yield and quality of those root crops were done by using specific
    wavelength of remotely sensed satellite data and the regression equation (Hongo
    2006; Okuno 2006). Precision agriculture research for sugar cane in Okinawa revealed
    that the soil potassium availability and sugar content estimated by NIRS and remote
    sensing are closely related (Ueno et al. 2005) and relevant new research and extension
    project started from 2019 by the integrated use of ICT (http://www.ufsma.jp/index.html).
    7. Use of recent ICT and necessary research in the future Although the principle
    of precision agriculture has not changed, tools and procedures for attaining it
    have improved tremendously as shown in the compiled book for smart agriculture
    (Ohmasa et al. 2019). Measurements of yield variability by yield harvester is
    cost effective and time saving. However, as Blackmore ( 2000) advised, systematic
    errors in yield measurement are produced by the harvester. To remove outlier data
    in the yield measurement caused by harvester operation, several filters were developed
    such as rapid change of swath, etc. The software integrated those filters named
    ‘Yield Editor’ was developed (Sudduth and Drummond 2007). Introduction of high
    accuracy GNSS, UAV, robotic technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud
    computing assist the diffusion of precision agriculture. Performance of UAV improved
    significantly in terms of safety, automatic routing, and it could be an indispensable
    alternative of satellite remote sensing on cloudy days before harvest. Tsouros,
    Bibi, and Sarigiannidis ( 2019) made a comprehensive review on the present research
    challenge by UAV. Automatic driving tractors and transplanters equipped with GNSS
    and various sensors have been developed by robotic technology. AI exhibit its
    special role in the image processing such as discriminating weeds from crops,
    identify disease or pest damages (Bannerjee et al. 2018). It may also cause a
    breakthrough to some of the crop scouting. Chligaryan, Sukkarieh, and Whelan (
    2018) reviewed the machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction and nitrogen
    status estimation in precisio,n agriculture. Iwasawa, Mio, and Watanabe ( 2019)
    developed a software for the estimation of growth stage of rice by pictures taken
    on the ground employing AI techniques. By knowing the growth stage of rice in
    each field assist the optimum timing of top dressing fertilizer application. As
    shown in Figure 4, the historical yield map and related soil map together with
    in-season monitoring data such as weather, crop growth give the optimum management
    options such as the timing of fertilizer application, variable rate fertilization
    or optimum timing of irrigation and drainage by employing crop models and soil
    models. The use of cloud computing made it feasible to integrate many data sources.
    WAGRI, an infrastructure for agricultural data collaboration system in Japan,
    started its operation in 2019 by the initiative of Japanese government (Ministry
    of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan 2018; Agricultural Data Collaboration
    Platform Council 2020) (Figure 5). Data are supplied to WAGRI system not only
    from public domains but also from private sectors as shown in Table 1 and Figure
    5 through a suitable Application Programing Interface (API). Contracted agriculture
    supporting company including agricultural equipment company, ICT vendors and farm
    managers can use this platform under the respective contract. This infrastructure
    could boost the adoption of precision agriculture because farmers (producers)
    will be free from a series of complicated work such as data acquisition, processing
    and decision making. Table 1. Data systems available from WAGRI (Agricultural
    data collaboration infrastructure) Download CSVDisplay Table Figure 5. Concept
    and structure of WAGRI (agriculture data collaboration infrastructure). Translated
    from the presentation of MAFF ( 2018) Display full size In spite of such tremendous
    progress in ICT for precision agriculture, however, we still cannot accurately
    address the suitable operation on a farm because identification of the drivers
    or limiting factors of yield variability is still difficult (Nishida et al. 2018a).
    This problem shall be analyzed quantitatively by WAGRI or using multilayered datasets
    such as yearly yield map, weather data and soil maps (Filippi, Bishop, and Whelan
    2019). Regarding the soil and fertilizer aspect, selection of suitable materials
    for addressing the spatial variability of soil N fertility need further research.
    For example, in the case of low content of available soil N, we have alternatives
    to increase N supplying capacity by applying inorganic N fertilizer, slow release
    N fertilizer or organic amendments. As each material has different N supplying
    characteristics and different N use efficiency, calculation of variable rate application
    needs data base suited for these purposes. In addition, more quantitative understanding
    of behaviors of nutrients and organic matter in soil should be integrated into
    a data base, such as that in WAGRI Data System (Table). An excessive N application
    to the soil increase the risk of nitrate leaching to the environment or increase
    the nitrous oxide emission, basic research on the behavior of fertilizer and organic
    amendments is essential not only for a site-specific crop production but also
    for the effect on the environment. 8. Conclusions Understanding the spatial variability
    of soils is crucial for site-specific management of crops, which is estimated
    by the data fusion of grid soil sampling, proximal sensing and remote sensing.
    Yield mapping is also essential to delineate management zones. However, spatial
    yield variability may fluctuate according to the climate, especially in upland
    field. Therefore, the notion of fixed management zone is no more realistic. The
    integration of soil fertility map, yield map, and crop data obtained by in-season
    monitoring together with a crop and soil models to derive an optimum management
    strategy under different weather condition is more effective (Figure 4). Recent
    development in ICT could surely support this complex data fusion and model simulation.

    • Big Data is expected to have a large impact on Smart Farming and involves the
    whole supply chain. • Smart sensors and devices produce big amounts of data that
    provide unprecedented decision-making capabilities. • Big Data is expected to
    cause major shifts in roles and power relations among traditional and non-traditional
    players. • Governance (incl. data ownership, privacy, security) and business models
    are key issues to be addressed in future research. Abstract Smart Farming is a
    development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology
    in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet
    of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce
    more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the
    phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be
    captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight
    into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify
    the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured
    approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used
    for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data
    applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing
    the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights
    in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business
    processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest
    that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different
    players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits
    an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often
    small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions
    that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be
    guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme
    scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly
    integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer
    and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business
    partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further
    development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards)
    and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between
    these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give
    research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable
    business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios. Previous

    communication technologyData infrastructureGovernanceBusiness modelling 1. Introduction
    As smart machines and sensors crop up on farms and farm data grow in quantity
    and scope, farming processes will become increasingly data-driven and data-enabled.
    Rapid developments in the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are propelling
    the phenomenon of what is called Smart Farming (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). While
    Precision Agriculture is just taking in-field variability into account, Smart
    Farming goes beyond that by basing management tasks not only on location but also
    on data, enhanced by context- and situation awareness, triggered by real-time
    events (Wolfert et al., 2014). Real-time assisting reconfiguration features are
    required to carry out agile actions, especially in cases of suddenly changed operational
    conditions or other circumstances (e.g. weather or disease alert). These features
    typically include intelligent assistance in implementation, maintenance and use
    of the technology. Fig. 1 summarizes the concept of Smart Farming along the management
    cycle as a cyber-physical system, which means that smart devices - connected to
    the Internet - are controlling the farm system. Smart devices extend conventional
    tools (e.g. rain gauge, tractor, notebook) by adding autonomous context-awareness
    by all kind of sensors, built-in intelligence, capable to execute autonomous actions
    or doing this remotely. In this picture it is already suggested that robots can
    play an important role in control, but it can be expected that the role of humans
    in analysis and planning is increasingly assisted by machines so that the cyber-physical

    but increasingly at a much higher intelligence level, leaving most operational
    activities to machines. Download : Download high-res image (142KB) Download :

    Farming enhanced by cloud-based event and data management (Wolfert et al., 2014).
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential, reciprocal role in this development:
    machines are equipped with all kind of sensors that measure data in their environment
    that is used for the machines'' behaviour. This varies from relatively simple
    feedback mechanisms (e.g. a thermostat regulating temperature) to deep learning
    algorithms (e.g. to implement the right crop protection strategy). This is leveraged
    by combining with other, external Big Data sources such as weather or market data
    or benchmarks with other farms. Due to rapid developments in this area, a unifying
    definition of Big Data is difficult to give, but generally it is a term for data
    sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications
    are inadequate (Wikipedia, 2016). Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies
    with new forms of integration to reveal insights from datasets that are diverse,
    complex, and of a massive scale (Hashem et al., 2015). Big Data represents the
    information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity and variety to
    require specific technology and analytical methods for its transformation into
    value (De Mauro et al., 2016). The Data FAIRport initiative emphasizes the more
    operational dimension of Big Data by providing the FAIR principle meaning that
    data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable (Data FAIRport,
    2014). This also implies the importance of metadata i.e. ‘data about the data’
    (e.g. time, location, standards used, etc.). Both Big Data and Smart Farming are
    relatively new concepts, so it is expected that knowledge about their applications
    and their implications for research and development is not widely spread. Some
    authors refer to the advent of Big Data and related technology as another technology
    hype that may fail to materialize, others consider Big Data applications may have
    passed the ‘peak of inflated expectations’ in Gartner''s Hype Cycle (Fenn and
    LeHong, 2011, Needle, 2015). This review aims to provide insight into the state-of-the-art
    of Big Data applications in relation to Smart Farming and to identify the most
    important research and development challenges to be addressed in the future. In
    reviewing the literature, attention is paid to both technical and socio-economic
    aspects. However, technology is changing rapidly in this area and a state-of-the-art
    of that will probably be outdated soon after this paper is published. Therefore
    the analysis primarily focuses on the socio-economic impact Big Data will have
    on farm management and the whole network around it because it is expected that
    this will have a longer-lasting effect. From that perspective the research questions
    to be addressed in this review are: 1. What role does Big Data play in Smart Farming?
    2. What stakeholders are involved and how are they organized? 3. What are the
    expected changes that are caused by Big Data developments? 4. What challenges
    need to be addressed in relation to the previous questions? The latter question
    can be considered as a research agenda for the future. To answer these questions
    and to structure the review process, a conceptual framework for analysis has been
    developed, which is expected to be useful also for future analyses of developments
    in Big Data and Smart Farming. In the remainder of this paper the methodology
    for reviewing the literature (Section 2) and the framework will be described (Section
    3). Then the main results from the analysis will be presented in Section 4. Section
    5 concludes the review and provides recommendations for further research and actions.
    2. Methodology To address the research questions as outlined in the Introduction,
    we surveyed literature between January 2010 and March 2015. The choice of the
    review period was a practical one and took into consideration the fact that Big
    Data is a rather recent phenomenon; it was not expected that there would be any
    reference before 2010. Beside the period of publication, we used two inclusion
    criteria for the literature search: 1) full article publication; 2) relevance
    to the research question. Two exclusion criteria were used: 1) articles published
    in languages other than English or Chinese; 2) articles focussing solely on technological
    design. The literature survey followed a systematic approach. This was done in
    three steps. In the first step we searched two major bibliographical databases,
    Web of Science and Scopus, using all combinations of two groups of keywords of
    which the first group addresses Big Data (i.e. Big Data, data-driven innovation,
    data-driven value creation, internet of things, IoT) and the second group refers
    to farming (i.e. agriculture, farming, food, agri-food, precision agriculture).
    The two databases were chosen because of their wide coverage of relevant literature
    and advanced bibliometric features such as suggesting related literature or citations.
    From these two databases 613 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved. These were
    scanned for relevance by identifying passages that were addressing the research
    questions. In screening the literature, we first used the search function to locate
    the paragraphs containing the key words and then read the text to see whether
    they can be related to the research questions. The screening was done by four
    researchers, with each of them judging about 150 articles and sharing their findings
    with the others through the reference management software EndNote X7. As a result,
    20 were considered most relevant and 94 relevant. The remaining articles were
    considered not relevant as they only tangentially touch upon Big Data or agriculture
    and therefore excluded from further reading and analysis. We found the number
    of relevant peer-reviewed literature not very high which can be explained because
    Big Data and Smart Farming are relatively new concepts. Especially the applications
    are rapidly evolving and expected not to be taken into account in peer-reviewed
    articles which are usually lagging behind. Therefore we decided to also include
    grey literature into our review. For that purpose we have used Google Scholar
    and the search engine LexisNexis for reports, magazines, blogs, and other web-items
    in English. This has resulted in 3 reports, 225 magazine articles, 319 blogs and
    19 items on twitter. Each of the 319 blogs was evaluated on relevance based on
    its title and sentences containing the search terms. Also possible duplications
    were removed. The result was a short list containing 29 blogs that were evaluated
    by further reading. As a result, 9 blogs have been considered as presenting relevant
    information for our framework. Each of the 225 magazine articles was similarly
    evaluated on their relevance based on its title and sentences containing the search
    terms. After removing duplicates, the result is a short list of 25 articles. We
    then read these 25 articles through for further evaluation. Consequently 9 articles
    have been considered as containing relevant information for further analysis.
    In the second step, we read the selected literature in detail to extract the information
    relevant to our research questions. Additional literature that had not been identified
    in the first step was retrieved in this step as well if they were referred to
    by the ‘most relevant’ literature. This ‘snow-ball’ approach has resulted in 11
    additional articles and web-items from which relevant information was extracted
    as well. In the third step, the extracted information was analysed and synthesized
    following the conceptual framework as described in Section 3. 3. Conceptual framework
    For this review a conceptual framework was developed to provide a systematic classification
    of issues and concepts for the analysis of Big Data applications in Smart Farming
    from a socio-economic perspective. A major complexity of such applications is
    that they require collaboration between many different stakeholders having different
    roles in the data value chain. For this reason, the framework draws upon literature
    on chain network management and data-driven strategies. Chain networks are considered
    to be composed of the actors which vertically and horizontally work together to
    add value to customers (Christopher, 2005, Lazzarini et al., 2001, Omta et al.,
    2001). An important foundation of chain networks is the concept ‘value chain’,
    which is a system of interlinked processes, each adding value to the product of
    service (Porter, 1985). In big data applications, the value chain refers to the
    sequence of activities from data capture to decision making and data marketing
    (Chen et al., 2014, Miller and Mork, 2013). The often-cited conceptual framework
    of Lambert and Cooper (2000) on network management comprises three closely interrelated
    elements: the network structure, the business processes, and the management components.
    The network structure consists of the member firms and the links between these
    firms. Business processes are the activities that produce a specific output of
    value to the customer. The management components are the managerial variables
    by which the business processes are integrated and managed across the network.
    The network management component is further divided into a technology and organization
    component. For our purpose the framework was tailored to networks for Big Data
    applications in Smart Farming as presented in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res
    image (306KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Conceptual framework
    for the literature analysis (Adapted from Lambert and Cooper (2000)). In this
    framework, the business processes (lower layer) focus on the generation and use
    of Big Data in the management of farming processes. For this reason, we subdivided
    this part into the data chain, the farm management and the farm processes. The
    data chain interacts with farm processes and farm management processes through
    various decision making processes in which information plays an important role.
    The stakeholder network (middle layer) comprises all stakeholders that are involved
    in these processes, not only users of Big Data but also companies that are specialized
    in data management and regulatory and policy actors. Finally, the network management
    layer typifies the organizational and technological structures in the network
    that facilitate coordination and management of the processes that are performed
    by the actors in the stakeholder network layer. The technology component of network
    management (upper layer) focuses on the information infrastructure that supports
    the data chain. The organizational component focuses on the governance and business
    model of the data chain. Finally, several factors can be identified as key drivers
    for the development of Big Data in Smart Farming and as a result challenges can
    be derived from this development. The next subsections provide a more detailed
    description of each subcomponent of the business processes layer and network management
    layer of the framework. 3.1. Farm processes A business process is a set of logically
    related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome (Davenport and Short,
    1990). Business processes can be subdivided into primary and supporting business
    processes (Davenport, 1993, Porter, 1985). Primary Business Processes are those
    involved in the creation of the product, its marketing and delivery to the buyer
    (Porter, 1985). Supporting Business Processes facilitate the development, deployment
    and maintenance of resources required in primary processes. The business processes
    of farming significantly differ between different types of production, e.g. livestock
    farming, arable farming and greenhouse cultivation. A common feature is that agricultural
    production is depending on natural conditions, such as climate (day length and
    temperature), soil, pests, diseases and weather (Nuthall, 2011). 3.2. Farm management
    Management or control processes ensure that the business process objectives are
    achieved, even if disturbances occur. The basic idea of control is the introduction
    of a controller that measures system behaviour and corrects if measurements are
    not compliant with system objectives. Basically, this implies that they must have
    a feedback loop in which a norm, sensor, discriminator, decision maker, and effector
    are present (Beer, 1981, in ''t Veld, 2002). As a consequence, the basic management
    functions are (Verdouw et al., 2015) (see also Fig. 1): • Sensing and monitoring:
    measurement of the actual performance of the farm processes. This can be done
    manually by a human observer or automated by using sensing technologies such as
    sensors or satellites. In addition, external data can be acquired to complement
    direct observations. • Analysis and decision making: compares measurements with
    the norms that specify the desired performance (system objectives concerning e.g.
    quantity, quality and lead time aspects), signals deviations and decides on the
    appropriate intervention to remove the signalled disturbances. • Intervention:
    plans and implements the chosen intervention to correct the farm processes'' performance.
    3.3. Data chain The data chain refers to the sequence of activities from data
    capture to decision making and data marketing (Chen et al., 2014, Miller and Mork,
    2013). It includes all activities that are needed to manage data for farm management.

    Data applications, based on Chen et al. (2014). Being an integral part of business
    processes, the data chain consists necessarily of a technical layer that captures
    raw data and converts it into information and a business layer that makes decisions
    and derives value from provided data services and business intelligence. The two
    layers can be interwoven in each stage and together they form the basis of what
    has come to be known as the ‘data value chain’ (Dumbill, 2014) (Table 1). Table

    Network management organization The network management organization deals with
    the behaviour of the stakeholders and how it can be influenced to accomplish the
    business process objectives. For the uptake and further development of Big Data
    applications, two interdependent aspects are considered relevant: governance and
    business model. Governance involves the formal and informal arrangements that
    govern cooperation within the stakeholder network. Important arrangements for
    the management of big data include agreements on data availability, data quality,
    access to data, security, responsibility, liability, data ownership, privacy and
    distribution of costs. Three basic forms of network governance can be distinguished
    (Lazzarini et al., 2001): managerial discretion, standardization and mutual adjustment.
    These forms correspond with the three forms of network governance presented by
    Provan and Kenis (2008): lead organization-governed network, network administrative
    organization, and shared participant-governed network. The choice of a particular
    network governance structure aims at mitigating all forms of contractual hazards
    found between the different contracting parties in such a way that transaction
    costs are minimized (Williamson, 1996). When studying hybrid forms of organization
    such as supply chain networks, two main dimensions should be identified: the allocation
    of decision rights, i.e., who has the authority to take strategic decisions within
    the supply chain network, and the inter-organizational mechanisms aiming at rewarding
    desirable behaviour and preventing undesirable behaviour (risk and rewarding mechanisms).
    Despite agreement on the importance of business model to an organization''s success,
    the concept is still fuzzy and vague, and there is little consensus regarding
    its compositional facets. Osterwalder (2004) defines business model as “… a conceptual
    tool that contains a set of elements and their relationships and allows expressing
    a company''s logic of earning money”. It is a description of the value a company
    offers to one or several segments of customers and the architecture of the firm
    and its network of partners for creating, marketing and delivering this value
    and relationship capital, in order to generate profitable and sustainable revenue
    streams.” This definition reflects a so-called firm-centric view of business model.
    Another view on business model is the network-centric business model which builds
    upon value network theories (Al-Debei and Avison, 2010). The value network theories
    consider both financial and non-financial value of business transactions and exchanges.
    Both views are relevant to the network management of Big Data applications. 3.5.
    Network management technology The network management technology includes all computers,
    networks, peripherals, systems software, application packages (application software),
    procedures, technical, information and communication standards (reference information
    models and coding and message standards) etc., that are used and necessary for
    adequate data management in the inter-organizational control of farming processes
    (van der Vorst et al., 2005). Components to be mentioned here encompass: • Data
    resources stored in shared databases and a shared understanding of its content
    (shared data model of the database). • Information systems and services that allow
    us to use and maintain these databases. An information system is used to process
    information necessary to perform useful activities using activities, facilities,
    methods and procedures. • The whole set of formalised coding and message standards
    (both technically and content-wise) with associated procedures for use, connected
    to shared databases, which are necessary to allow seamless and error-free automated
    communication between business partners in a food supply chain network. • The
    necessary technical infrastructure. None of the above can work if we don''t have
    the connected set of computers (workstations of individual associates or people
    employed by or interested in the network and the database, communication and application
    servers and all associated peripherals) that will allow for its usage. In conclusion,
    this framework now provides a coherent set of elements to describe and analyse
    the developments of Big Data in Smart Farming. The results are provided in the
    next section. 4. Results 4.1. Drivers for Big Data in Smart Farming There has
    been a significant trend to consider the application of Big Data techniques and
    methods to agriculture as a major opportunity for application of the technology
    stack, for investment and for the realisation of additional value within the agri-food
    sector (Noyes, 2014, Sun et al., 2013b, Yang, 2014). Big data applications in
    farming are not strictly about primary production, but play a major role in improving
    the efficiency of the entire supply chain and alleviating food security concerns
    (Chen et al., 2014, Esmeijer et al., 2015, Gilpin, 2015a). Currently, big data
    applications discussed in the literature are taking place primarily in Europe
    and North America (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014). Considering the growing attention
    and keen interest shown in the literature, however, the number of applications
    is expected to grow rapidly in other countries like China (Li et al., 2014, Liu
    et al., 2012). Big data is the focus of in-depth, advanced, game-changing business
    analytics, at a scale and speed that the old approach of copying and cleansing
    all of it into a data warehouse is no longer appropriate (Devlin, 2012). Opportunities
    for Big Data applications in agriculture include benchmarking, sensor deployment
    and analytics, predictive modelling, and using better models to manage crop failure
    risk and to boost feed efficiency in livestock production (Faulkner and Cebul,
    2014, Lesser, 2014). In conclusion, Big Data is to provide predictive insights
    to future outcomes of farming (predictive yield model, predictive feed intake
    model, etc.), drive real-time operational decisions, and reinvent business processes
    for faster, innovative action and game-changing business models (Devlin, 2012).
    Decision-making in the future will be a complex mix of human and computer factors
    (Anonymous, 2014b). Big data is expected to cause changes to both the scope and
    the organization of farming (Poppe et al., 2015). While there are doubts whether
    farmers'' knowledge is about to be replaced by algorithms, Big Data applications
    are likely to change the way farms are operated and managed (Drucker, 2014). Key
    areas of change are real-time forecasting, tracking of physical items, and reinventing
    business processes (Devlin, 2012). Wider uptake of Big Data is likely to change
    both farm structures and the wider food chain in unexplored ways as what happened
    with the wider adoption of tractor and the introduction of pesticides in the 1950s.
    As with many technological innovations changes by Big Data applications in Smart
    Farming are driven by push-pull mechanisms. Pull, because there is a need for
    new technology to achieve certain goals. Push, because new technology enables
    people or organizations to achieve higher or new goals. This will be elaborated
    in the next subsections. 4.1.1. Pull factors From a business perspective, farmers
    are seeking ways to improve profitability and efficiency by on the one hand looking
    for ways to reduce their costs and on the other hand obtaining better prices for
    their product. Therefore they need to take better, more optimal decisions and
    improve management control. While in the past advisory services were based on
    general knowledge that once was derived from research experiments, there is an
    increasing need for information and knowledge that is generated on-farm in its
    local-specific context. It is expected that Big Data technologies help to achieve
    these goals in a better way (Poppe et al., 2015, Sonka, 2015). A specific circumstance
    for farming is the influence of the weather and especially its volatility. Local-specific
    weather and climate data can help decision-making a lot (Lesser, 2014). A general
    driver can be the relief of paper work because of all kind of regulations in agri-food
    production (Poppe et al., 2015). From a public perspective global food security
    is often mentioned as a main driver for further technological advancements (Gilpin,
    2015b, Lesser, 2014, Poppe et al., 2015). Besides, consumers are becoming more
    concerned about food safety and nutritional aspects of food related to health
    and well-being (Tong et al., 2015). In relation to that, Tong et al. (2015) mention
    the need for early warning systems instead of many ex-post analyses that are currently
    being done on historical data. 4.1.2. Push factors A general future development
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) in which all kinds of devices – smart objects
    – are connected and interact with each other through local and global, often wireless
    network infrastructures (Porter and Heppelmann, 2014). Precision agriculture can
    be considered as an exponent of this development and is often mentioned as an
    important driver for Big Data (Lesser, 2014, Poppe et al., 2015). This is expected
    to lead to radical changes in farm management because of access to explicit information
    and decision-making capabilities that were previously not possible, either technically
    or economically (Sonka, 2014). As a consequence, there is a rise of many ag-tech
    companies that pushes this data-driven development further (Lesser, 2014). Wireless
    data transfer technology also permits farmers to access their individual data
    from anywhere – whether they are at the farmhouse or meeting with buyers in Chicago
    – enabling them to make informed decisions about crop yield, harvesting, and how
    best to get their product to market (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014). Table 2 provides
    an overview and summarizes the push and pull factors that drive the development
    of Big Data and Smart Farming. Table 2. Summary of push and pull factors that

    processes 4.2.1. Farm processes Agricultural Big Data are known to be highly heterogeneous
    (Ishii, 2014, Li et al., 2014). The heterogeneity of data concerns for example
    the subject of the data collected (i.e., what is the data about) and the ways
    in which data are generated. Data collected from the field or the farm include
    information on planting, spraying, materials, yields, in-season imagery, soil
    types, weather, and other practices. There are in general three categories of
    data generation (Devlin, 2012, UNECE, 2013): (i) process-mediated (PM), (ii) machine-generated
    (MG) and (iii) human-sourced (HS). PM data, or the traditional business data,
    result from agricultural processes that record and monitor business events of
    interest, such as purchasing inputs, feeding, seeding, applying fertilizer, taking
    an order, etc. PM data are usually highly structured and include transactions,
    reference tables and relationships, as well as the metadata that define their
    context. Traditional business data are the vast majority of what IT managed and
    processed, in both operational and business information systems, usually structured
    and stored in relational database systems. MG data are derived from the vast increasing
    number of sensors and smart machines used to measure and record farming processes;
    this development is currently boosted by what is called the Internet of Things
    (IoT). MG data range from simple sensor records to complex computer logs and are
    typically well-structured. As sensors proliferate and data volumes grow, it is
    becoming an increasingly important component of the farming information stored
    and processed. Its well-structured nature is suitable for computer processing,
    but its size and speed is beyond traditional approaches. For Smart Farming, the
    potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been well-recognized (Faulkner
    and Cebul, 2014, Holmes, 2014). Drones with infrared cameras, GPS technology,
    are transforming agriculture with their support for better decision making, risk
    management (Anonymous, 2014c). In livestock farming, smart dairy farms are replacing
    labour with robots in activities like feeding cows, cleaning the barn, and milking
    the cows (Grobart, 2012). On arable farms, precision technology is increasingly
    used for managing information about each plant in the field (Vogt, 2013). With
    these new technologies data is not in traditional tables only, but can also appear
    in other formats like sounds or images (Sonka, 2015). In the meantime several
    advanced data analysis techniques have been developed that trigger the use of
    data in images or other formats (Lesser, 2014, Noyes, 2014). HM data is the record
    of human experiences, previously recorded in books and works of art, and later
    in photographs, audio and video. Human-sourced information is now almost entirely
    digitized and stored everywhere from personal computers to social networks. HM
    data are usually loosely structured and often ungoverned. In the context of Big
    Data and Smart Farming, human-sourced data have rarely been discussed except in
    relation to the marketing aspects (Verhoosel et al., 2016). Limited capacity with
    regard to the collection of relevant social media data and semantic integration
    of these data from a diversity of sources is considered to be a major challenge
    (Bennett, 2015). Table 3 provides an overview of current Big Data applications
    in relation to different elements of Smart Farming in key farming sectors. Table

    2013) Satellite data, (European Space Agency, 2016) From the business perspective,
    the main data products along the Big Data value chain are (predictive) analytics
    that provide decision support to business processes at various levels. The use
    or analysis of sensor data or similar data must somehow fit into existing or reinvented
    business processes. Integration of data from a variety of sources, both traditional
    and new, with multiple tools, is the first prerequisite. 4.2.2. Farm management
    As Big Data observers point out: big or small, Big Data is still data (Devlin,
    2012). It must be managed and analysed to extract its full value. Developments
    in wireless networks, IoT, and cloud computing are essentially only means to obtain
    data and generate Big Data. The ultimate use of Big Data is to obtain the information
    or intelligence embodied or enabled by Big Data. Agricultural Big Data will have
    no real value without Big Data analytics (Sun et al., 2013b). To obtain Big Data
    analytics, data from different sources need to be integrated into ‘lagoons of
    data’. In this process, data quality issues are likely to arise due to errors
    and duplications in data. As shown in Fig. 4, a series of operations on the raw
    data may be necessary to ensure the quality of data. Download : Download high-res

    processing of agricultural Big Data. (Source: Li et al., 2014) Since the advent
    of large-scale data collections or warehouses, the so-called data rich, information
    poor (DRIP) problems have been pervasive. The DRIP conundrum has been mitigated
    by the Big Data approach which has unleashed information in a manner that can
    support informed - yet, not necessarily defensible or valid - decisions or choices.
    Thus, by somewhat overcoming data quality issues with data quantity, data access
    restrictions with on-demand cloud computing, causative analysis with correlative
    data analytics, and model-driven with evidence-driven applications (Tien, 2013).
    Big data on its own can offer ‘a-ha’ insights, but it can only reliably deliver
    long-term business advantage when fully integrated with traditional data management
    and governance processes (Devlin, 2012). Big Data processing depends on traditional,
    process-mediated data and metadata to create the context and consistency needed
    for full, meaningful use. The results of Big Data processing must be fed back
    into traditional business processes to enable change and evolution of the business.
    4.2.3. Data chain As often discussed in the literature, a wide range of issues
    need to be addressed for big data applications. Both technical and governance
    issues can arise in different stages of the data chain, where governance challenges
    become increasingly dominant at the later stages of the data chain. Table 4 summarizes
    the state-of-the-art features of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and the
    key issues corresponding to each stage of the Big Data chain that were found in
    literature. At the initial stages, technical issues concerning data formats, hardware,
    and information standards may influence the availability of big data for further
    analysis. At the later stages, governance issues such as achieving agreements
    on responsibilities and liabilities become more challenging for business processes.

    by Big Data and Smart Farming, we seek to understand the stakeholder network around
    the farm. The literature suggests major shifts in roles and power relations among
    different players in existing agri-food chains. We observed the changing roles
    of old and new software suppliers in relation to Big Data and farming and emerging
    landscape of data-driven initiatives with prominent role of big tech and data
    companies like Google and IBM. In Fig. 5, the current landscape of data-driven
    initiatives is visualized. Download : Download high-res image (223KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The landscape of the Big Data network with
    business players. The stakeholder networks exhibits a high degree of dynamics
    with new players taking over the roles played by other players and the incumbents
    assuming new roles in relation to agricultural Big Data. As opportunities for
    Big Data have surfaced in the agribusiness sector, big agriculture companies such
    as Monsanto and John Deere have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on technologies
    that use detailed data on soil type, seed variety, and weather to help farmers
    cut costs and increase yields (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014). Other players include
    various accelerators, incubators, venture capital firms, and corporate venture
    funds (Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta, Bayer, DOW etc.) (Lane, 2015). Monsanto has
    been pushing big-data analytics across all its business lines, from climate prediction
    to genetic engineering. It is trying to persuade more farmers to adopt its cloud
    services. Monsanto says farmers benefit most when they allow the company to analyse
    their data - along with that of other farmers - to help them find the best solutions
    for each patch of land (Guild, 2014). While corporates are very much engaged with
    Big Data and agriculture, start-ups are at the heart of action, providing solutions
    across the value chain, from infrastructure and sensors all the way down to software
    that manages the many streams of data from across the farm. As the ag-tech space
    heats up, an increasing number of small tech start-ups are launching products
    giving their bigger counterparts a run for their money. In the USA, start-ups
    like FarmLogs (Guild, 2014), FarmLink (Hardy, 2014) and 640 Labs challenge agribusiness
    giants like Monsanto, Deere, DuPont Pioneer (Plume, 2014). One observes a swarm
    of data-service start-ups such as FarmBot (an integrated open-source precision
    agriculture system) and Climate Corporation. Their products are powered by many
    of the same data sources, particularly those that are freely available such as
    from weather services and Google Maps. They can also access data gathered by farm
    machines and transferred wirelessly to the cloud. Traditional agri-IT firms such
    as NEC and Dacom are active with a precision farming trial in Romania using environmental
    sensors and Big Data analytics software to maximize yields (NEC, 2014). Venture
    capital firms are now keen on investing in agriculture technology companies such
    as Blue River Technology, a business focusing on the use of computer vision and
    robotics in agriculture (Royse, 2014). The new players to Smart Farming are tech
    companies that were traditionally not active in agriculture. For example, Japanese
    technology firms such as Fujitsu are helping farmers with their cloud based farming
    systems (Anonymous, 2014c). Fujitsu collects data (rainfall, humidity, soil temperatures)
    from a network of cameras and sensors across the country to help farmers in Japan
    better manage its crops and expenses (Carlson, 2012). Data processing specialists
    are likely to become partners of producers as Big Data delivers on its promise
    to fundamentally change the competitiveness of producers. Beside business players
    such as corporates and start-ups, there are many public institutions (e.g., universities,
    USDA, the American Farm Bureau Federation, GODAN) that are actively influencing
    Big Data applications in farming through their advocacy on open data and data-driven
    innovation or their emphasis on governance issues concerning data ownership and
    privacy issues. Well-known examples are the Big Data Coalition, Open Agriculture
    Data Alliance (OADA) and AgGateway. Public institutions like the USDA, for example,
    want to harness the power of agricultural data points created by connected farming
    equipment, drones, and even satellites to enable precision agriculture for policy
    objectives like food security and sustainability. Precision farming is considered
    to be the “holy grail” because it is the means by which the food supply and demand
    imbalance will be solved. To achieve that precision, farmers need a lot of data
    to inform their planting strategies. That is why USDA is investing in big, open
    data projects. It is expected that open data and Big Data will be combined together
    to provide farmers and consumers just the right kind of information to make the
    best decisions (Semantic Community, 2015). 4.4. Network management 4.4.1. Organization
    Data ownership is an important issue in discussions on the governance of agricultural
    Big Data generated by smart machinery such as tractors from John Deere (Burrus,
    2014). In particular, value and ownership of precision agricultural data have
    received much attention in business media (Haire, 2014). It has become a common
    practice to sign Big Data agreements on ownership and control data between farmers
    and agriculture technology providers (Anonymous, 2014a). Such agreements address
    questions such as: How can farmers make use of Big Data? Where does the data come
    from? How much data can we collect? Where is it stored? How do we make use of
    it? Who owns this data? Which companies are involved in data processing? There
    is also a growing number of initiatives to address or ease privacy and security
    concerns. For example, the Big Data Coalition, a coalition of major farm organizations
    and agricultural technology providers in the USA, has set principles on data ownership,
    data collection, notice, third-party access and use, transparency and consistency,
    choice, portability, data availability, market speculation, liability and security
    safeguards (Haire, 2014). And AgGateway, a non-profit organization with more than
    200 member companies in the USA, have drawn a white paper that presents ways to
    incorporate data privacy and standards (AgGateway, 2014). It provides users of
    farm data and their customers with issues to consider when establishing policies,
    procedures, and agreements on using that data instead of setting principles and
    privacy norms. The ‘Ownership Principle’ of the Big Data Coalition states that
    “We believe farmers own information generated on their farming operations. However,
    it is the responsibility of the farmer to agree upon data use and sharing with
    the other stakeholders (...).” While having concerns about data ownership, farmers
    also see how much companies are investing in Big Data. In 2013, Monsanto paid
    nearly 1 billion US dollars to acquire The Climate Corporation, and more industry
    consolidation is expected. Farmers want to make sure they reap the profits from
    Big Data, too. Such change of thinking may lead to new business models that allow
    shared harvesting of value from data. Big data applications in Smart Farming will
    potentially raise many power-related issues (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014). There
    might be companies emerging that gain much power because they get all the data.
    In the agri-food chain these could be input suppliers or commodity traders, leading
    to a further power shift in market positions (Lesser, 2014). This power shift
    can also lead to potential abuses of data e.g. by the GMO lobby or agricultural
    commodity markets or manipulation of companies (Noyes, 2014). Initially, these
    threats might not be obvious because for many applications small start-up companies
    with hardly any power are involved. However, it is a common business practice
    that these are acquired by bigger companies if they are successful and in this
    way the data still gets concentrated in the hands of one big player (Lesser, 2014).
    Gilpin (2015b), for example, concluded that Big Data is both a huge opportunity
    as a potential threat for farmers. 4.4.2. Technology To make Big Data applications
    for Smart Farming work, an appropriate technological infrastructure is essential.
    Although we could not find much information about used infrastructures in literature
    it can be expected that the applications from the AgTech and AgBusiness companies
    in Fig. 5 are based on their existing infrastructure that is usually supplied
    by large software vendors. This has resulted in several proprietary platforms
    such as AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deere''s FarmSight or Monsanto''s FieldScripts.
    Initially these platforms were quite closed and difficult to connect to by other
    third parties. However, they increasingly realize to be part of a system of systems
    (Porter and Heppelmann, 2014) resulting in more open platforms in which data is
    accessible through open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The tech- and
    data start-ups mainly rely on open standards (e.g. ISOBUS) through which they
    are able to combine different datasets. Moreover, Farmobile recently introduced
    a piece of hardware, the passive uplink communicator (PUC), which captures all
    machine data into a database that can be transmitted wirelessly (Young, 2016).
    In North America, several initiatives are undertaken to open up data transfer
    between several platforms and devices. The ISOBlue project facilitates data acquisition
    through the development of and open-source hardware platform and software libraries
    to forward ISOBUS messages to the cloud and develop applications for Android smartphones
    (Layton et al., 2014). The Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK) endeavours to provide a specialized
    Farm Management Information System incorporating low-cost, widely available mobile
    computing technologies, internet-based cloud storage services, and user-centred
    design principles (Welte et al., 2013). One of the internet-based cloud storage
    services that is candidate in the OpenATK is Trello, which is also advocated by
    Ault et al. (2013). They emphasize the capability to share data records easily
    between several workers within the farm or stakeholders outside the farm and the
    guarantee of long-term ownership of farmer''s data. In Europe, much work to realize
    an open infrastructure for data exchange and collaboration was done within the
    Future Internet programme. The focus of this programme was to realize a set of
    Generic Enablers (GEs) for e.g. cloud hosting, data and context management services,
    IoT services, security and Big Data Analysis which are common to all Future Internet
    applications for all kind of different sectors, called FIWARE (Wolfert et al.,
    2014). The SmartAgriFood proposed a conceptual architecture for Future Internet
    applications for the agri-food domain based on these FIWARE GEs (Kaloxylos et
    al., 2012, Kaloxylos et al., 2014). The FIspace project implemented this architecture
    into a real platform for business collaboration which is visualized in Fig. 6
    (Barmpounakis et al., 2015, Wolfert et al., 2014). Download : Download high-res
    image (167KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. A high-level picture
    of the FIspace architecture based on FIWARE GEs. Further explanation in text.
    FIspace uses FIWARE Generic Enablers (GEs) but has two particular extensions for
    business collaboration: the App Store and the Real-Time B2B collaboration core.
    These key components are connected with several other modules to enable system
    integration (e.g. with IoT), to ensure Security, Privacy and Trust in business
    collaboration and an Operating Environment and Software Development Kit to support
    an ‘ecosystem’ in which Apps for the FIspace store can be developed. The FIspace
    platform will be approachable through various type of front-ends (e.g. web or
    smartphone), but also direct M2M communication is possible. Because all mentioned
    open platforms are result from recent projects, their challenge is still how they
    could be broadly adopted. For the FIspace platform, a first attempt was made in
    the FIWARE accelerator programme1 in which several hundreds of start-ups were
    funded to develop apps and services and also received business support. Some of
    them were already successful in receiving further funding from private investors,
    but it is too early to determine the final success rate of this programme. 4.5.
    Challenges The challenges for Big Data and Smart Farming found in literature can
    be broadly classified into technical and organizational ones of which the latter
    category is considered the most important (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014, Sonka, 2015).
    Moreover, most technical challenges will be solved if enough business opportunities
    for Big Data in Smart Farming can be created, so there needs to be a clear return
    on investment (Lesser, 2014). On the revenue side, there is a challenge to make
    solutions affordable for farmers, especially for those in developing countries
    (Kshetri, 2014). If there will be more users of Big Data applications it will
    lead in its turn to more valuable data, often referred to as the reciprocal value
    of Big Data (Van ''t Spijker, 2014). This is a very important feature that needs
    to be carefully implemented in companies'' strategies. On the costs side, the
    challenge is to automate data acquisition in such a way that there are virtually
    no costs (Sonka, 2015). Because on-farm data will generally remain in the hands
    of individual companies, investments are needed in a common pool infrastructure
    to transfer and integrate data and finally make applications out of it. Poppe
    et al. (2015) refer to this as Agricultural Business Collaboration and Data Exchange
    Facilities (ABCDEFs). An important question concerning these ABCDEFs is if these
    will be closed, proprietary systems such as currently Monsanto''s FieldScripts
    or if these will be more open as proposed by e.g. the OpenATK or the FIspace platform.
    Finally, another business-related challenge of Big Data is how the potential of
    information across food systems can be utilized (Sonka, 2015). One of the biggest
    challenges of Big Data governance is probably how to ensure privacy and security
    (Lesser, 2014, Orts and Spigonardo, 2014, Sonka, 2014, Van ''t Spijker, 2014).
    Currently this is sometimes inhibiting developments when data are in silos, guarded
    by employees or companies because of this issue. They are afraid that data fall
    into the wrong hands (e.g. of competitors) (Gilpin, 2015b). Hence privileged access
    to Big Data and building trust with farmers should be a starting point in developing
    applications (Van ''t Spijker, 2014). Therefore new organizational linkages and
    modes of collaboration need to be formed in the agri-food chain (Sonka, 2014).
    In other words, it means the ability to quickly access the correct data sources
    to evaluate key performance/core processes and outcome indicators in building
    successful growth strategies (Yang, 2014). All aforementioned challenges make
    that the current amounts of farm data is currently underutilized (Bennett, 2015).
    Another problem is that the availability and quality of the data is often poor
    and needs to be ensured before you can make use of it (Lesser, 2014, Orts and
    Spigonardo, 2014). A lack of integration is also reported as an important problem
    (Yang, 2014). Anonymization of data, so that it cannot be traced back to individual
    companies can also be a problem sometimes (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014). There are
    also attempts to include more open, governmental data (cf. the GODAN initiative),
    but a problem can be that the underlying systems were never designed for that
    or they contain many inconsistent, incompatible data (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014).
    5. Conclusions and recommendations In this paper a literature review on Big Data
    applications in Smart Farming was conducted. In Section 2 it was concluded that
    currently there are not many references in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
    Therefore, a reliable, quantitative analysis was not possible. Furthermore, findings
    from grey literature may lack scientific rigor as can be expected from peer-reviewed
    journal articles. However, as articles from grey literature are publicly available,
    they can be seen as being subject to public scrutiny and therefore reasonably
    reliable. As such, we consider that the knowledge base was enriched by articles
    from grey literature. Besides, much effort was put into developing a framework
    for analysis that can be used for future reviews with a more quantitative approach.
    Based on the findings in this paper several conclusions can be drawn on the state-of-the-art
    of Big Data applications in Smart Farming. First of all, Big Data in Smart Farming
    is still in an early development stage. This is based on the fact there are only
    limited scientific publications available on this topic and much information had
    to be derived from ‘grey literature’. The applications discussed are mainly from
    Europe and Northern America, with a growing number of applications expected from
    other countries as well. Considering the scope of the review, no geographic analysis
    was performed in this study. Further conclusions, drawn as answers to the research
    questions we formulated in the Introduction, are elaborated below. What role does
    Big Data play in Smart Farming? Big Data is changing the scope and organization
    of farming through a pull-push mechanism. Global issues such as food security
    and safety, sustainability and as a result efficiency improvement are tried to
    be addressed by Big Data applications. These issues make that the scope of Big
    Data applications extends far beyond farming alone, but covers the entire supply
    chain. The Internet of Things development, wirelessly connecting all kind of objects
    and devices in farming and the supply chain, is producing many new data that are
    real-time accessible. This applies to all stages in the cyber-physical management
    cycle (Fig. 1). Operations and transactions are most important sources of process-mediated
    data. Sensors and robots producing also non-traditional data such as images and
    videos provide many machine-generated data. Social media is an important source
    for human-sourced data. These big amounts of data provide access to explicit information
    and decision-making capabilities at a level that was not possible before. Analytics
    is key success factor to create value out of these data. Many new and innovative
    start-up companies are eager to sell and deploy all kind of applications to farmers
    of which the most important ones are related to sensor deployment, benchmarking,
    predictive modelling and risk management. What stakeholders are involved and how
    are they organized? Referring to Fig. 5, there are first of all the traditional
    players in agriculture such as input suppliers and technology suppliers for which
    there is a clear move towards Big Data as their most important business model.
    Most of them are pushing their own platforms and solutions to farmers, which are
    often proprietary and rather closed environments although a tendency towards more
    openness is observed. This is stimulated by farmers - organized in cooperatives
    or coalitions - that are concerned about data privacy and security and also want
    to create value with their own data or at least want to benefit from Big Data
    solutions. Beside the traditional players we see that Big Data is also attracting
    many new entrants which are often start-ups supported by either large private
    investors or large ICT or non-agricultural tech companies. Also public institutions
    aim to open up public data that can be combined with private data. These developments
    raise issues around data ownership, value of data and privacy and security. The
    architecture and infrastructure of Big Data solutions are also significantly determining
    how stakeholder networks are organized. On the one hand there is a tendency towards
    closed, proprietary systems and on the other hand towards more open systems based
    on open source, standards and interfaces. Further development of Big Data applications
    may therefore likely result in two extremes of supply chain scenarios: one with
    further integration of the supply chain in which farmers become franchisers; another
    in which farmers are empowered by Big Data and open collaboration and can easily
    switch between suppliers, share data with government and participate in short
    supply chains rather than integrated long supply chains. In reality, the situation
    will be a continuum between these two extremes differentiated by crop, commodity,
    market structure, etc. What are the expected changes that are caused by Big Data
    developments? From this review it can be concluded that Big Data will cause major
    changes in scope and organization of Smart Farming. Business analytics at a scale
    and speed that was never seen before will be a real game changer, continuously
    reinventing new business models. Referring to Fig. 1, it can be expected that
    farm management and operations will drastically change by access to real-time
    data, real-time forecasting and tracking of physical items and in combination
    with IoT developments in further automation and autonomous operation of the farm.
    Taking also the previous research question into account, it is already visible
    that Big Data will also cause major shifts in power relationships between the
    different players in the Big Data farming stakeholder network. The current development
    stage does however not reveal yet towards which main scenario Smart Farming will
    be developed. What challenges need to be addressed in relation to the previous
    questions? A long list of key issues was already provided in Table 4, but the
    most important ones are • Data-ownership and related privacy and security issues
    – these issues have to be properly addressed, but when this is applied too strictly
    it can also slow down innovations; • Data quality – which has always been a key
    issue in farm management information systems, but is more challenging with big,
    real-time data; • Intelligent processing and analytics – for Big Data this is
    also more challenging because of the large amount of often unstructured, heterogeneous
    data which requires a smart interplay between skilled data scientists and domain
    experts; • Sustainable integration of Big Data sources – integration of many different
    data sources is challenging but because this is crucial for your business model
    this has to be done in a sustainable manner; • Business models that are attractive
    enough for solution providers but that also enable a fair share between the different
    stakeholders; • Openness of platforms that will accelerate solution development
    and innovation in general but also empower farmers in their position in supply
    chains. The framework for analysis was developed from a chain network perspective
    with specific attention to network management between the stakeholders that are
    involved. In future research it could also be valuable to look at this subject
    from a wider innovation perspective (Busse et al., 2015, Klerkx et al., 2010,
    Lamprinopoulou et al., 2014). The same holds for ethical aspects of an innovation
    such as Big Data that could be addressed in future research (Carolan, 2016, Driessen
    and Heutinck, 2015, Wigboldus et al., 2016). The promise of Big Data in agriculture
    is alluring, but the challenges above have to be addressed for increased uptake
    of Big Data applications. Although there are certainly technical issues to be
    resolved we recommend to focus first on the governance issues that were identified
    and design suitable business models because these are currently the most inhibiting
    factors. References AgGateway, 2014 AgGateway Data privacy and use white paper

    China SECTION I. Introduction At present, China''s agriculture mainly depends
    on human labor, planting, fertilization and irrigation rely on previous experience.
    In the process of large-scale planting, it is difficult to achieve fine planting.
    It causes a waste of agricultural materials and can not obtain stable output.
    Many domestic scholars have joined the research on smart agriculture [1]–[7],
    which is based on sensor technology and Internet of things technology for data
    collection and analysis. However, there is no model built with the help of big
    data and agricultural knowledge to calculate and analyze and give planting guidance.
    This research will integrate the knowledge of Agronomy, Internet of things, big
    data processing, system analysis and other fields, and realize the remote real-time
    monitoring of the information of planting, growth environment and plant ontology
    through various sensors. The construction of intelligent agriculture system analysis
    platform hands over complex data analysis to computer processing, and interacts
    with users with operation instructions and simple and understandable information.
    It has improved the overall intelligent planting level in China, and is expected
    to be applied on a large scale in agricultural production. SECTION II. Intelligent

    and the national reuse soil landfill. At the same time, it is necessary to calibrate
    the position of solar panels to ensure the maximum illumination efficiency throughout
    the day and provide sufficient illumination for battery charging. The soil sensor
    needs to be pulled and buried in the field. In order to accurately find the sensor
    position after crop growth, insert a benchmark for prompt, and set a monitoring
    point every 20m. As shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Schematic diagram of sensor layout

    multi-point sampling. In order to obtain more accurate sensor data, it is necessary
    to dig a pit larger than 20cm vertically, insert the steel needle horizontally
    into the pit wall, and then fill the pit tightly. After stabilizing for a period
    of time, continuous data acquisition can be carried out. The sensor can obtain

    timely respond to and control the front-end equipment and improve the user experience.
    The disadvantage is that the executable needs to be uploaded again every time
    the software is updated. The software UI is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8. Software
    ui Show All B. Platform Business and Function Introduction Data Collection The
    user terminal obtains the soil temperature, humidity, nutrient and other data
    at the collection point through the data server, obtains the change trend map
    of soil and crops through long-term records, and controls fertilization, irrigation
    and other operations through the change trend and in combination with the growth
    situation and nutrient demand of relevant crops. Fault Alarm Through the analysis
    of big data, the user terminal will predict the upcoming drought, flood, diseases
    and insect pests in advance, remind the user what measures should be taken to
    avoid disasters, and the user can also observe the crop situation anytime and
    anywhere through handheld devices. Data Statistics Realize daily, monthly and
    annual reports or print scheduled data and any data immediately, such as temperature
    value, humidity value, nutrient value, fertilization amount, irrigation amount,
    time and date, illumination, wind direction, etc. And carry out automatic statistics
    to generate curves and reports. Accurate Decision-Making It broadens the way to
    find problems, accelerates the process of solving problems, realizes centralized
    monitoring and unified scheduling, and improves the level of management and service,
    as well as the efficiency and accuracy of decision-making. Efficient Management
    The traditional “field patrol management” is changed to “system centralized management”,
    which not only reduces the loss of “patrol” personnel and vehicles, but also reduces
    the maintenance cost; Moreover, the user terminal management only needs to operate
    according to the system prompt, does not need too much agricultural foundation,
    and does not require high knowledge level of talents. Model Prediction Obtain
    the information of fertilization and irrigation suitable for crop growth through
    the big data analysis of the user terminal, so as to avoid excessive fertilization
    and irrigation. Prevention of Diseases and Insect Pests The system can realize
    remote observation of crop growth and soil texture, timely collect, calculate
    and store the soil conditions every day, every month and every year, understand
    the crop conditions at any time, implement effective management, reduce the loss
    of natural disasters, prevent diseases and insect pests and improve economic benefits.
    Expert q&a Connect relevant agricultural experts online for online guidance and
    Q&A. Help operators obtain solutions accurately and quickly. With the support
    of system data and the guidance of online experts, the planting becomes very efficient
    and the yield is guaranteed. C. Sensor Statistical Data Analysis The object of
    this data analysis is the cotton field in Xinjiang long staple cotton planting
    base. The factors affecting cotton yield and quality include cotton varieties,
    local water and soil conditions, operator planting technology, temperature, light,
    precipitation, frost fall and other meteorological factors. By installing equipment
    in the experimental site and collecting data, the temperature and humidity curve
    data of air and soil are obtained. The curve can be analyzed. The temperature
    difference between day and night in this area is large, so the soil temperature
    also changes. As shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. Fig. 9. Air temperature Show All
    Fig. 10. Soil temperature Show All Due to the change of temperature difference
    between day and night, soil heat preservation and moisture retention is particularly
    key. The soil in this area uses film moisturizing technology. It can be seen from
    the curve that there is no significant change in soil moisture, as shown in Fig.
    11. Through this curve, we can set the upper and lower limits of irrigation. Avoid
    excessive irrigation or dry soil. Use big data for prediction. The optimal irrigation
    time point and irrigation amount can be analyzed in advance. Because infiltration
    takes a period of time, we can make full use of this time to keep plants in a
    good water environment. Fig. 11. Soil moisture Show All EC can be used to measure
    the concentration of soluble salts in soil, and high concentration of soluble
    salts will damage plants or cause root death. It can be seen from Fig. 12. that
    after fertilization, the EC value will rise rapidly, and then slowly absorb and
    dissolve the soil, and the average EC value will return to the normal level. So
    the plants are growing well. Fig. 12. Soil ec Show All SECTION VI. Conclusions
    This paper designs and constructs the intelligent agriculture system, and collects
    data in real fields for one year. Through the analysis of the data of the target
    crop cotton. Through the scientific data and the actual planting conditions in
    the area, the planting guidance scheme is given, including irrigation, fertilization,
    heat preservation, saline alkali land neutralization and so on. The results of
    the experimental prototype show that the cotton yield of the next year is increased
    by about 10% compared with the field of non intelligent planting. It is believed
    that through further data and technical iteration, the yield of cotton will be
    greatly improved. Field installation and commissioning, as shown in Fig. 13. Fig.

    Keyword Computer science 1. Introduction In recent times artificial neural networks
    (ANNs) has become popular and helpful model for classification, clustering, pattern
    recognition and prediction in many disciplines. ANNs are one type of model for
    machine learning (ML) and has become relatively competitive to conventional regression
    and statistical models regarding usefulness [1]. Currently, artificial intelligence
    (machine learning, neural network, deep learning, robotic), information security,
    big data, cloud computing, internet, and forensic science are all hotspots and
    exciting topics of information and communication technology (ICT). ANNs full applications
    can be evaluated with respect to data analysis factors such as accuracy, processing
    speed, latency, performance, fault tolerance, volume, scalability and convergence
    [2, 3]. The great potential of ANNs is the high-speed processing provided in a
    massive parallel implementation and this has heightened the need for research
    in this domain [4]. ANNs can be developed and used for image recognition, natural
    language processing and so on. Nowadays, ANNs are mostly used for universal function
    approximation in numerical paradigms because of their excellent properties of
    self-learning, adaptivity, fault tolerance, nonlinearity, and advancement in input
    to an output mapping [5]. These data analysis factors give more reason why ANNs
    are effective, efficient and successful in providing a high level of capability
    in handling complex and non-complex problems in many spheres of life. ANNs are
    capable of handling problems in agriculture, science, medical science, education,
    finance, management, security, engineering, trading commodity and art. Including
    problems in manufacturing, transportation, computer security, banking, insurance,
    properties management, marketing, energy, and those challenges that cannot be
    solve by the computational ability of traditional procedures and conventional
    mathematics. Despite these extensive applications of ANNs, there is an increasing
    need to address the problem of adopting a systematic approach in ANNs development
    phase to improve its performance. For instance, an approach to address major factors
    and topics in a choice of data sets (size, volume, small, large and otherwise),
    the accuracy of data, data instrument, data standardization, type of data inputs,
    data division, and data preprocessing, validations, processing and output techniques.
    Also, other key challenges or issues that are common with ANN modeling which have
    received interest and require further investigation in future. Including developmental
    techniques that can improve designing of robust models, improving pattern transparency
    and allowing useful knowledge from trained ANNs. More also is the challenges of
    improving extrapolation ability, new approaches to uncertainty and improving convergences.
    More also, there is continuous gradient enigma and quantization of variable problems
    and noise. Furthermore, there is a need to address the traversal of the error
    surface by utilizing quantization of variable and time-consuming convergence problems
    common to most artificial neural systems (ANS) that use supervised training. Some
    of these problems are highlights as follows: (i) Improve designing of robust models:
    model robustness means predictive capability of ANN kinds in generalizing range
    of data like those used for training. An example is using of textual data or information
    to improve modeling prediction of the financial market. Some experts believe if
    that ANNs become globally accepted and reach apex potentiality, they will not
    only provide a good fit to calibration and validation of data. But will enable
    predictions that will be plausible regarding model''s correlation and robustness
    in any range of conditions [6, 7]. ANNs validated of error can give accurate predictions
    for conditions like those found in trained data. (ii) Improving of model transparency
    and the enabling of knowledge extraction from trained ANNs: means the possibility
    of interpreting ANN models in a way that provides a deep understanding of the
    effect of model inputs to outputs. (iii) Improving extrapolation ability: extrapolation
    of ANN models is the capability of the model to predict accurately outward range
    of data used for ANN model calibration. ANNs perform best if they do not extrapolate
    above the range of data used for design or model calibration [8, 9, 10]. (iv)
    New approaches to uncertainty: another limitation of ANNs including uncertainty
    in predictions which may not be taken to account. When uncertainty is not accounted,
    it becomes difficult to measure ANN predictions quality, which can critically
    limits or reduces their efficacy. Although ANNs has had their issues, new approaches
    like cognitive computing and deep learning have significantly raised the support
    in these fields. A synthetic machine might still be out of reach, but systems
    like ANNs that help improve people''s lives are here today. 2. Main text 2.1.
    Artificial neural networks Nowadays ANNs application have become popular in various
    area of human needs. Many organizations are investing in the neural networks to
    solve problems in various fields and the economic sector which traditionally fall
    under the responsibility of operations research [11]. What makes artificial intelligence
    unique is that it is mostly proposed for data analyses by academics in the fields
    of social science and arts apart from its usefulness in science and engineering
    [12], because of its wide applications. For example, in recent times, artificial
    intelligence (AI) has been extensively applied to optimization issues in diverse
    areas like industrial production and petroleum exploration [13] and business [14]
    setting. A good advantage of ANNs application is that it can make models easy
    to use and more accurate from complex natural systems with large inputs [15].
    The ANN is found to be a very novel and useful model applied to problem-solving
    and machine learning. ANN is an information manager model that is similar to biological
    nervous systems function of the man brain. Recently, research interest in brain
    functionality has rapidly increased globally [16]. According to Haykin [17], an
    ANN can be comparable machine produced to function the same way the human brain
    performs a given task of interest. For example, "the human brain is big and highly
    efficient. The man brain is like an information-processing machine that has a
    variety of complex signal computing operations” [18], that can be easily coordinated
    to perform a task. The main element of this brain is the unique design of their
    information-processing capability. It constitutes many complexes interconnected
    “neurons” in the form of elements working together to solve specific problems
    on daily basis. A typical example of a neural network function is the human brain
    that is connected to send and receive signals for human action. An illustration
    of how the human brain function is explained in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res
    image (377KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. A typical human brain
    structure with operational capabilities. Fig. 1 is a demonstration of a connection
    within the brain working like a neural network that performs intelligence reasoning
    functions. Brainstorming to understand a scenario (like an internet web search
    platform), recognizing speech (e.g. from a known person and unknown person) like
    the human brain, recognizing an image (from an object) like the brain, can process
    language (translate language) like the human brain does and can perform other
    things like eating, riding a bicycle (self-intuition). For more specific examples;
    ANNs has seen massive use in specific domains, such as; diagnosis of hepatitis;
    speech recognition; recovery of data in telecommunications from faulty software;
    interpretation of multi-language messages; three-dimensional object recognition;
    texture analysis; facial recognition; undersea mine detection; and hand-written
    word recognition. Thus, ANNs can learn by example like people. In some cases,
    ANNs can be designed for a specific application like data classification or pattern
    recognition through the learning process [19]. Learning in the human brain requires
    adjustments to the synaptic relationship between and among neurons, likewise the
    learning in ANNs [19]. Generally, an ANN function like an imitation of the man
    brain [1, 20]. An architecture of a typical NN is showed in Fig. 2. Download :
    Download high-res image (307KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. A
    typical neural network architecture. Neural network (NN) layers are independent
    of one another; that is, a specific layer can have an arbitrary number of nodes.
    This arbitrary number of nodes is called bias node. The bias nodes always set
    as equal to one. In analogy, the bias nodes are like the offset in linear regression
    given as; y = ax + b, where “a” is the coefficient of independent “x” and then
    “b” is called slope. A bias major function is to provide node with a constant
    value that is trainable, in addition to the normal inputs received by the network
    node. Importantly, a bias value enables one to move the activation function either
    to the right or the left, that can be analytical for ANN training success. When
    the NN used as a classifier, the input and the output nodes will match input features
    and output classes. However, when the NN is used as a function approximation,
    it generally has an input and an output node. However, the number of designed
    hidden nodes essential greater than those of input nodes. 2.2. Applications of
    neural networks Given this description of neural networks (NNs), how its work,
    and their real-world applications and uses, indeed, NNs have wide applied to real-world
    problem in business, education, economics and in many aspects of life problems.
    NNs are also applicable to optimization method [21] intrusion detection [22, 23]
    and data classification [24, 25, 26]. Classification regarded as a form of difficult
    optimization challenge. Most researchers applied machine learning (ML) techniques
    in solving classification problem [27, 28]. NNs are excellent identifier of trends
    in data and patterns [29], they are suited for forecasting and prediction needs
    including those items listing (with references to Supplementary Table 1). The
    list in Supplementary Table 1 based on the successful application of ANN to real-world
    problems. It summarizes neural networks application in practice which integrated
    into many areas like modeling, classification, pattern recognition, and prediction.
    Prediction of financial stability is useful in economic, management and development
    of any nation, which is beneficiary for analyzing the monetary value of any economy.
    Moreover, ANNs have been used successfully in the prediction of banks success
    or failure and stock market estimation. Likewise, it is used extensively in forecasting
    of weather and climatic change which is helpful in human safety and security of
    properties such as buildings, environment, installation, houses, and transportation.
    Furthermore, ANNs applied successfully to different areas of agriculture like
    remote sensing, particularly in the crop type classification and crop production
    estimation. Therefore, Supplementary Table 1 provides a general review of the
    wide scope of problems that this neuro-Intelligence system can currently address.

    Review framework for artificial neural networks classification. A feedforward
    neural network (FFNN) is a machine learning classification algorithm that made
    up of organized in layers that are similar to human neuron processing units. In
    FFNN each unit in a layer relates to all the other units in the layers. These
    layers connections with units are not all equal because each connection can have
    a different weight or strength. The weights of the network connections measure
    the potential amount of the knowledge of the network. Also, NN units are known
    as nodes. The information processing in the network involves data entry from the
    input units and passes through the network, flowing from one layer to another
    layer until it gets to the output units. When NN operate normally, that is when
    its acted as a classifier, then there will be no feedback between layers [30].
    In FFNN, information transmitted only in one direction, that is from the input
    nodes, to the hidden nodes, if any, and then to output nodes. With this behaviour,
    they are called feedforward neural networks [31]. Examples of FFNNs is single
    layer perception and multilayer perceptron. Example of a two-layered network is
    3 input units, 4 units with a hidden layer and 5 units of output layer as circles
    respectively in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (210KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 4. Two-layered feedforward neural network. Fig.
    4, has 3 input units as shown in circles, but input units is not part of any layer
    in the network system, sometimes the input units are regarded as a virtual layer
    having 0 layers. A hidden layer is neither an input or output layers, that is
    Fig. 4, has 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer and its shows all the connections
    between the units in the layers. It is clear that a layer only connects to the
    previous layer. FFNN applications is classified into two such as control of dynamical
    systems [32, 33], and spaces where the classic machine learning techniques are
    applied [34]. NNs with two or more hidden layers are called deep networks because
    the network has become complex with more than 1 hidden layer. Unlike FFNN, the
    feed-backward neural network (FBNN) can use internal state “memory” (store information)
    to process sequence of data inputs. That means FFNN can logically handle task
    according to first come first serve bases of inputs. Feed-backward NN can applied
    to tasks like un-segmentation, and pattern recognition (connected handwriting
    recognition). Feed-backward neural network application areas include mathematical
    proofs, seismic data fitting, medicine, science, engineering, classification,
    function estimation, and time-series prediction, etc. An architecture of FBNN
    illustrated as in Fig. 5. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download

    or backpropagation, connections between nodes produced a coordinated graph in
    sequence. The coordinated graph in sequence allows feedback NNs to demonstrate
    dynamic terrestrial behaviour for a time sequence. Examples are Kohonen''s self
    organizing map and recurrent neural network (RNN). RNN referred to a standard
    kind of neural network which extended over time, with edges that feed into the
    next time step rather than feeding into the next layer concurrent time of step.
    RNN is constructed to sequences recognition, for instance, a text or a speech
    signal. It has cycles within that indicates presence of short-memory in the net.
    Unlike a recurrent neural network, an RNN is like a hierarchical network where
    the input need processing hierarchically in the form of a tree because there is
    no time to the input sequence. 2.4. Deep learning Artificial intelligence (AI)
    has existed over many decades, and the field is wide. AI can be view as a set
    that contains machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). The ML is a subset
    of AI, meanwhile, DL, in turn, a subset of ML. That is DL is an aspect of AI;
    the term deep learning refers to artificial neural networks (ANN) with complex
    multilayers [35]. The distinction between deep learning and neural networks like
    feedforward NNs and feed backward NNs lies in their characteristic. Deep learning
    has more complex ways of connecting layers, also has more neurons count than previous
    networks to express complex models, more also with more computing power to train
    and further has automatic extraction of the feature. Therefore, DL defined as
    a NN with a broad variables and layers with a single basic network architecture
    of unsupervised pre-trained networks, convolutional NNs, recursive NNs, and recurrent
    NNs. The technological development in the field of AI has expanded over time as
    showed in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (209KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Artificial intelligence development and expansion. DL
    methods have been found to be fitting for big data study with remarkable success
    in its applied to speech recognition, computer vision, pattern recognition, recommendation
    systems, and natural language processing [36]. Nowadays, the innovation of DL
    in image identification, object detection, image classification, and face identification
    tasks have great success. The research by Zhou et al. [37] presents an application
    of DL in object detection task and its speedy use in the domain of computer vision.
    Similarly, the recently reviewed work by Liu et al. [36] discusses popularity
    of DL architectures and their industrial and practical applications. The review
    provided a comprehensive knowledge on four DL architectures like, deep belief
    network, restricted Boltzmann machine, autoencoder, and convolutional neural network
    (CNN). One of the most common deep NNs is the convolutional NN called CNN. A CNN
    is a standard NN that extends across space via shared weights. CNN is designed
    to recognize images by having convolutions within, that can recognize the image
    of an object. CNN has multiple layers; including fully-connected layer, pooling
    layer, convolutional and non-linearity layers. The fully connected layers and
    convolutional layers have parameters, however non-linearity layers and pooling
    do not have parameters. Study have shown that CNN has an excellent performance
    in ML problems [35]. Particularly, in the applications to image data, like the
    most extensive image classification dataset, natural language processing, and
    computer vision. The major concept of deep learning (DL) is learning data representations
    by increasing the quality of handling the ideas rather than events (abstraction)
    levels. Mostly in all levels, a significant amount of quality ideas or abstraction
    representation at a advance level are known through definition regarding fewer
    quality ideas or non-representations at the basic levels. This type of stages
    of learning, growth or hierarchical process of learning is superb because it can
    enable a system to fathom complex or multi-complex presentations accurately from
    raw data [38, 39]. This superb characteristic is making deep learning applicable
    to different fields. To fast tract classification, recognition of patterns in
    biological data, many methods of artificial intelligence particularly the machine
    learning has been proposed [38, 40, 41]. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a combination
    of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning (DL), thus mathematically, AI
    = RL + DL. Machine learning has become the latest model to digital evolution,
    that is making computing processes more cost-effective, efficient, strong, dependable
    and reliable. Conventional machine learning techniques widely classified into
    two sets that is, supervised and unsupervised. The supervised learning has the
    capability of classifying objects in a pool with possibility of given features
    or attributes nor annotations. A typical example of supervised learning is when
    students have written an exam, and having the exam marked by the teacher and shown
    which questions the students answered incorrectly. After being shown the correct
    answers, the students are expected to learn then understand how to answer those
    questions correctly. But the unsupervised learning methods form clusters or groups
    between and among the objects in an area to identify likeness, then use similarity
    for classifying unknowns. Example of unsupervised learning is the man that is
    learning how to ride a car by himself. He will start by entering the car and start
    the engine with the ignition key, then put down the clutch and put the car in
    first gear and press the accelerator for the car to move forward and then manage
    to control the steering. He continually practices the driving steps in a large
    open field and gradually master the driving technique, and then over time start
    to enter the road to drive skillfully. The reinforcement learning (RL) category,
    enables a system or an agent learn from the previous experiences gains in the
    environment through interaction and observing the results of these interactions.
    The interaction helps to mimic or imitates the basic pattern in which humans and
    animals learn. An agent of RL can act, and each act influences the agent''s future
    condition, a scalar reward signal measures RL success. RL goal is to choose actions
    that maximize future gain. In nutshell, DL, is a general-purpose framework in
    making decision. A framework that present learning given require objective from
    raw inputs by applying minimal domain knowledge. For instance, RL completely bypasses
    the problem of rules learning in a task. The learning agent learns by participating
    in the given activity. An example is a game of Chessboard, to determine the best
    action play move, the players need to think about various possibilities and strategies.
    The amount of possibilities is potentially big that it is not possible to perform
    a brute-force search. However, if a machine is to be built to play such a game
    using traditional techniques, there will be a necessity to specify many rules
    to cover all these possibilities. Reinforcement learning completely bypasses this
    problem. Examples of RL include value based deep RL, model based deep RL and policy
    based deep RL. While common supervised artificial neural networks and their adaptations
    include single-layer perceptron (SLP) [10, 31], multilayer perceptron (MLP) [42,
    43], and linear classifiers [44, 45]. Also, popular supervised ANNs include support
    vector machines (SVMs) [46, 47], k-nearest neighbours (kNNs) [48]. More also in
    the category of popular supervised ANNs are Bayesian statistics [49], decision
    trees [50] and hidden Markov model (HMM) [51]. Meanwhile, some common unsupervised
    methods include k-means [52], expectation maximization [53], and autoencoders
    [54]. Other unsupervised approaches in literature are density-based [55], self-organizing
    maps [56], clustering [57] and fuzzy [58]. Kernel-based neural networks methods
    are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, like SVM (support vector machine).
    Kernel functions or algorithms used in shallow architectures, for example support
    vector machines (SVMs), or multilayer kernel machines (MKMs). An investigation
    study by Cho and Saul [59], evaluates MKMs and SVMs with kernel functions to demonstrate
    advantages of deep NN architectures. The study highlighted the usefulness of kernel-based
    neural networks in the applications to optical character recognition and DNA analysis.
    The research by Camps-Valls, and Bruzzone [60], proposed kernel-based techniques
    for classification of hyperspectral image, with main characteristics of various
    kernel-based methods. The result demonstrates the successful performance of standard
    support vector machines (SVMs) that regularized radial basis function NNs (Reg-RBFNN),
    AdaBoost (Reg-AB) and kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) analysis. ANNs has significant
    advantages over statistical models when both are relatively compared. In ANN models
    there are no assumptions about data properties or data distribution. Therefore,
    ANNs are more useful in practical application. Also, unlike some statistical models
    that require certain hypothesis for testing, ANN models do not require any hypothesis.
    ANNs are very flexible, data reduction models, encompassing nonlinear regression
    models, and discriminant models. More also, unlike the support vector machine,
    extreme learning machine, and random forest, ANNs are more fault tolerant. That
    is, they can handle incomplete data and noise, they can solve non-linear problems,
    Also, trained ANNs, can generalize at high speed and make predictions. Furthermore,
    ANNs are scalable when relatively compared to the support vector machine, extreme
    learning machine, and random forest. Interestingly, DL techniques attracted more
    research attention since year 2006. DL has the built-in ability to solve the defect
    of traditional paradigms dependent on hand-built materials. Also, DL approaches
    have been useful in big data technique with performance applications to pattern
    recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, speech recognition,
    and computer vision. 2.5. Modeling Generally, modeling is the process of presenting
    a real-world phenomenon or object as a set of mathematical expression. However,
    neural network modeling is a process representing the way the nervous system functions.
    That is, a NN is a simplified representation of how the man brain processes information.
    Its function by simulating many interconnected processing units that resemble
    idea versions of neurons. It is the most common optimization paradigm used in
    optimizing a neural network. Recently gradient descent used in updating weights
    in a NN model, that is updating and changing the model''s parameters in a direction
    to minimize the Loss function. A study by Ludermir, Yamazaki, and Zanchettin [61],
    proposed a new method for NN global optimization. The method combines backpropagation
    algorithm, annealing, and tabu search, to produce an automation for generating
    networks with low complexity and high classification. The results showed that
    the new method is better than the previous studies obtained by the most used optimization
    approaches. Recently, researchers synthesized artificial enzymes that functions
    or operates in the metabolism of living cells. These artificial enzymes used cell''s
    own energy that enable hydrogen gas production from solar energy [62]. ANNs have
    applied in many ways like in system control [63], pattern recognition [64], power
    systems [65], robotics control [66], forecasting [67], manufacturing [68], social
    sciences [69], Art [70], optimization [71], psychological sciences [72], signal
    processing [73] etc. In an optimizer modeling approach to a solution of reusability
    problem. An example of a practical approach to modeling in the optimizer for a
    software architecture. A published work by Delinchant et al. [74] discusses an
    optimization framework in software components paradigm for sizing. Delinchant
    et al. work presents a framework system design based on optimization. It then
    highlights, a generator (analytical expressions of the framework system), an optimization
    service, the component standard and the pattern of using the designed framework.
    The result demonstrates how the framework system for the software components can
    be used in building new generations that optimized environment. That allow capitalization
    and reutilization by the combined software packages and optimization algorithms.
    Thus, the approach showed the possibility of building a global software architecture
    that optimized systems and components. In measuring a good prediction model to
    predict the expected outcome, a loss function required. That is the group or class
    of functions that minimized is called “loss functions”. A most popular used method
    of finding the minimal point of a function referred to as gradient descent. DNNs
    are currently among the most popularly used classifiers. In modeling on loss function,
    a paper by Janocha, and Czarnecki [75], investigated the effect of loss functions
    choices on deep models and its learning dynamics, and the resulting classifiers
    robustness to different effects. Two experiments (L1 and L2) performed on classical
    datasets. The result shows that L1 and L2 losses are, quite interesting, that
    justified classification objectives for deep neural nets because it gives probabilistic
    interpretation regarding expected misclassification. In finding the optimum design
    that provides a lightweight and high quality at the same time, it is significant
    to have effective and efficient prediction methods at the initial design stage.
    In a research work on weight optimization method, the paper by Yu, and Chi [76],
    proposed a weight model optimization in credit evaluation, based on the concept
    that the optimal is the weight. That is, after empowerment the result of credit
    evaluation should has maximum discriminating power to differentiate non-default
    from default customers. The empirical results demonstrate that the discriminating
    power of credit evaluation was the strongest compared with the three types of
    weight models, like t-value, mean square error, and variation coefficient. 2.6.
    ANN emerging successes and applications In the recent times various successful
    used of ANNs emerged in catalysis, meteorology, biology, chemistry, physics, nuclear
    physics, high-energy physics, and other areas of science. Nowadays, ANN has found
    uses in a new area such as in catalyzing especially in the chemical industrial
    sector. Catalysis is term as the significant energy in the modernization process
    of chemical industries. It ensures effective, efficient and successful use of
    finite natural resources, it prevent waste and air pollution, and provides safety
    for the industrial sector. Catalysis become the foundation of large scale operations
    regarding size in chemistry and petrochemistry environment. However, as demand
    changes, new environmental challenges now require new catalytic solutions. For
    example, changed in the energy economy has driven an increasing demand for coal
    and gas, hence given room for new challenges for catalytic technology in the areas
    like liquefaction in material science [77, 78]. Recently, there have been reported
    cases of ANNs applications to catalysis research in the literature. The reviewed
    paper by Li, Zhang, and Liu [79], show how ANNs applied to catalysis helps people
    in addressing the complex problems and then accelerating the progress of the catalysis
    utilization. The reviewed paper further showed how ANNs applied in many ways to
    catalysis prediction, new catalysts design, and understanding of catalytic structures
    which produced effective result. Likewise, research by Corma et al. [80] demonstrates
    how artificial NNs applied to modeling catalytic data in combinatorial catalysis
    and to predicting a new catalyst composition for ODHE (oxidative dehydrogenation
    of ethane). In another development research on an accurate description of chemical
    processes using computational methods like density functional theory (DFT). Behler
    and Parrinello [81], introduces a new breed of NN model of DFT, that gives the
    energy as a function of all atomic positions in systems with arbitrary size and
    in various orders of magnitude that is faster than DFT. The high level of accuracy
    of the NN method is shown for bulk silicon compared with DFT. This NN approach
    is generic which can be apply to all kind of periodic and nonperiodic systems.
    Recently, a generalized ML input representation was applied by quantification
    and concentrations of blended solutions in addressing the problem of determining
    intrinsic trends in CO2 solubility under a specific condition. The research orchestrated
    by Li, and Zhang [82], applied general regression NN (GRNN) algorithm in fitting
    intrinsic trends or movement of CO2 solubility with a minimal amount of experimental
    data. Which resulted in the average RMSE (root mean square error) less than 0.038
    mol CO2/mol of solution. The study has shown that applied generalized input representation,
    could provide a better comprehension of the inherent trends of CO2 solubility
    in a blended amount of solutions. ANNs are useful and applicable in system modeling
    like in implementing system identification and complex mappings. For instance,
    the application of NNs to renewable energy challenges have shown tremendous success.
    In 2001, an investigation by Kalogirou [83], applied ANN to energy like solar
    regarding modeling and design of a solar steam generating plant. The experimental
    result demonstrates prediction for speed, load, and error. Wavelet networks are
    been used extensively and effectively in different engineering fields for classification,
    identification and control problems. Wavelet networks are feed forward networks
    that uses wavelets as activation functions. ANNs application to solar radiation
    data forecasting with adaptive wavelet network has been useful. The most recent
    work by Li, and Liu [84], uses an adaptive wavelet network architecture in discovering
    an appropriate model for forecasting the daily total amount of solar radiation.
    The daily total amount of solar radiation is considered the most significant in
    the prediction of the performance of renewable energy like solar, importantly
    in sizing photovoltaic (PV) phenomenon of power systems. That is in the conversion
    of light into electricity. The experimental results demonstrate that the ANN model
    predicts daily total amount of solar radiation parameters with an accuracy of
    97% with a mean absolute percentage error of 6%. Also, Li, and Liu proposed a
    model on the optimization of the solar water heater and performance prediction
    using a knowledge-based machine learning technique. The result demonstrates that
    the model generalization that can applied in different locations even for weather
    data, like ambient temperature and sunshine period. In recent years ANN application
    to chemistry and physics problems has increasingly popular and successes [85].
    Many applications of approximation techniques and standard approaches to data
    fitting are performing better in NN. NN provide more accuracy with a lower number
    of adjustable parameters than any other methods. Learning in NNs is understood
    when it rebuilds hypersurfaces together with a sample points, generalization,
    and interpolation. NNs apply sigmoidal functions to re-buildings or transformations,
    stated in most physics and chemistry problems. Thus, resolving an arbitrary data
    fitting issue by applying a single layer net architecture if there is no restriction
    in sigmoidal functions applied [85]. Neural networks application in physics has
    witnessed a remarkable success. The research by Lynch et al. [86], describes new
    opportunities for applying NNs to physics and mapping kinds of physics related
    problems, especially in the field of science and engineering problem. ANN has
    been found useful in predicting the concentrations of radioactivity. An understanding
    the levels of radioactivity values with values of other variables in the environment
    can be apply to train a network to estimate the next levels of radioactivity.
    Hence, accuracy of the NN method can be better than other approaches in certain
    monitoring areas. Nuclear theory main goal is to predict nuclear structure and
    nuclear reactions from the fundamental theory of high cohesion interactions, and
    quantum chromodynamics (QCD). With the current superb high-performance computing
    (HPC) systems, many ab initio methods, like the No-Core Shell Model (NCSM), have
    been designed to calculate the chemical properties of atomic nuclei. However,
    to accurately calculate the properties of atomic nuclei, there are a plethora
    of theoretical and computational challenges involves. To overcome this problem,
    a most recent study on atomic nuclei properties prediction by Negoita et al. [87]
    proposes a feed-forward ANN for predicting the properties of atomic nuclei such
    as ground state (gs) energy and ground state (gs) point proton root-mean-square
    (rms) radius. The result demonstrates that FFANN could predict properties of the
    6Li nucleus like the gs energy and the gs point proton rms radius. The result
    satisfied the ideal physics condition. An important advantage of the ANN method
    is that it does not require mathematical relations of the input data and output
    data. Importantly, ANN applications to Physics and Chemistry problems should be
    compared with other methods like statistical techniques and data fittings procedures
    for the performance measure. 2.7. ANN models in different application areas Many
    artificial neural network techniques have been adopted in the academia and industries
    to address the challenges in computer vision, speech and pattern recognitions,
    face alignment, and detection. These include; 2.7.1. Speech recognition The application
    of ANNs has become divergence and understood in the capability of its successes
    in speech or communication recognition. In the past decades, ML algorithms have
    applied widely in areas like acoustic modeling and ASR (automatic speech recognition)
    [88]. 2.7.2. Computer vision Computer vision aims at making computers to accurately
    understand and process visual data efficiently like videos [88] and images [89,
    90, 91]. Main goal of computer vision is to provide computers with the kind of
    ability of man brain functionality. Theoretically, computer vision alludes to
    the logical control which studies how to separate data from images in artificial
    frameworks. Sub domains of computer vision include object detection and object
    recognition, object estimation, object position, event detection, scene reconstruction,
    image restoration, image editing, video enhancement, and statistical learning.
    Hence, in computer vision, ANN models are very useful. 2.7.3. Pattern recognition
    The recent improvement in deep learning models has given novel ways to deal with
    the issue in recognition of a pattern or pattern recognition (PR). PR is a scientific
    area that focus in identification of sequence in each input [92, 93]. PR is a
    general concept that surrounds various subdomains such as speech tagging, regression,
    sequence labeling and classification. There are rapidly increasing needs for information
    processing and output, due to industrial development, that has new trend and challenges
    to PR. 2.7.4. Face alignment Face alignment plays a role that is significant in
    diverse visual applications. In recent times ANNs has claimed successes in face
    alignment [94, 95, 96] and face recognition [97, 98, 99] and other models [100]
    have shown successes. Interestingly DL techniques can be applying to explain genetic
    variants to identify pathogenic variants [101, 102]. Usually, combined annotation
    dependent depletion algorithm is popularly applied to interpret the coding and
    non-coding variants. 2.7.5. Detection Detection in medical diagnosis, security,
    image objects, financial irregularity, a fault in a system, are being enhanced
    through ANNs application. Thus, ANN plays an essential role in the detection,
    particularly when applied to breast cancer [103, 104, 105, 106]. The performance
    of ANN can be relatively compared with other approaches in crime detection such
    as DNA and activity profiling [107] and the use of big data for financial crime
    detection [108]. Despite the many publications in the utilization of NN in different
    medical challenges, but there are few reviews study available that explain the
    architecture in improving the detection methods regarding performance, accuracy,
    sensitivity, and specificity. Thus, detection capability is commonly known subdomain
    or computing in computer vision which seeks to understand, locate, classify or
    differentiate the targeted image objects. An example during detection tasks, an
    image can be scanned to know certain special features or characteristics. For
    instance, using of image detection in medical diagnosis, especially abnormal cells
    or tissues in medical images. Normally, traditional methods are base on hand-designed
    features and contrast inference mechanisms. The DL techniques require raw image
    data only [109, 110, 111, 112]. Also, DL techniques applied to Glaucoma detection
    with promising results [113, 114, 115]. More also, ANN has employed in image change
    and computer vision detection in both civil and military challenges. Recently,
    image detection applying in remote sensing, disaster evaluation, videoing and
    surveillance. Furthermore, ANNs or deep learning techniques has been applying
    to human-robot interaction systems that yielded results [116, 117, 118]. 2.8.
    Comparison of different ANN models This section highlights discusses, compares,
    summarizes and critiques more than eighty research articles on artificial neural
    network model''s application to the diverse area of the economy. The comparison
    was made based on (i) author(s)/year of publication (ii) ANN modeling (iii) ANN
    area of application (iii) studied contribution to human challenges (with references
    to Supplementary Table 2) [11, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128,
    129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144,
    145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160,
    161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176,
    177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192,
    193, 194]. 2.8.1. Summary and critiques The comprehensive review has shown that
    interest in ANN applications exploded over the past two decades. The results indicate
    that the selected research articles are recent because they were majorly published
    between the year 2009–2018 and focuses on developmental and technological issues
    regarding ANN. The survey covers various areas of ANN applications such as computer
    security, network security, science and engineering, medical science, biology,
    ecology, nuclear industry, electricity generation, management, mineral exploration.
    Other areas of application are; crude oil fractions quality prediction, crops,
    water treatment, policy and businesses like banking, insurance, the stock market,
    money laundering and other financial institutions for crime detection. The field
    of application varies from science, engineering, socio science, humanity and to
    art-related fields. From the survey of various articles, it became clear that
    the artificial neural network application has no boundary. ANNs has attracted
    the most attention from researchers in recent time, for instance, the study found
    that forecasting of crops and animals yield are helpful in agricultural development.
    Interestingly, this application of ANN has led to an increase in agricultural
    production which has enhanced food security in many nations. In the past two decades,
    ANNs have applied in different fields of agricultural, particularly to crop area
    estimation and classification. Also, agricultural data can be predicted using
    a neural network. There are diverse approaches proposed for data analysis such
    as neural network models; examples are; feedforward artificial neural network,
    back propagation neural networks, probabilistic neural network. Others include
    supervised associating networks, multi-layer perceptron neural network architectures,
    learning vector quantization, and multi-layer neural network. Although, the study
    by Kitchens, and Harris [195], on ANN application to detection of fraud in insurance
    business and finance, demonstrates fraud detection process efficiently. However,
    the result needs comparison with other approaches like data mining, regression
    model and other statistical models for evidence of successes. Though, the research
    by Fanning and Cogger [149], on the application of ANN for fraud detection in
    management show evidence of success in fraudulent detection using ANN in financial
    statements. Nevertheless, the result needs to be compared with other current techniques
    if it performed better or outperformed state-of-the-art detection techniques.
    More also, even though ANN application is quite novel, one must not ignore that
    nowadays there are other novels criminal detection techniques with graphical and
    programming applications like graph-theoretic anomaly detection and inductive
    logic programming. Although, ANN tools make it simple, easy and faster for data
    analysis to enable not only the discovery of a new method for businesses, industrial,
    and educational topologies but also cross-product, cross-channel and cross-customer
    performance. Nevertheless, ANN is not necessarily a panacea; there has to be information
    and communication technology (ICT) involvement in making the data sources available
    and, of course, ANN tools do not exclude the need for data cleansing. But it gives
    new opportunities to an organization looking to tackle management challenges such
    as improvement of materials, product, services, financial crime, and so on via
    new means. With emerging technologies such as data mining, genetic algorithms,
    hybrid models, mathematical models, big data application especially in crime detection
    and prevention [185, 196]. The evolution of computer and the internet has the
    influence of rapid technology and digital media growth on every aspect of human
    lives [197, 198]. In addition to extensive interactive software application [199].
    Researchers can follow adequate artificial intelligence application mechanisms
    to achieve huge success in the diverse field of endeavours. In nowadays of global
    computing, there are a plethora of benefits in NNs. Since capability to learn
    during and after training makes ANN very powerful and flexible. Also, ANN do not
    require paradigm before performing a specific task, that is, without the need
    in understanding the external or internal mechanisms of the task before implementation
    [200]. 2.8.2. The result of ANN application The result of ANNs application to
    different areas of lives and disciplines as found in the literature is presents
    in Table 1. Table 1. Summarized result on ANNs application regarding prediction,

    Fig. 7. Reviewed ANN applications framework. The correlation among the distinct
    fields further reveals that ANN can apply to any areas of studies, industries,
    and profession. The histogram reveals the areas of application of ANN in security,
    science, engineering, medical science, agriculture, finance, banking, weather
    and climate, education, environmental, energy, mining, insurance, marketing etc.
    Therefore, interested researchers can explore the ANN application in these areas
    or many other emerging areas for future research for better solution to problems
    in their fields. Since there is always an algorithm, model, scheme, and framework
    for any problem. 3. Conclusions The survey was comprehensive with a discussion
    on how NN could applied to address human needs. ANNs has many names as found in
    the literature such as; connectionism/connectivist models, adaptive systems, parallel
    distributed processing models, self-organizing systems, neuromorphic and neurocomputing
    systems [201, 202, 203, 204]. The ANNs application areas considered in the survey
    include; computer security, medical science, business, finance, bank, insurance,
    the stock market, electricity generation, management, nuclear industry, mineral
    exploration, mining, crude oil fractions quality prediction, crops yield prediction,
    water treatment, and policy. It is interesting to know that neural network data
    analysis adds accuracy, processing speed, fault tolerance, latency, performance,
    volume, and scalability. Many new and enhanced data management and data analysis
    approaches help in the management of ANN. Creating analytics from the available
    data that aid in largely prioritizing information and provide its human business
    value. The ANN analytics in turn help in combating challenges and mitigate any
    possible risks. Therefore, based on data analysis factors such as accuracy, processing
    speed, latency, performance, fault tolerance, volume, and scalability, an evaluation
    was made of the ANN techniques. Then, proposes that neural-networks models such
    as FFBP and hybrid model using neural networks are performing better for implementation
    of human problems when compared to other approaches currently in practice. Also,
    the study proposes hybrid neural networks models and genetic algorithms (GA) for
    a better performance regarding effectiveness and efficiency. ANN are new computational
    model with rapid and large uses for handling various complex real world issues.
    ANNs popularity lies in information processing characteristics to learning power,
    high parallelism, fault tolerance, nonlinearity, noise tolerance, and capabilities
    of generalization. 3.1. Suggestions Based on the reviewed literature, some areas
    of improvement can be suggested to professionals, researchers and newcomer researchers
    for further research and future research development. The BPNNs and FFPNNs have
    the potential for modeling variables. In optimizing BPNNs and FFPNNs performance,
    a systematic approach is requiring in the model development process. Therefore,
    the following suggestions are stated. 1. Transformation of data. The past and
    current studies indicate that it is unnecessary to transform or change data not
    normally or usually distributed that reveal non-regular periodic development or
    variant. Meanwhile, the modification of heteroscedasticity and trends in data
    are encourage. Also, data normalization and scale to commensurates with function
    transfer in output layer. 2. Determining of appropriate inputs model. Input variables
    determined with the support of a priori knowledge, using a stepwise model-building
    method or analytical method like cross-correlation technique. 3. Network geometry
    choice. One hidden layer may be enough as adequate in most network practical uses.
    However, mathematical expression could determined the upper bound of hidden layer
    nodes required to approximate continuous function. Except if nonconvergent techniques,
    like cross-validation, the connection between the quantity of training and the
    quantity of hidden layer units likewise should be considered. The relationship
    can be investigated with the guide of the rules given in some literature. 4. Researchers
    can focus on network characteristic at variable specification phase. Also, it
    is useful to conduct trials in determining required local minimum in the error
    surface, and oscillations in the R. 5. Forecasting with continuous training, with
    different step sizes taken in weight space. These steps can be useful when selecting
    appropriate network parameters like (transfer function, momentum, epoch size,
    learning rate, and error) and how many training samples in the network for a case
    study. 6. Validation of model. The validation of model is necessary for standardization
    and practical scenarios of ANNs for optimization of performance. 3.2. Future directions
    This research has many areas in need of further investigation. Further research
    is requiring in the following areas: (i) A greater focus on adaptive dynamic programming
    (ADP) could produce interesting findings that account more for significant contributions
    in the area of brain research and computational intelligence (ii) Emerging topic
    in engineering and computer science include parameter adjustment technique in
    machine learning algorithms. The successful use of algorithms optimization in
    adjusting network variables should be well studied. (iii) Further investigation
    into the applications of reinforcement-learning, unsupervised, semi-supervised
    methods to the deep neural network for complex and multi-complex systems. (iv)
    Future research should concentrate on the use of intelligent analysis such as
    neural network models, backpropagation neural networks, probabilistic neural network,
    supervised associating networks, multi-layer perceptron neural network architectures,
    learning vector quantization, multi-layer neural network, and hybrid neural network
    models. These are because the areas can provide better performance in the application
    of neural network to diverse challenges of life. (v) Since the use of inferential
    statistics and neural networks can be more predictive in data analysis. Hence,
    the predictive approach can also be another focus in the study of the subject.
    (vi) Research is requiring in the execution of DL algorithms for communication
    materials like mobile gadgets. As recently, DL chips idea emerged that is attracting
    research interest. (vii) Public awareness training on artificial network neural
    models should continue regularly, especially on the need for providing useful
    information using empirical analysis and digital data. (viii) More investigation
    is requiring in the stability analysis of deep NN because, in recent times, the
    DNNs stability analysis has become a hot topic for research focus due to its advantages
    in many industrial sectors. (ix) With the new trend in big data technique, DL
    would be useful where large amounts of un-supervised data are applied. It would
    be interesting to construct DL models that can learn from fewer training data,
    particularly for visual and speech recognition systems. (x) Further research should
    be a focus on the use of DNNs to nonlinear networked control systems. More understanding
    of complicated dynamics would help us establish how to obtain better performances
    in control, and filtering capability effectively and efficiently. (xi) The governments
    and institutions need to provide funding into diverse areas of application of
    neural networks for success, especially in this era of modern education, technology
    advancement, industrial growth, economic challenges, artificial intelligence development,
    and information and communication revolution. 3.3. Other areas of further research
    It would be a good idea for further research to be carried out in the following
    areas: (i) Genetic algorithms (GA) for better performance regarding effectiveness
    and efficiency. (ii) Brain research focusing on RL and ADP (adaptive dynamic programming)
    and RL to produce more success in performing intelligent optimization. (iii) Hybrid
    neural networks models for better performance regarding effectiveness and efficiency.
    (iv) Research into possibilities in the integration of neural networks with other
    existing or developing technologies. (vi) There is a need for more future research
    into the application of ANN technology in businesses, industries, energy and agriculture
    for development and wealth creation. (vii) Research focus on determining if the
    more profitable trading system can be implemented using hybrid intelligent systems,
    expert systems, genetic algorithms, combining fuzzy logic and ANNs. (viii) Research
    to explore the possibility of using ANNs to forecast time series, and the integration
    of expert systems and fuzzy logic in determining trading signals. (ix) An exploration
    into the possibility of using genetic algorithms to select input variables and
    optimal parameters for a system. Meanwhile, the research on ANNs applications
    will attain more significant progress in the nearest future. Declarations Author

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) can revolutionize agriculture which impacts a country’s
    economy, employing more than 30% of the world’s population directly or indirectly.
    It can fulfill the needs of an ever-growing world’s population through automation.
    Traditional farmland practices like weeding, pesticide spraying, irrigation, monitoring
    soil nutritional and moisture status, etc. can be performed quicker using robots,
    sensors, drones, and algorithms. It reduces water wastage and pesticide overuse,
    maintains soil fertility, helps in reducing labor and enhances crop yield and
    productivity despite world problems. However, its penetration into agriculture
    is still in its infancy due to its uneconomical nature, lack of expertise and
    big data requirement for accuracy among others. This paper delves deeper into
    the various applications and impacts of AI in agriculture, new tools being used,
    challenges and future scope related to this field. Combined with Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) models and Machine Learning (ML), along with Expert systems (ES)
    and Internet of Things (IoT), AI can do wonders in agriculture in the subsequent
    years to come. References Abeyratne, S.A., & Monfared, R.P. (2016). Blockchain

    \ economy. Pressure on the agricultural system will\nincrease with the continuing\
    \ expansion of the human population. Agri-technology and precision\nfarming, now\
    \ also termed digital agriculture, have arisen as new scientiﬁc ﬁelds that use\
    \ data\nintense approaches to drive agricultural productivity while minimizing\
    \ its environmental impact.\nThe data generated in modern agricultural operations\
    \ is provided by a variety of different sensors that\nenable a better understanding\
    \ of the operational environment (an interaction of dynamic crop, soil,\nand weather\
    \ conditions) and the operation itself (machinery data), leading to more accurate\
    \ and faster\ndecision making.\nMachine learning (ML) has emerged together with\
    \ big data technologies and high-performance\ncomputing to create new opportunities\
    \ to unravel, quantify, and understand data intensive processes\nin agricultural\
    \ operational environments. Among other deﬁnitions, ML is deﬁned as the scientiﬁc\
    \ ﬁeld\nthat gives machines the ability to learn without being strictly programmed\
    \ [1]. Year by year, ML applies\nin more and more scientiﬁc ﬁelds including, for\
    \ example, bioinformatics [2,3], biochemistry [4,5],\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674;\

    In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the application of ML in agriculture.\n\
    A number of relevant papers are presented that emphasise key and unique features\
    \ of popular\nML models. The structure of the present work is as follows: the\
    \ ML terminology, deﬁnition, learning\ntasks, and analysis are initially given\
    \ in Section 2, along with the most popular learning models and\nalgorithms. Section\
    \ 3 presents the implemented methodology for the collection and categorization\

    \ the implementation of ML in\nagri-technology are listed, as well as the future\

    \ Learning\n2.1. Machine Learning Terminology and Deﬁnitions\nTypically, ML methodologies\
    \ involves a learning process with the objective to learn from\n“experience” (training\
    \ data) to perform a task. Data in ML consists of a set of examples. Usually,\n\
    an individual example is described by a set of attributes, also known as features\
    \ or variables. A feature\ncan be nominal (enumeration), binary (i.e., 0 or 1),\
    \ ordinal (e.g., A+ or B−), or numeric (integer, real\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n\
    4 of 29\nnumber, etc.). The performance of the ML model in a speciﬁc task is measured\
    \ by a performance\nmetric that is improved with experience over time. To calculate\
    \ the performance of ML models and\nalgorithms, various statistical and mathematical\
    \ models are used. After the end of the learning process,\nthe trained model can\
    \ be used to classify, predict, or cluster new examples (testing data) using the\n\
    experience obtained during the training process. Figure 1 shows a typical ML approach.\n\

    algorithms,  various  statistical  and  mathematical  models  are  used.  After \

    \ \nFigure 1. A typical machine learning approach. \nML tasks are typically classified into different broad categories depending on the learning type \n\
    (supervised/unsupervised), \nlearning \nmodels \n(classification, \nregression, \n\
    clustering, \nand \ndimensionality reduction), or the learning models employed to implement the selected task. \n\
    2.2. Tasks of Learning \nML tasks are classified into two main categories, that is, supervised and unsupervised learning, \n\
    depending on the learning signal of the learning system. In supervised learning, data are presented \n\
    with example inputs and the corresponding outputs, and the objective is to construct a general rule \n\
    that maps inputs to outputs. In some cases, inputs can be only partially available with some of the \n\
    target  outputs  missing  or  given  only  as  feedback  to  the  actions  in \
    \ a  dynamic  environment \n(reinforcement learning). In the supervised setting, the acquired expertise (trained model) is used to \n\
    predict the missing outputs (labels) for the test data. In unsupervised learning, however, there is no \n\
    distinction between training and test sets with data being unlabeled. The learner processes input data \n\
    with the goal of discovering hidden patterns. \n2.3. Analysis of Learning \nDimensionality reduction (DR) is an analysis that is executed in both families of supervised and \n\
    unsupervised  learning  types,  with  the  aim  of  providing  a  more  compact, \
    \ lower‐dimensional \nrepresentation of a dataset to preserve as much information as possible from the original data. It is \n\
    usually performed prior to applying a classification or regression model in order to avoid the effects \n\
    of dimensionality. Some of the most common DR algorithms are the following: (i) principal component \n\
    analysis [22], (ii) partial least squares regression [23], and (iii) linear discriminant analysis [24]. \n\
    2.4. Learning Models \nThe presentation of the learning models in ML is limited to the ones that have been implemented \n\
    in works presented in this review. \n2.4.1. Regression \nRegression constitutes a supervised learning model, which aims to provide the prediction of an \n\
    output variable according to the input variables, which are known. Most known algorithms include \n\
    linear regression and logistic regression [25], as well as stepwise regression [26]. Also, more complex \n\
    regression  algorithms  have  been  developed,  such  as  ordinary  least  squares \
    \ regression  [27], \nmultivariate  adaptive  regression  splines  [28],  multiple \

    Figure 1. A typical machine learning approach.\nML tasks are typically classiﬁed\
    \ into different broad categories depending on the learning type\n(supervised/unsupervised),\
    \ learning models (classiﬁcation, regression, clustering, and dimensionality\n\
    reduction), or the learning models employed to implement the selected task.\n\
    2.2. Tasks of Learning\nML tasks are classiﬁed into two main categories, that\
    \ is, supervised and unsupervised learning,\ndepending on the learning signal\
    \ of the learning system. In supervised learning, data are presented\nwith example\
    \ inputs and the corresponding outputs, and the objective is to construct a general\
    \ rule that\nmaps inputs to outputs. In some cases, inputs can be only partially\
    \ available with some of the target\noutputs missing or given only as feedback\
    \ to the actions in a dynamic environment (reinforcement\nlearning). In the supervised\
    \ setting, the acquired expertise (trained model) is used to predict the\nmissing\
    \ outputs (labels) for the test data. In unsupervised learning, however, there\
    \ is no distinction\nbetween training and test sets with data being unlabeled.\
    \ The learner processes input data with the\ngoal of discovering hidden patterns.\n\
    2.3. Analysis of Learning\nDimensionality reduction (DR) is an analysis that is\
    \ executed in both families of supervised\nand unsupervised learning types, with\
    \ the aim of providing a more compact, lower-dimensional\nrepresentation of a\
    \ dataset to preserve as much information as possible from the original data.\
    \ It is\nusually performed prior to applying a classiﬁcation or regression model\
    \ in order to avoid the effects of\ndimensionality. Some of the most common DR\
    \ algorithms are the following: (i) principal component\nanalysis [22], (ii) partial\
    \ least squares regression [23], and (iii) linear discriminant analysis [24].\n\
    2.4. Learning Models\nThe presentation of the learning models in ML is limited\
    \ to the ones that have been implemented\nin works presented in this review.\n\
    2.4.1. Regression\nRegression constitutes a supervised learning model, which aims\
    \ to provide the prediction of an\noutput variable according to the input variables,\
    \ which are known. Most known algorithms include\nlinear regression and logistic\
    \ regression [25], as well as stepwise regression [26]. Also, more complex\nregression\
    \ algorithms have been developed, such as ordinary least squares regression [27],\
    \ multivariate\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n5 of 29\nadaptive regression splines [28],\
    \ multiple linear regression, cubist [29], and locally estimated scatterplot\n\
    smoothing [30].\n2.4.2. Clustering\nClustering [31] is a typical application of\
    \ unsupervised learning model, typically used to\nﬁnd natural groupings of data\
    \ (clusters). Well established clustering techniques are the k-means\ntechnique\
    \ [32], the hierarchical technique [33], and the expectation maximisation technique\
    \ [34].\n2.4.3. Bayesian Models\nBayesian models (BM) are a family of probabilistic\
    \ graphical models in which the analysis is\nundertaken within the context of\
    \ Bayesian inference. This type of model belongs to the supervised\nlearning category\
    \ and can be employed for solving either classiﬁcation or regression problems.\n\
    Naive bayes [35], gaussian naive bayes, multinomial naive bayes, bayesian network\
    \ [36], mixture\nof gaussians [37], and bayesian belief network [38] are some\
    \ of the most prominent algorithms in\nthe literature.\n2.4.4. Instance Based\
    \ Models\nInstance based models (IBM) are memory-based models that learn by comparing\
    \ new examples\nwith instances in the training database. They construct hypotheses\
    \ directly from the data available,\nwhile they do not maintain a set of abstractions,\
    \ and generate classiﬁcation or regression predictions\nusing only speciﬁc instances.\
    \ The disadvantage of these models is that their complexity grows with\ndata.\
    \ The most common learning algorithms in this category are the k-nearest neighbor\
    \ [39], locally\nweighted learning [40], and learning vector quantization [41].\n\
    2.4.5. Decision Trees\nDecision trees (DT) are classiﬁcation or regression models\
    \ formulated in a tree-like\narchitecture [42]. With DT, the dataset is progressively\
    \ organized in smaller homogeneous subsets\n(sub-populations), while at the same\
    \ time, an associated tree graph is generated. Each internal node\nof the tree\
    \ structure represents a different pairwise comparison on a selected feature,\
    \ whereas each\nbranch represents the outcome of this comparison. Leaf nodes represent\
    \ the ﬁnal decision or prediction\ntaken after following the path from root to\
    \ leaf (expressed as a classiﬁcation rule). The most common\nlearning algorithms\
    \ in this category are the classiﬁcation and regression trees [43], the chi-square\n\
    automatic interaction detector [44], and the iterative dichotomiser [45].\n2.4.6.\
    \ Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are divided into\
    \ two categories; “Traditional ANNs” and\n“Deep ANNs”.\nANNs are inspired by the\
    \ human brain functionality, emulating complex functions such as\npattern generation,\
    \ cognition, learning, and decision making [46]. The human brain consists of billions\n\
    of neurons that inter-communicate and process any information provided. Similarly,\
    \ an ANN as a\nsimpliﬁed model of the structure of the biological neural network,\
    \ consists of interconnected processing\nunits organized in a speciﬁc topology.\
    \ A number of nodes are arranged in multiple layers including\nthe following:\n\
    1.\nAn input layer where the data is fed into the system,\n2.\nOne or more hidden\
    \ layers where the learning takes place, and\n3.\nAn output layer where the decision/prediction\
    \ is given.\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n6 of 29\nANNs are supervised models that\
    \ are typically used for regression and classiﬁcation problems.\nThe learning\
    \ algorithms commonly used in ANNs include the radial basis function networks\
    \ [47],\nperceptron algorithms [48], back-propagation [49], and resilient back-propagation\
    \ [50]. Also, a large\nnumber of ANN-based learning algorithms have been reported,\
    \ such as counter propagation\nalgorithms [51], adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference\
    \ systems [52], autoencoder, XY-Fusion, and supervised\nKohonen networks [53],\
    \ as well as Hopﬁeld networks [54], multilayer perceptron [55], self-organising\n\
    maps [56], extreme learning machines [57], generalized regression neural network\
    \ [58], ensemble neural\nnetworks or ensemble averaging, and self-adaptive evolutionary\
    \ extreme learning machines [59].\nDeep ANNs are most widely referred to as deep\
    \ learning (DL) or deep neural networks\n(DNNs) [60]. They are a relatively new\
    \ area of ML research allowing computational models that\nare composed of multiple\
    \ processing layers to learn complex data representations using multiple\nlevels\
    \ of abstraction. One of the main advantages of DL is that in some cases, the\
    \ step of feature\nextraction is performed by the model itself. DL models have\
    \ dramatically improved the state-of-the-art\nin many different sectors and industries,\
    \ including agriculture. DNN’s are simply an ANN with\nmultiple hidden layers\
    \ between the input and output layers and can be either supervised, partially\n\
    supervised, or even unsupervised. A common DL model is the convolutional neural\
    \ network (CNN),\nwhere feature maps are extracted by performing convolutions\
    \ in the image domain. A comprehensive\nintroduction on CNNs is given in the literature\
    \ [61]. Other typical DL architectures include deep\nBoltzmann machine, deep belief\
    \ network [62], and auto-encoders [63].\n2.4.7. Support Vector Machines\nSupport\
    \ vector machines (SVMs) were ﬁrst introduced in the work of [64] on the foundation\
    \ of\nstatistical learning theory. SVM is intrinsically a binary classiﬁer that\
    \ constructs a linear separating\nhyperplane to classify data instances. The classiﬁcation\
    \ capabilities of traditional SVMs can be\nsubstantially enhanced through transformation\
    \ of the original feature space into a feature space of\na higher dimension by\
    \ using the “kernel trick”. SVMs have been used for classiﬁcation, regression,\n\
    and clustering. Based on global optimization, SVMs deal with overﬁtting problems,\
    \ which appear\nin high-dimensional spaces, making them appealing in various applications\
    \ [65,66]. Most used SVM\nalgorithms include the support vector regression [67],\
    \ least squares support vector machine [68],\nand successive projection algorithm-support\
    \ vector machine [69].\n2.4.8. Ensemble Learning\nEnsemble learning (EL) models\
    \ aim at improving the predictive performance of a given statistical\nlearning\
    \ or model ﬁtting technique by constructing a linear combination of simpler base\
    \ learner.\nConsidering that each trained ensemble represents a single hypothesis,\
    \ these multiple-classiﬁer systems\nenable hybridization of hypotheses not induced\
    \ by the same base learner, thus yielding better results in\nthe case of signiﬁcant\
    \ diversity among the single models. Decision trees have been typically used as\
    \ the\nbase learner in EL models, for example, random forest [70], whereas a large\
    \ number of boosting and\nbagging implementations have been also proposed, for\
    \ example, boosting technique [71], adaboost [72],\nand bootstrap aggregating\
    \ or bagging algorithm [73].\n3. Review\nThe reviewed articles have been, on a\
    \ ﬁrst level, classiﬁed in four generic categories; namely, crop\nmanagement,\
    \ livestock management, water management, and soil management. The applications\
    \ of\nML in the crop section were divided into sub-categories including yield\
    \ prediction, disease detection,\nweed detection crop quality, and species recognition.\
    \ The applications of ML in the livestock section\nwere divided into two sub-categories;\
    \ animal welfare and livestock production.\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n7 of 29\n\
    The search engines implemented were Scopus, ScienceDirect and PubMed. The selected\
    \ articles\nregard works presented solely in journal papers. Climate prediction,\
    \ although very important for\nagricultural production, has not been included\
    \ in the presented review, considering the fact that ML\napplications for climate\
    \ prediction is a complete area by itself. Finally, all articles presented here\
    \ regard\nthe period from 2004 up to the present.\n3.1. Crop Management\n3.1.1.\
    \ Yield Prediction\nYield prediction, one of the most signiﬁcant topics in precision\
    \ agriculture, is of high importance\nfor yield mapping, yield estimation, matching\
    \ of crop supply with demand, and crop management to\nincrease productivity. Examples\
    \ of ML applications include in those in the works of [74]; an efﬁcient,\nlow-cost,\
    \ and non-destructive method that automatically counted coffee fruits on a branch.\
    \ The method\ncalculates the coffee fruits in three categories: harvestable, not\
    \ harvestable, and fruits with disregarded\nmaturation stage. In addition, the\
    \ method estimated the weight and the maturation percentage of the\ncoffee fruits.\
    \ The aim of this work was to provide information to coffee growers to optimise\
    \ economic\nbeneﬁts and plan their agricultural work. Another study that used\
    \ for yield prediction is that by\nthe authors of [75], in which they developed\
    \ a machine vision system for automating shaking and\ncatching cherries during\
    \ harvest. The system segments and detects occluded cherry branches with\nfull\
    \ foliage even when these are inconspicuous. The main aim of the system was to\
    \ reduce labor\nrequirements in manual harvesting and handling operations. In\
    \ another study [76], authors developed\nan early yield mapping system for the\
    \ identiﬁcation of immature green citrus in a citrus grove under\noutdoor conditions.\
    \ As all other relative studies, the aim of the study was to provide growers with\n\
    yield-speciﬁc information to assist them to optimise their grove in terms of proﬁt\
    \ and increased yield.\nIn another study [77], the authors developed a model for\
    \ the estimation of grassland biomass (kg dry\nmatter/ha/day) based on ANNs and\
    \ multitemporal remote sensing data. Another study dedicated\nto yield prediction,\
    \ and speciﬁcally to wheat yield prediction, was presented in another study [78].\n\
    The developed method used satellite imagery and received crop growth characteristics\
    \ fused with\nsoil data for a more accurate prediction. The authors of [79] presented\
    \ a method for the detection of\ntomatoes based on EM and remotely sensed red\
    \ green blue (RGB) images, which were captured by an\nunmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ (UAV). Also, in the work of [80], authors developed a method for the rice\n\
    development stage prediction based on SVM and basic geographic information obtained\
    \ from weather\nstations in China. Finally, a generalized method for agricultural\
    \ yield predictions, was presented in\nanother study [81]. The method is based\
    \ on an ENN application on long-period generated agronomical\ndata (1997–2014).\
    \ The study regards regional predictions (speciﬁcally in in Taiwan) focused on\

    \ Detection\nDisease detection and yield prediction are the sub-categories with\
    \ the higher number of articles\npresented in this review. One of the most signiﬁcant\
    \ concerns in agriculture is pest and disease\ncontrol in open-air (arable farming)\
    \ and greenhouse conditions. The most widely used practice\nin pest and disease\
    \ control is to uniformly spray pesticides over the cropping area. This practice,\n\
    although effective, has a high ﬁnancial and signiﬁcant environmental cost. Environmental\
    \ impacts\ncan be residues in crop products, side effects on ground water contamination,\
    \ impacts on local\nwildlife and eco-systems, and so on. ML is an integrated part\
    \ of precision agriculture management,\nwhere agro-chemicals input is targeted\
    \ in terms of time and place. In the literature [82], a tool\nis presented for\
    \ the detection and discrimination of healthy Silybum marianum plants and those\n\
    infected by smut fungus Microbotyum silybum during vegetative growth. In the work\
    \ of [83], authors\ndeveloped a new method based on image processing procedure\
    \ for the classiﬁcation of parasites\nand the automatic detection of thrips in\
    \ strawberry greenhouse environment, for real-time control.\nThe authos of [84]\
    \ presented a method for detection and screening of Bakanae disease in rice seedlings.\n\
    More speciﬁcally, the aim of the study was the accurate detection of pathogen\
    \ Fusarium fujikuroi for\ntwo rice cultivars. The automated detection of infected\
    \ plants increased grain yield and was less\ntime-consuming compared with naked\
    \ eye examination.\nWheat is one of the most economically signiﬁcant crops worldwide.\
    \ The last ﬁve studies presented\nin this sub-category are dedicated to the detection\
    \ and discrimination between diseased and healthy\nwheat crops. The authors of\
    \ [85] developed a new system for the detection of nitrogen stressed,\nand yellow\
    \ rust infected and healthy winter wheat canopies based on hierarchical self-organizing\n\
    classiﬁer and hyperspectral reﬂectance imaging data. The study aimed at the accurate\
    \ detection of these\ncategories for a more effective usage of fungicides and\
    \ fertilizers according to the plant’s needs. In the\nnext case study [86], the\
    \ development of a system was presented that automatically discriminated\nbetween\
    \ water stressed Septoria tritici infected and healthy winter wheat canopies.\
    \ The approach used\nan least squares (LS)-SVM classiﬁer with optical multisensor\
    \ fusion. The authors of [87] presented a\nmethod to detect either yellow rust\
    \ infected or healthy wheat, based on ANN models and spectral\nreﬂectance features.\
    \ The accurate detection of either infected or healthy plants enables the precise\n\
    targeting of pesticides in the ﬁeld. In the work of [88], a real time remote sensing\
    \ system is presented\nfor the detection of yellow rust infected and healthy wheat.\
    \ The system is based on a self-organising\nmap (SOM) neural network and data\
    \ fusion of hyper-spectral reﬂection and multi-spectral ﬂuorescence\nimaging.\
    \ The goal of the study was the accurate detection, before it can visibly detected,\
    \ of yellow\nrust infected winter wheat cultivar “Madrigal”. Finally, the authors\
    \ of [89] presented a method for\nthe simultaneous identiﬁcation and discrimination\
    \ of yellow rust infected, and nitrogen stressed and\nhealthy wheat plants of\
    \ cultivar “Madrigal”. The approach is based on an SOM neural network and\nhyperspectral\
    \ reﬂectance imaging. The aim of the study was the accurate discrimination between\n\
    the plant stress, which is caused by disease and nutrient deﬁciency stress under\
    \ ﬁeld conditions.\nFinally, the author of [90] presented a CNN-based method for\
    \ the disease detection diagnosis based\non simple leaves images with sufﬁcient\
    \ accuracy to classify between healthy and diseased leaves in\nvarious plants.\n\

    Weed detection and management is another signiﬁcant problem in agriculture. Many\
    \ producers\nindicate weeds as the most important threat to crop production. The\
    \ accurate detection of weeds is\nof high importance to sustainable agriculture,\
    \ because weeds are difﬁcult to detect and discriminate\nfrom crops. Again, ML\
    \ algorithms in conjunction with sensors can lead to accurate detection and\n\
    discrimination of weeds with low cost and with no environmental issues and side\
    \ effects. ML for\nweed detection can enable the development of tools and robots\
    \ to destroy weeds, which minimise\nthe need for herbicides. Two studies on ML\
    \ applications for weed detection issues in agriculture\nhave been presented.\
    \ In the ﬁrst study [91], authors presented a new method based on counter\npropagation\
    \ (CP)-ANN and multispectral images captured by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)\
    \ for\nthe identiﬁcation of Silybum marianum, a weed that is hard to eradicate\
    \ and causes major loss on\ncrop yield. In the second study [92], the authors\
    \ developed a new method based on ML techniques\nand hyperspectral imaging, for\
    \ crop and weed species recognition. More speciﬁcally, the authors\ncreated an\
    \ active learning system for the recognition of Maize (Zea mayas), as crop plant\
    \ species\nand Ranunculus repens, Cirsium arvense, Sinapis arvensis, Stellaria\
    \ media, Tarraxacum ofﬁcinale,\nPoa annua, Polygonum persicaria, Urtica dioica,\
    \ Oxalis europaea, and Medicago lupulina as weed\nspecies. The main goal was the\
    \ accurate recognition and discrimination of these species for economic\nand environmental\
    \ purposes. In another study [93], the authors developed a weed detection method\n\
    based on SVN in grassland cropping.\nTable 7 summarizes the above papers for the\

    \ crop category is studies developed for the identiﬁcation\nof features connected\
    \ with the crop quality. The accurate detection and classiﬁcation of crop quality\n\
    characteristics can increase product price and reduce waste. In the ﬁrst study\
    \ [94], the authors presented\nand developed a new method for the detection and\
    \ classiﬁcation of botanical and non-botanical\nforeign matter embedded inside\
    \ cotton lint during harvesting. The aim of the study was quality\nimprovement\
    \ while the minimising ﬁber damage. Another study [95] regards pears production\
    \ and,\nmore speciﬁcally, a method was presented for the identiﬁcation and differentiation\
    \ of Korla fragrant\npears into deciduous-calyx or persistent-calyx categories.\
    \ The approach applied ML methods with\nhyperspectral reﬂectance imaging. The\
    \ ﬁnal study for this sub-category was by the authors of [96],\nin which a method\
    \ was presented for the prediction and classiﬁcation of the geographical origin\
    \ for\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n14 of 29\nrice samples. The method was based on\
    \ ML techniques applied on chemical components of samples.\nMore speciﬁcally,\
    \ the main goal was the classiﬁcation of the geographical origin of rice, for\
    \ two\ndifferent climate regions in Brazil; Goias and Rio Grande do Sul. The results\
    \ showed that Cd, Rb, Mg,\nand K are the four most relevant chemical components\
    \ for the classiﬁcation of samples.\nTable 8 summarizes the above presented articles.\n\

    \ The main goal is the automatic\nidentiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of plant species\
    \ in order to avoid the use of human experts, as well as\nto reduce the classiﬁcation\
    \ time. A method for the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of three legume\nspecies,\
    \ namely, white beans, red beans, and soybean, via leaf vein patterns has been\
    \ presented in [97].\nVein morphology carries accurate information about the properties\
    \ of the leaf. It is an ideal tool for\nplant identiﬁcation in comparison with\
    \ color and shape.\nTable 9 summarizes the above study for the case of species\

    \ consists of two sub-categories, namely, animal welfare and livestock\nproduction.\
    \ Animal welfare deals with the health and wellbeing of animals, with the main\
    \ application\nof ML in monitoring animal behaviour for the early detection of\
    \ diseases. On the other hand, livestock\nproduction deals with issues in the\
    \ production system, where the main scope of ML applications is the\naccurate\
    \ estimation of economic balances for the producers based on production line monitoring.\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 2674\n15 of 29\n3.2.1. Animal Welfare\nSeveral articles are\
    \ reported to belong to the animal welfare sub-category. In the ﬁrst article [98],\n\
    a method is presented for the classiﬁcation of cattle behaviour based on ML models\
    \ using data collected\nby collar sensors with magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers.\
    \ The aim of the study was the\nprediction of events such as the oestrus and the\
    \ recognition of dietary changes on cattle. In the second\narticle [99], a system\
    \ was presented for the automatic identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of chewing\n\
    patterns in calves. The authors created a system based on ML applying data from\
    \ chewing signals of\ndietary supplements, such as hay and ryegrass, combined\
    \ with behaviour data, such as rumination\nand idleness. Data was collected by\
    \ optical FBG sensors. In another study [100], an automated\nmonitoring system\
    \ based on ML was presented for animal behavior tracking, including tracking of\n\
    animal movements by depth video cameras, for monitoring various activities of\
    \ the animal (standing,\nmoving, feeding, and drinking).\nTable 10 summarizes\
    \ the features of the above presented articles.\n3.2.2. Livestock Production\n\
    The sub-category of livestock production regards studies developed for the accurate\
    \ prediction\nand estimation of farming parameters to optimize the economic efﬁciency\
    \ of the production system.\nThis sub-category consists of the presentation of\
    \ four articles, three with cattle production and one for\nhens’ eggs production.\
    \ In the work of [101], a method for the prediction of the rumen fermentation\n\
    pattern from milk fatty acids was presented. The main aim of the study was to\
    \ achieve the most\naccurate prediction of rumen fermentations, which play a signiﬁcant\
    \ role for the evaluation of diets for\nmilk production. In addition, this work\
    \ showed that milk fatty acids have ideal features to predict\nthe molar proportions\
    \ of volatile fatty acids in the rumen. The next study [102] was related to hen\n\
    production. Speciﬁcally, a method based on SVM model was presented for the early\
    \ detection and\nwarning of problems in the commercial production of eggs. Based\
    \ on SVM methods [103], a method for\nthe accurate estimation of bovine weight\
    \ trajectories over time was presented. The accurate estimation\nof cattle weights\
    \ is very important for breeders. The last article of the section [104] deals\
    \ with the\ndevelopment of a function for the prediction of carcass weight for\
    \ beef cattle of the Asturiana de los\nValles breed based on SVR models and zoometric\
    \ measurements features. The results show that the\npresented method can predict\
    \ carcass weights 150 days prior to the slaughter day. The authors of [105]\n\
    presented a method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied in digital\
    \ images for\npig face recognition. The main aim of the research was the identiﬁcation\
    \ of animals without the need\nfor radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags,\
    \ which involve a distressing activity for the animal, are\nlimited in their range,\
    \ and are a time-consuming method.\nTable 11 summarizes the features of the above\
    \ presented works.\n3.3. Water Management\nWater management in agricultural production\

    18 of 29\nThis section consists of four studies that were mostly developed for\
    \ the estimation of daily, weekly,\nor monthly evapotranspiration. The accurate\
    \ estimation of evapotranspiration is a complex process\nand is of a high importance\
    \ for resource management in crop production, as well as for the design\nand the\
    \ operation management of irrigation systems. In another study [106], the authors\
    \ developed a\ncomputational method for the estimation of monthly mean evapotranspiration\
    \ for arid and semi-arid\nregions. It used monthly mean climatic data of 44 meteorological\
    \ stations for the period 1951–2010.\nIn another study dedicated to ML applications\
    \ on agricultural water management [107], two scenarios\nwere presented for the\
    \ estimation of the daily evapotranspiration from temperature data collected\n\
    from six meteorological stations of a region during the long period (i.e., 1961–2014).\
    \ Finally, in another\nstudy [108], authors developed a method based on ELM model\
    \ fed with temperature data for the\nweekly estimation of evapotranspiration for\
    \ two meteorological weather stations. The purpose was\nthe accurate estimation\
    \ of weekly evapotranspiration in arid regions of India based on limited data\n\
    scenario for crop water management.\nDaily dew point temperature, on the other\
    \ hand, is a signiﬁcant element for the identiﬁcation of\nexpected weather phenomena,\
    \ as well as for the estimation of evapotranspiration and evaporation.\nIn another\
    \ article [109], a model is presented for the prediction of daily dew point temperature,\
    \ based\non ML. The weather data were collected from two different weather stations.\n\
    Table 12 summarizes the above papers for the case of the water management sub-category.\n\
    3.4. Soil Management\nThe ﬁnal category of this review concerns ML application\
    \ on prediction-identiﬁcation of\nagricultural soil properties, such as the estimation\
    \ of soil drying, condition, temperature, and moisture\ncontent. Soil is a heterogeneous\
    \ natural resource, with complex processes and mechanisms that are\ndifﬁcult to\
    \ understand. Soil properties allow researchers to understand the dynamics of\
    \ ecosystems\nand the impingement in agriculture. The accurate estimation of soil\
    \ conditions can lead to improved\nsoil management. Soil temperature alone plays\
    \ a signiﬁcant role for the accurate analysis of the\nclimate change effects of\
    \ a region and eco-environmental conditions. It is a signiﬁcant meteorological\n\
    parameter controlling the interactive processes between ground and atmosphere.\
    \ In addition, soil\nmoisture has an important role for crop yield variability.\
    \ However, soil measurements are generally\ntime-consuming and expensive, so a\
    \ low cost and reliable solution for the accurate estimation of soil\ncan be achieved\
    \ with the usage of computational analysis based on ML techniques. The ﬁrst study\
    \ for\nthis last sub-category is the work of [110]. More speciﬁcally, this study\
    \ presented a method for the\nevaluation of soil drying for agricultural planning.\
    \ The method accurately evaluates the soil drying,\nwith evapotranspiration and\
    \ precipitation data, in a region located in Urbana, IL of the United States.\n\
    The goal of this method was the provision of remote agricultural management decisions.\
    \ The second\nstudy [111] was developed for the prediction of soil condition.\
    \ In particular, the study presented the\ncomparison of four regression models\
    \ for the prediction of soil organic carbon (OC), moisture content\n(MC), and\
    \ total nitrogen (TN). More speciﬁcally, the authors used a visible-near infrared\
    \ (VIS-NIR)\nspectrophotometer to collect soil spectra from 140 unprocessed and\
    \ wet samples of the top layer of\nLuvisol soil types. The samples were collected\
    \ from an arable ﬁeld in Premslin, Germany in August\n2013, after the harvest\
    \ of wheat crops. They concluded that the accurate prediction of soil properties\n\
    can optimize soil management. In a third study [112], the authors developed a\
    \ new method based on a\nself adaptive evolutionary-extreme learning machine (SaE-ELM)\
    \ model and daily weather data for\nthe estimation of daily soil temperature at\
    \ six different depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 cm in two\ndifferent in climate\
    \ conditions regions of Iran; Bandar Abbas and Kerman. The aim was the accurate\n\
    estimation of soil temperature for agricultural management. The last study [113]\
    \ presented a novel\nmethod for the estimation of soil moisture, based on ANN\
    \ models using data from force sensors on a\nno-till chisel opener.\nTable 13\
    \ summarizes the above papers for the case of soil management sub-category.\n\

    \ that ML models have been applied in multiple\napplications for crop management\
    \ (61%); mostly yield prediction (20%) and disease detection (22%).\nThis trend\
    \ in the applications distribution reﬂects the data intense applications within\
    \ crop and\nhigh use of images (spectral, hyperspectral, NIR, etc.). Data analysis,\
    \ as a mature scientiﬁc ﬁeld,\nprovides the ground for the development of numerous\
    \ applications related to crop management\nbecause, in most cases, ML-based predictions\
    \ can be extracted without the need for fusion of data from\nother resources.\
    \ In contrast, when data recordings are involved, occasionally at the level of\
    \ big data,\nthe implementations of ML are less in number, mainly because of the\
    \ increased efforts required for\nthe data analysis task and not for the ML models\
    \ per se. This fact partially explains the almost equal\ndistribution of ML applications\
    \ in livestock management (19%), water management (10%), and soil\nmanagement\
    \ (10%). It is also evident from the analysis that most of the studies used ANN\
    \ and SVM\nML models. More speciﬁcally, ANNs were used mostly for implementations\
    \ in crop, water, and soil\nmanagement, while SVMs were used mostly for livestock\
    \ management.\nBy applying machine learning to sensor data, farm management systems\
    \ are evolving into real\nartiﬁcial intelligence systems, providing richer recommendations\
    \ and insights for the subsequent\ndecisions and actions with the ultimate scope\
    \ of production improvement. For this scope, in the future,\nit is expected that\
    \ the usage of ML models will be even more widespread, allowing for the possibility\n\
    of integrated and applicable tools. At the moment, all of the approaches regard\
    \ individual approaches\nand solutions and are not adequately connected with the\
    \ decision-making process, as seen in other\napplication domains. This integration\
    \ of automated data recording, data analysis, ML implementation,\nand decision-making\

    \ a transformation driven by new technologies, which seems\nvery promising as\
    \ it will enable this primary sector to move to the next level of farm productivity\n\
    and proﬁtability [1]. Precision Agriculture, which consist of applying inputs\
    \ (what is needed) when\nand where is needed, has become the third wave of the\
    \ modern agriculture revolution (the ﬁrst was\nmechanization and the second the\
    \ green revolution with its genetic modiﬁcation [2]), and nowadays,\nit is being\
    \ enhanced with an increase of farm knowledge systems due to the availability\
    \ of larger\namounts of data. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ already reported in October\n2016 that Precision Agriculture technologies increased\
    \ net returns and operating proﬁts [3]. Also,\nwhen considering the environment,\
    \ new technologies are increasingly being applied in the farms\nto maintain the\
    \ sustainability of farm production. However, the adoption of these technologies\n\
    involves uncertainty and trade-oﬀs. According to a market analysis, the factors\
    \ that would facilitate\nthe adoption of sustainable farming technologies include\
    \ better education and training of farmers,\nsharing of information, easy availability\
    \ of ﬁnancial resources, and increasing consumer demand\nfor organic food [4].\
    \ When applying these new technologies, the challenge for retrieving data from\n\
    crops is to come out with something coherent and valuable, because data themselves\
    \ are not useful,\njust numbers or images. Farms that decide to be technology-driven\
    \ in some way, show valuable\nadvantages, such us saving money and work, having\
    \ an increased production or a reduction of costs\nwith minimal eﬀort, and producing\
    \ quality food with more environmentally friendly practices [5].\nHowever, taking\
    \ these advantages to the farm will depend, not only on the willingness of producers\n\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n2 of 21\nfor adopting new technologies in their ﬁelds,\
    \ but also on each speciﬁc farm potential in terms of scale\neconomies, as proﬁt\
    \ margin increases with farm size. The USDA reported that, on average, corn\n\
    farm operating proﬁt of Precision Agriculture adopters was 163 dollars per hectare\
    \ higher than for\nnon-adopters, taking into account that the highest adoption\
    \ rates for three technologies (computer\nmapping, guidance, and variable-rate\
    \ equipment) were on farms over 1500 hectares [3]. Such margins\ncan even go up\
    \ to 272 dollars depending on the crop. A greater use of Smart Farming services\
    \ is vital\nto not only improving a farm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet\
    \ the food needs of an expanding\npopulation [6].\nThe ﬁnal purpose of this paper\
    \ is to demonstrate how making decisions with the modern\ndata-based agriculture\
    \ available today can lead to sustainable and proﬁtable actuation to nourish\n\
    people while reducing harm to the environment. In order to evaluate how modern\
    \ agriculture can help\nin a sustainable decision-making process, this article\
    \ revisits the main steps of an information-based\nagriculture and focuses on\
    \ data management systems by reviewing recent applications related to each\ncrucial\
    \ step, from data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to the execution of tasks with variable\
    \ rate equipment.\n2. Data-Driven Agriculture: Agriculture 4.0\nThis new philosophy\
    \ centered on agricultural data has been expressed with several names:\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0, Digital Farming, or Smart Farming, and was born when telematics and data\
    \ management\nwere combined to the already known concept of Precision Agriculture,\
    \ improving the accuracy of\noperations [7]. As a result, Agriculture 4.0 is based\
    \ on Precision Agriculture principles with producers\nusing systems that generate\
    \ data in their farms, which will be processed in such a way to make proper\n\
    strategical and operational decisions. Traditionally, farmers have gone to the\
    \ ﬁelds to check the status\nof their crops and make decisions based on their\
    \ accumulated experience. This approach is no longer\nsustainable as, among other\
    \ reasons, some ﬁelds are too large to be eﬃciently managed according to\nthe\
    \ threefold criteria that will lead the coming years: Eﬃciency, sustainability\
    \ and availability (for\npeople). Advanced management systems within the context\
    \ of Smart Farming are providing practical\nsolutions. Also, despite some farmers\
    \ have a long-time experience gathered after many years of work\nin the ﬁeld,\
    \ technology may provide a systematic tool to detect unforeseen problems hard\
    \ to notice\nby visual inspection on occasional checks. Regarding the willingness\
    \ of adopting modern tools in\nagriculture, young farmers show a more positive\
    \ attitude than elder ones, as the former can support\ntheir not-so-large experience\
    \ in the ﬁeld with new smart tools providing key information. However,\nthe average\
    \ age of farmers in the last decades has been alarmingly increasing: Around 58\
    \ years old in\nthe USA and Europe, 60 in sub-Saharan Africa, or 63 in Japan [8,9].\
    \ Fortunately, this trend is expected\nto change. Several European policies, for\
    \ example, are being set to support a generational renewal,\nfacilitating access\
    \ to initial investment, loans, business advice, and training [9]. A generational\
    \ renewal\nin a rural development context goes beyond a reduction in the average\
    \ age of farmers; it is also about\nempowering a new generation of highly qualiﬁed\
    \ young farmers to bring the full beneﬁts of technology\nin order to support sustainable\
    \ farming practices [10]. This implies that young farmers will need to\ntransform\
    \ the existing land to more modern and competitive farms with the purpose of maintaining\n\
    viable food production while improving the competitiveness of the agrifood chain,\
    \ because with\nadvanced technologies and new thinking, young people can transform\
    \ the agricultural sector [8].\n2.1. Internet of Things: Collecting Information\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) in an agricultural context refers to the use of sensors\
    \ and other devices to\nturn every element and action involved in farming into\
    \ data. It has been reported that an estimation\nof a 10% to 15% of US farmers\
    \ are using IoT solutions on the farm across 1200 million hectares and\n250,000\
    \ farms [11]. IoT drives Agriculture 4.0 [12]; in fact, IoT technologies is one\
    \ of the reasons why\nagriculture can generate such a big amount of valuable information,\
    \ and the agriculture sector is\nexpected to be highly inﬂuenced by the advances\
    \ in these technologies [13]. It is estimated that, with\nnew techniques, the\
    \ IoT has the potential to increase agricultural productivity by 70% by 2050 [14],\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n3 of 21\nwhich is positive, because according to Myklevy\
    \ et al., the world needs to increase global food\nproduction by 60% by 2050 due\
    \ to a population growth over nine thousand million [15]. The main\nadvantages\
    \ of the use of IoT are achieving higher crop yields and less cost. For example,\
    \ studies from\nOnFarm found that for an average farm using IoT, yield rises by\
    \ 1.75% and energy costs drop 17 to\n32 dollars per hectare, while water use for\
    \ irrigation falls by 8% [12].\n2.2. Big Data: Analysis of Massive Data\nIn the\
    \ current technology-based era, the concept of big data is present in many economic\
    \ sectors,\nbut is it already available to agriculture?\nThe ever-growing amount\
    \ of data available for ﬁeld\nmanagement makes necessary the implementation of\
    \ some type of automatic process to extract\noperational information from bulk\
    \ data. However, the volume of data currently retrieved from most\ncommercial\
    \ ﬁelds is, arguably, not yet at the level considered to be classiﬁed as big data.\
    \ According to\nManyica et al. [16], big data has three dimensions: Volume, velocity,\
    \ and variety. Kunisch [17] added a\nfourth V for veracity. Finally, a ﬁfth V\
    \ was added by Chi et al. for the extra dimension valorization [18].\nOverall,\
    \ the ﬁve V (dimensions) of big data stand for:\n•\nVolume refers to datasets\
    \ whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to\ncapture,\
    \ store, manage, and analyze information. This deﬁnition includes an estimate\
    \ of how big\na dataset needs to be in order to be considered big, and it can\
    \ vary by study sector, depending on\nsoftware tools that are commonly available\
    \ and common sizes of datasets, typically starting in the\nterabyte range [16].\n\
    •\nVelocity refers to the capability to acquire, understand and interpret events\
    \ as they occur.\nIn agriculture, this would refer to applications that occur\
    \ in real time, like data being processed\nright in the ﬁeld to apply variable\
    \ rates of chemicals in equipment featuring variable rate\napplication technologies.\n\
    •\nVariety refers to the diﬀerent data formats (videos, text, voice), and the\
    \ diverse degrees of\ncomplexity. This situation is not strange in agriculture\
    \ when diﬀerent data sources are used to\nwork in complex scenarios such as images\
    \ and soil or weather probes.\n•\nVeracity refers to the quality, reliability,\
    \ and overall conﬁdence of the data.\n•\nValorization is the ability to propagate\
    \ knowledge, appreciation and innovation [18].\nIn the context of crop management,\
    \ Kunisch [17] concluded that big data is applicable only in\nsome cases in agriculture,\
    \ depending on each farm and its level of technology adoption. Nevertheless,\n\
    the Proagrica [19] report conﬁrmed that big data was being increasingly applied\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector. Kamilaris et al. [18] cited 34 works where big data\
    \ was used in agricultural applications, and\nWolfert et al. [20] published a\
    \ review on big data applications in Smart Farming. In line with this\ntrend,\
    \ the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR, Montpellier,\
    \ France)\ncreated a Platform for Big Data in Agriculture with the purpose of\
    \ using big data approaches to solve\nagricultural development problems faster,\
    \ better, and at a greater scale than before [21].\n2.3. Agriculture 5.0: Robotics\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to Help in Nourishing People\nBig engineering\
    \ challenges typically spur big solutions through disruptive technologies,\nand\
    \ Agriculture 5.0 is probably the one for the ﬁrst half of the 21st Century. The\
    \ concept Agriculture\n5.0 implies that farms are following Precision Agriculture\
    \ principles and using equipment that involves\nunmanned operations and autonomous\
    \ decision support systems. Thus, Agriculture 5.0 implies the use\nof robots and\
    \ some forms of AI [22]. By tradition, farms have needed many workers, mostly\
    \ seasonal,\nto harvest crops and keep farms productive. However, society has\
    \ moved away from being an agrarian\nsociety with large quantities of people living\
    \ in farms to people living in cities now; as a result, farms\nare facing the\
    \ challenge of a workforce shortage. One solution to help with this shortage of\
    \ workers is\nagricultural robots integrating AI features. According to a Forbes\
    \ study [23], farm robots augment\nthe human labor workforce and can harvest crops\
    \ at a higher volume and faster pace than human\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n4 of\
    \ 21\nlaborers. Although there are still many cases in which robots are not as\
    \ fast as humans, agriculture is\ncurrently developing robotic systems to work\
    \ in the ﬁeld and help producers with tedious tasks [24–27],\npushing agricultural\
    \ systems to the new concept of Agriculture 5.0. According to Reddy et al. [28],\n\
    the advent of robots in agriculture drastically increased the productivity in\
    \ several countries and\nreduced the farm operating costs. As said before, robotic\
    \ applications for agriculture are growing\nexponentially [27], which oﬀers promising\
    \ solutions for Smart Farming in handling labor shortage and\na long-time declining\
    \ proﬁtability; however, like most innovations, there exist important limitations\n\
    to cope with at the current early stages. These technologies are still too expensive\
    \ for most farmers,\nespecially those with small farms [29], because scale economics\
    \ make small individual farms less\nproﬁtable [30]. Nevertheless, the cost of\
    \ technology decreases with time, and agricultural robots will be\nsurely implemented\
    \ in the future as the alternative to bring about higher production [4,31]. The\
    \ world\nagricultural production and crop yields slowed down in 2015. The concept\
    \ of agricultural robotics\nwas introduced to overcome these problems and satisfy\
    \ the rising demand for high yields. Robotic\ninnovations are giving a boost to\
    \ the global agriculture and crop production market, as according to\nthe Veriﬁed\
    \ Market Intelligence report, agricultural robots will be capable of completing\
    \ ﬁeld tasks\nwith greater eﬃciency as compared to the farmers [32].\nAgricultural\
    \ tech startups have raised over 800 million dollars in the last ﬁve years [31].\
    \ Startups\nusing robotics and machine learning to solve problems in agriculture\
    \ started gaining momentum in\n2014, in line with a rising interest in AI [33].\
    \ In fact, venture capital funding in AI has increased by 450%\nin the last 5\
    \ years [34]. This kind of new agriculture pretends to do more with less, because\
    \ nourishing\npeople while increasing production sustainably and taking care of\
    \ the environment will be crucial in\nthe coming years, as the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates\nthat, in 2050, there will\
    \ be a world population of 9.6 billion [35]. Advanced sensing technologies in\n\
    agriculture can help to meet the challenge; they provide detailed information\
    \ on soil, crop status,\nand environmental conditions to allow precise applications\
    \ of phytosanitary products, resulting in a\nreduced used of herbicides and pesticides,\
    \ improved water use eﬃciency and increased crop yield and\nquality [2].\n3. Data-Driven\
    \ Management for Advanced Farming: Principal Stages\nThe raw measurements of key\
    \ parameters from crops need to be eﬃciently processed so that\nnumbers or images\
    \ unambiguously turn into valuable information. Crop management based on ﬁeld\n\
    data already evolved when Precision Agriculture came to light thirty years ago,\
    \ but it has certainly\nbeen transformed by the present digital information era.\
    \ Traditionally, and in those places where\ntechnology has not arrived yet, ﬁeld\
    \ management consists of visually inspecting the development of\ncrops to reach\
    \ a diagnosis with which farmers make decisions and actuate giving diﬀerent treatments\n\
    to their crops. This approach relies on ﬁeld experience and the information perceived\
    \ through the\neyes of farmers. Additionally, associated growers can follow the\
    \ recommendations of cooperative\ntechnicians or engineers hired by the society\
    \ they belong to. In farms where advanced technology\nhas been implemented, ﬁeld\
    \ management varies according to the operating cycle shown in Figure 1.\nThis\
    \ management system based on objective ﬁeld data and smart decision-making starts\
    \ with the actual\ncrop to manage, taking advantage of its inner variability,\
    \ both spatial-wise and time-wise. The platform\nrefers to the physical means\
    \ with which information is acquired, being the sensors the speciﬁc elements\n\
    through which objective data are obtained. Data includes the information directly\
    \ retrieved from the\nparameters measured from the crop, soil, or ambient. Retrieving\
    \ the data from the sensors can be done\nin multiple ways, from inserting a pen\
    \ drive in a USB port to get the ﬁles [36] to retrieving data from\nsoftware applications\
    \ synchronized to the Internet. The nexus between the data and the decision stage\n\
    involves ﬁltering routines and AI algorithms for getting only the right data and\
    \ helping the grower\nmake correct decisions. Finally, actuation refers to the\
    \ physical execution of an action commanded by\nthe decision system, and is typically\
    \ carried out by advanced equipment that can receive orders from\na computerized\
    \ control unit. As each action takes place over the crop, the cycle starts and\
    \ closes at\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n5 of 21\ncrop level; the response of the\
    \ crop is then registered by specialized sensors and the loop continues\nsystematically\
    \ until harvesting time, which marks the end of the crop life cycle.\nAgronomy\

    \ of the Agricultural Management Cycle—Analyzing \nVariability \nRegardless how\
    \ the crop will be managed, some degree of spatial variability is assumed for\
    \ all \nfields by nature. According to Searcy [37], natural variability is influenced\
    \ by weather within a \ngrowing season and from year to year; then, data from\
    \ several years may be needed to determine \ntrends in the parameters of interest,\
    \ and hence, data becomes a regular input to the farm management \nsystem. Therefore,\
    \ the necessity of monitoring crops comes from the existence of variability, but\
    \ there \nis a need for the producer to manage that variability in a feasible\
    \ way, and the widely accepted way \nto do it is by setting within-field management\
    \ zones. Management zones are subfield areas that have \nhomogeneous features,\
    \ so field practices can be custom-made to each of such areas, resulting in a\
    \ \npractical and cost-effective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption\
    \ of management \nzones would reduce the cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, \nprovide better farm records that are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for \nmanagement decisions [4]. According\
    \ to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a \nfunction of the\
    \ natural variability within the field, the size of the field and certain management\
    \ \nfactors. If the variability is high, the minimum size of a zone is limited\
    \ by the possibility of each \nfarmer to differentially manage regions within\
    \ a field in economic and logistics terms. In addition to \ndecide the area of\
    \ working zones, the selection of the specific parameters to be tracked within\
    \ those \nzones must be carefully made early in the process. Rovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio\

    3.1. Stage I: The Crop as the Beginning and End of the Agricultural Management\
    \ Cycle—Analyzing Variability\nRegardless how the crop will be managed, some degree\
    \ of spatial variability is assumed for all\nﬁelds by nature. According to Searcy\
    \ [37], natural variability is inﬂuenced by weather within a growing\nseason and\
    \ from year to year; then, data from several years may be needed to determine\
    \ trends in\nthe parameters of interest, and hence, data becomes a regular input\
    \ to the farm management system.\nTherefore, the necessity of monitoring crops\
    \ comes from the existence of variability, but there is a need\nfor the producer\
    \ to manage that variability in a feasible way, and the widely accepted way to\
    \ do it is by\nsetting within-ﬁeld management zones. Management zones are subﬁeld\
    \ areas that have homogeneous\nfeatures, so ﬁeld practices can be custom-made\
    \ to each of such areas, resulting in a practical and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n\
    6 of 21\ncost-eﬀective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption of\
    \ management zones would reduce\nthe cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, provide better farm records\nthat are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for management decisions [4]. According\n\
    to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a function of the natural\
    \ variability within\nthe ﬁeld, the size of the ﬁeld and certain management factors.\
    \ If the variability is high, the minimum\nsize of a zone is limited by the possibility\
    \ of each farmer to diﬀerentially manage regions within a\nﬁeld in economic and\
    \ logistics terms. In addition to decide the area of working zones, the selection\
    \ of\nthe speciﬁc parameters to be tracked within those zones must be carefully\
    \ made early in the process.\nRovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio [65] classiﬁed crop biometric\
    \ traits in a tri-level division of crop features\ndepending on the focus of interest\
    \ being at soil level, plant level, or produce level. This division\nallowed the\
    \ superimposition of various layers in a standardized map with the aim of determining\
    \ a\ndata-based wine quality index deﬁned as the Quality Potential Index (QPI)\
    \ for each subﬁeld area in a\nvineyard. Nevertheless, there may be speciﬁc cases\
    \ where the spatial variability of a ﬁeld is so low that\na single mapping event\
    \ can be suﬃcient, as reported by Klassen et al. [42] when characterizing soil\n\
    variability in rice ﬁelds.\n3.2. Stage II: Platforms Supporting Sensors\nSensors\
    \ are the universal devices to monitor crops and to obtain objective information\
    \ from them.\nThey are usually integrated in a platform, which is the general\
    \ term used in Figure 1 to name the\nstructures where sensors are placed and carried.\
    \ These platforms may be attached to oﬀ-road vehicles\nor ﬁxed to the ground within\
    \ ﬁelds such as local weather stations. One of the most urgent challenges to\n\
    cope with in the next few years will be getting a wider range of non-invasive\
    \ sensors able to measure\non-the-go. This approach would be closer to Agriculture\
    \ 5.0, as these sensors could be attached to\nautonomous platforms and robots.\
    \ Nowadays, not all the parameters of interest can be measured\nnon-invasively\
    \ and at a distance from the target; however, some technologies such as multispectral\
    \ or\nhyperspectral imaging are making signiﬁcant improvements.\n3.2.1. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms: Satellites\nRemote sensing has played a key role in the progress\
    \ of Smart Farming when ﬁeld data became\ngenerally accessible from artiﬁcial\
    \ satellites. Important satellites providing agricultural information are\nthe\
    \ American Landsat satellites (eight satellites take spectral data from the Earth\
    \ each 16 to 18 days),\nthe European Sentinel 2 satellite system (it provides\
    \ multispectral data at 10 m pixel resolution for\nNDVI—Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation\
    \ Index—imagery, soil, and water cover every ten days), the\nRapidEye constellation\
    \ (ﬁve satellites provide multispectral RGB imagery, as well as red-edge and NIR\n\
    bands at 5 m resolution), the GeoEye-1 system (captures multispectral RGB data\
    \ and NIR data at a\n1.84 m resolution), and the WorldView-3 (collects multispectral\
    \ data from the RGB bands including\nthe red-edge, two NIR bands, and 8 SWIR bands\
    \ with a resolution of 1.24 m at nadir). IKONOS\nand QuickBird have been already\
    \ decommissioned. There exist several reviews on satellite sensing\napplications,\
    \ having recent studies focused on the potential applications of thermal technologies\
    \ using\nremote sensing [44] and nutritional status in commodity crops [45].\n\
    3.2.2. Aircraft Systems\nThe distance between crops and satellites is considerable,\
    \ typically around 700 km, and deeper\ninsights are reachable when sensors remain\
    \ closer to the targets. For aircraft systems, the distance\nto land can be around\
    \ 100 m. For example, there is a legal limit of 120 m above the ground in Spain\n\
    for unmanned ﬂying vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remotely-piloted\
    \ aircrafts (RPA)\ncan basically be of two kinds: Fixed-wing aircrafts and multirotor\
    \ aircrafts. Rotary-wing UAVs are\nmore stable ﬂiers as they are capable of a\
    \ vertical take-oﬀ and landing; however, they are slower and\ncannot cover as\
    \ much area during their battery life. Fixed-wing platforms, on the other hand,\
    \ can cover\nmore area per ﬂight and carry larger payloads, but tend to be more\
    \ expensive and break more easily\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n7 of 21\nafter multiple\
    \ landings [45]. When compared to remote sensing, the advantages of UAVs for Precision\n\
    Agriculture are their ﬂexibility in frequency (revisit time of satellites) and\
    \ better spatial resolutions.\nWhen compared to ground vehicles, UAVs can get\
    \ data from inaccessible places where conventional\nequipment cannot stand; however,\
    \ they require a professional planning of the ﬂight route beforehand,\nand certain\
    \ machine vision applications may require ﬂying at midday to avoid vegetation\
    \ shadows\non the ground causing errors with imagery data. Furthermore, post processing\
    \ the data and image\nmosaicking is often quite challenging. An important disadvantage\
    \ of UAVs is the limited payload\nthey can carry, which often limits the suite\
    \ of sensors onboard, as well as the incapacity of ﬂying with\nstrong wind.\n\
    3.2.3. Proximal Sensing: Ground Autonomous Systems—the Great Push for Agriculture\
    \ 5.0\nWhen monitoring platforms operate from the ground, the distance from the\
    \ sensors to the target\ncrop diminishes to less than 2 m. Due to the proximity\
    \ of the sensor to the plant, when data is acquired\nfrom ground-based platforms,\
    \ it is called proximal sensing. Ground vehicles are polyvalent in relation\n\
    to the payload of sensors. As these vehicles move near the crop, the data acquired\
    \ increase in accuracy,\nand resolutions of one or more samples per meter are\
    \ feasible, being only limited by the speciﬁcations\nof the particular sensors\
    \ implemented. When active sensors are used, weather conditions such as\nstrong\
    \ sunlight or poor illumination are not a serious problem anymore, and, in case\
    \ of on-the-ﬂy\nprocessing, real-time applications are possible, as spraying weeds\
    \ with the previous detection of the\npest [47]. There has been a signiﬁcant impulse\
    \ in the last ﬁve years for the particular case where data is\nretrieved from\
    \ an autonomous platform (unmanned ground vehicle or UGV) [48–52]. Aravind et\
    \ al. [48]\nreviewed ground robots for tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting,\
    \ crop scouting, pest control,\nweed removal and harvesting, where crop scouting\
    \ has been deﬁned as the process of continuously\nmonitoring the ﬁeld to acquire\
    \ information on the plant status, disease incidence, and infestations\naﬀecting\
    \ crop growth. Shamshiri et al. [27] described recent achievements of UGVs for\
    \ weed control,\nﬁeld scouting, and harvesting, highlighting that, if successfully\
    \ integrated and implemented, ﬁeld\nscouting robots can play a key role in reducing\
    \ production cost, increasing productivity and quality,\nand enabling customized\
    \ plant and crop treatments. The European Commission (EC) has recently\nbacked\
    \ the relevance of robotic technology for Smart Farming by funding four projects\
    \ involving the\nconstruction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: VineRobot,\
    \ Vinbot, GRAPE, and VineScout.\nIn 2016, the European project VineRobot [53]\
    \ delivered a monitoring robot prototype at a Technology\nReadiness Level (TRL)\
    \ status between 6 and 7 (TRL1 represents an early stage concept and TRL9\nis\
    \ a solution ready for production), paving the path for its conceptual termination\
    \ in the VineScout\nproject [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in Figure\
    \ 2. This robot is autonomously driven\nwhen monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local perception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and\nultrasound sensors) for\
    \ navigation and safeguarding. It gathers data from the canopy of the vines with\n\
    the goal of creating plant water status maps and nutritional status maps. In order\
    \ to accomplish its\nmission in a reasonable timeframe, established by end-users\
    \ at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors\nvine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies several challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust\nsensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and in motion, while having a cost-eﬃcient price\
    \ for the\nagriculture sector. Regarding software, the challenge was the agile\
    \ integration of all the crop-sensing\ndevices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ validation of the models developed in the ﬁeld.\nIn addition to scouting robots,\
    \ the introduction of robotics to the farm is also being led by industry\non speciﬁc\
    \ agricultural tasks. Naïo Technologies, for instance, has developed robot Oz\
    \ for mechanical\nweeding [55], and the autonomous sprayer GUSS received the Davidson\
    \ Prize in 2019 [56]. RowBot\nSystems LLC (Minneapolis, MN, USA) patented a robotic\
    \ platform whose structure was conﬁgured\nto perform several ﬁeld tasks, as selectively\
    \ applying fertilizer, mapping growth zones, or seeding\ncover crop [57]. Over\
    \ the 20th century, farm productivity has been increasing by augmenting the\n\
    size of machines, which has led to heavy and oversized equipment. In order to\
    \ invert this trend,\nresearchers and growers have started to think about alternatives\
    \ to tractors to avoid soil compaction.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n8 of 21\nShamshiri\
    \ et al. [27] suggested using various machines instead of one heavy machine. In\
    \ the same\nline, Hameed [58] proposed a technology that enabled a single farmer\
    \ to control a team of automated\nvehicles, and Ball et al. [59] used cooperative\
    \ robots as a measure to control weeds. In fact, there\nhave been several projects\
    \ implementing more than one machine operating in collaborative work,\nas the\
    \ Flourish European project that combines UAVs and UGVs to retrieve information\
    \ for decision\nsupport [46], or the RHEA project where a ﬂeet of autonomous robot\
    \ units performed treatments in\ncrops [82].\n \nfunding four projects involving\
    \ the construction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: \nVineRobot, Vinbot,\
    \ GRAPE, and VineScout. In 2016, the European project VineRobot [53] delivered\
    \ \na monitoring robot prototype at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) status\
    \ between 6 and 7 (TRL1 \nrepresents an early stage concept and TRL9 is a solution\
    \ ready for production), paving the path for \nits conceptual termination in the\
    \ VineScout project [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in \nFigure 2.\
    \ This robot is autonomously driven when monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local \nperception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and ultrasound sensors)\
    \ for navigation and safeguarding. It \ngathers data from the canopy of the vines\
    \ with the goal of creating plant water status maps and \nnutritional status maps.\
    \ In order to accomplish its mission in a reasonable timeframe, established by\
    \ \nend-users at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors vine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies \nseveral challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust sensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and \nin motion, while having a cost-efficient\
    \ price for the agriculture sector. Regarding software, the \nchallenge was the\
    \ agile integration of all the crop-sensing devices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ \nvalidation of the models developed in the field. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure\

    \ (b).\n3.3. Stage III: Data\nOne of the fundamental diﬀerences between traditional\
    \ and modern farming is, apart from the\nmechanization level, the data collected\
    \ directly from the crops. In traditional farms where growers\njudge by visual\
    \ assessment, decisions are relative and subjective. Modern farming oﬀers assessment\n\
    by quantitative data producing objective decisions. Sensors allow data acquisition\
    \ in the ﬁeld, but\nthe special case of non-invasive technologies in combination\
    \ with on-the-ﬂy sensing from moving\nplatforms has opened the window of massive\
    \ data collection, a forerunner of big data in agriculture.\nHowever, the excess\
    \ of data is also a serious challenge to cope with, as vital information may result\n\
    masked by noise. The NDVI measurements collected for plotting the maps of Figure\
    \ 3 [94] were\ncollected with two sensors working simultaneously (SRS sensors,\
    \ METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA,\nUSA) and placed in the robot of Figure 2. One\
    \ of the sensors pointed to the sky and corrected NDVI\nestimates with the incident\
    \ light from the sun, and the other sensor pointed sidewise to the canopy\nto\
    \ collect data from the leaves at an approximate distance of 0.5 m. The zenithal\
    \ photo inserted on\nthe bottom-right corner of Figure 3a shows the VineScout\
    \ autonomous robot taking data between\ntwo rows in a vineyard. The onboard algorithm\
    \ averaged individual local measurements of NDVI in\nsquare cells of 16 m2 classiﬁed\
    \ into nine NDVI levels between 0 and 1 (Figure 3a). The grid map of\nFigure 3a,\
    \ despite informative, is not operational, so a further simpliﬁcation of data\
    \ is necessary before\na grower may ﬁnd it useful. Figure 3b is the result of\
    \ applying a clustering ﬁlter to Figure 3a. It shows\ntwo management zones based\
    \ on vine vigor (high-medium) for the grower to make decisions, together\nwith\
    \ water status maps, about fertilization and diﬀerential harvesting.\nAgronomy\

    3.3.1. Maps Containing Relevant Field Features\nDisplaying data in a coherent\
    \ format is key for ﬁnal users to understand what is happening in the\nﬁeld. The\
    \ most common way to display agricultural data has been in the format of maps,\
    \ as mapping is\nuseful to deﬁne spatial trends and homogeneous zones. However,\
    \ displaying agronomical information\nin beautiful maps should not be the goal\
    \ of map generation. Maps need to be useful for making decisions,\nthey need to\
    \ be a help to answer a question, providing an interpretation of spatial information\
    \ [39].\nThe goal of building maps is obtaining a few management zones with the\
    \ parameters of interest so that a\ntreatment can be eﬃciently applied. To get\
    \ plausible management zones, kriging is one of the most used\ninterpolation techniques\
    \ to delimit areas of manageable sizes [43]. Taking into account the considerable\n\
    amount of data that Smart Farming generates, there are many software applications\
    \ to cope with\ninterpolation, in general, or kriging in particular [66]. Also,\
    \ when building a map, a coordinate system\nneeds to be supplied along with the\
    \ map. One ideal alternative for agricultural maps is brought by\nthe Local Tangent\
    \ Plane (LTP) coordinate system, which features Euclidean geometry, allows user-set\n\
    origins, and employs the intuitive coordinate frame east-north. Regarding the\
    \ coding and display of\ndata in the maps, grids allow the systematic quantization\
    \ of the LTP coordinate system to manage crop\nproduction information more eﬃciently,\
    \ facilitating the exchange of information among successive\nseasons and the comparison\
    \ of multiple parameters on the same ﬁeld [67]. A practical example of\ngrid-based\
    \ maps using LTP coordinates is shown in Figure 3.\nTaking into account the key\
    \ role of positioning systems, a map-based approach is the method\nin which a\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS)—or any other Global Navigation Satellite System\n\
    (GNSS)—receiver and a data logger (e.g., an onboard computer) are used to record\
    \ the position of a\nparticular measurement (georeferenced data), so several maps\
    \ can be generated and processed along\nwith other layers of spatially variable\
    \ information [68]. In general, GNSS receivers are the universal\nposition devices\
    \ used to build maps; however, in some cases, for example in greenhouses or dense\n\
    ﬁelds of tall trees, GNSS is not the best option to use due to the diﬃculty of\
    \ getting signals with reliable\naccuracy; so, in some cases, alternative solutions\
    \ such as machine vision must be implemented [69].\n3.3.2. Data Management Software\
    \ to Ease the Process of Decision Making\nA popular way to manage ﬁeld data displayed\
    \ on maps and culminate with a practical solution\nis through the use of Geographic\
    \ Information Systems (GIS). This set of computer-based tools (or\ndata platforms)\
    \ allows to store, analyze, manipulate and map any type of georeferenced information.\n\
    A speciﬁc GIS system called the Field-level geographic Information System (FIS)\
    \ was developed\nfor Precision Agriculture applications [70], but it was set for\
    \ old computer operative systems\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n10 of 21\nsuch as Windows\
    \ 3.1×, 95, 98, or NT [71]. The updated version of FIS is the farm management\n\
    information system (FMIS), which according to Burlacu et al. [72] is a management\
    \ information system\ndesigned to assist farmers with various tasks, ranging from\
    \ operational planning, implementation and\ndocumentation to the assessment of\
    \ performed ﬁeld work. The purpose of FMIS is to reduce production\ncosts, comply\
    \ with agricultural standards, and maintain high product quality and safety, guiding\n\
    growers to make the best decisions possible [95]. Farm management software solutions\
    \ support the\nautomation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning,\
    \ decision making, documenting,\nand managing the farm operations [64], and include\
    \ basic functions for record keeping like crop\nproduction rates (harvests and\
    \ yields), proﬁts and losses, farm tasks scheduling, weather prediction,\nsoil\
    \ nutrients tracking, and ﬁeld mapping, up to more complex functionalities for\
    \ automating ﬁeld\nmanagement accounting for farms and agribusinesses (accounting,\
    \ inventory management, or labor\ncontracts). In many cases, growers do not need\
    \ to be ﬂuid on data management because the software can\nbuild maps or decision-making\
    \ models with basic information introduced by growers. Furthermore,\na critical\
    \ feature of these applications is that they even help in the early warning of\
    \ weather-related\nhazards that enables farmers, policy makers, and aid agencies\
    \ to mitigate their exposure to risk [83].\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration\
    \ that the eﬃciency of a recommendation for a particular\nagent will depend on\
    \ the factors included in the algorithms of the software (technical, economic,\n\
    safety-wise. . . ). In this sense, a DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\
    \ Transfer)\nprovides outputs with experimental data for evaluation of crop models,\
    \ allowing users to compare\nsimulated outcomes with observed results, which is\
    \ critical if real-world decisions or recommendations\nare based on modeled results\
    \ [84]. Table 2 gathers a representative set of commercially available FMIS\n\
    programs speciﬁcally conﬁgured to deal with the usual data generated in the farm.\
    \ It includes the\nname of each application program, the company commercializing\
    \ it with its headquarters location,\nand the main features of the program. The\
    \ table is focused on programs managing crop data as the\nprimary tool, and its\
    \ purpose is not the compilation of all available FMIS software, which would\n\
    be futile given the rate new applications are constantly released, but bringing\
    \ a proof of the global\neﬀort realized in the last decade to deploy Smart Farming\
    \ in actual farms, accelerating the move\nfrom academics to agribusiness. The\
    \ examples show that some smartphone and tablet applications\nalready include\
    \ complex features so that growers can insert data directly in the ﬁeld; other\
    \ companies,\non the contrary, prefer having a basic application for mobile devices\
    \ to increase complexity in the\ncloud-based desktop version. In the majority\
    \ of cases, it is not necessary to have wireless connection\nwhile the grower\
    \ is entering data in the ﬁeld, because as soon as the mobile device ﬁnds a wireless\n\
    connection to the internet, it synchronizes the data previously introduced by\
    \ the grower in the mobile\ndevice with the data safely stored in the cloud. Many\
    \ of the programs listed below oﬀer the option\nof upgrading the software depending\
    \ on speciﬁc grower needs, increasing the price accordingly.\nThe most advanced\
    \ tools include features for ﬁnancial and machinery management, help in the\n\
    decision-making process, release warnings, or even propose management advice.\
    \ In many cases, these\nsoftware applications are not only addressed to the grower\
    \ or producer, but also to other stakeholders in\nagriculture such as inputs suppliers,\
    \ service suppliers, and food distributors, which makes a diﬀerence\nfor Smart\
    \ Farming, where multiple agriculture agents are connected. Regarding exploitation\
    \ rights,\nvarious agricultural management systems have been patented, as the\
    \ software from The Climate Corp.\nto generate agriculture prescriptions [85],\
    \ which entered into partnership with AGCO Corporation in\n2017 [4]. Decisive\

    \ T: Technology); 2 PaaS: Platform as a service.\nThe use of commercial data management\
    \ systems, as the ones listed in Table 2, often implies\nthat producers need to\
    \ share their crop data with a software platform owned and run by private\ncompanies.\
    \ This fact creates some controversy regarding the ownership of the data. In the\
    \ Software\nServices Agreement (SSA), it is stated that the person or entity providing\
    \ the data to the farm\nmanagement software company shall own and retain all rights,\
    \ title and interest in and to their\ndata, so that the data belongs to the provider\
    \ [76]. However, when data are aggregated with other\ngrowers’ data, the combined\
    \ data typically become property of the software company [96]. The list of\napplications\
    \ included in Table 2 proves that there is a global interest in developing software\
    \ for farm\ndata management, and most of the features requested by end-users are\
    \ similar everywhere. This table\nalso gives an idea of the interest raised in\
    \ industry by software-based management systems. However,\nmany applications use\
    \ their own proprietary formats, which complicates the share of data among data\n\
    acquisition and processing systems. A standardization eﬀort is needed among software\
    \ developers\nand providers. The ADAPT toolkit of Table 2 [77] is an example of\
    \ how to face this challenge, as it\nprovides an open-source application that\
    \ eliminates a barrier to the broad use of Precision Agriculture\ndata by enabling\
    \ interoperability between diﬀerent hardware and software applications.\n3.4.\
    \ Stage IV: Decision-Making\nIn situations where many ﬁeld parameters need being\
    \ considered, people ﬁnd practical diﬃculties\nin managing complex information\
    \ to make eﬀective decisions. In such cases, artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) can\
    \ help with techniques like deep learning or neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic\
    \ algorithms,\nor expert systems. AI, with its modelling and reasoning capabilities,\
    \ can play a key role in agriculture,\nhelping to make sense of all the data available.\
    \ Fuzzy logic, to name one example within AI, resembles\nhuman reasoning imitating\
    \ the way of making decisions that involve several possibilities instead of\n\
    ‘true’ or ‘false’ alternatives; this technique uses linguistic variables that\
    \ ﬁt well with the complexity\nof the challenges posed by the diversity of agricultural\
    \ decision making. According to Dengel [20],\nagriculture oﬀers a vast application\
    \ area for all kinds of AI core technologies as agents operating in\nuncontrolled\
    \ environments. Giusti and Marsili-Libellia [81] designed a fuzzy-based decision\
    \ support\nsystem (DSS) taking as input variables soil moisture and rain forecast\
    \ for kiwi, corn, and potato.\nSimilarly, the DSS developed by Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [87] estimated weekly irrigation for citrus\norchards taking into account\
    \ climate and soil variables; in that work, real-time measurements from soil\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n14 of 21\nparameters in a closed-loop control scheme were\
    \ decisive to avoid the accumulative eﬀect due to errors\nin consecutive weekly\
    \ estimations, as the DSS was allowed to adapt to local perturbations. In the\n\
    same fashion, Lindsay Corporation (Omaha, Nebraska, USA) was awarded for its solution\
    \ FieldNET\nAdvisor™ [91] that provides irrigation management decisions for growers.\
    \ DSS may be more robust\nand reliable when diﬀerent variables are considered,\
    \ but some procedures remain controversial as\nobjectives can lead to diﬀerent\
    \ solutions at diﬀerent times based on the priority set by decision makers\nor\
    \ other people involved in the procedure [88].\nSrivastava and Singh [80] highlighted\
    \ the importance of incorporating the graphical part of GIS to\nDSS, which was\
    \ demonstrated for water management scenarios in India. The importance of using\n\
    GIS for agricultural DSS lies on using user-friendly graphical interfaces for\
    \ growers. The result of a\nquestionnaire distributed by VineScout project [36]\
    \ members to the attendees of a ﬁeld demonstration in\nPortugal (October 2019),\
    \ evidenced the high value given to graphical user interfaces (GUI). Considering\n\
    that the prototype is in research phase and not commercial yet, 84% of the attendees\
    \ concluded that\nthe robot GUI shown in Figure 4 was simple to understand and\
    \ easy to use (unpublished research).\nRupnik et al. [89] developed a cloud-based\
    \ system to allow growers upload their own data, utilize\nseveral data analysis\
    \ methods, and ﬁnally present their outputs as decisions to apply. This time,\
    \ their\nuse case focused on spray planning for ﬁghting against pests in vineyards\
    \ and orchards. Rose et al. [90]\nconducted a survey on DSS and arrived to the\
    \ conclusion that 15 factors were inﬂuential in convincing\nUK growers and advisers\
    \ to use DSS, including usability, cost-eﬀectiveness, performance, relevance to\n\
    user, and compatibility with compliance demands. In addition, they found that\
    \ 49% of UK farmers used\nsome kind of DSS, and the preferred ways of delivery\
    \ were software (28%), paper-based (22%) tools,\nand mobile apps (10%). These\
    \ results show that the use of software to manage decisions is growing,\nbut its\
    \ percentage is still low and comparable to those who preferred paper-based tools.\
    \ Choosing\nsoftware and mobile applications to make agricultural decisions may\
    \ be considered beneﬁcial because\ndigital tools increase management eﬃciency\
    \ when compared to paper-based tools; however, there is\nstill a long way to make\
    \ technology-based tools attractive enough—easy to understand, intuitive and\n\
    nice—for growers to adopt. On the producer side, it is important to have access\
    \ to proper training\nuntil these technologies can be comfortably managed.\nAgronomy\

    \ last step for closing the loop in the complete crop management cycle of Figure\
    \ 1 is the\nphysical actuation on the crop. Actuation is understood as executing\
    \ some action on the crop or\nrelated to it, and this can be done by making decisions\
    \ right after obtaining information (real-time\napplications) or in another moment\
    \ deferred in time (oﬀ-line). For farmers to execute decisions,\nthey need advanced\
    \ equipment that can receive orders from a computerized control unit. Variable\n\
    rate machines can execute a number of farming tasks driven by a smart system [60].\
    \ Variable rate\ntechnology (VRT) applied on site-speciﬁc crop management (SSCM)\
    \ has the potential to increase\nproﬁt and decrease environmental impact [61]\
    \ as only what is needed is actually applied. Colaço\nand Molin [92] conducted\
    \ a long-term study for six years with the goal of evaluating the eﬀects of\n\
    variable rate fertilization on fertilizer consumption, soil fertility, and yield\
    \ in citrus. The outcomes\nof comparing variable and uniform rates showed that\
    \ the former achieved higher yields while using\nless fertilizer: using nitrogen,\
    \ fruit yield (kg of oranges) respect to the amount of fertilizer resulted\nin\
    \ a 32% yield increase in ﬁeld 1, and 38% in ﬁeld 2. When using potassium, the\
    \ yield increase even\nreached 40% in ﬁeld 1. In the case of phosphorus, the growth\
    \ rate was approximately 20% for both\nﬁelds. A recent review led by Nawar et\
    \ al. [93] conﬁrmed that, when management zone delineation\ntechniques were used\
    \ for variable-rate nutrient application, farm eﬃciency increased in all cases\n\
    when compared to traditional uniform-rate applications, and environmental impacts\
    \ were reduced.\nMachinery manufacturers are leading the development of commercial\
    \ solutions implementing VRT.\nThomasson et al. [62] described commercial VRT\
    \ systems oﬀered by major agricultural machinery\nmanufacturers, like CLAAS, that\
    \ used the ISARIA crop sensor for the variable-rate application of\nnitrogen-based\
    \ fertilizer, or the CEBIS MOBILE ISOBUS, which, apart from having other Precision\n\
    Agriculture functions, it is a compatible terminal to integrate the ISARIA sensor.\
    \ Another promising\ntype of variable actuation is automatic diﬀerential harvesting\
    \ or variable rate harvesting (VRH),\nwhich attempts harvesting according to previously\
    \ deﬁned management zones. In specialty crops,\nSethuramasamyraja [40] worked\
    \ in diﬀerential harvesting for vineyards by using near-infrared sensors\nto determine\
    \ grape quality in the ﬁeld based on the anthocyanin content of berries. The three\
    \ steps for\nthis VRH system involved sensing the anthocyanin content of grapes,\
    \ using these data to produce\nquality map based on a threshold anthocyanin level,\
    \ and feeding the quality map to the harvester for its\ncommanding. CLAAS was\
    \ awarded for implementing VRH in combines and forage harvesters [91] by\nmerging\
    \ precision sensing technology with autonomous machine control. The goal was to\
    \ maximize\nproductivity and automatically optimize harvester performance, according\
    \ to the changing conditions\nof the soil, plants, grain, and humidity in the\
    \ harvested ﬁeld. A USDA statistical analysis conducted in\n2010 [3] showed that\
    \ variable rate technologies had positive, but small, rate adoptions of 1% due\
    \ to\ntheir diﬃculty of use. Apart from eﬃciency and utility, cost is also a critical\
    \ parameter to consider for\nthe adoption of this technology. In this sense, the\
    \ ubiquitous availability of low-cost electronics will\nfavor the introduction\
    \ of such digital applications. In fact, advances in autonomous driving technology\n\
    for cars, including object detection capabilities through multi-camera systems,\
    \ have already reduced\nthe cost of developing automated agricultural machines\
    \ [22].\n4. Discussion\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, mainly since the advent\
    \ of mechanization, and along the Green\nRevolution, humans and machines have\
    \ been eﬃciently collaborating for growing crops to feed people.\nHowever, to\
    \ face the population growth in the coming years, an extra eﬀort is needed to\
    \ succeed,\nnot only in feeding people by increasing productivity, but also in\
    \ doing it in the most eﬃcient and\nrespectful possible way, that is, producing\
    \ sustainably. To face this challenge, remarkable advances in\ntechnology have\
    \ been appearing over the last decades, in particular the access to reliable agricultural\n\
    data and advanced computer techniques to get the optimal meaning from them, eventually\
    \ obtaining\nmaximum beneﬁts while being respectful with the environment. This\
    \ new approach driven by digital\ntechnology implies that growers must act as\
    \ supervisors of their crops rather than laborers, in an attempt\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 207\n16 of 21\nof avoiding repetitive, physically-demanding, and tedious\
    \ ﬁeld tasks. In this modern agronomical\nframework, DATA is the key, and the\
    \ information-based management cycle described above provides\nthe practical approach\
    \ that unites concept and tasks. The following points summarize some of the\n\
    speciﬁc ideas drawn from this study:\n•\nPrecision Agriculture, which consists\
    \ of applying what is needed when and where is needed,\nhas further improved the\
    \ eﬃciency of managing farms with the addition of data-based digital\nsystems\
    \ that increase the knowledge of producers about their ﬁelds; this is known as\
    \ Agriculture\n4.0 or Digital Farming. When these data-driven farms incorporate\
    \ robotics with AI algorithms to\ntheir systems, the overall concept is then referred\
    \ to as Agriculture 5.0. Some studies report that\nagricultural robots integrating\
    \ forms of AI can do certain tasks faster than humans [23]. Despite\nthere are\
    \ other studies that contradict this statement [63], robotics is a growing economy\
    \ and there\nexists a great potential for many applications within agriculture.\n\
    •\nA greater adoption of Digital Farming by professional growers is vital to not\
    \ only improving a\nfarm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet the food needs\
    \ of an expanding population [6].\nSmall farms will steadily incorporate basic\
    \ technology whereas large ﬁelds will likely invest with\nsophisticated equipment,\
    \ but data-less intuition-driven management will no longer represent\nthe modus\
    \ operandi of professional farms in the future. This should be considered a source\
    \ of\nopportunities, especially for a new generation of young farmers used to\
    \ digital technology, who\nare the ones with the capacity to balance an aging\
    \ population in rural areas, mainly those in\nindustrialized countries.\n•\nAfter\
    \ the rapid growth of UAVs, a steady-state is being reached, mostly induced by\
    \ the fact that\ndata analysis and ground-truth validation has resulted far more\
    \ complex and delicate than image\nacquisition and platform handling. This has\
    \ promoted the expansion of proximal sensing and the\nexploration of combining\
    \ both data sources—aerial and terrestrial—for a better understanding of\nthe\
    \ physiology of plants and trees.\n•\nMaps, as the most common way to represent\
    \ agricultural data, would need to be standardized.\nIntensely-interpolated colored\
    \ maps are output by GIS, FMIS, and other software applications,\nbut at the time\
    \ of comparing data with the precision enough to grant statistical signiﬁcance,\
    \ it often\nbecomes an impossible mission without standardization. Figure 3, for\
    \ example, uses the ﬂat\nrepresentation provided by the local tangent plane (LTP)\
    \ and formatted in a regular grid. Other\nprograms use UTM projections, and there\
    \ are even images only given in geodetic coordinates.\nAt the need of overlapping\
    \ maps, it takes a big eﬀort to make all data compatible. Not only the\nway coordinates\
    \ are represented needs a standard, but also the units, intervals, and even colors\
    \ in\nwhich parameters are displayed. The combination of aerial and ground data,\
    \ for instance, will\ngreatly beneﬁt from such standardization in the way data\
    \ is visually displayed for the average\ngrower to understand.\n•\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a representative compilation of software applications for farm management.\n\
    The list is not exhaustive, and yet includes companies from four continents and\
    \ 14 countries,\nwhich provides evidence of the fact that agricultural digitalization\
    \ is in fact a global move.\n•\nRegarding variable rate applications, adoption\
    \ rates need to augment, and to do so, farmers must\nﬁnd by themselves the value\
    \ in this technology for their crops. Only after maintaining accurate\nspatial\
    \ records and analyzing ﬁeld data can eﬀective variable rate prescriptions be\
    \ created [39] to\naddress particular tasks.\n5. Conclusions\nThis analysis conﬁrms\
    \ that consistent knowledge about farms leads to optimal decisions.\nAgricultural\
    \ management systems can handle farm data in such a way that results are orchestrated\n\
    to address customized solutions for each farm. This aid for farmers in the form\
    \ of digital solutions\ncombines forces with robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to launch the imminent idea of Agriculture\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n17 of 21\n\
    5.0. After thirty years of great expectations—and disappointments—by the application\
    \ of robotics to\nagriculture, the timing seems right for the ﬁrst time. However,\
    \ in order to take the most advantages\nfrom Agriculture 5.0, deep training needs\
    \ to be delivered to users, ideally young farmers eager to\nlearn and apply modern\
    \ technologies to agriculture and granting a generational renewal still to come.\n\
    It seems to be the right time to move forward towards a modern and sustainable\
    \ agriculture that\nis capable of showing the full power of data-driven management\
    \ to face the challenges posed to\nfood production in the 21st Century. The evolution\
    \ to Agriculture 5.0 is in the agenda of most major\nfarm equipment makers for\
    \ the next decade, and therefore oﬀ-road equipment manufacturers will\nplay a\
    \ key role in this move if agricultural robots are considered as the next—smarter—generation\
    \ of\nfarm machines.\nAuthor Contributions: V.S.-R. and F.R.-M. contributed to\

    of information and communication technology (ICT) in different industrial sectors,
    the production and manufacturing process relies more on ICT. ICT significantly
    increases the quality of service and productivity while it comes together with
    information security risks. As an essential part of a nation and economy, agriculture
    is provided with many ICT applications. ICT greatly contributes to the weather
    climate forecast, pest or disease prediction and so on to improve crop yields
    and food safety. The revolution of the fourth industry accelerates the application
    of ICT in agriculture and the development of smart agriculture. Smart agriculture
    is highly based on ICT to improve productivity and reduce waste, loss, and cost,
    such as big data, sensors, the Internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence
    (AI), cloud computing, and so on. All these changes and applications of ICT bring
    together information security risks. Based on the literature review and content
    analysis as research methodology, this paper concluded that information security
    risks are serious and inevitable in agriculture or food security. Therefore the
    need for information security risks management is significant in agriculture and
    food security. Published in: 2023 IEEE 21st World Symposium on Applied Machine

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Herl''any, Slovakia SECTION I. Introduction
    Along with the rapid development and application of information and communication
    technology (ICT) in various industries, organizations, and businesses, it brings
    a better quality of service and higher productivity. The role of ICT is changing
    all the fields of research [1], including agriculture. Especially nowadays, the
    industry 4.0-time, information and communication technology is taking a significant
    role in the manufacturing process, supply chain, and people’s everyday life. ICT
    is unquestionably important to support better quality and higher agriculture productivity
    and manufacturing activities [2], particularly food safety and security. The fourth
    industry''s revolution significantly accelerates the use of ICT in agriculture.
    Unfortunately, even the agricultural industry is not provided a full advantage
    of intelligence systems, and It is noticed that the trend is becoming an automated
    process in agricultural production, supply chain, control process, and agribusiness
    sector. There are becoming more and more ICT practiced well in agriculture, such
    as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing,
    big data, and so on. In current years, the Internet of Things (IoT) is developing
    rapidly in agriculture, which makes agriculture sectors more efficient and smarter.
    IoT is good at increasing production and reducing cost, relying on data collecting,
    data analysis, and optimal reaction and prediction of unexpected problems, such
    as problems from pest control, climate and weather, crop diseases, and so on.
    The best application of IoT is cloud computing technology, which has unlimited
    service. AI can help agricultural producers or manufacturers to monitor the crop
    production process to improve productivity and profitability and reduce cost and
    loss. Cloud computing can connect people worldwide, achieving control remotely
    and storage freely. Here should be mentioned the question of data security in
    agricultural production. Let’s see an example: plant protection and the forecasting
    of special harmful organisms. The key question is: how can it be based on the
    data available to build an effective forecasting system? Who will transfer the
    data about the plant developmental stage (i.e., phenology) and the weather condition
    (meteorological service ), and who will observe the harmful organism on the plot?
    There is no shortage of data: it was frequently described that not only "our lives",
    but the whole environment is being "recorded" at more and more points, leaving
    digital traces behind with almost every step we take. What are the indications
    that someone is preparing to commit an interruption to "transfer," not the real
    data (a terrorist offense against farmers)? [3]. The question of safe food needs
    to be documented in the whole production chain from farm to table, including the
    pre-production phase (chemical use, methods of tillage, source of seeds, etc.)
    through the technology and harvesting, storing, and food processing, too [4].
    Especially as the potential leading agriculture type for meeting global food production
    needs and sustainable demands, precision agriculture (PA) has a significant role
    in balancing input-output efficiency. PA is the system conducted by many information-related
    technologies, such as data transfer, GPS trackers, sensor access to wireless networks,
    remote transmission, and system actuation, typically in real-time [5]. These technologies
    significantly help agricultural producers to reduce water use and predict and
    prevent crop diseases. Besides mentioned above, there is still a huge number of
    technologies using information collection, analysis, and processes in the agriculture
    sector. With the adoption of smart farming worldwide, more and more advanced ICT
    applications will be required in agriculture. Whatever ICT type is used in the
    agriculture sector, it highly relies on the networks, hardware, software, personnel,
    and organizational structure. It is closely connected with information security
    risks which conduct security breaches, security vulnerabilities, and security
    incidents. The agriculture system can get attacked by cyber-attacks in both scale
    and complexity. Whether small-medium-sized agriculture companies are prepared
    well for cybersecurity, there is always a possibility of facing information security
    breaches. It is noticed that the security risk can lead to a production decrease,
    service quality decline, and financial proficiency loss. For sure, information
    security risks also result in the same consequences. Information security risk
    management supplies an essential supplement of ICT in a different sector to improve
    efficiency and proficiency and eliminate the risk and loss of productivity and
    service globally. Therefore, it is necessary to set a series of information security
    standards as much for most people worldwide as the rapid globalization acceleration.
    Such standards as ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E) generally picture the term, processes,
    and technologies for information security risk management. The best solution to
    improve wireless network security is to raise awareness of threats, vulnerabilities,
    and security settings among the players, such as the network users and providers
    [6], which can also be applied to agricultural ICT information security. This
    research aims to clarify that the need for information security risk analysis
    in agriculture and food security is significant and provides useful information
    to people concerned about food security issues. Especially, information security
    risks analysis is needed in the current Industry 4.0 time. A better research structure
    may help to explain the research purpose better, and this research was structured
    as, firstly, identifying the general information security risk analysis in industry
    and organization. Secondly, declare the security risk in agriculture and the information
    security risk in agriculture and smart agriculture. In the end, it was concluded
    that information security risk analysis is significantly needed in agriculture
    and food security, especially in smart agriculture. SECTION II. Literature review
    A. Information security risk analysis in industry and organization The international
    standards give a guideline for information security risk management for any organization
    which considers information security risk according to ISO/IEC 27001, such as
    the general terms, concepts, models, and processes of information security risk
    management. At the same time, the specific information security risk methodologies
    vary in different organizations and sectors. 1) Information security analysis
    According to ISO/IEC 27001, information security risk management offers organizations
    the technologies and principles to protect their digital or any other information,
    which takes into account information security risk analysis. Information security
    mainly includes three basic requirements, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    Information security risk consists of a systematic approach to help the organizations
    meet the information security requirements, which should also be aligned with
    other risk management. Information security management is a continual process
    based on both external and internal factors analysis to give a prediction about
    potential results to reduce the risk that decision-makers can accept. The information
    security risk management process develops from the risk management process, which
    consists of context establishment, risk assessment (risk identification, risk
    analysis, and risk evaluation), risk treatment, and risk acceptance. Risk communication
    and consultation are working along the whole information security risk management
    process with risk monitoring and review. This process is iterative to get risk
    acceptance for the decision-makers. The information security management system
    (ISMS) includes all these process steps. The planning phase in ISMS is establishing
    the context, risk assessment, developing a risk management plan, and risk acceptance.
    In doing the phase of ISMS, it is the implementation of the risk treatment plan.
    The check phase in ISMS is continual monitoring and reviewing of risks. The security
    risk management process is performed in the action phase, and the information
    is maintained and improved. There are types of assets in an organization, primary
    assets (business process, business activities, and information) and supporting
    assets (hardware, software, network, personnel, site, and organizational structure).
    Risk identification declares the areas where the vulnerabilities can harm the
    assets, such as organization, processes and procedures, management routines, personnel,
    physical environment, information system configuration, hardware, software or
    communications equipment, and dependence on external parties. Both quantitative
    and qualitative methodologies or a combination of them can be used as an analysis
    method. After the satisfactory assessment, risk treatment is performed, including
    risk modification, risk retention, risk avoidance, and risk sharing. The application
    of the above options depends on the risk assessment result and the ideal cost
    and benefit of this option. The information security risk acceptance will conduct
    a list of risks that the organization can accept. Risk communication, consultation,
    and risk monitoring and review should be performed between decision-makers and
    stakeholders in all information security risk management activities. 2) The information
    security risk of industry and organization In recent years, ICT has been developing
    rapidly, bringing distinguished outcomes for different industries and organizations.
    The impact of ICT on modern industries is effective as the impact of mechanization
    and electricity in the first and second industrial revolutions. Industry 4.0,
    it is mainly focused on digital manufacturing rely on a huge amount of information
    integrity and information process in production and service. The rapid development
    of new technologies significantly influences the producers and manufacturers to
    improve the efficiency and benefits in service and productivity, along with the
    high risk of security, undoubtedly due to the deep reliance on information technology.
    The usual digital methods in the manufacturing industry include but are not limited
    to the following: cloud-based systems, Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0,
    the so-called Bring Your Own devices (BYOD) and Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)
    trend. As Pereira et al. (2017)[7] explained, organizations and industries have
    higher chances of getting information security risk as it is highly connected
    with digital operations in production and business processes. The cyber-espionage
    could steal confidential information and intellectual property, resulting in a
    direct and profound loss for an enterprise, even a country. For example, the information
    security breaches that happen in some vital enterprises for a country, such as
    the steel industry, could make the country lose its competitiveness and benefits.
    The denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) easily attacks
    the interconnected systems and processes unavailable, resulting in huge financial
    damage for an industry or a company. The major information security risk in the
    supply chain is at the top management level to other processes. And phishing attacks
    and stolen privileged credentials from suppliers can expose the organization to
    huge information and data breaches. Enterprise information security ensures authenticity,
    confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, controllability, and
    reviewability. A computer virus is becoming more and more complicated and converting
    based on the more frequent use of enterprises network and the rapid improvement
    of internet technology. Hacker attacks are also becoming popular among enterprise
    networks. The confidential organization information is stolen for damage purposes
    or occupation by hackers’ attacks. As globalization steps, enterprises are connected
    more and more closely locally and globally, and the spreading process of information
    and confidential data is vulnerable to attacks. Usually, the enterprise information
    system only offers access to a targeted group via some programs. While these programs
    cannot have enough technology to support precise administration, there is no well-structured
    administration system to control different application systems. This lack of identification
    administration directly decreases the security of the enterprise''s confidential
    information and data. B. Information security risk is one of the security risks
    of agriculture and smart agriculture In the agriculture sector, information security
    risk is taking a more vital role in agricultural security risk management as the
    positive adoption of digital technologies in agriculture. In order to gain adequate
    competitiveness and advantage, the agriculture sector must change into a new trend,
    smart agriculture or digital agriculture, which requires the application of ICT
    in planting, production, manufacturing, supply chain, and markets highly. 1) Security
    risk in agriculture As the UN studies predicted, the global population will increase
    obviously in 2050, and the number will get 9.7 billion [8], demanding huge production
    from different sectors. However, food production will be the biggest question
    for the generation. Even though the adoption of ICT has spread widely worldwide,
    agricultural information security management systems have not yet taken full advantage
    of the smart system. It means a huge potential advantage of smart technologies
    will work on agricultural information security protection, prevention of attacks,
    security breaches, and security incidents [9]. According to the review of risk
    types in agriculture from 3283 peer-review studies between 1974 and 2019 by Adam
    et al. (2020)[10], there are mainly five types of risks in the agricultural sector,
    production risk, market risk, institutional risk, personal risk, and financial
    risk. The production risks come from any yield-limiting or yield-reducing natural
    factors, such as the fertilization and availability of soil, the quality and amount
    of water, weather or climate, pest and diseases, and others that can reflect on
    crops and livestock growth. Market risks stem from the volatility of price and
    costs and market access. The unwanted or unexpected policies and regulations related
    to agriculture created institutional risks. Especially the farmers are getting
    more and more connections with institutions and governments. Personal risks are
    related to individual health problems or relationship problems between farmers.
    Financial risks come from the financial sources to support the farm, such as unexpected
    changes in interest rates, credit availability, or credit conditions. The decision-makers''
    success is based on properly coping with different risks separately or jointly.
    The mainly five types of risks in the agricultural sector are capable of resulting
    in unwanted security risks and unexpected information security risks. 2) The information
    security risk of agriculture and smart agriculture The information security risks
    in agriculture come from the five main agricultural risks. For example, Bolek
    et al. (2016)[11] concluded that the information security risk in agriculture
    comes from two aspects, both internal and external factors. The internal factors
    are mainly the human factors and the facilities and equipment within the agriculture
    sector. Firstly, the organization should have enough financial support to find
    the hardware, software, and employee training on information security risk prevention
    and protecting confidential, integrated, and available information. Sufficient
    software, other technical equipment, and proper use are the basic elements of
    information security risk prevention. Even the human factor is regarded as the
    weakest point in information security risk. There also should be a guideline and
    standard for corrective employee attention, knowledge, and behavior in case of
    misuse or ignorance of data. The external factors that cause information security
    risks in agriculture are coming from external certification, legislation, governmental
    support for information security, natural disaster, and third-party service delivery
    failure. And general technological progress brings a big phenomenon to most agriculture
    organizations, following the criteria or the legislation where the business or
    production is the most important part of information security. Even modern ICT
    brings production efficiency, high-quality service, and delight proficiency, all
    of which have security and privacy risks. For example, one of the best uses of
    ICT, IoT, has the challenge of storage and power duration. There is misuse risk
    in IoT, on IoT itself, running applications or devices on IoT, and the tasks conducted
    by IoT [12]. Cloud computing is limited by the delay of communication and security
    risks. Any of them can lead to production decrease and financial loss. Smart Climate
    Agriculture adds a new direction of data security to the above-mentioned thoughts.
    More data, more risk. As agriculture is a multi-participant platform of the economy,
    more risk is going as adopting precision technology. To adopt those technologies
    that are either newly invented or are being utilized in new ways means a task
    for farmers to think, to work, to manage the so complex ‘system’, of their farm
    in another way than they used to. So the role of the human factor should be highlighted
    from the point of view of increasing risk. Higher is the invested capital value
    in the farm, a higher level of knowledge and managerial skills are needed, and
    farming risk is increasing, so the higher the loss can be due to inadequate work.
    All innovative solutions in agriculture should serve sustainable agriculture [13].
    Especially in smart farming, it is highly connected with big data and networks
    to provide practical and efficient measurements for the whole agricultural process.
    Forecasting the development of pests and, thus, the dynamics of potential damage
    is a key issue for the safety of production. The question of input optimization
    is regarded as an economic decision. So forecasting and the "predictive analytics"
    is essentially neutral science that can be used for both good and bad purposes
    [14]. We can state that the Internet and modern technology help both the good
    and the bad. Whoever uses it wisely will be more effective, effective, and visible,
    regardless of intent and moral attitude [15]. However, the high dependence on
    the network, hardware, software use, personnel, sites, and organizational structure
    puts smart farming at a high risk of cyber-attacks and information security breaches.
    Once there is inadequate supervision or control, multiple groups will be implicated
    in cyber-attacks in the smart farming system, such as farmers or agricultural
    producers, logisticians, food production industries, end-uses, governments, and
    even the countries that rely on agriculture. SECTION III. Methodology To better
    understand the importance or necessity of information security risks analysis
    in agriculture and food security, we conducted this research based on a literature
    review and content analysis as the research methodology. SECTION IV. Results A.
    Concluding remark Applying more digitalization farming technologies is not a practice
    in a specific area or a country. It is an evitable but prospective world topic
    for the present and future. We have discussed in the previous research that sophisticated
    technologies, such as 5G and GPS, are efficient catalysts for sustainable agriculture
    [16], maximizing agricultural economic benefits and production and minimizing
    the cost and environmental effects simultaneously. Both technologies in agriculture
    improve efficiency and production by farmland measurement, positioning information
    collection, and matching with intelligent agricultural machinery for the precision
    agriculture industry. However, there are notable threats and risks to the application
    of 5G and GPS, such as passive and active 5G information security attacks (Eavesdropping
    and traffic analysis, Jamming, DoS and DDoS, 5G architecture core networks, Network
    access, Primary infrastructure of information technology (IT) and information
    and communication technology (ICT), Data privacy and security, Authorized communication
    security, Malware Fake Data Security) [17]. Any threat or risks may directly cause
    agricultural loss and waste, which is connected to food security. Regarding food
    security and safety, plant disease is one of the most important factors in decreasing
    yields [18]. The crop disease can be ranged from light symptoms to catastrophic
    food crop destruction, which exacerbates food insecurity, especially amongst the
    COVID-19 pandemic [19], climate change, and the war between Russia and Ukraine
    [20]–[22]. Besides, plant disease threatens human health, national security, and
    the economy of agriculture [18]. Correct and effective plant pathogens identification
    is the fundamental step for disease control. The plant disease problem resulting
    in unexpected yields can be caused by poor management the poor methods to identify
    and quantify the disease outbreak [23]. Early plant disease detection reduces
    the impact on farmers or managers by reducing pesticide use and increasing yields
    and is also good for environmental protection. However, human plant disease diagnosis
    expert is not adapting to modern agricultural requirement, instead the big-data
    time. The Plant-Aid database project in North Carolina bridged the plant disease
    detection data and the farmers or managers and then helped them with the disease
    cause and mitigation strategies on tomato pathogens before the visible symptoms
    came. These plant disease detection data come from disease detection sensors,
    weather, climate information, the spatial location of the fields, and soil moisture
    sensors based on the cloud-based database [24]. The detection, diagnosis, and
    qualification of individual lesion maize were identified by field-based disease
    detection in the Cornell University Musgrave Research Farm in Aurora, NY, with
    95% accuracy in UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) images [25]. The complex plant disease
    identification system data requires stable, reliable, and high throughput hardware
    or software, which also addresses the significance of information security analysis.
    Besides the begging step of the food supply chain, information security in agricultural
    production is very important for ensuring food security in the present and future.
    Food industrial processing, as one of the five main players in the food supply
    chain, also accounts for food security. As we emphasized in previous research,
    industrial safety guarantees not only the organization''s business but also the
    workers’ safety and health [26]. Well-structured information security ensures
    food security during the whole manufacturing process, such as food industrial
    facility design, food industrial technical safety, food processing materials safety,
    food industrial occupational safety, food industrial fire protection, and food
    industrial environmental protection. Nevertheless, the more use of high data-based
    technologies in agriculture, the more risk there is. There would be profound terrible
    loss or bad effects if the misuse or any information security risks happened.
    As the old saying says, Fire and Water Are Good Servants but Bad Masters. B. limitations
    and suggestions In this globalization world, it is more local because of the information
    boom. As it is described in Hungarian Food Chain Safety Strategy 2013-2022 [27],
    [pp. 2013–2022], food chain safety differs from traditional and modern food safety.
    It over highlighted the safety issues in the whole food chain, from "soil to table".
    In food chain safety, information and communication technology is used in the
    logistician step and in food production, food-producing, market, and consumption.
    However, due to paper length limitations, we can not go into detail to understand
    how important information security risk analysis is for a region, a country, and
    the world food supply and food security. Therefore this limitation of our current
    research also shows a future way for other researchers concerned about how we
    can feed our future generation and us. SECTION V. Conclusion The adoption of ICT
    in the agricultural sector comes together with many information security risks.
    Identifying and analyzing the information security risks in the agricultural sector
    is the important first step to minimizing the loss or cost of information security
    risk and promoting the benefit in the agricultural sector, especially in the smart
    farming sector, which closely relies on ICT to work. Authors References Citations

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: A novel idea called “smart farming” aims
    to increase the productivity and effectiveness of agriculture by utilizing cutting-edge
    information technologies. Using the most recent developments in automation, artificial
    intelligence, and networking, farmers are better able to keep an eye on every
    step of the process and apply exact treatments selected by machines with superhuman
    accuracy. With an expanding global population comes a rise in the need for both
    employment and food. The farmers'' traditional practices fell short of meeting
    these demands. New automated methods were consequently proposed. These innovative
    techniques satisfied the world''s food needs while also creating jobs for billions
    of people. For effective farm management, a variety of techniques are utilized,
    including IoT, cloud computing, AI, machine learning, deep learning, big data,
    etc. Deep learning is one of these, and it is a developing field of study for
    crop yield forecasting. Engineers, data scientists, and farmers are still developing
    methods to optimize the amount of human labor needed in agriculture. As key information
    sources improve, smart farming transforms into a learning system that grows smarter
    every day. Artificial neural network principles are used in a machine learning
    method known as deep learning. The depth of deep learning networks, which also
    allows them to detect latent structures in unlabeled, unstructured data, is what
    sets them apart from neural networks. Compared to ML techniques, deep learning
    networks that automatically extract features without human involvement have a
    considerable advantage. In this research, we suggest a recommendation model and
    an algorithm to assess crop yield in the upcoming year. We have contrasted the
    deep learning algorithm with the random forest machine learning algorithm. These
    algorithms have been the subject of a brief comparison. Python has been used to
    implement the suggested model. Published in: 2022 2nd Odisha International Conference

    Conference Location: Bhubaneswar, India SECTION I. Introduction Since classical
    times, farming has been the foundation of our nation. Contemporarily, climate
    change is a very common occurrence. Monitoring meteorological parameters as a
    result makes it challenging to develop crops [1]. Researchers ought to employ
    technology to discover or examine agricultural features to assist farmers in producing
    crops effectively, and fertilizer is one of the most important factors in doing
    so. [2]. The soil''s fertility may be lost if fertilizer is administered inadvertently
    or excessively in the field, and the crop may fail to give the desired results.
    Fertilizer thus becomes a crucial factor [3]. Understanding temperature conditions
    is crucial for India since crop forecasting can boost the country''s economy.
    Deep learning, a method of machine learning, is built on artificial neural networks.
    In contrast to neural networks, deep networks are more complex. Before the big
    data era, the majority of machine learning algorithms were used in shallow architecture.
    These structures frequently feature up to two layers that contain nonlinear transformations.
    Shallow architectures excel at solving issues that have a clear structure, but
    they struggle to handle more complex real-world data applications like images,
    language, human speech, and other natural sounds. These data could be processed
    thanks to deep learning. Several techniques are used to turn the client''s raw
    data toward informative material. Agriculture can also benefit from this research.
    The local farmers projected a higher production for the forthcoming season based
    on their vast field expertise with particular crops. They still don''t get compensated
    fairly for their harvests, though. It usually happens as a result of poor crop
    choices or insufficient irrigation, although it can also happen when crop yields
    are lower than anticipated. Because of many points, the majority of farmers do
    not achieve the anticipated Crop yield. The ideal crop can be predicted using
    the agricultural yield data set, which consists of some different elements, by
    investigating the soil and environment for a particular place to maximize crop
    production. One of the main advantages of our research is that it will aid farmers
    because of our prognosis. Identify the best crops for their land depending on
    the soil type, pH level, and nutrient use [4]. The internet of things (IoT) is
    cutting-edge technology in the digital era, where gadgets communicate with one
    another and processes are automated and controlled using the internet. The use
    of IoT in agriculture has some advantages in terms of crop management and monitoring.
    In this study, an architectural framework for integrating the internet of things
    (IoT) with crop production is built, and various metrics and methods for monitoring
    crops utilizing fog computing are used. The approach enables real-time analysis
    of data obtained from sensors installed in crops and gives a result for the farmer
    that is required for crop growth monitoring, saving the farmer time and energy.
    The information captured in the fields is stored in the fog and analyzed to allow
    for automation through the use of IoT devices. The outcome of the prediction will
    be saved in the cloud layer. The notion provided within this research has the
    potential to boost crop output by reducing resource waste in agriculture settings.
    This experiment''s findings provide information on the field''s temperature, soil
    moisture, humidity, and water use, as well as an analysis of the farmer''s decisions
    [5], [6]. Based on a farmer''s recent experience, previous yield projections have
    occasionally been off, but times have changed so quickly. Machine learning algorithms
    typically forecast the yield''s most effective output. The difficulty lies in
    creating the most effective model to forecast the crop''s output, so test out
    many algorithms, compare them all, and decide which one has the least error and
    loss. That model will then be chosen to forecast the crop''s yield. This research
    compares the two algorithms and forecasts the results from the best model among
    those two. The remainder of the work is organized as follows: It has covered some
    earlier research in this area under Section 2. The dataset used in this study
    and the project''s functioning concept is included in Section 3''s background
    study material, and Section 4''s performance analyses and comparisons of results
    are described. A summary of the findings and recommendations for further research
    are included in Section 5 to conclude the project. SECTION II. Literature Survey
    A crucial role is played by Big Data technologies in the growth of Smart agriculture
    where machines are outfitted with a variety of sensors that collect information
    about their surroundings and use it to determine how they should behave. A thermostat,
    for example, which modulates temperature, is an example of a relatively easier
    feedback mechanism. Deep learning methods are also used (e.g. to implement the
    right crop protection strategy) [6]. The nation''s economy is mostly dependent
    on agriculture; the principal industry is agriculture, which is also completely
    essential to rural livelihood. Approximately 70% of the earliest and lower sectors
    are focused on cultivation. Surprisingly, despite being the least digitalized
    sector; the development and commercialization of agricultural technology have
    gained traction. To enhance their farming operations, many farmers are starting
    to use modern tools and techniques to enhance their farming operations subsequently
    [7]. Smart agriculture is the application of cutting-edge technologies, such as
    the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, GPS, Cloud Computing, and Artificial Intelligence,
    to traditional agriculture (AI). At the target locations, such as farms, greenhouses,
    forest gardens, and pastures, an intelligent agricultural IoT -enabled embedded
    system with a configurable number of sensors can be utilized to gather information
    on farming breeding or planting in real-time [8]. The method used in the process
    helps producers determine a crop to grow in a particular location at a particular
    time and estimate its profitability. By indicating if the crop is valuable, it
    gives details. For this, farmers can save effort by using this technology to help
    them make decisions. In this research, researchers examined various typical implications
    for cloud computing-based agriculture IoT sensor monitoring network technologies.
    Studying these numerous technology and promoting sustainable smart agriculture
    are the goals of this survey [9]. According to the authors, agro-related variables
    including temperature, humidity, soil PH, soil nutrition levels, water level,
    etc. are continuously evaluated using the precision agriculture sensor monitoring
    network. Thanks to the Internet of Things, farmers can now remotely monitor and
    assess their crops and machinery using smartphones and computers. To predict agricultural
    output, regression analysis has been used as a predictive modeling technique.
    The regression methods used were Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Multiple
    Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regression. These results imply that Random
    Forest Regression can be used to accurately predict wheat, rice, and maize yields
    [10]. In addition to machine learning, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Polynomial
    Regression, the authors also used other techniques. The Random Forest algorithm
    outperforms the various methods in terms of yield estimation, following their
    suggested methodology. The decision tree model looks for efficiency that suggests
    changes in the dataset, like the random forest, polynomial regression, and other
    systems. They concluded that the suggested model performs better at predicting
    agricultural output than the current framework. The aforementioned strategy will
    be implemented, assisting in the advancement of agricultural practices in our
    nation [11]. Farmers can utilize them to raise agricultural output and reduce
    losses. Farmers can use it to reduce their losses and increase crop yields. Combining
    horticulture, sericulture, and other fields can boost our nation''s agricultural
    productivity. According to a literature review, Machine Learning has been used
    to forecast agricultural output and soil nutrient levels. Random forest optimization
    produces the most accurate and error-free predictions. We compared Random forest
    to a backpropagation algorithm and produced a more accurate forecast. SECTION
    III. Materials and Methods The objective of the proposed system model is to assist
    farmers in farming for greater yields. The seeds picked for this project are essential
    plants from a specific area. The following crops have been selected: rice, jowar,
    wheat, soybean, sunflower, cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, onion, and dry chili. Data
    on crop yields were acquired during the last five years from a variety of sources.
    There are three steps in the suggested work. Soil characterization: Data on soil
    nutrients can be used to categorize soils. Backpropagation and the Random Forest
    machine learning algorithm Soil characterization is done using big data techniques.
    The two algorithms will sort the data into categories and display the confusion
    matrix, average values, and accuracy percentage. Prediction of crop yield: Crop
    production can be anticipated using the information on location. Locational factors,
    and crop yield: Random Forest and backpropagation techniques are used to process
    these data. Based on the most recent data, this approach will forecast crops.
    Recommendation of fertilizer: Based on fertilizer crop and regional information,
    fertilizer recommendations can be created. The appropriate crops and fertilizer
    for each crop are suggested in this section. A. Methodology Crop production forecasts
    and recommendations for the amount of fertilizer to use to achieve the desired
    crop output are created using an efficient algorithm. Data collection that is
    typical of the experiment is used. We could create a model and train it to predict
    production using this data. We can also estimate the number of fertilizers needed
    to produce the desired yield. The quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus are the
    input parameters, while the recommended dosage for each fertilizer is the output.
    Initializing all the specifics is equivalent to initializing all the significant
    variables in this data set to the desired value for the operation. The starting
    values for each of the crop names in this metadata will be 1. This information
    facilitates our usage of the data in the algorithm. Each crop''s metadata is listed
    with an international number. This number cannot be applied to a later crop in
    the same way it was applied to the first crop since it is universal. This database
    includes data on more than a hundred different crops that are produced all over
    India. Crop production forecasts and recommendations for the amount of fertilizer
    to use to achieve the desired crop output are created using an efficient algorithm.

    specifics of the proposed work''s workflow in detail. The administrator will initially
    gather the Agri data set''s historical data. The data will then be stored in the
    database. The two algorithms, Random Forest ML and Backpropagation, will then
    retrieve this data to make predictions. The recommendation model generates an
    accurate graph in addition to recommending the crop and soil nutrients. The database
    will store the graph for potential usage in the future. The model will then generate
    the output, which the user will then receive. Fig. 1 Architecture of the proposed
    system Show All Back Propagation, the algorithm we provide, yields reliable results.
    The dataset must have the required output attribute for backpropagation algorithm
    training to use our suggested approach. Before back-propagating the error and
    altering the weights between the nodes in the layers and bias based on the comparison,
    the backpropagation method computes the result and compares it to the predicted
    output. The backpropagation approach is demonstrated by fixing the output value
    or attribute to the dataset that needs to be learned. As a result, until the desired
    result is obtained, the network is trained through repeated iterations. Using
    the test dataset, the network model is tested and generalized after training to
    determine whether the prediction was accurate. After the network model has been
    validated, predictions may be made by feeding it unknown input and extrapolating
    the model''s output from the unknown data. Figure 2 depicts the work''s flow.

    soil nutrient label and crop yield Step - 1: Begin; Step - 2: Take into account
    a training set of m observations; Step - 3: From m observations, produce t bootstrap
    sets of size n each; Step - 4: If n=m, then each set will have 63 % original observations
    and the remaining 34 % will be duplicates; Step - 5: Out-of-bag (OOB) observations
    are non- selected training observations; Step - 6: Base learners can identify
    mistakes from OOB observation; Step - 7: With the aid of bootstrap training sets,
    create t Models; Step - 8: A prediction may be made by any basic learner; Step
    - 9: A majority vote on the base learners'' predictions is taken to aggregate
    their predictions; Step - 10: End; Fig. 2 Flow chart of the proposed system Show
    All SECTION IV. Result and Discussion To comprehend the agricultural production
    analysis, this research uses both the Random Forest method and the Backpropagation
    approach. These models were tested with several crop kinds in various Indian locales
    to predict the output. To calculate how much phosphorus and nitrogen are required
    for the area of land, the backpropagation algorithm was trained on and used to
    evaluate fertilizer data. The output prediction and other error rate-related aspects
    of the two crop production models were compared. We examined the error rates found
    when contrasting the random forest technique and backpropagation to anticipate
    the output for both models. The compassion is represented in the graph when it
    was discovered that the random forest approach had a lower error rate than backpropagation.
    Accuracy is one of the factors considered while rating a classification model
    [12], [13]. Accuracy is calculated by dividing the total number of recommendations
    by the number of accurate forecasts [14], [15]. Accuracy=N o.of CorrectPredictions/TotalNo.of
    Predictions (4) View Source It is evident from Table 1 that our suggested method
    outperforms the Random Forest ML technique in terms of accuracy while determining
    crop yield. The accuracy comparison of two algorithms, random forest, and backpropagation,
    is shown in Fig. 3. It is evident that backpropagation outperforms random forest.
    Table I. Comparison table Fig. 3. Accuracy comparison. Show All The comparison
    of the error rates of the two methods is shown in Fig. 4. The Back Propagation
    does well in terms of mistake rate. Fig. 4. Error rate comparison. Show All A
    crop-by-crop yield analysis that considers the yield of each crop is shown in
    Fig. 5. The fertilizer suggestion, as in Fig. 5, suggests the appropriate crops
    and the required fertilizer for each crop. As shown via third-party APIs, it also
    presents the weather information for the selected location first. Fig. 5. Crop
    wise yield analysis. Show All SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Scope Higher crop
    output is attainable, as shown by the ability to anticipate agricultural yield
    based on geography and the successful application of algorithms. In the investigation
    indicated above, Back Propagation outperforms Random forest for soil classification,
    with an accuracy rate of 98 percent. The Back Propagation has a 98% accuracy rate
    for predicting crop yields in comparison to the Random Forest. The work can be
    improved by including the following features. Mobile apps that help farmers can
    be developed by sharing photographs of fields. Crop diseases are discovered using
    image processing, and the user is given insecticides based on the disease images.
    To boost output, farms should adopt a smart irrigation system. Authors Figures

    in agri-food supply chains. Abstract The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to
    the term "Industry 4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the
    origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept
    of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry
    2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution
    by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including
    and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well
    as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit
    real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge
    is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised
    within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply
    chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain
    is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the
    domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and
    has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition,
    electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several
    agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals
    and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use
    of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains
    performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved
    and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance
    in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support
    a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to
    farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore,
    in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the
    new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand
    the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. Previous article in issue Next article

    dataBlockchainArtificial intelligence 1. Introduction Small farms are the engine
    to support rural employment and to make a considerable contribution to territorial
    development. Even though they have always been considered a cornerstone of agricultural
    activity in the European Union (EU), this sector most often suffers from very
    low efficiency and effectiveness, sensitivity to weather, market disruptions and
    other external factors, such as poor agriculture supply chain stakeholders’ linkages
    and communication, especially at the food processing level. In fact, and as stablished
    by the FAO,1 under an approach from “field to fork” the agriculture supply chain
    structures can also be named Agri-Food supply chains, where main events coming
    from the agricultural production of food to the food processing events, including
    trading, are linked. Across this Agri-Food Supply Chain, in most of the cases,
    the transferred agriculture knowledge, from generation to generation, is paramount
    from a cultural point of view, but most of the time, it does not answer to the
    needs nor the requirements of the Agri-Food Supply Chains. Furthermore, such delineation
    does not exist also between farms as economic units and farmers who are producing
    food, mostly, for their own consumption. However, no formal delineation to what
    is a “small” and/or a “large” farm formally exists that is holistically accepted,
    it depends on several factors, such as countries, regions, politics, strategies,
    market shares amongst many others. Nonetheless, there are two criteria to classify
    farm size: standard output (in economic terms) and utilised agricultural area
    (UAA), as alternative measure2 . In this same line, Eurostat3 predicts that, by
    2026, an increment of 4%–6% in agriculture cost savings, as well as an increment
    of 3 % in market value, will be regarded to the use and development of smart agriculture.
    Hence, “Agriculture 4.0″ emerges to provide advanced technologies to the famers
    in order to meet agri-food production challenges, hence, to achieve more affordable
    prices for open market and the minimum cost for farmers. Thus, the expectation
    for the further coming years, is that Agri-Food 4.0 should help meeting sustainable
    challenges by increasing the agri-food supply chain stakeholders revenues as well
    as decreasing their pressure for handling complex and external factors they cannot
    control, such as weather, market behaviours and policies, but also to react on
    time by visualising current trends in needs. This paper focus principally on the
    factory farm model issued from the European and north American style. In those
    typologies of farms the Industry 4.0 elements can be introduced and merged with
    the agricultural domain to create the Agri-Food 4.0. The focus is more specialised
    on the industrial farming although the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted
    also to the organic and silvo-pasture paradigms. Thus, this paper, considering
    a review over than two hundred papers, provides a contribution to knowledge by
    establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies and Agri-Food
    Supply Chain Challenges, which opens the 4.0 research field for a multidisciplinary
    work. The choice of the literature review methodology focused firstly on key words
    related to the Agri-food technology, then the second approach was to focus on
    selected journals and at the end we looked for the data-based repository and the
    linked publications. To accomplish this, the structure in this paper is as follows:
    in the first place, a compressive state of the art of Agri-Food 4.0 related technologies
    is covered. In the second place, a review and contribution coming from digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food shows linkages with
    next trends and technologies. Next, and linked to the agri-food supply chain challenges,
    the fourth section presents new trends and models in agri-food supply chains,
    especially in the domain of risk management, collaboration, governance, cold chain
    management, globalization, information and communication technologies, Logistics,
    supply chain structures and sustainable agri-food supply chains. Finally, the
    fifth section covers the main conclusions, visions and perspectives for this novel
    research. 2. Agri-food 4.0 and technologies state-of-the-art The agricultural
    sector has been active in digital innovation for decades already. Especially the
    advances in Precision Agriculture, remote sensing, robots, farm management information
    systems, and (agronomic) decision support systems have paved the way for a broad
    digital transformation in farming and food (Pedro and Gonzalez-Andujar, 2019).
    Recent developments, such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain,
    Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, allow for the integration of so far isolated
    lines of development into smart, connected systems of systems. Those technologies
    will let the agriculture to evolve in a data-driven, intelligent, agile and autonomous
    connected system of systems. The operations of each agricultural process will
    be automatically integrated in the food chain through the semantically active
    technologies up to the end consumer. The 4th industrial revolution is now reaching
    agriculture. The digital platform (DP) concept emerged as an integration of heterogeneous
    mainly open software solutions for ecosystem building (Yablonsky, 2018). The EU
    promote the creation of digital platforms for several application domains as manufacturing
    (i.e. FoF 11 – 2016 projects, DT-ICT-07-2018-2019, etc.), construction (BIM + calls),
    etc. As a concentration of technology enablers, research on DP covers several
    issues such as software engineering (Guertin and Van Benthem, 2016; Wang et al.,
    2006), process simulation and development (Zhao and Yao, 2016; Hu et al., 2016),
    features analysis (Wang et al., 2014), resource performance (Mocnej et al., 2018),
    test algorithms (Santiago et al., 2017) or performance control (Sahota et al.,
    2011). The technological platforms allow access to the different stakeholders
    and provide deployment capabilities for IT solutions. These solutions are exposed
    by service providers or developed by software engineers. Agricultural Data management
    and exploitation is the central node between digital transformation capabilities
    and the agriculture concerns. The main research issues concern the consolidation
    of data repositories with open data (Gumaste and Kadam, 2016) (weather, maps,
    etc.), governance data (policies, local regulation, etc.) and domain specific
    data from end users. Data typology is very rich (land, location, energy, climate,
    climate impact, etc.) and data volume is continually increasing by the integration
    of sensors and IoT platforms in agriculture (Amandeep et al., 2017; Biradar and
    Shabadi, 2017). Data engineering effort covers pattern definition (Laube et al.,
    2011; Spekken et al., 2016), classification algorithms (Narvaez et al., 2018;
    Shi et al., 2015; Yalcin and Razavi, 2016), correlation analysis (Nilsson et al.,
    2016; Xavier et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2017), etc. All those technologies provide
    engineering capabilities for agricultural data. The implementation of these techniques
    will handle farmers data, will integrate new data repositories from external providers,
    will transform data to knowledge and feed decision support systems. The data transparency
    enabler with necessary sharing policies will accelerate data ingestion and ejection
    processes. 2.1. Big data technologies Research activities in Big Data provide
    relevant results in several application domains (healthcare, marketing, maritime,
    urban, manufacturing, etc.). The Big Data Value Association (BDVA)4 promote the
    application of bigdata in different domains (Belaud et al., 2019). The Big Data
    Grapes EU project5 provides data semantic, analytics, integration and exploitation
    solutions as well as a software stack for grapes agriculture. As additional ongoing
    research issues, we identified tools and technology development (Devarakonda et
    al., 2014; Hashem and Ranc, 2016), analytic methods and services (Malhotra et
    al., 2017; Deka and Walczak, 2017), clustering methods (Balan et al., 2015), transformation
    algorithms (Penar and Wilczek, 2016; Hashem and Ranc, 2016) performance and data
    processing technics (Wu and Zhao, 2009), data source and storage management (Cha
    et al., 2018; RubyDinakar and Vagdevi, 2017), etc. The integration of Big Data
    technologies in Agri-Food projects plays an important role in: the extension of
    farmers data to create new knowledge; the creation of innovative services and
    processes by IT providers and software developers as well as the extension and
    the adaptation of ICT and Factories of the Future (FoF)6 related Big Data models
    and patterns for agriculture. There are several Big Data Repositories that guarantee,
    nowadays, the access and the exploitation to Agri-Food data. As example: the “National
    Climatic Data Centre” (about 2,9 Go per day); Satellite Imagery and metrological
    information from Google and the NASA Earth Exchange; Soil, water and geospatial
    data from the National Resources Conservation Service (US); the OpenCorporates
    as the world’s largest open repository of companies (165 million companies around
    the word); etc. 2.2. Internet of things technologies The integration of IoT platforms
    in agriculture provides additional data sources describing agricultural features
    (water, soil, humans, animals, etc.) with more data. The recent research issues
    on IoT highlight the multiplication of IoT platforms. This expansion generates
    new implementation frameworks (Lee et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018) answering
    to different requirement models, new networks of heterogeneous components and
    sensors with different monitoring models (Pflanz et al., 2018; Vergara et al.,
    2017; Prathibha et al., 2017), time processing scheme and misbalanced energy consumption
    (Ruano et al., 2018; Jarolimek et al., 2016). The integration of the IoT platforms
    with the agricultural issues could add additional research challenges, specifically
    when the data are stocked or used in the cloud, in terms of interoperability (Panetto,
    2007; Mocnej et al., 2018; Zarko et al., 2017; Hefnawy et al., 2017; Martinez
    et al., 2016; Leal et al., 2019; Panetto et al., 2016) (protocols, security, etc.),
    performance monitoring (Paulraj et al., 2018; Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017), etc.
    In addition, IoT serves Robotics (Murar and Brad, 2015) and Automated Guided Vehicles
    (AGV) (Sanchez-Hermosilla et al., 2013). An interesting activity might be the
    benchmarking of all the existing IoT platforms and their proposed functionalities
    and mapping them with Agri-Food stakeholders’ requirements. The integration of
    IoT capabilities will support farmers in the harvesting of new data sources to
    create new valuable services. 2.3. Knowledge model approaches The development
    of valuable knowledge models in agriculture aims to transform shared multi-sources
    data repositories to create profitable services and support the decision making
    for different stakeholders. Recent research topics address precise data collection
    and engineering to serve knowledge creation of new farming models (Abdullah et
    al., 2017; Irmak et al., 2006), technology application in farming (Chen and Jin,
    2011; Gerhards et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2013), resource allocation (Garcia
    et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2017; Musacchio and Grant, 2002), assessment frameworks
    (for risk, policies definition and quality management) (Jacxsens et al., 2016;
    Louwagie et al., 2012) as well as the qualification of decision models (Costanzo
    and Faro, 2012; Dragincic et al., 2015) and the identification of decision parameters
    (region, land, climate, plant, time, process, etc.). 2.4. Artificial intelligence
    techniques Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques propose important contributions
    to knowledge model’s identification, service creation and the decision-making
    processes as support for the different Agri-Food’s applications (Solemane et al.,
    2019). AI offers formal general algorithms for prediction (Bhatt and Buch, 2015;
    Soh et al., 2018), accuracy and performance evaluation (Jeon et al., 2017) as
    well as pattern classification (Ott et al., 2003; Pinho et al., 2011; Starr, 2005)
    that might solve knowledge issues in the agricultural domain such as the pest’s
    identifications and the correct treating methods. In addition, AI supports applications
    in farming technics development: land allocation regarding the targeted activity
    (Pokhrel et al., 2018), irrigation process analysis and control (Ait-Mouheb et
    al., 2018; Mohanraj et al., 2017), robot guidance (Tian et al., 2018; Roshanianfard
    et al., 2018; Sheridan, 2016), etc. 2.5. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture emerges
    as a main concept in Agri-Food 4.0. By integrating new technology enablers propelled
    by the Industry 4.0 paradigm (Annosi et al., 2019), smart agriculture addresses
    important farming objectives as water saving (O’Connor and Mehta, 2016), soil
    conservation (Li et al., 2002), limit carbon emission (Ochoa et al., 2014) and
    productivity increasing (Mayer et al., 2015) by doing more with less. The new
    agricultural age aims to harmonize and share better local European policies and
    rules to scale the best farming practices and applications. Smart agriculture
    offers the opportunity to farmers, technology and service providers, governance
    agencies and other impacted stakeholders (financial organization, investors, traders,
    etc.) to share their experiences and preoccupations in the optimization in the
    farming Supply Chain with the close respect of production sustainability (Swisher
    et al., 2018; Oberholster et al., 2015). 2.6. Precision farming techniques and
    robot development The Precision Farming topic is already covered by other H2020
    calls (SFS-05-2017, SFS-06-2018-2020, SFS-08-2018-2019, etc.). The analysis of
    released projects outcomes and related research issues allows to identify new
    technologies, processes and applications in agriculture. Relevant models are proposed
    for land, grain and arable related activities (Gumma et al., 2016). Relevant listed
    results cover harvesting distribution accuracy (Roshanianfard et al., 2018; Kamata
    et al., 2018; Alzahrani, 2018), cost development (Pomar et al., 2010) and distribution
    optimization (Zhou et al., 2018; Tabatabaie et al., 2013; Ruiz-Garcia et al.,
    2010; Eisele et al., 2001). Within the Agri-Food projects is planned to reuse
    available precision farming technologies and results to improve the quality of
    targeted farmers’ processes and applications. Results in the integration of robots
    in agriculture are well mature and already proposed by Agri-Food stakeholders.
    With precision farming enablers, it will be ensured the performance of impacted
    farming processes. Agriculture Robots are already investigated in the precision
    farming topic. Recent research in this area covers the adaptability of robot design
    to the agriculture sector, the improvement of navigation conditions through additional
    sensing (Liu et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2017; Jhonattan et al., 2019) and localization
    capabilities as well as real-time image processing (Xu et al., 2017; Pilli et
    al., 2015) and camera detection (Dworak et al., 2013) to maximize the operational
    capabilities and behaviour of robots and collaborative robots (cobots). Robots
    can assist humans (Chilcanan et al., 2017; Dondeynaz et al., 2013) for difficult
    tasks or replace them for difficult ones. The cost reduction (Pomar et al., 2010)
    effectiveness is demonstrated and research in decision error reduction (Montecinos
    et al., 2018; Shin and Ko, 2017; Brigido et al., 2015) is intensive to improve
    accuracy by simulation (Xu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Latorre-Biel et al.,
    2018) and by more precise path finding (Spekken et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 2017)
    and guidance algorithms (Kviz et al., 2014; Baio, 2012). The new Agri-Food projects
    fund the integration of Agriculture Robots to support the applications since the
    beginning to ensure the maximum results. Building resilient and sustainable farming
    system is the ultimate concept behind Agriculture 4.0. Recent research in this
    topic covers farming processes sustainability analysis (McGuire and Sperling,
    2013; Joly, 2005), farming activity calibration (Suryoputro et al., 2017; Hosseini
    et al., 2014; do Nascimento et al., 2012) (rotation cycles, control of accuracy),
    the development of conservation protocols (Kladivko et al., 2014; Gaspary et al.,
    2002) and the alignment of business development strategies. 3. How the new digital
    technology transforms the agri-food supply chains To achieve robust, resilient
    and sustainable agri-food supply chains is very complex because they face more
    sources of uncertainty and risks in comparison with other supply chains that give
    rise to serious questions and concerns about their economic, environmental and
    social performance. Several studies identify agricultural sources of uncertainty
    (Mundi et al., 2019; Esteso et al., 2017; Esteso et al., 2018) and how to model
    them (Grillo et al., 2019). In Esteso et al. (2018) four types of crop-based uncertainty
    are identified: Product (shelf-life, deterioration rate, lack of homogeneity,
    food quality and food safety), Process (harvesting yield, supply lead time, resource
    needs, production), Market (demand, market prices) and Environment (weather, pests
    & diseases and regulations). Poor management of these sources of uncertainty can
    have a very negative impact on safety, quality, quantity and waste of products
    as well as human, technological and natural resources. Indeed, the agri-food sector
    is one of the economic and political areas worldwide, with key implications in
    sustainability to cover not only the food needs of the population, contribute
    to their employability and economic growth, but also in the impact on the natural
    environment (Iakovou et al., 2014). Therefore, the agri-food supply chains are
    strongly pressured to manage these sources of uncertainty and risks whose precise
    evolution over time is unknown but may jeopardize the future sustainability of
    these type of supply chains. It is necessary to move away from “business as usual”
    developing new solutions and implement innovative technologies (FAO, 2018). Along
    these lines, a digitalized supply chain, allows companies to monitor material
    flows in real time making potential risks visible and develop future plans to
    face them. The main drivers for the digitalization of the processes of SC are
    usually the increase of the flexibility and the speed of reaction of the industrial/logistical
    systems (ten Hompel and Henke, 2017a, ten Hompel and Henke, 2017b) as well as
    the improvement of agri-food supply chain robustness and resilience. In this context,
    data becomes crucial. Data is the lifeblood of any business and the agricultural
    business is not an exception but rather a referent. The new technologies have
    a great impact on the reduction of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise
    data in real time, whose treatment, together with the capacities of autonomous
    and intelligent decision making will help to increase the efficiency, sustainability,
    flexibility, agility, and the resilience along the whole supply chain from the
    farmers to the final customers. In the context of data-driven supply chains, the
    new technologies listed in the previous section, provide different and complementary
    support to the sequence of activities from data chain (Wolfert et al., 2017):
    data capture, storage, transfer, transformation, analytics and marketing. The
    support of each technology to different data chain activities lets envisage that
    the true potential of the data comes from the combination and integration of these
    technologies. Indeed, each one will improve some of the following basic functions
    of agri-food supply chains: sensing, monitoring, control, analysis (descriptive
    capabilities), prediction (predictive capabilities), decision-making (prescriptive
    capabilities) and adaptive learning. Through the sensing, monitoring, control
    and analysis it is possible to the early and accurate detection of problems and
    even predicting them before occurring, making better decisions and learn of them
    improving the sustainability and resilience of agri-food supply chains. In fact,
    the integration of previous technologies allows a more intelligent management
    of the agri-food supply chains, being able to combine multiple models of independent
    data analysis, repositories of historical data and data flows in real time. Real-time
    information and data processing tools provide new opportunities for companies
    to react more quickly to changing conditions in the supply chain. Due to this
    integrated intelligence, the agri-food supply chain management goes from supporting
    decisions to delegating them and, ultimately, to predicting which decisions should
    be taken. From all the above, there is no doubt that these new technologies are
    transforming the way agricultural sector organize and make decisions. In order
    to provide a general overview about how the new digital technology transforms
    the agri-food supply chains, the tables (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) integrate
    and classify the main positive impacts of the most relevant technologies as well
    as the challenges to be faced according to recent studies in the field carried
    by different authors. Table 1. IoT: Impact and Challenges. Internet of Things

    private or permissioned blockchains and strong encryption, there are still cyber
    security concerns that need to be addressed before the general public will entrust
    their personal data to a blockchain solution. • Throughput and latency issue:
    in the context of agri-food Supply Chain management, due to the original restriction
    of block size and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current
    processing capacity of blockchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing
    millions of transactions in real-time • Infrastructure and capacity development

    more value and insights from data) • Valence (support of connectivity in data).
    The potential of connectivity between systems is being constrained by a lack of
    common data standards or easy-to-use ontologies. • Combine the three levels of

    further facilitate additional developments on visualization • AI algorithms designed
    for single-machine environments might have emergent subproblem structures useful
    for parallelization. • Adding speech interface to the system may be proved to
    be more beneficial for the farmers of the remote area • Expert systems will not
    be able to give the creative responses that human experts can give in unusual
    circumstances. • Lack of flexibility and ability to adapt to changing environments.
    • Not being able to recognize when no answer is available. • Knowledge acquisition
    remains the major bottleneck in applying expert system technology to new domains.
    • Maintenance and extension of a rule base can be difficult for a relatively large
    rule base • Enhance IoT with machine learning techniques to analyse data captured
    by sensors in real time in agriculture. As it can be seen in the above tables,
    some challenges of these digital technologies appear as strengths of others. This
    allows intuiting the suitability of using them as complements with the others.
    Indeed, in the near future, the full potential of data will rely on the combination
    of the different technologies that enhance data-driven agri-food supply chains
    more informed, efficient, secure, sustainable and resilient. For instance, IoT
    and BDA can benefit from blockchain providing data security, anonymity, trust
    and decentralization. Since blockchain exchange information in a distributed network,
    novel IoT applications will be developed for distributed environments. On the
    other side, the valuable data generated from the IoT could enrich transaction
    details that are registered on the blockchain (Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018).
    In turn, the accurate data provided by blockchain technology can be used as input
    for AI applications and to also record their outputs (Rabah et al., 2018). Besides,
    AI can enhance IoT by developing applications to analyse data captured by sensors
    in real time using machine learning algorithms (Reshma and Pillai, 2018). Machine
    learning and other analytic methods can also improve predictive and prescriptive
    capabilities (decision making) of Big Data Analytics. There is a broad consensus
    on the need to strengthen research and innovation in the Agri-food sector, both
    in terms of practices and technologies, through the creation of new products,
    the improvement of processes, services or processes or the integration of digital
    possibilities. Indeed, one of the persisting challenges to take advantage of the
    full potential of the data is to achieve not only the integration of these technologies
    but also their interoperability. Diversity of stakeholders integrating agri-food
    supply chains with different interests and characteristics make difficult to find
    solutions that fit all those involved, so group decision-making tools should be
    developed (Zaraté et al., 2019). Moreover, when these solutions require significant
    investments and there are stakeholders, such as small farmers with a limited budget.
    For this reason, it will be key to demonstrate the value of innovations as compared
    to their companies and to collect and exchange data. Other challenges reside on
    the needs of data standards. The standardization of the fruition data would provide
    equity for all stakeholders because of the possibility to access to the same information
    that might provide financial gain. The fruition data might provide the training
    for ensuring the availability of the required technical skills and definition
    of regulatory actions by governments. Research may be co-financed with partners
    private (e.g., companies or business groups), government (many departments and
    agencies involved) or institutional (e. g. universities). This approach accentuates
    the effect leverage government support and improve the transfer of innovations
    to businesses. It enables the training of highly qualified personnel and a new
    generation of scientists for companies and centres of research. The stability
    of funding agreements with the centres promote the retention of their qualified
    staff and facilitate partnerships with industry for the realization of structuring
    projects. Access to appropriate funding and research tax credits and development
    (R&D) is also a source of funding structuring for the industry to absorb financial
    risks generated by innovation activities (Tuhin et al., 2019). This type of financing
    is particularly important when innovation takes place directly in the company,
    which is often the case in food processing. 4. The new models of the Agri-Food
    supply chains The competitiveness of food processing companies depends on their
    investment capacity, the increase in their production, the development of new
    products and the implementation of processes to stand out from the competition
    (Guoqing et al., 2020). Over the past 30 years, we have seen a significant reduction
    in biodiversity, FAO estimates that we will have a 70 % reduction in biodiversity
    on our planet by 2050 (FAO, 2018). Human activities seem to be the main cause
    of this loss. The agriculture has many cards in hand to slow this process by implementing
    environmental protection practices and reducing the chemicals that have led to
    the destruction of many animals and insects living on land, in the air and in
    the water; creating green corridors and shelters for animals and insects; the
    cultivation of old species or species with high genetic variability, leaving the
    design of hybrid plants and monocultures that lead to significant genetic depletion;
    the reduction of arable land to make way for the replanting of forests, grasslands
    and hedges. The competitiveness is addressed to a new way of thinking the Agriculture
    that will let to optimize the process and respecting the nature. The labour shortage
    in many regions of Europe requires processing companies to automate and robotize
    their processes. In addition, investment in these new technologies allows them
    to improve their productivity and provide better working conditions necessary
    to the attraction and retention of the workforce. In addition, to meet the quality
    standards requirements of large chains and food retailers, they must use recognised
    quality management and traceability systems. Investment in digital technologies
    also promotes automation of operations, data management and access to a new range
    of management tools (Industry 4.0). The industry is particularly requested, as
    shown in the previous section, for the use of digital technologies, which allows
    it to optimize production and the supply chain while ensuring traceability of
    food from more and more pointed (Panetto et al., 2019). It is not new that, nowadays,
    agricultures supply chain practices, especially regarding to food products, are
    currently under public scrutiny. As established by Van Der Vorst (2006), this
    is because several factors, which considers food contamination issues, the new
    consumer healthy requirements, requirements for more precise information about
    the farming, marketing, and distribution practices used to bring the agricultural
    products into the shelves into supermarket, to name a few. In this same context,
    and regarding to Suprem et al. (2013), agricultural industry has been solely dependent
    on human labour with limited application of mechanical equipment and machines.
    Moreover, the applications of advanced technology such as embedded computing,
    robotics, wireless technology, GPS/GIS (Geographical Positioning System/Geographical
    Information System) and DBMS (Database Management System) software are seen to
    be recent developments, where regulations are vaguely considered. Moreover, the
    increasing gap between farmer''s expectations and the ability of the government
    led extension services has created a big business opportunity for private parties
    (Kumar and Ali, 2007). In this context, the information about the geometric properties
    of crops provided by digital based techniques, such as: ultrasound, digital photographic
    techniques, light sensors, high-resolution radar images, high-resolution X-ray
    computed tomography, stereo vision and LIDAR sensors; has innumerable applications
    in agriculture. Some important agricultural tasks that can benefit from these
    plant-geometry characterization techniques are the application of pesticides,
    irrigation, fertilization and crop training, improving the environmental and economic
    impact. But there is still a need to resolve several technological and commercial
    questions (Rosell et al., 2012). In line to this, agriculture technologies are
    focused on how traceability can be performed, in fact, the food industry had developed
    efficient traceability methods for the management of logistics and warehouses,
    based on the balance of costs and benefits of the traceability system level (Dabbene
    et al., 2013). Because of this, several authors are currently reviewing main agriculture
    supply chain technology based methods, and example of this is provided by Ahumada
    and Villalobos (2008), who identified that the use of integrated planning models
    in the agriculture supply chains is still very limited, with a high potential
    to manage perishable agri-food products, especially to deal with complex environments.
    In addition, (Ali and Kumar, 2011a) study the implication of using ICT in agriculture.
    From the authors’ findings it is highly appreciated that there is still a medium
    level of dissemination of information and knowledge sharing in agricultural developments
    (Boshkoska et al., 2019), as well as there is still a need for empirical evidences
    as to how ICT interventions are enabling the farmers to take informed decisions.
    Complementary to this, S. Araba and M. Fellows (Araba and Fellows, 2009) address
    that the majority of current research have not established a clear link between
    public access to ICTs and socioeconomic change/impacts in agriculture. In fact,
    there is a need for researchers to go beyond anecdotal evidence of downstream
    public access impacts on end‐users. Nevertheless, it is also evidenced that there
    is still limited ability on information to make definitive statements about agriculture
    expected impacts, as well as to identify and attribute specific impacts to specific
    ICT usage. Table 5 presents a summary on well-known methods and approached to
    support this, in special the agriculture supply chain decision-making methods.

    Hence, and as depicted from Table 1, as studied and established by Reardon et
    al. (2019), the food system can be thought of as “dendritic,” linking R&D, finance,
    input, and output supply chains. This means (1) the first and “core” supply chain,
    is the output Supply Chain. The second and upstream “feeder” supply chains are
    the farm input supply chains. The third and downstream ‘feeder’ supply chains
    are those supplying inputs to the post-farmgate segments. The fourth “pan-system
    feeder” supply chain is that supplying finance into every segment of every chain
    in the dendritic system. The fifth ‘feeder’ supply chain is a broad set of public
    assets apart from agricultural research institutions. The sixth set of “feeders”
    is the R&D supply chains, which supply technology and product innovations. Moreover,
    the ICT challenges in Agriculture supply chains are still open. Birkel in Birkel
    and Hartmann (2019), studied most of the recent ICT developments in this field,
    and found that most of the technological challenges in agriculture mainly includes
    security issues, lack of standards and interoperability, as well as hardware and
    software limitations are the focus of current research. Hence, the main challenges
    and risks are also in relation to the methodology, where (Ben-Daya et al., 2017)
    has revealed that the design aspect is primarily identified as a technological
    issue, while neglecting social and political challenges. Food processing companies''
    projects must benefit from financial levers that the government makes available
    to all in the manufacturing sector (Hernández et al., 2020). In order to further
    stimulate the investments, particularly in the SMEs and in innovative sectors,
    from financial tools considering the needs of the processing sector are decisive
    for the development of the implementation of development projects (Hernandez et
    al., 2020). In a business environment characterized by technological innovation,
    the consolidation of industries, deregulation and demand for consumers in constant
    evolution, the approaches of the traditional managers can no longer allow for
    companies to remain profitable. They are therefore forced to find new ways to
    stay competitive in agri-food domain, as it is also the case for all other industrial
    sectors (Boehlje, 1999; Senge, 1997; Senge et al., 2006). In the value chain management
    (VCM) domain, the informed decision making to unite resources to improve the competitiveness,
    is proving to be a powerful strategic approach that allows organizations to adapt
    to an environment of business in full motion. (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011;
    Dunne, 2008; Fearne, 2007; Fernandez et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). The concept
    of a continuous observation results in continuous and significant improvement
    of the design and the system performance, this is only possible when the companies
    are able to establish a degree of coordination and integration with their suppliers
    and customers that do not allow them the usual relationships with the latter based
    on the transactional approach buyer-seller (Sparling, 2007). Closer strategic
    relationships with customers and suppliers allow companies to better learn and
    adapt (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Multiple firms that co-invent and work together
    for the same objectives using integrated processes can increase their performance
    in a much more significant way that if they had gone it alone (Bonney et al.,
    2007; Fearne, 2007). Co-innovation allows companies to improve their own practices
    as well as those of all of them, it is a process that gives companies competitive
    forces that are difficult to match by others (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011).
    Several of the cases mentioned below demonstrate the benefits sustainable and
    competitive products obtained by companies who have chosen to co-innovate with
    other members of their supply chain. 5. Conclusions, vision and perspectives For
    this scientific contribution to knowledge, more than two hundred papers support
    the analysis on scientific work on the smart agriculture technology trends, but,
    more importantly, on how they emerge as a main concept in the agriculture domain
    as Agri-Food 4.0. From this reviews and analysis, it is clearly revealed that
    integration across new technologies allows smart agriculture to address important
    farming objectives as water saving, soil conservation, limit carbon emission and
    productivity increasing by doing more with less. In fact, the new technologies
    have a positive impact and at the same time pose new challenges in the management
    of different domains of human knowledge. Hence, two main conceptual pillars impact
    and challenges, arising from the use of various technologies in the world of the
    new conception of agriculture are the fundamental aspects in Agri-Food 4.0. A
    precision is due. This paper focus principally on the factory farm model issued
    from the “western” style. In those farms, the Agri-Food 4.0 started to be applied
    and validated. The focus is more specialised on the industrial farming although
    the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted also to the organic and silvo-pasture
    paradigms. The paper pays attention particularly to four major technologies, the
    Internet of Things, the Blockchain, the Big data and the Artificial Intelligence.
    For each of those technologies is presented some type of impacts: functional,
    economic, environmental, social, related to the business and technological and
    the challenges that come with their introduction. The literature is segmented
    in relation to the functionality of the specific technology and a panoramic view
    gives the possibility to better understand the paths needed to face the new challenges.
    The future of the Agriculture domain is in the creation of a resilient and sustainable
    farming system. On the four types of crop-based uncertainty that have been identified:
    Product, Process, Market and Environment the core problem is the management. Poor
    management of these sources of uncertainty have a negative impact on safety, quality,
    quantity and waste of products as well as human, technological and natural resources.
    Today, and always more in the future, the data is the lifeblood of any business
    and the agricultural business is not an exception but rather a referent. As aforementioned
    in the discussion section, the new technologies have a great impact on the reduction
    of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise data in real time, and real-time
    information tools provide new opportunities for companies to react more quickly
    to changing conditions in the supply chain. Our interest in the next future is
    to use formal methods to extract knowledge from the interrelation of the difference
    technologies impacts and from the existing solutions to the highlighted challenges
    to increase the efficiency, sustainability, flexibility, agility, and the resilience
    along the whole supply chain from the farmers to the final customers, and the

    Development Goals (SDGs) to ensure an equitable, environmentally sustainable,
    and healthy society. This perspective describes the opportunities that digitalization
    can provide towards building the sustainable society of the future. Smart technologies
    are envisioned as game-changing tools, whereby their integration will benefit
    the three essential elements of the food-water-energy nexus: (i) sustainable food
    production; (ii) access to clean and safe potable water; and (iii) green energy
    generation and usage. It then discusses the benefits of digitalization to catalyze
    the transition towards sustainable manufacturing practices and enhance citizens''
    health wellbeing by providing digital access to care, particularly for the underserved
    communities. Finally, the perspective englobes digitalization benefits by providing
    a holistic view on how it can contribute to address the serious challenges of
    endangered planet biodiversity and climate change. Graphical abstract Download

    1. Introduction The world is transitioning through the digitalization era in which
    most of our daily activities are highly dependent on innovative digital and computer
    technologies. These contemporary technologies have got their applications in socio-economic,
    environmental, sustainable, and climate research applications to enhance the productivity
    and efficiency of a given system (Balogun et al., 2020; Ceipek et al., 2020).
    Digitalization is the integration of digital technologies into everyday life.
    Such integration is possible by the digitization of information. Digitization
    is defined as the process of converting physically collected information (e.g.,
    sensors, written information, etc.) and knowledge into a computer-readable language.
    The tedious effort of digitizing information gathered over centuries (including
    paintings, images, and video formats) has given valuable fruits propelled by information
    technologies. The benefits resulting from digitalization contributed to the development
    of tools and sensors throughout integrated into the internet of things (IoT) environment.
    The IoT is a robust network of physical objects connected over internet through
    embedded sensors, software, and other technologies that enable interchange and
    collection of data. The convergence of simultaneously developed technologies for
    real-time analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence manages a massive
    amount of data, also known as big data. The high value of these massive data sets
    generated is not yet fully exploited but generates unique opportunities to catalyze
    the transition to more efficient and sustainable smart integrated cities. Digitalization
    brings a new set of tools that have to be carefully balanced to ensure smart application
    and their green character. The capability of making well-informed decisions to
    use more efficiently resources and services has a significant impact on sustainability
    and equal access (Appio et al., 2021; Ardito et al., 2018), but several challenges
    cannot be overlooked to ensure successful achievement of these goals. Development
    and manufacturing of electronic devices are depleting limited resources and generating
    e-waste (unwanted electronic products, not working, and nearing or at the end
    of their “useful life”) that is being hardly recycled (Ahirwar and Tripathi, 2021;
    Dhir et al., 2021). Considering life-cycle and developing e-waste recycling technologies
    is an urgent need. The necessity of better infrastructure is another challenge
    that may widen the gap between developed and developing regions instead of narrowing
    it. There is a need to ensure infrastructure and equal internet access to achieve
    the holistic goal of reducing inequalities and poverty, aligning with the need
    to provide digital education to the final users (Habibi and Zabardast, 2020; Lopez-Sintas
    et al., 2020; Matthess and Kunkel, 2020). Finally, data security is one of the
    major concerns on big-data sources'' wide accessibility and openness. Data security
    is a sensitive topic that generates debate associated to safety risks and network
    integrity of these digitalized services (Craig, 2018; Reveron and Savage, 2020).
    These challenges have to be considered but should not have to be seen as barriers
    to digitalization''s applicability to face sustainable challenges from an applied
    perspective. The United Nations (UN) defined in 2015 a roadmap towards equity
    and sustainable development with a horizon set in 2030 (United Nations, 2018).
    These so-called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) identify 17 existing challenges
    that should be overcome to reach this ambitious global goal: (1) No poverty, (2)
    Zero hunger, (3) Good health and wellbeing, (4) Quality education, (5) Gender
    equality, (6) Clean water and sanitation, (7) Affordable and clean energy, (8)
    Decent work and economic growth, (9) Industry, innovation and infrastructure,
    (10) Reduced inequalities, (11) Sustainable cities and communities, (12) Responsible
    consumption and production, (13) Climate action, (14) Life below water, (15) Life
    on land, (16) Peace, justice and strong institutions, and (17) Partnership for
    the goals. These interlinked SDGs present the urgent needs of our civilization
    to ensure a sustainable and competitive future. The creative development of digital
    tools to generate, use, transmit, or source electronic data for organizational
    activities can be used to achieve SDGs. These tools that contribute to achieving
    these specific targets could be defined as digital sustainability. Digital Sustainability
    is understood as the effort of developing and deploying smart technologies to
    secure sustainable economic growth while considering and integrating the SDGs.
    Modern digital innovations like artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques
    have seen exponential growth in their value, estimated to add around 14% to the
    global economy by 2030 (George et al., 2020; Magistretti et al., 2019). In this
    perspective, we explore how digitalization can pave the way towards sustainable
    development, which is essential to create a Smart Green Planet that provides resources
    while protecting the environment and health of all the planet''s inhabitants.

    from the correlated benefits of all these actions. In this article, we explore
    how digitalization can assist in attaining SDGs in different sectors such as (i)
    food-water-energy nexus, (ii) industry, (iii) citizens'' health and wellbeing,
    (iv) climate change and biodiversity protection. Fig. 2 summarizes the different
    sections of this perspective with emphasis on the specific aspects addressed for
    the different SDGs. Each big topic is framed to answer a holistic question regarding
    how digitalization can lead the change towards a more sustainable and balanced
    society for each challenge. We will specifically discuss digitalization tools
    implemented in specific areas with the direct aim to benefit said sector and to
    tackle said SDGs. Even though it is important to remark the tight correlations
    and interlinks between the different areas that become hard to differentiate.
    For example, effects resulting from the food-water-energy nexus directly impact
    the wellbeing of citizens of smart cities. Therefore, it is assessed and discussed
    how digitalization aids in sustaining the main pillars of our civilization in
    the food-water-energy nexus, the benefits of industrial manufacturing, and the
    relevance for human health and wellbeing. The perspective ends with a discussion
    centered on the benefits of digitalization to protect biodiversity and mitigate
    climate change. Download : Download high-res image (382KB) Download : Download

    sustainable development goal addressed in this perspective. 2. Will digital technologies
    redefine the future of agriculture and food production systems? The ever-growing
    global demand for food, feed, fiber, and clean energy increases pressure on the
    agroecosystems. Increased stress adversely affects agroecosystems'' natural resilience,
    and it is expected to result in unprecedented environmental changes on a global
    scale (Okolo et al., 2019). Changing climatic conditions are accompanied by high
    and low heat stress, altered rainfall pattern, elevated carbon dioxide, increased
    frequency of extreme weather events like droughts, floods, cyclonic disturbances,
    and increased saline soils. These effects result in inflation of production costs,
    pest infestation and disease incidences which collectively add pressure on global
    agricultural land (Abhilash and Dubey, 2014; Lobell et al., 2012). Owing to the
    rising demand for food, the stressed supply chains, and diminishing soil carbon
    levels are depicting a daunting task for future generations to meet the nutritional
    requirements of 9.7 billion people by 2050. The advent of digital technologies
    within agriculture is a ray of hope on the horizon. Digital technologies are up-scaling
    the sustainable management of agricultural land and resources as well as strengthening
    the associated productivity, services, and livelihood security worldwide as summarized
    in Table 1. Crop variety, plot, and field-specific sustainable agricultural practices
    are being developed (Dubey et al., 2019; Okolo et al., 2019) and data generated
    from promising practices should be maintained and analyzed through digital technologies.
    Digitalization has made rapid strides within the agricultural sector, making its
    presence felt in varying dimensions such as land assessment, soil-crop suitability,
    weather information, crop-growth, biomass and productivity, precision farming,
    along with the various stages of the agriculture supply chain (processing, packaging,
    delivery, consumption, and agro-waste management). Digitalization adds multipurpose
    benefits to global agriculture via real-time monitoring, common fingertip-based
    smartphones and computers, and satellite and weather information-based consultation.
    These IoT technologies can alert and allow planning to deal with upcoming challenges
    such as pest infestation and/or disease outbreaks. Digital technologies also help
    select high yield-oriented optimum practices, precise resource inputs, less production
    cost with the better nutritional quality of agricultural produces, geo-tagging
    for precise prophecy, vigorous and elastic farming methods, crop data management,
    post-harvest services, and agro-based industries. Various technologies like remote
    sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), smart-phone, robotics, artificial
    intelligence, genomics, bioinformatics and big data-based digital technologies
    are being utilized for attaining the target of agricultural sustainability (Basso
    and Antle, 2020) and the targets of United Nations SDGs (United Nations, 2018)
    (Fig. 3). Under digitalization, application of various hardware (sensors, ground
    robot, drones, nursery automation, robotics, robotics-based irrigation, precise
    fertilization at the base between densely grown crops, automated tractors for
    crop harvesting), software (geo-mapping, computer imaging technology), and their
    combination (micro-spraying robots for targeted herbicide application, automated
    weed uprooting and pruning robotics with computer imaging) are already being employed.
    Details and implications of the internet of agricultural things-based technologies
    are described in the following subsections that define promising opportunities
    enabled by digitalization. Table 1. Application of digital technologies in providing

    and their efficacies for improving the global agricultural sustainability, healthy
    food, people, and planet that help achieve the target of United Nations Sustainable
    Development Goals (UN-SDGs). 2.1. Remote sensing and GIS-based technologies for
    sustainable management of agricultural land Remote sensing (RS) and GIS techniques
    offer various solutions starting from crop species identification, farm and landscape-level
    sustainable management of farming systems, to policy formulation (Basso and Antle,
    2020). Thus, increasing agri-productions, resource conservation, above-belowground
    biodiversity, gender equality, and farmers'' empowerment opportunities could be
    achieved by integrating these modern digital tools. Integration of RS-GIS, Fuzzy-logic,
    and multicriteria assessment using the Analytical Hierarchy Process generate a
    superior database and a guide map for effective land-use patterns, crop variety,
    planning, monitoring of agroecosystem activities, and decision making with several
    examples summarized in Table 1. These integration techniques have quick and efficient
    access to a large amount of information, revealing relationships, patterns, and
    useful trends for combining soil survey information for better land-use suitability
    assessment (Singha and Swain, 2016). Research has demonstrated the benefits of
    implementing these techniques as a viable alternative for highly productive and
    stable agricultural systems over time. Smart integration of GIS-based technology
    promises better farming systems to production areas with enhanced resilience while
    mitigating climate change. For instance, GIS-remote sensing tools have been utilized
    in citrus orchards in China where digital mapping and modeling-based knowledge
    of area topography, land-use, soil types, climatic conditions, and altitude predicted
    the suitable area for citrus cropping and their sustainable management from field
    to end-users (Wu et al., 2011). The RS data helps decipher the spatiotemporal
    characteristics of the land exceptionally, including the impact of the environment
    on the growth of crops. According to Al-Gaadi et al., the GIS-RS technology and
    models (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Spectral Reflectance, Fraction
    of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, LandSAT Enhanced Thematic Mapper,
    Environmental Policy Integrated Climate models, Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging
    Spectroradiometer) have been explored for improving the sustainability of potato
    production (Al-Gaadi et al., 2016). The use of advanced multispectral images in
    RS was highlighted as an effective monitoring tool for determining vegetation
    dynamics, plant health, and predicting crop yield under different practices (Al-Gaadi
    et al., 2016). Hence, decisions related to quantitative export and import of the
    product within the region could be made assuredly to strengthen the net economic
    benefits to the farming community. Through GIS-RS-based technologies, farm operators
    are provided with precision maps, information on crops, estimation of fields,
    and soil characteristics, which are beneficial for producers of the government,
    as they can provide the necessary projects to support the farmers. Besides, these
    systems provide better information on climatic parameters for the development
    of heat and drought-resilient crop varieties via different breeding approaches
    (Faloon et al., 2015). Also, GIS-RS equipped with Revised Universal Soil Loss
    Equation models helped explain the susceptibility to severe soil erosion in Syria
    with a soil loss of more than 109 tons ha−1 yr−1 by generating a map for soil
    degradation (Abdo and Salloum, 2017). Around 104–627 kg ha−1 plastic materials
    including synthetic polymers, are being used in agriculture in varied processes
    like mulching, hail protection, crop protection, shading nets and in irrigation
    support. Sustainable management of land and crops along-with soil biodiversity
    sustenance requires the regular removal of these polymers. Here again, readily
    updatable GIS-based databases and maps have been used to identify the extent of
    plastic in farms, delineate the place for plastic collection and develop a monitoring
    and decision-making system for the identification and collection followed by their
    proper delivery to the recycling companies (Blanco et al., 2018). The involvement
    of geoinformatics and decision support systems in precision irrigation plays a
    significant role in sustainable water management and is crucial for those countries
    where water is a scarce or highly limited resource and in arid and semi-arid areas.
    However, this technique requires combining large sets of precise and highly accurate
    data about land characteristics and water resources. Factors such as the high
    cost of maintenance and calibration of the sensors make its implementation tiresome,
    especially in developing countries. Although these technologies are still a challenge
    for many countries, the availability of open-source geospatial platforms like
    QGIS and R open up new possibilities for their application in low-income systems.
    Active stakeholder engagement is further required to highlight the accessibility
    and feasibility of such GIS software to the rest of the farming community and
    supply chain members. The world is in an era where online information is becoming
    more prosperous, with multiple applications for phones, computers, and other devices
    being launched. Scientific interventions can further boost the integration of
    emerging digital technologies within agricultural practices, offering several
    opportunities to significantly improve the social, economic and environmental
    sustainability of food production systems. 2.2. APP based agricultural services
    and climate-smart agriculture Globally, agricultural transformation is proceeding
    rapidly, with Information Communications Technology (ICT) and digitization being
    the central players behind this novel transformation. The use of mobile application
    software by almost all agricultural stakeholders enhances resource use efficiency
    and equally helps reduce costs associated with production while simultaneously
    increasing yields and net economic return (Qiang et al., 2011) with several examples
    collected in Table 1. The use of mobile-based apps by farming, scientific and
    technical professionals is enabling information access related to climate-smart
    agricultural (CSA) practices. The integration of digitalized access is assists
    in decision-making during production and subsequent stages of the supply chain.
    According to Global System for Mobile Communications Association real-time intelligence
    data, more than 5.2 billion people (~68% of the world''s population) have access
    to mobile devices worldwide. Globally, the current cellular phone users surpass
    3 billion, projected to grow by several hundred million in the next few years.
    The effectiveness of mobile phones/Apps and their implication in disseminating
    agricultural information to farmers have been validated (Mittal and Mehar, 2016).
    However, the use of ICT in agriculture does not always lead to higher yields and
    profits for every farmer (Eitzinger et al., 2019). Thus, despite the positive
    results of mobile applications in improving smallholder agriculture (Tata and
    McNamara, 2018), many farmers are still left in the “dark” owing to lack of technology
    access, especially in rural communities of developing countries (Eitzinger et
    al., 2019). Notably, vital impediments that hinder digitalization in agriculture
    (i.e., use of mobile phone/Apps and ICT), especially among smallholder farmers
    in a rural context, include lack of connectivity, missing digital capability,
    poor usability of ICT applications, and digital illiteracy (Eitzinger et al.,
    2019; Mittal and Mehar, 2016). Failure to address these shortcomings will eventually
    lead to farmers facing a new era of digital poverty. More importantly, recognition
    of the local context of connectivity, user''s capacities, synchronization with
    local dialects, and socio-cultural backgrounds should be focused upon as the new
    ICT cutting-edge initiatives with the potential to avoid the impending digital
    poverty among smallholder farmers (Aker et al., 2016; Eitzinger et al., 2019).
    Rising agricultural production, food security, and livelihood of millions of people
    across the globe are being threatened by climate change. Agriculture is a significant
    contributor to greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions and global warming (Gebresamuel
    et al., 2021). Digital technologies-based climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices
    that integrated the benefits of sustainable production, climate resilience, and
    reduced GHGs emissions appear to be very promising and offer a potential solution
    to existing problems (Abegunde et al., 2020). However, despite the various benefits
    of CSA technologies, farmers'' current adoption rate is relatively low. Factors
    such as the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, the biophysical environment
    of a particular location, and the attributes of new technologies influence the
    adoption of CSA technologies (Bu and Wang, 2019; Deressa et al., 2011). Food systems
    must undergo significant digital transformation to meet the ever-growing challenges
    of food security and climate change. From a sustainability perspective, adoption
    of APP-based agricultural services with location-specific CSA practices could
    be the major driver of cleaner and greener agriculture, which is also an agenda
    for global sustainable development. 2.3. Precision agriculture, robotics, and
    artificial intelligence Precision agriculture is a farming practice undertaken
    at an accurate place under specific timing rather than uniform adoption across
    the field. Lesser ecological risks, higher crop yield (reduced global hunger),
    and economic gains (reduced poverty) to the farming communities are the fundamental
    attributes of precision agriculture. Precision agriculture employs robotics, artificial
    intelligence, and deep learning processes for the next generation and is climate-smart
    sustainable agriculture practice. Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones
    enabled for providing hyper-class remote-sensing spatiotemporal and spectral records
    can solve the multifarious problems associated with agroecosystems, farming community
    and strengthen the path of precision agriculture. The UAVs contain various sensors
    for predicting the real-time information on drought, soil nutrient, plant growth,
    yield, disease, pesticide and weed, pest, weather parameters, soil type, moisture
    content, and spray pesticide and fertilizer (Maes and Steppe, 2019; Vasconez et
    al., 2019). Thermal imagery, combined thermal with hyper-spectral data, entity-based
    imaging, and UAVs models could be the better technologies for revealing the drought
    stress, pathogen, weed, nutrient status, and yield. Artificial intelligence has
    also proven to improve the impact of precision agriculture. For instance, integration
    of advanced artificial intelligence models, deep reinforcement learning, information,
    and cloud technology has the potential to conserve critical agricultural resources
    while enhancing food production and sustainability (Bu and Wang, 2019). The national
    governing bodies also adopt the advents of these integrated technologies for the
    betterment of advisory and data availability to the farming community (http://agricoop.nic.in).
    In another research, artificial intelligence developed several expert systems
    for the cotton plant such as COMAX (Cotton Management eXpert) and COTFLEX that
    provide decision-making information to farmers. Similarly, SOYGRO and PRITHVI
    expert system provides information regarding insect attacks and pesticides used
    for the soybean crop (Jha et al., 2019). Artificial intelligence enabled machine
    learning technologies and the internet of agricultural things. Wireless communications
    are increasing the farm knowledge system and decision making for better management
    of agriculture. Additionally, precision agriculture is growing faster because
    of rapid research and development of cheaper sensors, better control, and computer
    imaging systems with evolving artificial intelligence. Consequently, a myriad
    of semi and autonomous, unmanned ground vehicles or ground robotics are being
    successfully applied in seedbed grounding, irrigation, spraying, pruning, harvesting,
    real-time monitoring, and mapping for saving resources, finances, and the environment
    (Vasconez et al., 2019). In precision agriculture, data expressed in the form
    of different names such as Digital Farming, Agriculture 5.0 and Smart Farming
    enhances the accuracy of farm operation and helps in making critical operational
    decisions. For example, remote sensing technologies such as American Landsat satellites,
    European Sentinel 2 satellite system, Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites,
    RapidEye constellation, GeoEye-1 system, WorldView series, and IKONOS provide
    agricultural information that helps in sustainable planning and management of
    agriculture. Some other examples of robotic technology such as Vinbot, VineRobot,
    VineScout, and GRAPE have crop sensing devices and afford multi-season ground-truth
    justification of vineyards. Furthermore, Naïo Technologies and RowBot Systems
    LLC are interesting robotics platforms. The first is associated with mechanical
    weeding, and the latter is used for selective application of fertilizer, mapping
    crop growth, and other field related tasks. The field-level geographic Information
    System (FIS) provides satisfactory information for implementation, operational
    planning, and documentation for the management of farming systems (Saiz-Rubio
    and Rovira-Más, 2020). 2.4. Role of genomics, bioinformatics, and big data in
    sustainable food productions Previously, genomics, bioinformatics, and big data
    were inclined to explore the elementary processes of the life and biological sciences.
    However, nowadays, digital technologies-based omics and data science are performing
    far better in agri-sciences for improving the crop yield, nutritional quality,
    stress tolerance, and combating the negative impact of climate change. Global
    projections demonstrate that a one-degree upsurge in global average temperature
    could reduce the crop-yield of maize, wheat, rice, and soybean by 7.4, 6, 3.2,
    and 3.1%, respectively (Zhao et al., 2017). Therefore, extensive knowledge of
    crop genomics is essential to develop climate-smart, resource-efficient and high-yielding
    crop varieties. Furthermore, multiple draft genomes are being assembled for various
    cereals (Oryza sativa, Setaria italic, Sorghum bicolor, Triticum aestivum, Zea
    mays), legumes (Cicer arietinum, Cajanus cajan, Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris,
    Vigna radiata), oilseeds (Brassica napus, Camelina sativa, Elaeis guineensis,
    Ricinus communis), vegetables (Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Carica papaya,
    Capsicum annum, Cucumis sativus, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum melongena, Solanum
    tuberosum) and fruits (Citrullus lanatus, Citrus clementina, Citrus sinensis,
    Cucumis melo, Fragaria vesca, Musa acuminate, Phoenix dactylifera, Prunus mume,
    Pyrus bretschneideri, Vitis vinifera) (Thottathil et al., 2016) as well as for
    their wild crop relatives (Chang et al., 2019) and based on their identified genomic
    traits various crop varieties can be developed with desired traits. Vast volumes
    of data gathered from the genomics mentioned above, proteomics, and metabolomics
    are managed through various bioinformatics-based tools and databases that ultimately
    store all information through computing and cloud technology. Bioinformatics tools
    are computer-based information technology that decodes the enormous digital data
    in agricultural sciences. Examples of dedicated databases for improving the crop
    traits are Integrated Breeding (https://www.integratedbreeding.net/), Wheat Barely
    and Oat Germplasm (https://triticeaetoolbox.org), Wheat Information System (http://wheatis.org/),
    Wheat Genome Information (http://www.wheatgenome.info), Rice-Informatics (http://iric.irri.org/),
    Rice Genome Data (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), Oryzabase (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/),
    Rice Genome Annotation Project (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), Oil-seed Proteomics
    (http://www.oilseedproteomics.missouri.edu/), Maize Genome Database (http://www.maizegdb.org/),
    and the International Crop Information System (ICIS) (http://www.icis.cgiar.org),
    among others. As evident application of genomics, bioinformatics, and big data
    play a crucial role in improving the crop agronomic traits such as abiotic stress
    tolerance, insect resistance, herbicide tolerance, higher grain yield, plant height,
    and weight and crop nutrient content of the crops, which in turn helps in maintaining
    the food and nutritional security (Batley and Edwards, 2016). Varshney et al.
    (2020) have proposed 5Gs crop breeding approaches consisting of a crop-specific
    gene assembly followed by genome and agronomic trait-based characterization of
    germplasm, gene identification combined with functional annotation, genomic breeding,
    and gene editing for improving climate-resilient high yielding, nutrient-rich
    crop varieties. Moreover, in precision genome editing technology, CRISPR-Cas9
    helps develop the disease, drought, and herbicide tolerant crops with better plant
    defense against the virus, bioactive compound production, crop yield, and nutritional
    quality. In integration, CRISPR-Cas9 with multiple targeting sgRNAs serves as
    an appropriate genome editing tool that increases nutrient content in wheat, maize,
    rice, tomato, and sweet orange. The aforesaid mentioned integrated technology
    had been proven to combat the bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV), tomato yellow leaf
    curl virus (TYLCV), and Beet Severe Curly Top geminivirus (BSCTV) infection by
    editing the viral genome. Using CRISPR-Cas9 can cause a mutation in TaMLO-A1 and
    TaMLO-B1 gene of wheat, OsERF922 gene of rice and SIDMR6–1 gene of tomato, increasing
    the resistance against the powdery mildew, rice blast and Xanthomonas spp. in
    wheat, rice, and tomato, respectively. Similarly, CRISPER based genome editing
    tool has modified the ARGOS8 gene locus in maize for enhancing the grain yield
    even under drought stress. Moreover, the mutation in acetolactate synthase genes
    ALS1 and ALS2 have increased the resistance against chlorsulfuron herbicides in
    maize (Eş et al., 2019). These examples highlight the application of information,
    computing, and cloud-based digital technologies in digging and improving the crop
    genomic traits for agricultural sustainability. Besides, various computational
    algorithm-based agricultural system modeling approaches are also being utilized
    extensively for sustainable land management. These models provide a robust prediction
    approach for crop yield, soil nutrient cycling, resource use efficiency, GHGs
    emission, ecosystem services, pest and disease mediated damage, food security,
    livestock production, agroecosystems responses to global climate change and policy
    assessment (Holzworth et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2017) across the various global
    agroecological zones and socioeconomic conditions. Further decision-making systems
    use the knowledge of such models and other computer-based algorithms for enhancing
    the sustainability of agro-practices at plot, field, agroecosystems, landscape,
    national, and global scale. In addition to genomics and bioinformatics, information,
    and communication technology uses various massive, heterogeneous, and unstructured
    data (also known as big data) through the internet and cloud computing. These
    provide insight into the decision-making aspects of the smart farming system.
    Computational scripts allow us to analyze such big data in an integrated manner
    to optimize agricultural productivity and food supply chains. There are multiple
    robotics systems with heterogeneous nature of data in a single smart farming practice.
    These data now became accessible to the users through Application Programming
    Interfaces (APIs) technology. Similarly, technology and data start-ups-based different
    datasets can be combined through open standards (e.g., ISOBUS). Farmobile, a recently
    introduced hardware (passive-uplink communicator) can record all data from robotics;
    store it in the database, and transmit the data using a wireless system. Another
    example of big data analysis can be achieved through Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK)
    that provides farm management information via cheaper, readily accessible, user-friendly
    mobiles and stores data on the cloud. Likewise, in Europe, the FIWARE GEs application
    helps in big data analysis utilizing cloud technology, data collection, and secured
    information technology that opens up multiple options to identify socio-economic
    challenges and provide real-time operational decisions, thereby reducing the economic
    risks involved in the sustainable farming system (Wolfert et al., 2017). However,
    although all previously mentioned digital technologies are rapidly gaining influx
    and witnessing an upsurge in usage within developed nations, they are yet to gain
    ground within developing countries and could prove crucial in achieving the agriculture
    related targets of the various SDGs (no poverty; SDG1, zero hunger; SDG2, good
    health and wellbeing; SDG3, clean water and sanitation; SDG6, industry innovation
    and infrastructure; SDG9, sustainable cities and communities; SDG11 responsible
    consumption and productions; SDG 12, climate action; SDG13, life below water;
    SDG 14, life on land; SDG 15, etc. for global sustainable development) (Dubey
    et al., 2020; Moomen et al., 2019). 3. Can digitalization catalyze strategies
    to ensure clean water for all? 3.1. Artificial intelligence and data mining-assisted
    approaches for optimal design and control of water treatment systems Water treatment
    systems (WTSs), such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), drinking water treatment
    plants (DWTPs), and desalination plants, are complex systems that integrate different
    processes to remove pollutants, impurities, and salts from target water bodies
    (Asadi et al., 2017; Heck et al., 2019; Ming-Yang, 2013). The traditional design
    of WTSs relies on expert knowledge of different treatment processes and cannot
    be efficiently generalized. Generalization has lead to oversized designs of treatment
    units and improper selection of treatment processes, which increases capital expenditures
    and influences the final product water quality. Conventional operation of WTSs
    employs instrumentation, control, and automation (ICA) techniques, but sometimes
    fault signals from instruments without regular maintenance may lead to failure
    responses to the system''s control (Qiu et al., 2018). Most of central control
    systems in WTSs are only capable of acquiring data rather than processing data
    to guide subsequent actions due to the workforce lacking knowledge in data science
    (Newhart et al., 2019). The underutilization of the big data in WTSs would lead
    to the unnecessary increase in operating costs and sometimes inefficient treatment.
    In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been increasingly
    applied to translate the passive data into actionable knowledge to improve the
    WTSs operation and support decision-making (Al Aani et al., 2019; Corominas et
    al., 2018; Haimi et al., 2013; Li et al., 2021). The use of the AI approach to
    optimize the design and control of water treatment systems can be dated back to
    three decades ago (Krovvidy et al., 1991; Zvi, 1992). An early review outlined
    the difficulties of the expert system approach, which is based on advanced mathematical
    techniques and was prevalently used for operational control of WWTP in the early
    days, in acquiring and representing knowledge of the complex phenomena (Zvi, 1992).
    It highlighted the advantages of AI techniques particularly the artificial neural
    networks (ANN) in water and wastewater plant modeling, expert rule extraction,
    fault detection and diagnosis, plant and instrument monitoring, dynamic forecasting,
    and robust control (Zvi, 1992). One of the earliest studies using the AI approach
    to design a water treatment system proposed two phases: the analysis and synthesis
    phases (Krovvidy et al., 1991). In the analysis phase, an inductive learning algorithm
    and expert rules are arranged together to evaluate the treatment efficiency of
    several compounds at different concentrations by an individual treatment process.
    In the synthesis phase, the sequence of different treatment processes satisfying
    the treatment targets are obtained using the knowledge rules generated from the
    analysis phase via the neural network method. This study laid a foundation for
    the later decision support system (DSS) development to select and sequence water
    treatment processes, and design treatment facilities (Hamouda et al., 2009). Fig.
    4 shows the typical four-stage DSS for WTSs design involving AI techniques, including
    water treatment problem analysis and interpretation, developing reasoning models,
    process sequential decision optimization, validating DSS logic, and enhancing
    user interactivity (Hamouda et al., 2009). In a recent study, the optimization
    of WWTPs design was realized via the data mining and AI techniques such as artificial
    neural network and fuzzy logic, following an integral procedure including data
    collection and cleaning, data warehouse, data mining, and web user interface (Qiu
    et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res image (353KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Stages of developing a water treatment decision support
    system. Figure adopted from (Hamouda et al., 2009). Apart from the design of the
    WTSs, the optimal control and operation of the WTSs are equally important to maximize
    technical benefits and cost savings. During the treatment processes, vast volumes
    of data are generated and some are monitored online and collected simultaneously
    via various sensing technologies. Data-mining techniques are incorporated into
    sensing techniques to verify process normalcy and create knowledge on plant malfunctioning
    (Corominas et al., 2018; Haimi et al., 2013). Advanced information extraction
    and Human-interpretable information extraction based on AI and data-mining techniques
    are further developed to transform the data into useful information and knowledge
    for the effective control and optimization of operation of WTSs (Corominas et
    al., 2018). Newhart et al. summarized the data-driven technologies used in WWTPs
    for the purpose of fault detection, variable prediction, and advanced automated
    control to reduce energy consumption, ensure product water quality and prevent
    system failure (Fig. 5) (Newhart et al., 2019). Li et al. reviewed AI and machine
    learning for nonlinear relationship analysis and process control for DWTPs (Li
    et al., 2021). They specifically introduced the current status of these data-driven
    technologies in each treatment unit from source water quality monitoring and identification
    to the accurate and efficient control of each treatment unit, such as the control
    and prediction of coagulation dosage, the analysis of the formation of disinfection
    by-products, and the advanced control of membrane fouling. Some recent cases were
    reported on the use of machine learning to develop model soft-sensor for predictive
    control of WWTPs (Bernardelli et al., 2020; Hernández-del-Olmo et al., 2019).
    AI and machine learning techniques have also exhibited promise to revolutionize
    the automation of the desalination process, especially in the renewable energy-driven
    desalination processes (Al Aani et al., 2019). Cabrera et al. (Cabrera et al.,
    2018) compared three machine learning techniques, namely artificial neural networks
    (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), in predicting the
    wind-driven seawater desalination performance (Fig. 6). They found that (1) SVM
    and RF are significantly better to predict the plant''s performances than neural
    networks, and (2) variable pressure and flow operating mode are more continuous
    than constant pressure and flow mode. Without focusing exclusively on either AI
    techniques or a conventional expert system approach, a recent study proposed a
    hybrid statistical machine learning method to improve the accuracy in predicting
    ammonia in municipal wastewater treatment (Newhart et al., 2020). This study provided
    a new perspective to develop new and rigorous treatment models by integrating
    conventional statistical methods and advanced AI methods. Download : Download

    developed to compare the three machine learning techniques in wind-driven seawater
    desalination plant. Figure adapted from (Cabrera et al., 2018). Despite the promise
    of AI techniques for predictive and optimal control of WTSs, the utilization of
    these advanced data techniques is constrained by some conditions. For example,
    although the data do not need to be linearly correlated or parametrically distributed,
    those monitored variables must have a high sample frequency and number of historical
    observations (Newhart et al., 2019). Some challenges for using these advanced
    techniques are also identified, such as (1) difficulties in the acquisition of
    useful data in complex environment for screening and identifying targeted contaminants,
    and (2) challenges on the establishment of a macro intelligence model and decision
    scheme for entire treatment plants to support the overall management in the water
    supply system (Li et al., 2021). 3.2. Integration of water sensing to ensure water
    quality and protect public health Water of drinking quality is a fait accompli
    that is being placed at stake due to increasing water quality violations (Dettori
    et al., 2019; “US Water Quality Wake-Up Call: Americans Report Increase in Instances
    of Water Contamination,” 2019). For instance, The American Society of Civil Engineers
    evaluated America''s actual condition of water infrastructure with “D” grade (ASCE,
    2017). However, water quality violations are an endemic problem worldwide that
    becomes more concerning in developing areas. Recent examples of significant quality
    violations are the Flint water crisis (i.e., lead contamination from aging pipes)
    (Morckel, 2017), the pressing problems associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl
    substances (PFASs) in water (Sima and Jaffé, 2021), the high arsenic levels in
    drinking water sources (Gifford et al., 2018; Rahman et al., 2018), cyanotoxins
    blooms (Serrà et al., 2021), or water disinfection needs at point of use (Chu
    et al., 2019; Montenegro-Ayo et al., 2020). The variable water quality arises
    as a severe health threat for users. Smart cities of the future should warrant
    accessible water of the highest quality to all their citizens that meets maximum
    concentration levels defined by the World Health Organization. Water is one of
    the pivotal components that will define the smart cities of the future. Smart
    water refers to the holistic approach to manage this resource, related infrastructure,
    treatment, and delivery (Wu et al., 2020). As cities invest in updating old-fashioned
    infrastructure, it is the possibility to integrate internet-enabled tools and
    emerging decentralized smart technologies (e.g., treatment at the point of delivery
    or point of use). Real-time water quality audits at critical control points can
    define when decentralized water treatment may be required to operate to ensure
    public health (Richard et al., 2020). Integrating such neural networks between
    information technology and modular on/off treatment systems can become a game-changer
    for ensuring access to water of drinking quality for all. There is an existing
    need to develop and deploy artificial intelligence systems that identify a water
    quality issue (e.g., high nitrate levels, bacteria presence, etc.) and activate
    immediate action for its remediation. Such Smart Actions will ensure sustainable
    and healthy environments in cities. 4. How can digitalization address energy challenges?
    The energy sector faces several challenges that range from well-known old dilemmas,
    such as overcoming barriers for the grid integration of the ever-fluctuating renewable
    energy resources, adapting the offer to the demand, or increasing the efficiency
    of the energy processes in the industry, to facing new foreseeable issues, such
    as addressing the upcoming increasing energy demands derived from the spread of
    digitalization worldwide (Coroamă and Mattern, 2019), and the security issues
    that may be derived from an interconnected energy generation system (Ebrahimy
    et al., 2018). Digitalization opens a broad range of exciting possibilities as
    in any technological revolution but brings, inevitably, a series of concerns.
    Digitalization is expected to increase the sustainability of our energy systems,
    spread electricity to remote areas, and improve the way we use it. However, digitalization
    may also open the door to novel challenges for our energy systems, for which we
    need to be prepared. In the following sections, we discuss how digitalization
    will impact the sustainability of energy systems by addressing its role in the
    integration of renewable resources, its smart management in the complexity of
    our energy systems puzzles, its use to optimize energy in the ever-insatiable
    industrial sector, and the needs for storage systems that its use will bring,
    as an essential part to fulfill the former targets. 4.1. Renewable energy sources
    and distributed electricity generation The conventional electricity grid is designed
    around centralized generation. As such, large power plants are used to generate
    electricity, typically powered by fossil fuels. Subsequently, the electricity
    is sent through the transmission lines to consumers, providing, essentially, a
    one-way flow of electricity in the grid. However, even in this situation, digitalization
    has been a key for a few years. For example, detailed modeling is performed daily
    to predict electricity demand based on weather conditions, climatology, or societal
    habits (i.e., when people come home from work to cook dinner, large events such
    as football matches, and even advertisement breaks which drive people towards
    their fridge). As such, and despite few events that may cause over-generation
    of electricity, supply and demand can be managed with high accuracy. However,
    the introduction of scalable renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar
    have shaken up the system by introducing the concept of distributed energy generation.
    There are several potential benefits of distributed electricity generation. First,
    electricity can be generated close to where it is needed. This is particularly
    the case of rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), where consumers can generate their
    own electricity or become electricity generators for other households. Second,
    it avoids the need to upgrade infrastructure by avoiding transmission losses.
    Furthermore, some distributed generation sources closely match the demand (e.g.,
    solar with the demand for air-conditioning load on a hot summer day). As such,
    distributed generation can help reduce one of the biggest costs to electricity
    networks, which need to have transmission lines over-dimensioned to accommodate
    the highest demand of the year placed on the overall transmission system. Third,
    generation only needs to compete against the retail cost of electricity, not the
    wholesale cost, providing potential savings and investment opportunities for consumers.
    Nevertheless, the use of distributed energy systems, intermittent in nature, requires
    further digitalization of existing systems to accurately model the contribution
    of individual electricity supplies into the grid, and their dynamics due, for
    instance, to changing weather conditions. Digitalization, including distributed
    generators modeling, projections of energy demand, and smart control for energy
    savings, is therefore needed to help ensure the grid''s stability in terms of
    both voltage and frequency, which is disrupted by the asynchronous nature of the
    renewable energy systems. Hence, the transition to distributed energy systems
    that renewable resources bring will imply a more critical role of digitalization.
    Moreover, consumers may benefit from increased digitalization of energy systems,
    as, for instance, the shift to smart digital meters can encourage them to avoid
    the use of electricity during peak times (Maglakelidze et al., 2019). Additionally,
    smart energy management can be used for intermittent electricity generation and
    supply in households, for example, choosing when to heat hot water (i.e., which
    can be seen as a thermal battery) instead of exporting excess electricity to the
    grid when it is not needed. Moreover, a grid-wide smart energy system can also
    decide when that surplus electricity is more valuable being transmitted through
    the grid for another purpose (e.g., charging electric vehicles or hydrogen generation).
    This enables the opportunity for peer-to-peer electricity trading, allowing electricity
    exchanges with neighboring consumers rather than selling it to the electricity
    provider. For large apartment buildings or micro-grids, this can effectively happen
    by having the main meter and sub-meters for each individual consumer so that the
    surplus electricity by one user can be exported to another user within the microgrid,
    and net surplus or deficits can be exchanged with the main electricity grid. This
    system may maximize energy savings to the expense of increasing the system and
    control complexity, for which digitalization of the measuring systems will be
    crucial. These features, in turn, can be upscaled, allowing the optimal tracking
    of energy exports and trans-national energy exchanges. The digitalization of large
    energy distribution systems can also be used to control, manage, and provide grid
    protection with energy storage or grid stabilization by using large batteries
    such as in South Australia (Faunce et al., 2018), which can provide urgent stabilization
    of the grid and avoid a complete network shutdown in the event of an unforeseen
    shutdown of a major fossil fuel power plant. Distributed energy systems offer,
    therefore, the path towards sustainable energy systems, and their development
    requires parallel development of their digitalized control and modeling. Nevertheless,
    it has to be mentioned that despite notable advances in digitalization in the
    last few years, the main driver and accelerator in the shift to distributed energy
    systems has been the drop in photovoltaic systems cost, which has gone below that
    of other renewable and fossil-based resources, as shown in Fig. 7. In fact, as
    of today, the low payback times for solar-generated electricity at the residential
    level, and even large solar plants, can be cheaper than the generation cost of
    coal-based electricity. Thus, the current situation is the best possible, and
    digitalization offers the key solution to the biggest challenge for distributed
    renewable energy systems, which is the supply and demand management for intermittent
    generation technologies. It is up to the development of digitalization technologies
    to catch up and make the most of it. Download : Download high-res image (379KB)

    auctions, compared to that of other energy sources. 4.2. Smart grid integration
    of different energy sources It is clear that the modernization of power systems
    brings a number of benefits to all energy stakeholders. However, these advantages
    are challenged by the system transit to the new technology and system innovation.
    Nevertheless, despite the high level of complexity that integrated and distributed
    energy systems may imply, the concept of smart grid technologies offers a solid
    platform for a safe, stable, and sustainable transition. The conceptual framework
    of smart grids, which can be represented as in Fig. 8, consists of (i) the application
    of intelligent strategies to effectively allow the coordination of the energy
    flow between generation and the consumption of power (Bansal, 2019; Mbungu et
    al., 2020, Mbungu et al., 2019); (ii) the coordination of diverse energy resources
    by encouraging maximum use of renewable energy resources; (iii) the integration
    of distributed and diverse energy storage systems; (iv) energy management policies
    through which the relationship between the consumer and the supplier is coordinated.

    Fig. 8. Overview of intelligent energy system (Mbungu et al., 2020). In order
    to become a reality, smart energy systems need the development of optimal control
    schemes from the production sites to the consumption sites. Currently, energy
    management strategies use smart grid technologies to guarantee optimal energy
    coordination into the electrical system. The features that the smart grid technologies
    offer provide the electrical system with the opportunities of having a digitalized
    system with diverse possibilities to optimally coordinate several energy resources.
    Contrary to traditional energy networks, smart grids are adaptive, distributed,
    and have smart metering sensors that allow two-way communication, providing pervasive
    control, self-monitoring, and remote checks in a real-time and dynamic environment.
    The development and deployment of smart grids will define the implementation perspective
    of the future electrical. One of the greatest challenges will be to guarantee
    a better relationship of the energy trilemma (Mbungu et al., 2019), which consists
    of solving the equilibrium aspect of the equilateral triangle where the sides
    are energy equity, energy security, and environmental sustainability. Therefore,
    in the future perspective of power systems, we will not only be looking for affordable
    and green and clean energy generation, but also secure and reliable energy resources.
    And to this purpose, the novel approach of smart grid will need to integrate the
    concepts of energy internet and the internet of energy (IoE). 4.3. Energy efficiency
    in industries and transportation Distributed generation and smart grids are thus
    the keys for a greener energy supply, but a crucial factor that may impact the
    energy use sustainability to the same or even greater extent as its efficient
    use. When it comes to energy use, the industrial and transport sectors represent
    more than half of the total energy consumption in the world (Taylor et al., 2010).
    A great majority of processes consuming energy in these sectors require high temperatures,
    which are achieved, mostly through the combustion of fossil fuels, therefore contributing
    to most of the greenhouse gas emissions on the planet (Panayiotou et al., 2017).
    These processes, have efficiencies between 45% (i.e., Diesel engines) to about
    85% (i.e., gas boilers), meaning that around 15–55% of the energy provided by
    fossil fuels is wasted in the form of residual heat. This heat represents a significant
    waste of energy resources, which in turn contributes to global warming, exposing
    these sectors'' incapacity for using the valuable resources in a smart way. The
    standardization of inline sensors for processes metering and the popularization
    of logging systems and connectivity (Halstenberg et al., 2019), conforming the
    concept of the internet of things in the industry, will soon provide extensive
    datasets for process optimization that may allow for energy savings of up to 20%
    in industry (Kagermann, 2015). Beyond static operation, the continuous availability
    of processes data will allow a rapid adaptation of the processes configurations
    in combination with autonomous control systems, which in turn, may self-learn
    daily from the generated data by using neural network-based systems (Han et al.,
    2016). This new capability may be easily extended to the transport sector, especially
    the one concerning the shipping of goods by air, sea, and road (i.e., trucks),
    which are the three main contributors to the CO2 emissions from transport (Dray
    et al., 2012). Data logging onboard ships and trucks have become a reality in
    recent years, where many companies initially motivated to reduce the economic
    stress of ship owners by reducing fuel consumption, have found their side contribution
    on cutting down emissions (Fruth and Teuteberg, 2017). Similarly, the road transport
    sector is taking up the baton, as digitalization is currently claimed as the main
    driver for change in the sector (Noussan et al., 2020; Schiller et al., 2016).
    Interconnected devices between trucks and supplier centers may allow dynamic route
    optimization, ensuring better capacity utilization and fuel savings. Equally,
    individual systems that monitor each driver''s style, and the maintenance needs
    for each vehicle (e.g., wear on components) may be used to dynamically optimize
    the operating parameters to save fuel, reduce emissions, and increase the truck''s
    lifetime. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that increased energy efficiency
    from the user side may bring with it the so-called induction effect, by which
    more optimized energy systems may create new energy demands. For instance, it
    has been claimed that the evolution of autonomous cars may increase the amount
    of users that, because of special mobility needs, may not be using cars before
    or were using the ‘greener’ public transport (Coroamă and Mattern, 2019). Moreover,
    the forecasted gains in efficiency may be more than outweighed by the increase
    in energy consumption due to new digital services, therefore resulting in a counterproductive
    effect. It is therefore in our hands, and those of the future generations, to
    investigate the impact of different aspects of digitalization in our energy systems,
    aiming at define which digital technologies and services may foster more environmentally
    friendly and sustainable energy production technologies, and which may only result
    in a rebound effect (Coroamă and Mattern, 2019). 5. Does digitalization hold the
    key to catalyze changes on industry and social wellbeing? 5.1. Industry 4.0 towards
    sustainable manufacturing and infrastructure Industrial production of goods and
    services is undergoing significant changes in the last years evolving rapidly
    as digital technologies improve communication among the actors along the value
    chain (Correani et al., 2020). The term Industry 4.0 was coined to address the
    fact that the fourth industrial revolution will rely on digitalization rather
    than only automation as the third did, and that future production will be modular
    within factories consisting of “smart” objects. This trend is given by an application
    pull that requires standardization of systems, short development periods, individualization
    on demand (batch one manufacturing), flexibility, setting safe and secure production
    environments, resource efficiency, and decentralization for decision-making. Simultaneously,
    there is a technology push that will enable increased automation and mechanization,
    networking of elements leading to completely digitalized environments and an increasing
    degree of miniaturization (Lasi et al., 2014; Oztemel and Gursev, 2020). Industry
    4.0 conceives an integration of the entire product life-cycle ranging from the
    raw material acquisition stage all the way to the end of life of the product.
    In between there are manufacturing (and intermediate transformation) steps and
    the users, which also requires transportation (see Fig. 9) (Ardito et al., 2019;
    Stock and Seliger, 2016). Download : Download high-res image (413KB) Download

    4.0 integrated with material, energy and information flows through digital technologies.
    The vision of Industry 4.0 perfectly aligns with the concept of lean manufacturing
    (LM) since both approaches pursue improvements in quality, productivity, seek
    a reduction of waste, and are customer-oriented. With its historical origin in
    the Toyota Production System, LM has been a paradigm that has pushed industrial
    practice to operational excellence for years. It is based on five main guidelines,
    namely: the identification of value, map the value stream, creation of continuous
    flow between production steps, introduce pull between these steps, and, finally,
    seek perfection in the performance (D''Ippolito et al., 2019; Womack and Jones,
    1996). The reutilization of material flows is indeed a point of paramount importance
    in LM practice and, obviously, Industry 4.0 and must be emphasized. In this sense,
    the principles of both concepts are coherent with the perspective of a green chemical
    sector of the future, whereby industry would need to consider and implement “waste
    design.” This philosophy deals with how production should be readapted to design
    processes that (a) avoid as much as possible waste creation and subsequent management
    and (b) make by-products in the processes useful raw materials (Zimmerman et al.,
    2020). In the end, this will lead to the creation of value by reutilization throughout
    the supply chain contributing to a circular economy, which is crucial to consider
    sustainable manufacturing decisions (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018). Another consideration
    is that the transportation of completed or intermediate goods demands the use
    of the most sustainable infrastructure to connect the different stations of the
    value chain, optimizing costs while minimizing emissions and safety issues (Dev
    et al., 2020). As for energy flows, originating from renewable sources, they will
    go into smart grids to which each smart factory is connected to manage the demand
    or supply of energy. The core of the manufacturing process would be the smart
    factories (also referred to as “dark factories,” “lights out factories,” or “unmanned
    factories”). Smart manufacturing aims to optimize concept generation and production
    by employing computer control and high levels of adaptability hence promoting
    self-organization and decentralized decision-making. For this, it takes advantage
    of advanced information and manufacturing technologies to enable flexibility in
    physical processes to operate in dynamic global markets (Oztemel and Gursev, 2020).
    In turn, smart factories are heavily reliant on machine-to-machine communication
    through cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CPSs are one of the key aspects of Industry
    4.0, and they encompass a network of objects and systems communicating with each
    other over the internet and a virtual environment created by computer simulation
    of objects and behaviors in the real world. Cloud computing becomes essential
    for the interconnection of CPSs as it enables data mining and determining responses
    to be given by the self-organized systems. Within smart factories, virtual manufacturing
    (VM) allows the simulation and optimization of operations and processes of the
    different modules with different technologies like computer-aided process design,
    product life cycle management, virtual or augmented reality, or 3D modeling, to
    name a few. VM technologies, in the end, are key elements to the individualization
    of the production, which in the end will be realized by additive manufacturing,
    such as 3D or 4D printing (Kamble et al., 2018; Kerin and Pham, 2019; Oztemel
    and Gursev, 2020). In contrast with Industry 4.0 and considering its prior establishment,
    the LM philosophy can be regarded as a relatively low-tech approach whose excellence
    stems from its simplicity and the consideration of humans as a foundation to sustain
    continuous improvement of practices. Although this may represent a potential conflict
    from the standpoint of the involvement of manpower, given the similarity of many
    of the objectives of LM and Industry 4.0, it is more than arguable that positive
    associations between the two exist (Tortorella and Fettermann, 2018). A recent
    study by Pagliosa et al. covered precisely the potential synergies and the application
    of Industry 4.0 technologies that can overcome difficulties that directly concern
    LM (Pagliosa et al., 2019). After identifying a total of 9 Industry 4.0 technologies
    and 14 LM practices and analyzing their pairwise interactions, it was realized
    that very positive associations exist with a very high potential to achieve higher
    operational performance. A total of 24 relationships were suggested for prioritization,
    such as the relationship between CPSs and value stream mapping. Likewise, some
    technologies were also deemed a lower priority, such as advanced robotization,
    as they did not pose a definitive advantage to several LM practices. Another conclusion
    of the study is the highlight of the opportunities in research related to the
    area of Industry 4.0 and LM, which include the obvious need for validation of
    the synergies proposed, a categorization of technologies and LM practices in different
    levels of the value stream and the examination of the effects of the proposed
    relationships on operational performance (Pagliosa et al., 2019). Integration
    of life cycle assessments for decision-making is still underexplored and undoubtedly
    necessary to consider material and energy flows (Jose and Ramakrishna, 2018),
    which can help establish concepts like zero-waste manufacturing. This idea advocates
    for an industrial transformation that will reduce the designing for zero waste,
    smart auditing and collecting of any waste generated, subsequent waste to resource
    conversion, and establishing collaborative platforms for industrial symbiosis
    (Kerdlap et al., 2019). While it appears that the development of environmental
    and economic impacts of Industry 4.0 is promising, and several projects are already
    running (Oztemel and Gursev, 2020), the societal impact will have to be thoroughly
    assessed. Artificial intelligence technologies will enable autonomous vehicles
    and lights-out manufacturing, whereby the presence of operators will be minimal.
    These will reduce hazards by avoiding the presence of workers in the corresponding
    factories or transport infrastructures but could also lead to significant job
    losses. In the current context of ongoing rapid changes, the definition of the
    fifth industrial revolution is starting to take shape. Industry 5.0 would represent
    an extension to Industry 4.0 evolving into manufacturing practices that focus
    on the personalized demands of individual customers. Therefore, the application
    of human intelligence is key to the development of this concept. Thus, many efforts
    are being put into tools to increase personalization, including virtual reality
    or holography among which capitalize on the human-machine interaction (Javaid
    and Haleem, 2020). 5.2. Use of e-Health technologies to promote wellbeing and
    quality of life Digitalization is revolutionizing healthcare facilitating access
    to health services and addressing significant challenges in aging, mental health,
    and other costly and complex health care needs, overcoming the shortage of workers,
    and providing care to remote locations. e-Health is a critical area to expand
    and support as eHealth has the potential to provide affordable, sustainable, and
    quality health care (Bucci et al., 2019; Krick et al., 2019; Ossebaard and Van
    Gemert-Pijnen, 2016). Digital health includes different technological advances
    such as telehealth and telemedicine. Telehealth is the use of electronic information
    and telecommunication technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical
    health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health,
    and health administration. Whereas, telemedicine refers to connections at a distance
    with professional providers to obtain treatment via videoconferencing (Weinstein
    et al., 2018). However, the World Health Organization uses the term e-health to
    encompass all these different aspects related to the internet of health things
    (IoHT) that are advancing healthcare during the Digital Age (Larson et al., 2018;
    Ossebaard and Van Gemert-Pijnen, 2016; WHO, 2019). The reliance on IoHT has increased
    over the years, but it has gained more popularity during the COVID-19 Pandemic
    as an efficient alternative to access health services while respecting social
    distancing measures. Telemedicine brings solutions to consumers regarding their
    location and provides equal access to health, increasing health services at a
    lower price (Weinstein et al., 2018). Telemedicine is a helpful tool for reaching
    outpatients in rural areas to provide equal access to healthcare. With federal
    legislation increasing demand for medical services already in short supply, telehealth
    and telemedicine are often seen as more efficient methods for people to receive
    care. Eliminating traveling implies a series of savings, reduce hassles in many
    homes, and saves time, especially in rural areas (Larson et al., 2018; Rupert
    et al., 2017). Furthermore, telemedicine offers the opportunity to support persons
    of different ethnicities, cultures, and languages by facilitating access to health
    care providers that are culturally competent and offer translator services (Larson
    et al., 2018). Despite improvements in high-speed internet in developing countries,
    there are many barriers to overcome to implement telehealth from the part of organizations
    (e.g., cost), patients (e.g., age, level of education, computer literacy), and
    providers (e.g., technically challenged staff, resistance to change) (Scott Kruse
    et al., 2016). The IoHT is still in its infancy but a promising public health
    tool with the potential to significantly increase access to health care for medically
    underserved populations of different backgrounds and ethnicities. Furthermore,
    there is a widespread belief that IoHT can reduce healthcare costs and improve
    health outcomes overall (Bashshur et al., 2016). Wellbeing is one of the SDGs
    gaining importance worldwide. Digital tools play a vital role in promoting wellbeing
    and improving quality of life as these facilitate access to health care. Quality
    of life is an individual perception of physical, mental, and social wellbeing
    state even in the presence of a disease. Mobile phone apps and computers are resources
    for the population to communicate in different ways (phone call, video conference,
    email, app), allowing patients to meet and follow up with their providers. Implementation
    and normalization of eHealth enable the person to self-manage their health condition,
    improve their wellbeing, and prevent future health problems (Ossebaard and Van
    Gemert-Pijnen, 2016; Weinstein et al., 2018). Some examples are apps for promoting
    positive mental health strategies, physical activity, better management of diabetes,
    and heart control, among others (Weinstein et al., 2018). These IoHT applications
    have demonstrated that digital tools improve the overall quality of life of patients
    with chronic conditions while helping them manage their health from the comfort
    of their homes. Persons engaged in e-health achieve the same positive health outcomes
    as those who have the usual care at the clinic or hospital (Larson et al., 2018).
    Some examples of the use of telehealth and other digital sources to improve quality
    of life are: (i) telemonitoring to assist in the care and management of diabetes
    (Lee and Lee, 2018), (ii) use of telemedicine to help to control asthma (Chongmelaxme
    et al., 2019), (iii) telemedicine to help individuals with heart failure (Lin
    et al., 2017), (iv) telehealth to assist Cancer patients (Larson et al., 2018),
    and (v) telemonitoring for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    or COPD (Tupper et al., 2018). Telemedicine can reduce the number of admission
    and length of stays in the hospital. Preventive measures have demonstrated to
    delay mortality (Lin et al., 2017). All these aspects diminish the use of medical
    resources and positively impact the healthcare system and accelerate care attention.
    Emerging technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and
    videogames that induce the participant to exercise (also known as exergaming)
    present opportunities to improve our community''s wellbeing and quality of life.
    VR/AR offer quasi-naturalistic and real-life experiences that might not perform
    in a safe environment for the person. VR/AR allows treating, stimulating, and
    improving the patient''s wellbeing by training physical and cognitive abilities
    (Zucchella et al., 2018). VR reality can make dull activities more entertaining
    and increase adherence (Schröder et al., 2019; Slater and Sanchez-Vives, 2016).
    For example, adding VR to a stationary bike contributes to increasing the person''s
    motivation for training by making the stationary exercise more attractive (Slater
    and Sanchez-Vives, 2016). In rehabilitation, VR offers a safe home-training environment
    to improve mobility (Schröder et al., 2019). Additionally, VR interventions improve
    cognition (memory) and psychological functioning, such as alleviating anxiety,
    impacting the wellbeing of persons with neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer''s,
    stroke, and mild cognitive impairment (Moreno et al., 2019). 6. Can digitalization
    tools assist us in climate research? In climate research, multi spatial-temporal
    climatic data form a baseline to understand climate variability and future projections.
    Digitalization of historical climate data and availability of real-time climate
    data revolutionized the prediction of extreme climate events, and developed strategies
    for their mitigation and adaptation (Munang et al., 2013). The open-source data
    policy, robust storage and processing infrastructure, advanced algorithms, less
    cost and time, and participatory scientific forums have enthused global researchers
    from interdisciplinary fields to work in sustainability research at different
    scales. This section focuses on the role of digital solutions as a way forward
    to comprehend more about the prospect of digital solutions for climate actions
    to attain ecological sustainability. The key areas of our interest are the application
    of digitalization in biodiversity research, earth observation, and climate action.
    6.1. Digitalization in Global Biodiversity Assessment Since the beginning of the
    Anthropocene epoch, human-induced impacts on the environment, including urbanization,
    pollution, globalization, Green House Gases (GHG) emission, and climate change,
    are ever-increasing. Quantifying such impact based on available data is a big
    debate since there is a question on delimiting the onset of the Anthropocene still
    prevails (Lewis and Maslin, 2015). The practice of collecting and availability
    of historical and real-time biodiversity data in digital format has evidently
    increased worldwide from the beginning of the twenty-first century. The Global
    Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is an intergovernmental organization
    that hosts an online interoperable network of biodiversity databases from biological
    surveys and collections done at different geographical realms. The GBIF holds
    nearly one billion biodiversity occurrences records, of which nearly 150 million
    were based on a preserved specimen from natural history collection (Edwards, 2004;
    Yesson et al., 2007). However, estimates suggest that only 10% of specimen samples
    are available in digital format (Ball-Damerow et al., 2019). Online public participation
    has the potential to further accelerate the digitalization of biodiversity research
    specimens through three stages: transcription, geotagging, and specimen annotation.
    There are concerns over the data quality during the incorporation of citizen science
    data. But, this could be overcome by data quality control efforts such as standardization
    of transcription, spatial data accuracy, targeted training, development of pliable
    and multistage database management systems, practicing appropriate statistical
    procedures, and data validation protocols (Ellwood et al., 2015). It is conclusive
    that digitalization of collection-based research helps to derive and assess biological
    baseline to evaluate the impact of climate change, land use (biophysical characteristics
    of land) and land cover (anthropogenic utilization of land) change, invasive species,
    and anthropogenic induced impact on global biodiversity (Hedrick et al., 2020).
    6.2. Ecological monitoring to evaluate land and marine ecosystems The need for
    studying the long-term impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors on the environment
    is much needed to assess biodiversity loss and its implications on biogeochemical
    cycles and global food security (Shiklomanov et al., 2019). Environmental monitoring
    procedure incorporates processes such as background investigation, scheme determination,
    distribution optimization, field sampling, experimental analysis, data collection,
    and analysis complexion. Traditional data collection methods collect field samples
    on environmental change and pollution, which is now augmented through the intervention
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The vast amount of such scattered,
    unstructured and data collected worldwide could be connected through telecommunication
    and the internet for a single-point access. Big data analysis and cloud computing
    have enabled mining of such a vast amount of data to extract useful information
    to frame environmental management strategies (Li, 2014). Recent advancements in
    the sensing and communication infrastructures with storage infrastructure, flexible
    and interoperable geodatabase, cloud processing, and advanced algorithms have
    made the digital data inevitable input for continuous mapping and spatiotemporal
    monitoring of the land and marine ecosystems. Contemporary earth observation sensors
    such as multispectral, hyperspectral, microwave, and LiDAR provide high spatial
    and spectral resolution data utilizing diverse wavelength regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum. The archived and real-time data from these sensors provide a plethora
    of information that could be effectively combined with ground-based information
    to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of earth''s ecosystems. The IoT technologies
    enable us to build and deploy the communication of interconnected sensors to avail
    continuous real-time data (Abraham et al., 2017). The latest developments in the
    open-access interactive tools and frameworks for processing such a massive volume
    of data using LiMES (Live Monitoring of Earth Surface), and xROI helps even a
    non-expert in remote sensing to analyze and derive useful products out of raw
    data (Giuliani et al., 2017; Seyednasrollah et al., 2019). Furthermore, the integration
    of social sensing data through mobile technologies in participatory environmental
    management programs suggests that the participation of stakeholders enhances mapping
    and provides new information on the socio-ecological system (Brammer et al., 2016;
    Dong et al., 2019). 6.3. Digital earth observation data for the assessment of
    essential climate variables Geospatial information infrastructure consists of
    technological, semantic, organizational, and legal components which enable the
    user to discover, share, and utilize geospatial data to assess the rapidly changing
    climate and its implications on our physical environment. The multi-source, multi-band,
    multi-variable, and multi-scale earth observation data combined with auxiliary
    data has inherent 4 V qualities (volume, variety, veracity, and velocity) of big
    data, which could valuably contribute to the effective monitoring of 34 Essential
    Climate Variables (ECVs) as identified by UNFCCC at multiple scales (Guo et al.,
    2015). Time series satellite data for understanding the temporal dynamics in vegetation
    (Measho et al., 2019), deltas and estuarine wetlands (Kuenzer et al., 2019), alpine
    wetlands (Wang et al., 2020), snow line changes (Hu et al., 2019), polar ice cover
    (Eythorsson et al., 2019), urban impervious surface (Kuang, 2019), urban microclimatic
    regions (Bechtel et al., 2019), marine phytoplankton (Dutkiewicz et al., 2019),
    and sea surface temperature (Merchant et al., 2019) in response to the global
    climate change have proven the application potential of geospatial data in different
    domains of environmental monitoring. Recent digital advances, including IoT, big
    data, cloud computing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques together
    can handle a massive number of datasets generated from synchronous satellite-aerial-ground-based
    observation systems for the continuous monitoring of atmosphere, hydrosphere,
    lithosphere, and cryosphere. From these observations, accurate, comprehensive,
    and diverse information on essential climate variables, extreme climate events,
    and global environmental change could be derived to further investigate spatiotemporal
    dynamics of climate change indicators from regional to global scale (Jia et al.,
    2020). 7. Conclusions The United Nations defined in 2015 the sustainable development
    goals (SDGs) to roadmap research and social needs towards equity and sustainable
    development of our society. The advent of digital technologies is a ray of hope
    on the horizon that can guide and catalyze the change towards achieving all the
    holistic 17 SDGs. The role of digitalization and the technologies associated with
    the internet of things (IoT) have been discussed for their potential to solve
    big challenges in the food-water-energy nexus, and enabling Industry 4.0, improving
    social wellbeing, and reducing the effects of climate change. The ever-growing
    global demand for food is one of the greatest challenges of this century, aggravated
    by the unequal access to food resources. Digital technologies are up-scaling sustainable
    agricultural land and resources management and strengthening the associated productivity,
    services, and livelihood security worldwide. For example, the use of remote sensing
    and GIS techniques is increasing agri-productions. The use of data is mapping
    and guiding effective land-use pattern, defining crop variety, and monitoring
    agroecosystem activities. The early implementation of various hardware (e.g.,
    sensors, drones, precise fertilization, etc.) combined with geo-mapping leads
    the new agriculture revolution, given the prediction capabilities to magnify production
    yield and improve sustainable agriculture. The use of mobile application software
    provides unique opportunities for connectivity with agricultural stakeholders
    and farmer independence. Furthermore, applications position the farming communities
    as the essential attributes of precision and sustainable agriculture while ensuring
    economic gains (reduced poverty). Smart cities of the future should ensure accessible
    water of the highest quality for all of their citizens. Big data and digitalization
    play an essential role in meeting these goals. The underutilization of big data
    in water treatment systems may be leading to an unnecessary increase in operating
    costs and sometimes inefficient treatment. Artificial intelligence technologies
    can translate passive data into actionable knowledge to improve operation and
    lead decision-making. Digitalization can lead to an optimized design of water
    treatment plants. Optimized control and operation through efficient data management
    can maximize technical benefits and result in cost savings. Data-mining techniques
    are incorporated into sensing techniques to verify process normalcy and create
    knowledge on plant malfunctioning to respond faster. Advanced automated control
    through digitalization holds the promise to reduce energy consumption, ensure
    product water quality and prevent system failure. Integration of internet-enabled
    tools and emerging decentralized smart technologies (e.g., treatment at the point
    of delivery or point of use) for-real time water quality audit at critical control
    points can define when decentralized water treatment may be required to operate
    to ensure the public health and facilitate equal access to safe water for all.
    Digitalization can enhance energy efficiency and provide sustainable alternatives.
    Modeling electricity usage based on data is used to predict demand based on weather
    conditions, climatology, or societal habits. These data-driven strategies can
    be translated to decentralized energy systems based on renewable sources (e.g.,
    photovoltaics). Smart management in the complexity of our energy systems puzzles
    is an extraordinarily complex matter that can be dealt with through integration
    on the internet of things. Energy management strategies based on digitalization
    tools can contribute to managing with high accuracy supply and demand for a more
    efficient and sustainable generation and use of energy. It has been suggested
    that smart use of datasets for process optimization may allow up to 20% energy
    savings. Similar energy benefits can be observed in transportation systems where
    interconnected devices between trucks and supplier centers may allow dynamic route
    optimization. These strategies will ensure better capacity utilization and fuel
    savings while decreasing CO2 emissions associated to transportation. Sustainable
    manufacturing is one of the key aspects of Industry 4.0 that conceives an integration
    of the entire product life-cycle. Digitalization and material selections become
    an essential element to improve green manufacturing approaches considering the
    entire product life and its reusability/recyclability. Furthermore, smart manufacturing
    integrates computer and internet of things aid strategies to optimize industrial
    yield. Computer control and machine-to-machine communication through cyber-physical
    systems have shown high adaptability and demonstrated optimized self-organization
    and decentralized decision-making. Healthcare and equal access to health are being
    revolutionized by digitalization. Reliance on the internet of health things has
    increased over the years, but it has gained more popularity during the COVID-19
    Pandemic as an efficient alternative to access health services while respecting
    social distancing measures. Telemedicine has been indispensable to bring solutions
    to consumers regardless of their location and income. Digital tools play a vital
    role in promoting wellbeing and improving quality of life through facilitating
    access to health care. Implementation and normalization of e-Health enable the
    person to self-manage health conditions, prevent them, monitor chronic needs,
    and improve citizens'' wellbeing and quality of life. The interconnection of SDGs
    is undeniable. Sustainable approaches have demonstrated synergies that can mitigate
    climate change and its effects. Digitalization and artificial intelligence support
    low carbon energy systems with the integration of highly efficient renewable energy
    that can also monitor and model responses of climate and biodiversity over time.
    In climate research, multi-spatial-temporal climatic data form a baseline to understand
    climate variability and future projections. Digitalization of historical climate
    data and availability of real-time climate data have revolutionized prediction
    and provided a framework for understanding the current climate events and impacts
    on biodiversity. The recent implementation of Internet of Things technology has
    drastically improved collection methods and on-time big data analysis, which could
    favorably contribute for the effective monitoring and solutions deployment. There
    is a clear need for studying the long-term impact of climatic and anthropogenic
    factors on environment and biodiversity. Digitalization is a game-changing tool
    to assist the scientist in this race against time to stop climate change. Digitalization
    defines the path towards a smart Green Planet by providing solutions and assisting
    sustainable development. Integration of IoT, big data management, and artificial
    intelligence have already demonstrated a myriad of benefits. Special attention
    should be paid to implications of inequal data access that can result in digital
    poverty and hence increase inequalities instead of reducing the gap. Cybersecurity
    of strongly interconnected systems through the cloud should be reinforced. However,
    the benefits of big data integration in our daily lives can promote quality of
    life and drastically assist humanity towards the sustainable challenges to ensure
    human, biodiversity, and earth resilience. Declaration of competing interest The

    LSTM model, UAV, multispectral imagery. Abstract.Artificial intelligence technologies,
    including machine learning and deep learning, has shown the potential of transforming
    agriculture beyond our imaginations thanks to their abilities in extraction of
    hidden-layer information of big data. In recent years, deep learning algorithms
    have been widely studied to process and analyze imagery data collected using UAV-based
    imaging systems in precision agriculture and plant high throughput phenotyping.
    Deep-learning based data analytic methods acquired higher accuracy in estimation
    of crop yield, plant height, disease infection and weed detection. The goal of
    this paper was to predict the cotton yield using an improved Long short-term memory
    (LSTM) model, which is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture
    used in the field of deep learning. LSTM model has feedback connections and combinations
    of different gates (such as input gate, forget gate and output gate) to control
    the information needed to be memory for the previous time stamp data and to be
    updated from this time stamp inputs. In this study, a UAV imaging system consisting
    of a multispectral camera of five narrow spectral bands of blue (475±10 nm), green
    (560±10 nm), red (668±5 nm), red-edge (717±5 nm) and near-infrared (840±20 nm)
    was used to collect imagery data of cotton in three critical growth stages. Imagery
    data were pre-processed to remove background, calibrate reflectance and register
    to yield data based geo-referenced information. Multivariable factors of NDVI,
    GNDVI, canopy size and canopy temperature were extracted from UAV multispectral
    images and used as the input for the LSTM model. The parameters of the LSTM model
    with be optimized to improve the performance for accurate yield estimation. (Download

    In the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0),\
    \ the digital world has a wealth of data, such as \nInternet of Things (IoT) data,\
    \ cybersecurity data, mobile data, business data, social media data, health data,\
    \ etc. To intel-\nligently analyze these data and develop the corresponding smart\
    \ and automated applications, the knowledge of artificial \nintelligence (AI),\
    \ particularly, machine learning (ML) is the key. Various types of machine learning\
    \ algorithms such as \nsupervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement\
    \ learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which \nis part of a\
    \ broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data\
    \ on a large scale. In this paper, we \npresent a comprehensive view on these\
    \ machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence\
    \ and the \ncapabilities of an application. Thus, this study’s key contribution\
    \ is explaining the principles of different machine learning \ntechniques and\
    \ their applicability in various real-world application domains, such as cybersecurity systems,\
    \ smart cities, \nhealthcare, e-commerce, agriculture, and many more. We also\
    \ highlight the challenges and potential research directions \nbased on our study.\
    \ Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for both academia and\

    Introduction\nWe live in the age of data, where everything around us is \nconnected\
    \ to a data source, and everything in our lives is \ndigitally recorded [21, 103].\
    \ For instance, the current elec-\ntronic world has a wealth of various kinds\
    \ of data, such as \nthe Internet of Things (IoT) data, cybersecurity data, smart\
    \ \ncity data, business data, smartphone data, social media data, \nhealth data,\
    \ COVID-19 data, and many more. The data can \nbe structured, semi-structured,\
    \ or unstructured, discussed \nbriefly in Sect. “Types of Real-World Data and\
    \ Machine \nLearning Techniques”, which is increasing day-by-day. \nExtracting\
    \ insights from these data can be used to build \nvarious intelligent applications\
    \ in the relevant domains. For \ninstance, to build a data-driven automated and\
    \ intelligent \ncybersecurity system, the relevant cybersecurity data can \nbe\
    \ used [105]; to build personalized context-aware smart \nmobile applications,\
    \ the relevant mobile data can be used \n[103], and so on. Thus, the data management\
    \ tools and tech-\nniques having the capability of extracting insights or useful\
    \ \nknowledge from the data in a timely and intelligent way is \nurgently needed,\
    \ on which the real-world applications are \nbased.\nArtificial intelligence (AI),\
    \ particularly, machine learning \n(ML) have grown rapidly in recent years in\
    \ the context of \ndata analysis and computing that typically allows the appli-\n\
    cations to function in an intelligent manner [95]. ML usually \nprovides systems\
    \ with the ability to learn and enhance from \nexperience automatically without\
    \ being specifically pro-\ngrammed and is generally referred to as the most popular\

    \ technologies in the fourth industrial revolution (4IR \nor Industry 4.0) [103,\
    \ 105]. “Industry 4.0” [114] is typically \nthe ongoing automation of conventional\
    \ manufacturing and \nindustrial practices, including exploratory data processing,\
    \ \nusing new smart technologies such as machine learning \nautomation. Thus,\
    \ to intelligently analyze these data and to \ndevelop the corresponding real-world\
    \ applications, machine \nlearning algorithms is the key. The learning algorithms\
    \ can \nbe categorized into four major types, such as supervised, \nunsupervised,\
    \ semi-supervised, and reinforcement learn-\ning in the area [75], discussed briefly\
    \ in Sect. “Types of \nReal-World Data and MachineLearning Techniques”. The \n\
    popularity of these approaches to learning is increasing \nday-by-day, which is\
    \ shown in Fig. 1, based on data col-\nlected from Google Trends [4] over the\
    \ last five years. The \nx-axis of the figure indicates the specific dates and\
    \ the cor-\nresponding popularity score within the range of 0 (minimum) \nto 100\
    \ (maximum) has been shown in y-axis. According to \nFig. 1, the popularity indication\
    \ values for these learning \ntypes are low in 2015 and are increasing day by\
    \ day. These \nstatistics motivate us to study on machine learning in this \n\
    paper, which can play an important role in the real-world \nthrough Industry 4.0\
    \ automation.\nIn general, the effectiveness and the efficiency of a \nmachine\
    \ learning solution depend on the nature and char-\nacteristics of data and the\
    \ performance of the learning \nalgorithms. In the area of machine learning algorithms,\
    \ \nclassification analysis, regression, data clustering, fea-\nture engineering\
    \ and dimensionality reduction, associa-\ntion rule learning, or reinforcement\
    \ learning techniques \nexist to effectively build data-driven systems [41, 125].\
    \ \nBesides, deep learning originated from the artificial \nneural network that\
    \ can be used to intelligently analyze \ndata, which is known as part of a wider\
    \ family of machine \nlearning approaches [96]. Thus, selecting a proper learn-\n\
    ing algorithm that is suitable for the target application in \na particular domain\
    \ is challenging. The reason is that the \npurpose of different learning algorithms\
    \ is different, even \nthe outcome of different learning algorithms in a similar\
    \ \ncategory may vary depending on the data characteristics \n[106]. Thus, it\
    \ is important to understand the principles \nof various machine learning algorithms\
    \ and their appli-\ncability to apply in various real-world application areas,\
    \ \nsuch as IoT systems, cybersecurity services, business and \nrecommendation\
    \ systems, smart cities, healthcare and \nCOVID-19, context-aware systems, sustainable\
    \ agricul-\nture, and many more that are explained briefly in Sect. \n“Applications\
    \ of Machine Learning”.\nBased on the importance and potentiality of “Machine\
    \ \nLearning” to analyze the data mentioned above, in this \npaper, we provide\
    \ a comprehensive view on various types \nof machine learning algorithms that\
    \ can be applied to \nenhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an appli-\n\
    cation. Thus, the key contribution of this study is explain-\ning the principles\
    \ and potentiality of different machine \nlearning techniques, and their applicability\
    \ in various real-\nworld application areas mentioned earlier. The purpose \n\
    of this paper is, therefore, to provide a basic guide for \nthose academia and\
    \ industry people who want to study, \nresearch, and develop data-driven automated\
    \ and intelli-\ngent systems in the relevant areas based on machine learn-\ning\

    \ of our study. \nWe briefly discuss and explain different machine learning \n\
    algorithms in the subsequent section followed by which \nvarious real-world application\
    \ areas based on machine \nlearning algorithms are discussed and summarized. In\
    \ the \npenultimate section, we highlight several research issues and \npotential\
    \ future directions, and the final section concludes \nthis paper.\nTypes of Real‑World\
    \ Data and Machine \nLearning Techniques\nMachine learning algorithms typically\
    \ consume and process \ndata to learn the related patterns about individuals,\
    \ business \nprocesses, transactions, events, and so on. In the following, \n\
    we discuss various types of real-world data as well as cat-\negories of machine\
    \ learning algorithms.\nTypes of Real‑World Data\nUsually, the availability of\
    \ data is considered as the key to \nconstruct a machine learning model or data-driven\
    \ real-\nworld systems [103, 105]. Data can be of various forms, \nsuch as structured,\
    \ semi-structured, or unstructured [41, 72]. \nBesides, the “metadata” is another\
    \ type that typically repre-\nsents data about the data. In the following, we\
    \ briefly discuss \nthese types of data.\n– Structured: It has a well-defined\
    \ structure, conforms to \na data model following a standard order, which is highly\
    \ \norganized and easily accessed, and used by an entity or a \ncomputer program.\
    \ In well-defined schemes, such as rela-\ntional databases, structured data are\
    \ typically stored, i.e., \nin a tabular format. For instance, names, dates, addresses,\
    \ \ncredit card numbers, stock information, geolocation, etc. \nare examples of\
    \ structured data.\n– Unstructured: On the other hand, there is no pre-defined\
    \ \nformat or organization for unstructured data, making it \nmuch more difficult\
    \ to capture, process, and analyze, \nmostly containing text and multimedia material.\
    \ For \nexample, sensor data, emails, blog entries, wikis, and \nword processing\
    \ documents, PDF files, audio files, \nvideos, images, presentations, web pages,\
    \ and many \nother types of business documents can be considered as \nunstructured\
    \ data.\n– Semi-structured: Semi-structured data are not stored in \na relational\
    \ database like the structured data mentioned \nabove, but it does have certain\
    \ organizational proper-\nties that make it easier to analyze. HTML, XML, JSON\
    \ \ndocuments, NoSQL databases, etc., are some examples \nof semi-structured data.\n\
    – Metadata: It is not the normal form of data, but “data \nabout data”. The primary\
    \ difference between “data” and \n“metadata” is that data are simply the material\
    \ that can \nclassify, measure, or even document something relative \nto an organization’s\
    \ data properties. On the other hand, \nmetadata describes the relevant data information,\
    \ giving \nit more significance for data users. A basic example of a \ndocument’s\
    \ metadata might be the author, file size, date \ngenerated by the document, keywords\
    \ to define the docu-\nment, etc.\nIn the area of machine learning and data science,\
    \ research-\ners use various widely used datasets for different purposes. \nThese\
    \ are, for example, cybersecurity datasets such as \nNSL-KDD [119], UNSW-NB15\
    \ [76], ISCX’12 [1], CIC-\nDDoS2019 [2], Bot-IoT [59], etc., smartphone datasets\
    \ such \nas phone call logs [84, 101], SMS Log [29], mobile applica-\ntion usages\
    \ logs [137] [117], mobile phone notification logs \n[73] etc., IoT data [16,\
    \ 57, 62], agriculture and e-commerce \ndata [120, 138], health data such as heart\
    \ disease [92], dia-\nbetes mellitus [83, 134], COVID-19 [43, 74], etc., and many\
    \ \nmore in various application domains. The data can be in dif-\nferent types\
    \ discussed above, which may vary from applica-\ntion to application in the real\
    \ world. To analyze such data in \na particular problem domain, and to extract\
    \ the insights or \nuseful knowledge from the data for building the real-world\
    \ \nintelligent applications, different types of machine learning \ntechniques\
    \ can be used according to their learning capabili-\nties, which is discussed\
    \ in the following.\nTypes of Machine Learning Techniques\nMachine Learning algorithms\
    \ are mainly divided into four \ncategories: Supervised learning, Unsupervised\
    \ learning, \nSemi-supervised learning, and Reinforcement learning [75], \nas\
    \ shown in Fig. 2. In the following, we briefly discuss each \ntype of learning\
    \ technique with the scope of their applicabil-\nity to solve real-world problems.\n\
    – Supervised: Supervised learning is typically the task of \nmachine learning\
    \ to learn a function that maps an input \nto an output based on sample input-output\
    \ pairs [41]. It \nuses labeled training data and a collection of training \n\
    examples to infer a function. Supervised learning is car-\nried out when certain\
    \ goals are identified to be accom-\n \nSN Computer Science (2021) 2:160\n160\
    \ \nPage 4 of 21\nSN Computer Science\nplished from a certain set of inputs [105],\
    \ i.e., a task-\ndriven approach. The most common supervised tasks are \n“classification”\
    \ that separates the data, and “regression” \nthat fits the data. For instance,\
    \ predicting the class label \nor sentiment of a piece of text, like a tweet or\
    \ a product \nreview, i.e., text classification, is an example of super-\nvised\
    \ learning.\n– Unsupervised: Unsupervised learning analyzes unla-\nbeled datasets\
    \ without the need for human interference, \ni.e., a data-driven process [41].\
    \ This is widely used for \nextracting generative features, identifying meaningful\
    \ \ntrends and structures, groupings in results, and explora-\ntory purposes.\
    \ The most common unsupervised learning \ntasks are clustering, density estimation,\
    \ feature learn-\ning, dimensionality reduction, finding association rules, \n\
    anomaly detection, etc.\n– Semi-supervised: Semi-supervised learning can be \n\
    defined as a hybridization of the above-mentioned \nsupervised and unsupervised\
    \ methods, as it operates \non both labeled and unlabeled data [41, 105]. Thus,\
    \ it \nfalls between learning “without supervision” and learn-\ning “with supervision”.\
    \ In the real world, labeled data \ncould be rare in several contexts, and unlabeled\
    \ data are \nnumerous, where semi-supervised learning is useful [75]. \nThe ultimate\
    \ goal of a semi-supervised learning model \nis to provide a better outcome for\
    \ prediction than that \nproduced using the labeled data alone from the model.\
    \ \nSome application areas where semi-supervised learning \nis used include machine\
    \ translation, fraud detection, labe-\nling data and text classification.\n– Reinforcement:\
    \ Reinforcement learning is a type of \nmachine learning algorithm that enables\
    \ software \nagents and machines to automatically evaluate the opti-\nmal behavior\
    \ in a particular context or environment to \nimprove its efficiency [52], i.e.,\
    \ an environment-driven \napproach. This type of learning is based on reward or\
    \ \npenalty, and its ultimate goal is to use insights obtained \nfrom environmental\
    \ activists to take action to increase \nthe reward or minimize the risk [75].\
    \ It is a powerful tool \nfor training AI models that can help increase automation\
    \ \nor optimize the operational efficiency of sophisticated \nsystems such as\
    \ robotics, autonomous driving tasks, \nmanufacturing and supply chain logistics,\
    \ however, not \npreferable to use it for solving the basic or straightfor-\n\
    ward problems.\nThus, to build effective models in various application areas \n\
    different types of machine learning techniques can play \na significant role according\
    \ to their learning capabilities, \ndepending on the nature of the data discussed\
    \ earlier, and the \ntarget outcome. In Table 1, we summarize various types of\
    \ \nmachine learning techniques with examples. In the follow-\ning, we provide\
    \ a comprehensive view of machine learning \nalgorithms that can be applied to\
    \ enhance the intelligence \nand capabilities of a data-driven application.\n\

    \ Learning Tasks and Algorithms\nIn this section, we discuss various machine learning\
    \ algo-\nrithms that include classification analysis, regression \nanalysis, data\
    \ clustering, association rule learning, feature \nengineering for dimensionality\
    \ reduction, as well as deep \nlearning methods. A general structure of a machine\
    \ learning-\nbased predictive model has been shown in Fig. 3, where \nthe model\
    \ is trained from historical data in phase 1 and the \noutcome is generated in\
    \ phase 2 for the new test data.\nClassification Analysis\nClassification is regarded\
    \ as a supervised learning method \nin machine learning, referring to a problem\
    \ of predictive \nmodeling as well, where a class label is predicted for a given\
    \ \nexample [41]. Mathematically, it maps a function (f) from \ninput variables\
    \ (X) to output variables (Y) as target, label or \ncategories. To predict the\
    \ class of given data points, it can be \ncarried out on structured or unstructured\
    \ data. For example, \nspam detection such as “spam” and “not spam” in email \n\
    service providers can be a classification problem. In the fol-\nlowing, we summarize\
    \ the common classification problems.\n• Binary classification: It refers to the\
    \ classification tasks \nhaving two class labels such as “true and false” or “yes\
    \ \nand no” [41]. In such binary classification tasks, one \nclass could be the\
    \ normal state, while the abnormal \nstate could be another class. For instance,\
    \ “cancer not \ndetected” is the normal state of a task that involves a \nmedical\
    \ test, and “cancer detected” could be considered \nas the abnormal state. Similarly,\
    \ “spam” and “not spam” \nin the above example of email service providers are\
    \ con-\nsidered as binary classification.\n• Multiclass classification: Traditionally,\
    \ this refers to \nthose classification tasks having more than two class \nlabels\
    \ [41]. The multiclass classification does not have \nthe principle of normal\
    \ and abnormal outcomes, unlike \nbinary classification tasks. Instead, within\
    \ a range of \nspecified classes, examples are classified as belonging \nto one.\
    \ For example, it can be a multiclass classification \ntask to classify various\
    \ types of network attacks in the \nNSL-KDD [119] dataset, where the attack categories\
    \ \nare classified into four class labels, such as DoS (Denial \nof Service Attack),\
    \ U2R (User to Root Attack), R2L \n(Root to Local Attack), and Probing Attack.\n\
    • Multi-label classification: In machine learning, multi-\nlabel classification\
    \ is an important consideration where \nan example is associated with several\
    \ classes or labels. \nThus, it is a generalization of multiclass classification,\
    \ \nwhere the classes involved in the problem are hierar-\nchically structured,\
    \ and each example may simultane-\nously belong to more than one class in each\
    \ hierarchical \nlevel, e.g., multi-level text classification. For instance, \n\
    Google news can be presented under the categories of a \n“city name”, “technology”,\
    \ or “latest news”, etc. Multi-\nlabel classification includes advanced machine\
    \ learn-\ning algorithms that support predicting various mutually \nnon-exclusive\
    \ classes or labels, unlike traditional clas-\nsification tasks where class labels\
    \ are mutually exclu-\nsive [82].\nMany classification algorithms have been proposed\
    \ in the \nmachine learning and data science literature [41, 125]. In \nthe following,\
    \ we summarize the most common and popular \nmethods that are used widely in various\
    \ application areas.\n– Naive Bayes (NB): The naive Bayes algorithm is based \n\
    on the Bayes’ theorem with the assumption of independ-\nence between each pair\
    \ of features [51]. It works well and \ncan be used for both binary and multi-class\
    \ categories \nin many real-world situations, such as document or text \nclassification,\
    \ spam filtering, etc. To effectively classify \nthe noisy instances in the data\
    \ and to construct a robust \nprediction model, the NB classifier can be used\
    \ [94]. \nThe key benefit is that, compared to more sophisticated \napproaches,\
    \ it needs a small amount of training data \nto estimate the necessary parameters\
    \ and quickly [82]. \nHowever, its performance may affect due to its strong \n\
    assumptions on features independence. Gaussian, Multi-\nnomial, Complement, Bernoulli,\
    \ and Categorical are the \ncommon variants of NB classifier [82].\n– Linear Discriminant\
    \ Analysis (LDA): Linear Discrimi-\nnant Analysis (LDA) is a linear decision boundary\
    \ clas-\nsifier created by fitting class conditional densities to data \nand applying\
    \ Bayes’ rule [51, 82]. This method is also \nknown as a generalization of Fisher’s\
    \ linear discriminant, \nwhich projects a given dataset into a lower-dimensional\
    \ \nspace, i.e., a reduction of dimensionality that minimizes \nFig. 3  A general\
    \ structure of a machine learning based predictive \nmodel considering both the\
    \ training and testing phase\n \nSN Computer Science (2021) 2:160\n160 \nPage\
    \ 6 of 21\nSN Computer Science\nthe complexity of the model or reduces the resulting\
    \ \nmodel’s computational costs. The standard LDA model \nusually suits each class\
    \ with a Gaussian density, assum-\ning that all classes share the same covariance\
    \ matrix \n[82]. LDA is closely related to ANOVA (analysis of \nvariance) and\
    \ regression analysis, which seek to express \none dependent variable as a linear\
    \ combination of other \nfeatures or measurements.\n– Logistic regression (LR):\
    \ Another common probabilistic \nbased statistical model used to solve classification\
    \ issues \nin machine learning is Logistic Regression (LR) [64]. \nLogistic regression\
    \ typically uses a logistic function to \nestimate the probabilities, which is\
    \ also referred to as \nthe mathematically defined sigmoid function in Eq. 1.\
    \ \nIt can overfit high-dimensional datasets and works well \nwhen the dataset\
    \ can be separated linearly. The regulari-\nzation (L1 and L2) techniques [82]\
    \ can be used to avoid \nover-fitting in such scenarios. The assumption of linear-\n\
    ity between the dependent and independent variables is \nconsidered as a major\
    \ drawback of Logistic Regression. \nIt can be used for both classification and\
    \ regression prob-\nlems, but it is more commonly used for classification. \n\
    – K-nearest neighbors (KNN): K-Nearest Neighbors \n(KNN) [9] is an “instance-based\
    \ learning” or non-gen-\neralizing learning, also known as a “lazy learning” algo-\n\
    rithm. It does not focus on constructing a general internal \nmodel; instead,\
    \ it stores all instances corresponding to \ntraining data in n-dimensional space.\
    \ KNN uses data and \nclassifies new data points based on similarity measures\
    \ \n(e.g., Euclidean distance function) [82]. Classification is \ncomputed from\
    \ a simple majority vote of the k nearest \nneighbors of each point. It is quite\
    \ robust to noisy train-\ning data, and accuracy depends on the data quality.\
    \ The \nbiggest issue with KNN is to choose the optimal number \nof neighbors\
    \ to be considered. KNN can be used both for \nclassification as well as regression.\n\
    – Support vector machine (SVM): In machine learning, \nanother common technique\
    \ that can be used for classi-\nfication, regression, or other tasks is a support\
    \ vector \nmachine (SVM) [56]. In high- or infinite-dimensional \nspace, a support\
    \ vector machine constructs a hyper-plane \nor set of hyper-planes. Intuitively,\
    \ the hyper-plane, which \nhas the greatest distance from the nearest training\
    \ data \npoints in any class, achieves a strong separation since, in \ngeneral,\
    \ the greater the margin, the lower the classifier’s \ngeneralization error. It\
    \ is effective in high-dimensional \nspaces and can behave differently based on\
    \ different \nmathematical functions known as the kernel. Linear, \npolynomial,\
    \ radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid, etc., \n(1)\ng(z) =\n1\n1 + exp(−z).\n\
    are the popular kernel functions used in SVM classifier \n[82]. However, when\
    \ the data set contains more noise, \nsuch as overlapping target classes, SVM\
    \ does not per-\nform well.\n– Decision tree (DT): Decision tree (DT) [88] is\
    \ a well-\nknown non-parametric supervised learning method. \nDT learning methods\
    \ are used for both the classifica-\ntion and regression tasks [82]. ID3 [87],\
    \ C4.5 [88], and \nCART [20] are well known for DT algorithms. Moreover, \nrecently\
    \ proposed BehavDT [100], and IntrudTree [97] \nby Sarker et al. are effective\
    \ in the relevant application \ndomains, such as user behavior analytics and cyberse-\n\
    curity analytics, respectively. By sorting down the tree \nfrom the root to some\
    \ leaf nodes, as shown in Fig. 4, DT \nclassifies the instances. Instances are\
    \ classified by check-\ning the attribute defined by that node, starting at the\
    \ root \nnode of the tree, and then moving down the tree branch \ncorresponding\
    \ to the attribute value. For splitting, the \nmost popular criteria are “gini”\
    \ for the Gini impurity and \n“entropy” for the information gain that can be expressed\
    \ \nmathematically as [82]. \n– Random forest (RF): A random forest classifier\
    \ [19] \nis well known as an ensemble classification technique \nthat is used\
    \ in the field of machine learning and data \nscience in various application areas.\
    \ This method uses \n(2)\nEntropy ∶ H(x) = −\nn\n∑\ni=1\np(xi) log2 p(xi)\n(3)\n\
    Gini(E) =1 −\nc\n∑\ni=1\npi\n2.\nFig. 4  An example of a decision tree structure\n\

    \ ensembling” which fits several decision tree \nclassifiers in parallel, as shown\
    \ in Fig. 5, on different \ndata set sub-samples and uses majority voting or aver-\n\
    ages for the outcome or final result. It thus minimizes \nthe over-fitting problem\
    \ and increases the prediction \naccuracy and control [82]. Therefore, the RF\
    \ learning \nmodel with multiple decision trees is typically more \naccurate than\
    \ a single decision tree based model [106]. \nTo build a series of decision trees\
    \ with controlled vari-\nation, it combines bootstrap aggregation (bagging) [18]\
    \ \nand random feature selection [11]. It is adaptable to \nboth classification\
    \ and regression problems and fits \nwell for both categorical and continuous\
    \ values.\n– Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost): Adaptive Boost-\ning (AdaBoost) is\
    \ an ensemble learning process that \nemploys an iterative approach to improve\
    \ poor classi-\nfiers by learning from their errors. This is developed \nby Yoav\
    \ Freund et al. [35] and also known as “meta-\nlearning”. Unlike the random forest\
    \ that uses parallel \nensembling, Adaboost uses “sequential ensembling”. \nIt\
    \ creates a powerful classifier by combining many \npoorly performing classifiers\
    \ to obtain a good classi-\nfier of high accuracy. In that sense, AdaBoost is\
    \ called \nan adaptive classifier by significantly improving the \nefficiency\
    \ of the classifier, but in some instances, it \ncan trigger overfits. AdaBoost\
    \ is best used to boost the \nperformance of decision trees, base estimator [82],\
    \ on \nbinary classification problems, however, is sensitive to \nnoisy data and\
    \ outliers.\n– Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost): Gradient Boost-\ning, like\
    \ Random Forests [19] above, is an ensemble \nlearning algorithm that generates\
    \ a final model based \non a series of individual models, typically decision \n\
    trees. The gradient is used to minimize the loss func-\ntion, similar to how neural\
    \ networks [41] use gradient \ndescent to optimize weights. Extreme Gradient Boosting\
    \ \n(XGBoost) is a form of gradient boosting that takes more \ndetailed approximations\
    \ into account when determining \nthe best model [82]. It computes second-order\
    \ gradients \nof the loss function to minimize loss and advanced regu-\nlarization\
    \ (L1 and L2) [82], which reduces over-fitting, \nand improves model generalization\
    \ and performance. \nXGBoost is fast to interpret and can handle large-sized \n\
    datasets well.\n– Stochastic gradient descent (SGD): Stochastic gradient \ndescent\
    \ (SGD) [41] is an iterative method for optimiz-\ning an objective function with\
    \ appropriate smoothness \nproperties, where the word ‘stochastic’ refers to random\
    \ \nprobability. This reduces the computational burden, par-\nticularly in high-dimensional\
    \ optimization problems, \nallowing for faster iterations in exchange for a lower\
    \ \nconvergence rate. A gradient is the slope of a function \nthat calculates\
    \ a variable’s degree of change in response \nto another variable’s changes. Mathematically,\
    \ the Gradi-\nent Descent is a convex function whose output is a partial \nderivative\
    \ of a set of its input parameters. Let, 훼 is the \nlearning rate, and Ji is the\
    \ training example cost of ith , \nthen Eq. (4) represents the stochastic gradient\
    \ descent \nweight update method at the jth iteration. In large-scale \nand sparse\
    \ machine learning, SGD has been successfully \napplied to problems often encountered\
    \ in text classifi-\ncation and natural language processing [82]. However, \n\
    SGD is sensitive to feature scaling and needs a range of \nhyperparameters, such\
    \ as the regularization parameter \nand the number of iterations. \n– Rule-based\
    \ classification: The term rule-based classifi-\ncation can be used to refer to\
    \ any classification scheme \nthat makes use of IF-THEN rules for class prediction.\
    \ \nSeveral classification algorithms such as Zero-R [125], \nOne-R [47], decision\
    \ trees [87, 88], DTNB [110], Ripple \nDown Rule learner (RIDOR) [125], Repeated\
    \ Incremen-\ntal Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) [126] \nexist with\
    \ the ability of rule generation. The decision \ntree is one of the most common\
    \ rule-based classifica-\ntion algorithms among these techniques because it has\
    \ \nseveral advantages, such as being easier to interpret; the \nability to handle\
    \ high-dimensional data; simplicity and \nspeed; good accuracy; and the capability\
    \ to produce rules \nfor human clear and understandable classification [127] \n\
    [128]. The decision tree-based rules also provide signifi-\ncant accuracy in a\
    \ prediction model for unseen test cases \n[106]. Since the rules are easily interpretable,\
    \ these rule-\nbased classifiers are often used to produce descriptive \nmodels\
    \ that can describe a system including the entities \nand their relationships.\n\

    160 \nPage 8 of 21\nSN Computer Science\nRegression Analysis\nRegression analysis\
    \ includes several methods of machine \nlearning that allow to predict a continuous\
    \ (y) result variable \nbased on the value of one or more (x) predictor variables\
    \ \n[41]. The most significant distinction between classification \nand regression\
    \ is that classification predicts distinct class \nlabels, while regression facilitates\
    \ the prediction of a con-\ntinuous quantity. Figure 6 shows an example of how\
    \ classifi-\ncation is different with regression models. Some overlaps are \n\
    often found between the two types of machine learning algo-\nrithms. Regression\
    \ models are now widely used in a variety \nof fields, including financial forecasting\
    \ or prediction, cost \nestimation, trend analysis, marketing, time series estimation,\
    \ \ndrug response modeling, and many more. Some of the famil-\niar types of regression\
    \ algorithms are linear, polynomial, \nlasso and ridge regression, etc., which\
    \ are explained briefly \nin the following.\n• Simple and multiple linear regression:\
    \ This is one of \nthe most popular ML modeling techniques as well as \na well-known\
    \ regression technique. In this technique, \nthe dependent variable is continuous,\
    \ the independent \nvariable(s) can be continuous or discrete, and the form \n\
    of the regression line is linear. Linear regression creates \na relationship between\
    \ the dependent variable (Y) and \none or more independent variables (X) (also\
    \ known as \nregression line) using the best fit straight line [41]. It is \n\
    defined by the following equations: \n where a is the intercept, b is the slope\
    \ of the line, and e \nis the error term. This equation can be used to predict\
    \ the \n(5)\ny =a + bx + e\n(6)\ny =a + b1x1 + b2x2 + ⋯ + bnxn + e,\nvalue of\
    \ the target variable based on the given predictor \nvariable(s). Multiple linear\
    \ regression is an extension of \nsimple linear regression that allows two or\
    \ more predic-\ntor variables to model a response variable, y, as a linear \n\
    function [41] defined in Eq. 6, whereas simple linear \nregression has only 1\
    \ independent variable, defined in \nEq. 5.\n• Polynomial regression: Polynomial\
    \ regression is a form \nof regression analysis in which the relationship between\
    \ \nthe independent variable x and the dependent variable y \nis not linear, but\
    \ is the polynomial degree of nth in x [82]. \nThe equation for polynomial regression\
    \ is also derived \nfrom linear regression (polynomial regression of degree \n\
    1) equation, which is defined as below: \n Here, y is the predicted/target output,\
    \ b0, b1, ...bn are the \nregression coefficients, x is an independent/ input\
    \ vari-\nable. In simple words, we can say that if data are not dis-\ntributed\
    \ linearly, instead it is nth degree of polynomial \nthen we use polynomial regression\
    \ to get desired output.\n• LASSO and ridge regression: LASSO and Ridge regres-\n\
    sion are well known as powerful techniques which are \ntypically used for building\
    \ learning models in presence \nof a large number of features, due to their capability\
    \ to \npreventing over-fitting and reducing the complexity of \nthe model. The\
    \ LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and \nselection operator) regression model uses\
    \ L1 regulariza-\ntion technique [82] that uses shrinkage, which penalizes \n\
    “absolute value of magnitude of coefficients” (L1 pen-\nalty). As a result, LASSO\
    \ appears to render coefficients \nto absolute zero. Thus, LASSO regression aims\
    \ to find \nthe subset of predictors that minimizes the prediction \nerror for\
    \ a quantitative response variable. On the other \nhand, ridge regression uses\
    \ L2 regularization [82], which \nis the “squared magnitude of coefficients” (L2\
    \ penalty). \nThus, ridge regression forces the weights to be small but \nnever\
    \ sets the coefficient value to zero, and does a non-\nsparse solution. Overall,\
    \ LASSO regression is useful to \nobtain a subset of predictors by eliminating\
    \ less impor-\ntant features, and ridge regression is useful when a data \nset\
    \ has “multicollinearity” which refers to the predictors \nthat are correlated\
    \ with other predictors.\nCluster Analysis\nCluster analysis, also known as clustering,\
    \ is an unsuper-\nvised machine learning technique for identifying and group-\n\
    ing related data points in large datasets without concern for \nthe specific outcome.\
    \ It does grouping a collection of objects \nin such a way that objects in the\

    \ It is often used as a data analy-\nsis technique to discover interesting trends\
    \ or patterns in \ndata, e.g., groups of consumers based on their behavior. In\
    \ \na broad range of application areas, such as cybersecurity, \ne-commerce, mobile\
    \ data processing, health analytics, user \nmodeling and behavioral analytics,\
    \ clustering can be used. \nIn the following, we briefly discuss and summarize\
    \ various \ntypes of clustering methods.\n– Partitioning methods: Based on the\
    \ features and simi-\nlarities in the data, this clustering approach categorizes\
    \ \nthe data into multiple groups or clusters. The data sci-\nentists or analysts\
    \ typically determine the number of \nclusters either dynamically or statically\
    \ depending on \nthe nature of the target applications, to produce for the \n\
    methods of clustering. The most common clustering \nalgorithms based on partitioning\
    \ methods are K-means \n[69], K-Mediods [80], CLARA [55] etc.\n– Density-based\
    \ methods: To identify distinct groups or \nclusters, it uses the concept that\
    \ a cluster in the data \nspace is a contiguous region of high point density iso-\n\
    lated from other such clusters by contiguous regions of \nlow point density. Points\
    \ that are not part of a cluster are \nconsidered as noise. The typical clustering\
    \ algorithms \nbased on density are DBSCAN [32], OPTICS [12] etc. \nThe density-based\
    \ methods typically struggle with clus-\nters of similar density and high dimensionality\
    \ data.\n– Hierarchical-based methods: Hierarchical clustering \ntypically seeks\
    \ to construct a hierarchy of clusters, i.e., \nthe tree structure. Strategies\
    \ for hierarchical cluster-\ning generally fall into two types: (i) Agglomerative—a\
    \ \n“bottom-up” approach in which each observation begins \nin its cluster and\
    \ pairs of clusters are combined as one, \nmoves up the hierarchy, and (ii) Divisive—a\
    \ “top-down” \napproach in which all observations begin in one cluster \nand splits\
    \ are performed recursively, moves down the \nhierarchy, as shown in Fig 7. Our\
    \ earlier proposed BOTS \ntechnique, Sarker et al. [102] is an example of a hierar-\n\
    chical, particularly, bottom-up clustering algorithm.\n– Grid-based methods: To\
    \ deal with massive datasets, grid-\nbased clustering is especially suitable.\
    \ To obtain clusters, \nthe principle is first to summarize the dataset with a\
    \ grid \nrepresentation and then to combine grid cells. STING \n[122], CLIQUE\
    \ [6], etc. are the standard algorithms of \ngrid-based clustering.\n– Model-based\
    \ methods: There are mainly two types of \nmodel-based clustering algorithms:\
    \ one that uses statisti-\ncal learning, and the other based on a method of neural\
    \ \nnetwork learning [130]. For instance, GMM [89] is an \nexample of a statistical\
    \ learning method, and SOM [22] \n[96] is an example of a neural network learning\
    \ method.\n– Constraint-based methods: Constrained-based clustering \nis a semi-supervised\
    \ approach to data clustering that uses \nconstraints to incorporate domain knowledge.\
    \ Applica-\ntion or user-oriented constraints are incorporated to per-\nform the\
    \ clustering. The typical algorithms of this kind \nof clustering are COP K-means\
    \ [121], CMWK-Means \n[27], etc.\nMany clustering algorithms have been proposed\
    \ with the \nability to grouping data in machine learning and data sci-\nence\
    \ literature [41, 125]. In the following, we summarize the \npopular methods that\
    \ are used widely in various application \nareas.\n– K-means clustering: K-means\
    \ clustering [69] is a fast, \nrobust, and simple algorithm that provides reliable\
    \ results \nwhen data sets are well-separated from each other. The \ndata points\
    \ are allocated to a cluster in this algorithm \nin such a way that the amount\
    \ of the squared distance \nbetween the data points and the centroid is as small\
    \ as \npossible. In other words, the K-means algorithm identi-\nfies the k number\
    \ of centroids and then assigns each data \npoint to the nearest cluster while\
    \ keeping the centroids as \nsmall as possible. Since it begins with a random\
    \ selection \nof cluster centers, the results can be inconsistent. Since \nextreme\
    \ values can easily affect a mean, the K-means \nclustering algorithm is sensitive\
    \ to outliers. K-medoids \nclustering [91] is a variant of K-means that is more\
    \ robust \nto noises and outliers.\n– Mean-shift clustering: Mean-shift clustering\
    \ [37] is \na nonparametric clustering technique that does not \nrequire prior\
    \ knowledge of the number of clusters or \nconstraints on cluster shape. Mean-shift\
    \ clustering \naims to discover “blobs” in a smooth distribution or \nFig. 7 \
    \ A graphical interpretation of the widely-used hierarchical clus-\ntering (Bottom-up\
    \ and top-down) technique\n \nSN Computer Science (2021) 2:160\n160 \nPage 10\
    \ of 21\nSN Computer Science\ndensity of samples [82]. It is a centroid-based\
    \ algo-\nrithm that works by updating centroid candidates to be \nthe mean of\
    \ the points in a given region. To form the \nfinal set of centroids, these candidates\
    \ are filtered in a \npost-processing stage to remove near-duplicates. Clus-\n\
    ter analysis in computer vision and image processing \nare examples of application\
    \ domains. Mean Shift has \nthe disadvantage of being computationally expensive.\
    \ \nMoreover, in cases of high dimension, where the num-\nber of clusters shifts\
    \ abruptly, the mean-shift algorithm \ndoes not work well.\n– DBSCAN: Density-based\
    \ spatial clustering of applica-\ntions with noise (DBSCAN) [32] is a base algorithm\
    \ for \ndensity-based clustering which is widely used in data \nmining and machine\
    \ learning. This is known as a non-\nparametric density-based clustering technique\
    \ for sepa-\nrating high-density clusters from low-density clusters \nthat are\
    \ used in model building. DBSCAN’s main idea \nis that a point belongs to a cluster\
    \ if it is close to many \npoints from that cluster. It can find clusters of various\
    \ \nshapes and sizes in a vast volume of data that is noisy \nand contains outliers.\
    \ DBSCAN, unlike k-means, does \nnot require a priori specification of the number\
    \ of clus-\nters in the data and can find arbitrarily shaped clusters. \nAlthough\
    \ k-means is much faster than DBSCAN, it is \nefficient at finding high-density\
    \ regions and outliers, i.e., \nis robust to outliers.\n– GMM clustering: Gaussian\
    \ mixture models (GMMs) are \noften used for data clustering, which is a distribution-\n\
    based clustering algorithm. A Gaussian mixture model \nis a probabilistic model\
    \ in which all the data points are \nproduced by a mixture of a finite number\
    \ of Gaussian \ndistributions with unknown parameters [82]. To find the \nGaussian\
    \ parameters for each cluster, an optimization \nalgorithm called expectation-maximization\
    \ (EM) [82] \ncan be used. EM is an iterative method that uses a sta-\ntistical\
    \ model to estimate the parameters. In contrast to \nk-means, Gaussian mixture\
    \ models account for uncer-\ntainty and return the likelihood that a data point\
    \ belongs \nto one of the k clusters. GMM clustering is more robust \nthan k-means\
    \ and works well even with non-linear data \ndistributions.\n– Agglomerative hierarchical\
    \ clustering: The most com-\nmon method of hierarchical clustering used to group\
    \ \nobjects in clusters based on their similarity is agglom-\nerative clustering.\
    \ This technique uses a bottom-up \napproach, where each object is first treated\
    \ as a singleton \ncluster by the algorithm. Following that, pairs of clus-\n\
    ters are merged one by one until all clusters have been \nmerged into a single\
    \ large cluster containing all objects. \nThe result is a dendrogram, which is\
    \ a tree-based repre-\nsentation of the elements. Single linkage [115], Complete\
    \ \nlinkage [116], BOTS [102] etc. are some examples of \nsuch techniques. The\
    \ main advantage of agglomerative \nhierarchical clustering over k-means is that\
    \ the tree-struc-\nture hierarchy generated by agglomerative clustering is \n\
    more informative than the unstructured collection of flat \nclusters returned\
    \ by k-means, which can help to make \nbetter decisions in the relevant application\
    \ areas.\nDimensionality Reduction and Feature Learning\nIn machine learning and\
    \ data science, high-dimensional \ndata processing is a challenging task for both\
    \ researchers \nand application developers. Thus, dimensionality reduc-\ntion\
    \ which is an unsupervised learning technique, is impor-\ntant because it leads\
    \ to better human interpretations, lower \ncomputational costs, and avoids overfitting\
    \ and redundancy \nby simplifying models. Both the process of feature selec-\n\
    tion and feature extraction can be used for dimensionality \nreduction. The primary\
    \ distinction between the selection and \nextraction of features is that the “feature\
    \ selection” keeps a \nsubset of the original features [97], while “feature extrac-\n\
    tion” creates brand new ones [98]. In the following, we \nbriefly discuss these\
    \ techniques.\n– Feature selection: The selection of features, also known \nas\
    \ the selection of variables or attributes in the data, is \nthe process of choosing\
    \ a subset of unique features (vari-\nables, predictors) to use in building machine\
    \ learning and \ndata science model. It decreases a model’s complexity by \neliminating\
    \ the irrelevant or less important features and \nallows for faster training of\
    \ machine learning algorithms. \nA right and optimal subset of the selected features\
    \ in a \nproblem domain is capable to minimize the overfitting \nproblem through\
    \ simplifying and generalizing the model \nas well as increases the model’s accuracy\
    \ [97]. Thus, \n“feature selection” [66, 99] is considered as one of the \nprimary\
    \ concepts in machine learning that greatly affects \nthe effectiveness and efficiency\
    \ of the target machine \nlearning model. Chi-squared test, Analysis of variance\
    \ \n(ANOVA) test, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, recur-\nsive feature elimination,\
    \ are some popular techniques that \ncan be used for feature selection.\n– Feature\
    \ extraction: In a machine learning-based model \nor system, feature extraction\
    \ techniques usually provide \na better understanding of the data, a way to improve\
    \ pre-\ndiction accuracy, and to reduce computational cost or \ntraining time.\
    \ The aim of “feature extraction” [66, 99] is \nto reduce the number of features\
    \ in a dataset by generat-\ning new ones from the existing ones and then discarding\
    \ \nthe original features. The majority of the information \nfound in the original\
    \ set of features can then be summa-\nrized using this new reduced set of features.\
    \ For instance, \nprincipal components analysis (PCA) is often used as a \ndimensionality-reduction\
    \ technique to extract a lower-\nSN Computer Science (2021) 2:160 \nPage 11 of\
    \ 21 \n160\nSN Computer Science\ndimensional space creating new brand components\
    \ from \nthe existing features in a dataset [98].\nMany algorithms have been proposed\
    \ to reduce data dimen-\nsions in the machine learning and data science literature\
    \ [41, \n125]. In the following, we summarize the popular methods \nthat are used\
    \ widely in various application areas.\n• Variance threshold: A simple basic approach\
    \ to feature \nselection is the variance threshold [82]. This excludes all \n\
    features of low variance, i.e., all features whose variance \ndoes not exceed\
    \ the threshold. It eliminates all zero-var-\niance characteristics by default,\
    \ i.e., characteristics that \nhave the same value in all samples. This feature\
    \ selection \nalgorithm looks only at the (X) features, not the (y) out-\nputs\
    \ needed, and can, therefore, be used for unsupervised \nlearning.\n• Pearson\
    \ correlation: Pearson’s correlation is another \nmethod to understand a feature’s\
    \ relation to the response \nvariable and can be used for feature selection [99].\
    \ This \nmethod is also used for finding the association between \nthe features\
    \ in a dataset. The resulting value is [−1, 1] , \nwhere −1 means perfect negative\
    \ correlation, +1 means \nperfect positive correlation, and 0 means that the two\
    \ \nvariables do not have a linear correlation. If two random \nvariables represent\
    \ X and Y, then the correlation coef-\nficient between X and Y is defined as [41]\
    \ \n• ANOVA: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statisti-\ncal tool used to verify\
    \ the mean values of two or more \ngroups that differ significantly from each\
    \ other. ANOVA \nassumes a linear relationship between the variables and \nthe\
    \ target and the variables’ normal distribution. To sta-\ntistically test the\
    \ equality of means, the ANOVA method \n(8)\nr(X, Y) =\n∑n\ni=1(Xi − ̄X)(Yi −\
    \ ̄Y)\n\x1E∑n\ni=1(Xi − ̄X)2\n\x1E∑n\ni=1(Yi − ̄Y)2\n.\nutilizes F tests. For\
    \ feature selection, the results ‘ANOVA \nF value’ [82] of this test can be used\
    \ where certain fea-\ntures independent of the goal variable can be omitted.\n\
    • Chi square: The chi-square 휒2 [82] statistic is an esti-\nmate of the difference\
    \ between the effects of a series of \nevents or variables observed and expected\
    \ frequencies. \nThe magnitude of the difference between the real and \nobserved\
    \ values, the degrees of freedom, and the sample \nsize depends on 휒2 . The chi-square\
    \ 휒2 is commonly used \nfor testing relationships between categorical variables.\
    \ If \nOi represents observed value and Ei represents expected \nvalue, then \n\
    • Recursive feature elimination (RFE): Recursive Feature \nElimination (RFE) is\
    \ a brute force approach to feature \nselection. RFE [82] fits the model and removes\
    \ the \nweakest feature before it meets the specified number \nof features. Features\
    \ are ranked by the coefficients or \nfeature significance of the model. RFE aims\
    \ to remove \ndependencies and collinearity in the model by recursively \nremoving\
    \ a small number of features per iteration.\n• Model-based selection: To reduce\
    \ the dimensionality of \nthe data, linear models penalized with the L1 regulariza-\n\
    tion can be used. Least absolute shrinkage and selection \noperator (Lasso) regression\
    \ is a type of linear regression \nthat has the property of shrinking some of\
    \ the coefficients \nto zero [82]. Therefore, that feature can be removed from\
    \ \nthe model. Thus, the penalized lasso regression method, \noften used in machine\
    \ learning to select the subset of \nvariables. Extra Trees Classifier [82] is\
    \ an example of a \ntree-based estimator that can be used to compute impu-\nrity-based\
    \ function importance, which can then be used \nto discard irrelevant features.\n\
    • Principal component analysis (PCA): Principal compo-\nnent analysis (PCA) is\
    \ a well-known unsupervised learn-\n(9)\n휒2 =\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(Oi − Ei)2\nEi\n.\n\
    Fig. 8  An example of a principal component analysis (PCA) and created principal\

    \ (2021) 2:160\n160 \nPage 12 of 21\nSN Computer Science\ning approach in the\
    \ field of machine learning and data \nscience. PCA is a mathematical technique\
    \ that transforms \na set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated \n\
    variables known as principal components [48, 81]. Fig-\nure 8 shows an example\
    \ of the effect of PCA on various \ndimensions space, where Fig. 8a shows the\
    \ original fea-\ntures in 3D space, and Fig. 8b shows the created prin-\ncipal\
    \ components PC1 and PC2 onto a 2D plane, and \n1D line with the principal component\
    \ PC1 respectively. \nThus, PCA can be used as a feature extraction technique\
    \ \nthat reduces the dimensionality of the datasets, and to \nbuild an effective\
    \ machine learning model [98]. Techni-\ncally, PCA identifies the completely transformed\
    \ with the \nhighest eigenvalues of a covariance matrix and then uses \nthose\
    \ to project the data into a new subspace of equal or \nfewer dimensions [82].\n\
    Association Rule Learning\nAssociation rule learning is a rule-based machine learn-\n\
    ing approach to discover interesting relationships, “IF-\nTHEN” statements, in\
    \ large datasets between variables \n[7]. One example is that “if a customer buys\
    \ a computer or \nlaptop (an item), s/he is likely to also buy anti-virus soft-\n\
    ware (another item) at the same time”. Association rules \nare employed today\
    \ in many application areas, including \nIoT services, medical diagnosis, usage\
    \ behavior analytics, \nweb usage mining, smartphone applications, cybersecurity\
    \ \napplications, and bioinformatics. In comparison to sequence \nmining, association\
    \ rule learning does not usually take into \naccount the order of things within\
    \ or across transactions. \nA common way of measuring the usefulness of association\
    \ \nrules is to use its parameter, the ‘support’ and ‘confidence’, \nwhich is\
    \ introduced in [7].\nIn the data mining literature, many association rule learn-\n\
    ing methods have been proposed, such as logic dependent \n[34], frequent pattern\
    \ based [8, 49, 68], and tree-based [42]. \nThe most popular association rule\
    \ learning algorithms are \nsummarized below.\n– AIS and SETM: AIS is the first\
    \ algorithm proposed by \nAgrawal et al. [7] for association rule mining. The\
    \ AIS \nalgorithm’s main downside is that too many candidate \nitemsets are generated,\
    \ requiring more space and wasting \na lot of effort. This algorithm calls for\
    \ too many passes \nover the entire dataset to produce the rules. Another \napproach\
    \ SETM [49] exhibits good performance and \nstable behavior with execution time;\
    \ however, it suffers \nfrom the same flaw as the AIS algorithm.\n– Apriori: For\
    \ generating association rules for a given data-\nset, Agrawal et al. [8] proposed\
    \ the Apriori, Apriori-TID, \nand Apriori-Hybrid algorithms. These later algorithms\
    \ \noutperform the AIS and SETM mentioned above due to \nthe Apriori property\
    \ of frequent itemset [8]. The term \n‘Apriori’ usually refers to having prior\
    \ knowledge of \nfrequent itemset properties. Apriori uses a “bottom-up” \napproach,\
    \ where it generates the candidate itemsets. To \nreduce the search space, Apriori\
    \ uses the property “all \nsubsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent; and\
    \ if an \nitemset is infrequent, then all its supersets must also be \ninfrequent”.\
    \ Another approach predictive Apriori [108] \ncan also generate rules; however,\
    \ it receives unexpected \nresults as it combines both the support and confidence.\
    \ \nThe Apriori [8] is the widely applicable techniques in \nmining association\
    \ rules.\n– ECLAT: This technique was proposed by Zaki et al. [131] \nand stands\
    \ for Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-\nup Lattice Traversal. ECLAT uses\
    \ a depth-first search to \nfind frequent itemsets. In contrast to the Apriori\
    \ [8] algo-\nrithm, which represents data in a horizontal pattern, it \nrepresents\
    \ data vertically. Hence, the ECLAT algorithm \nis more efficient and scalable\
    \ in the area of association \nrule learning. This algorithm is better suited\
    \ for small \nand medium datasets whereas the Apriori algorithm is \nused for\
    \ large datasets.\n– FP-Growth: Another common association rule learning \ntechnique\
    \ based on the frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) \nproposed by Han et al. [42] is\
    \ Frequent Pattern Growth, \nknown as FP-Growth. The key difference with Apriori\
    \ \nis that while generating rules, the Apriori algorithm [8] \ngenerates frequent\
    \ candidate itemsets; on the other hand, \nthe FP-growth algorithm [42] prevents\
    \ candidate genera-\ntion and thus produces a tree by the successful strategy\
    \ of \n‘divide and conquer’ approach. Due to its sophistication, \nhowever, FP-Tree\
    \ is challenging to use in an interactive \nmining environment [133]. Thus, the\
    \ FP-Tree would not \nfit into memory for massive data sets, making it chal-\n\
    lenging to process big data as well. Another solution is \nRARM (Rapid Association\
    \ Rule Mining) proposed by \nDas et al. [26] but faces a related FP-tree issue\
    \ [133].\n– ABC-RuleMiner: A rule-based machine learning method, \nrecently proposed\
    \ in our earlier paper, by Sarker et al. \n[104], to discover the interesting\
    \ non-redundant rules to \nprovide real-world intelligent services. This algorithm\
    \ \neffectively identifies the redundancy in associations \nby taking into account\
    \ the impact or precedence of the \nrelated contextual features and discovers\
    \ a set of non-\nredundant association rules. This algorithm first con-\nstructs\
    \ an association generation tree (AGT), a top-down \napproach, and then extracts\
    \ the association rules through \ntraversing the tree. Thus, ABC-RuleMiner is\
    \ more potent \nthan traditional rule-based methods in terms of both \nnon-redundant\
    \ rule generation and intelligent decision-\nmaking, particularly in a context-aware\
    \ smart comput-\ning environment, where human or user preferences are \ninvolved.\n\

    Among the association rule learning techniques discussed \nabove, Apriori [8]\
    \ is the most widely used algorithm for \ndiscovering association rules from a\
    \ given dataset [133]. \nThe main strength of the association learning technique\
    \ is \nits comprehensiveness, as it generates all associations that \nsatisfy\
    \ the user-specified constraints, such as minimum sup-\nport and confidence value.\
    \ The ABC-RuleMiner approach \n[104] discussed earlier could give significant\
    \ results in terms \nof non-redundant rule generation and intelligent decision-\n\
    making for the relevant application areas in the real world.\nReinforcement Learning\n\
    Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning tech-\nnique that allows an\
    \ agent to learn by trial and error in an \ninteractive environment using input\
    \ from its actions and \nexperiences. Unlike supervised learning, which is based\
    \ on \ngiven sample data or examples, the RL method is based on \ninteracting\
    \ with the environment. The problem to be solved \nin reinforcement learning (RL)\
    \ is defined as a Markov Deci-\nsion Process (MDP) [86], i.e., all about sequentially\
    \ making \ndecisions. An RL problem typically includes four elements \nsuch as\
    \ Agent, Environment, Rewards, and Policy.\nRL can be split roughly into Model-based\
    \ and Model-\nfree techniques. Model-based RL is the process of infer-\nring optimal\
    \ behavior from a model of the environment \nby performing actions and observing\
    \ the results, which \ninclude the next state and the immediate reward [85]. Alp-\n\
    haZero, AlphaGo [113] are examples of the model-based \napproaches. On the other\
    \ hand, a model-free approach \ndoes not use the distribution of the transition\
    \ probability \nand the reward function associated with MDP. Q-learn-\ning, Deep\
    \ Q Network, Monte Carlo Control, SARSA \n(State–Action–Reward–State–Action),\
    \ etc. are some exam-\nples of model-free algorithms [52]. The policy network,\
    \ \nwhich is required for model-based RL but not for model-\nfree, is the key\
    \ difference between model-free and model-\nbased learning. In the following,\
    \ we discuss the popular RL \nalgorithms.\n– Monte Carlo methods: Monte Carlo\
    \ techniques, or Monte \nCarlo experiments, are a wide category of computational\
    \ \nalgorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to \nobtain numerical results\
    \ [52]. The underlying concept is \nto use randomness to solve problems that are\
    \ determinis-\ntic in principle. Optimization, numerical integration, and \nmaking\
    \ drawings from the probability distribution are the \nthree problem classes where\
    \ Monte Carlo techniques are \nmost commonly used.\n– Q-learning: Q-learning is\
    \ a model-free reinforcement \nlearning algorithm for learning the quality of\
    \ behaviors \nthat tell an agent what action to take under what condi-\ntions\
    \ [52]. It does not need a model of the environment \n(hence the term “model-free”),\
    \ and it can deal with sto-\nchastic transitions and rewards without the need\
    \ for adap-\ntations. The ‘Q’ in Q-learning usually stands for qual-\nity, as\
    \ the algorithm calculates the maximum expected \nrewards for a given behavior\
    \ in a given state.\n– Deep Q-learning: The basic working step in Deep \nQ-Learning\
    \ [52] is that the initial state is fed into the \nneural network, which returns\
    \ the Q-value of all pos-\nsible actions as an output. Still, when we have a reason-\n\
    ably simple setting to overcome, Q-learning works well. \nHowever, when the number\
    \ of states and actions becomes \nmore complicated, deep learning can be used\
    \ as a func-\ntion approximator.\nReinforcement learning, along with supervised\
    \ and unsu-\npervised learning, is one of the basic machine learning para-\ndigms.\
    \ RL can be used to solve numerous real-world prob-\nlems in various fields, such\
    \ as game theory, control theory, \noperations analysis, information theory, simulation-based\
    \ \noptimization, manufacturing, supply chain logistics, multi-\nagent systems,\
    \ swarm intelligence, aircraft control, robot \nmotion control, and many more.\n\
    Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning\nDeep learning is part of a wider\
    \ family of artificial neural \nnetworks (ANN)-based machine learning approaches\
    \ with \nrepresentation learning. Deep learning provides a computa-\ntional architecture\
    \ by combining several processing layers, \nsuch as input, hidden, and output\
    \ layers, to learn from data \n[41]. The main advantage of deep learning over\
    \ traditional \nmachine learning methods is its better performance in sev-\neral\
    \ cases, particularly learning from large datasets [105, \n129]. Figure 9 shows\
    \ a general performance of deep learning \nover machine learning considering the\
    \ increasing amount of \ndata. However, it may vary depending on the data character-\n\
    istics and experimental set up.\nThe most common deep learning algorithms are:\

    \ learning and deep learning performance in general \nwith the amount of data\n\

    (CNN, or ConvNet), Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent \nNeural Network (LSTM-RNN)\
    \ [96]. In the following, we \ndiscuss various types of deep learning methods\
    \ that can \nbe used to build effective data-driven models for various \npurposes.\n\
    – MLP: The base architecture of deep learning, which is \nalso known as the feed-forward\
    \ artificial neural network, \nis called a multilayer perceptron (MLP) [82]. A\
    \ typical \nMLP is a fully connected network consisting of an input \nlayer, one\
    \ or more hidden layers, and an output layer, \nas shown in Fig. 10. Each node\
    \ in one layer connects \nto each node in the following layer at a certain weight.\
    \ \nMLP utilizes the “Backpropagation” technique [41], the \nmost “fundamental\
    \ building block” in a neural network, \nto adjust the weight values internally\
    \ while building the \nmodel. MLP is sensitive to scaling features and allows\
    \ \na variety of hyperparameters to be tuned, such as the \nnumber of hidden layers,\
    \ neurons, and iterations, which \ncan result in a computationally costly model.\n\
    – CNN or ConvNet: The convolution neural network \n(CNN) [65] enhances the design\
    \ of the standard ANN, \nconsisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, as\
    \ \nwell as fully connected layers, as shown in Fig. 11. \nAs it takes the advantage\
    \ of the two-dimensional (2D) \nstructure of the input data, it is typically broadly\
    \ used \nin several areas such as image and video recognition, \nimage processing\
    \ and classification, medical image \nanalysis, natural language processing, etc.\
    \ While \nCNN has a greater computational burden, without any \nmanual intervention,\
    \ it has the advantage of automati-\ncally detecting the important features, and\
    \ hence CNN \nis considered to be more powerful than conventional \nANN. A number\
    \ of advanced deep learning models \nbased on CNN can be used in the field, such\
    \ as AlexNet \n[60], Xception [24], Inception [118], Visual Geometry \nGroup (VGG)\
    \ [44], ResNet [45], etc.\n– LSTM-RNN: Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an \n\
    artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architec-\nture used in the area of\
    \ deep learning [38]. LSTM has \nfeedback links, unlike normal feed-forward neural\
    \ \nnetworks. LSTM networks are well-suited for analyz-\ning and learning sequential\
    \ data, such as classifying, \nprocessing, and predicting data based on time series\
    \ \ndata, which differentiates it from other conventional \nnetworks. Thus, LSTM\
    \ can be used when the data are \nin a sequential format, such as time, sentence,\
    \ etc., and \ncommonly applied in the area of time-series analysis, \nnatural\
    \ language processing, speech recognition, etc.\nIn addition to these most common\
    \ deep learning \nmethods discussed above, several other deep learning \napproaches\
    \ [96] exist in the area for various purposes. For \ninstance, the self-organizing\
    \ map (SOM) [58] uses unsu-\npervised learning to represent the high-dimensional\
    \ data \nby a 2D grid map, thus achieving dimensionality reduc-\ntion. The autoencoder\
    \ (AE) [15] is another learning tech-\nnique that is widely used for dimensionality\
    \ reduction as \nwell and feature extraction in unsupervised learning tasks. \n\
    Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) [46] can be used \nfor dimensionality reduction,\
    \ classification, regression, \ncollaborative filtering, feature learning, and\
    \ topic mod-\neling. A deep belief network (DBN) is typically composed \nof simple,\
    \ unsupervised networks such as restricted Boltz-\nmann machines (RBMs) or autoencoders,\
    \ and a backprop-\nagation neural network (BPNN) [123]. A generative adver-\n\
    sarial network (GAN) [39] is a form of the network for \ndeep learning that can\
    \ generate data with characteristics \nclose to the actual data input. Transfer\
    \ learning is currently \nvery common because it can train deep neural networks\
    \ \nwith comparatively low data, which is typically the re-use \nof a new problem\
    \ with a pre-trained model [124]. A brief \ndiscussion of these artificial neural\
    \ networks (ANN) and \ndeep learning (DL) models are summarized in our earlier\
    \ \npaper Sarker et al. [96].\nOverall, based on the learning techniques discussed\
    \ \nabove, we can conclude that various types of machine \nFig. 10  A structure\

    Page 15 of 21 \n160\nSN Computer Science\nlearning techniques, such as classification\
    \ analysis, regres-\nsion, data clustering, feature selection and extraction,\
    \ and \ndimensionality reduction, association rule learning, rein-\nforcement\
    \ learning, or deep learning techniques, can play \na significant role for various\
    \ purposes according to their \ncapabilities. In the following section, we discuss\
    \ several \napplication areas based on machine learning algorithms.\nApplications\
    \ of Machine Learning\nIn the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(4IR), machine learning becomes popular in various appli-\ncation areas, because\
    \ of its learning capabilities from the \npast and making intelligent decisions.\
    \ In the following, \nwe summarize and discuss ten popular application areas \n\
    of machine learning technology.\n– Predictive analytics and intelligent decision-making:\
    \ A \nmajor application field of machine learning is intelli-\ngent decision-making\
    \ by data-driven predictive analyt-\nics [21, 70]. The basis of predictive analytics\
    \ is captur-\ning and exploiting relationships between explanatory \nvariables\
    \ and predicted variables from previous events \nto predict the unknown outcome\
    \ [41]. For instance, \nidentifying suspects or criminals after a crime has \n\
    been committed, or detecting credit card fraud as it \nhappens. Another application,\
    \ where machine learn-\ning algorithms can assist retailers in better understand-\n\
    ing consumer preferences and behavior, better manage \ninventory, avoiding out-of-stock\
    \ situations, and opti-\nmizing logistics and warehousing in e-commerce. Vari-\n\
    ous machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, \nsupport vector machines,\
    \ artificial neural networks, etc. \n[106, 125] are commonly used in the area.\
    \ Since accu-\nrate predictions provide insight into the unknown, they \ncan improve\
    \ the decisions of industries, businesses, and \nalmost any organization, including\
    \ government agen-\ncies, e-commerce, telecommunications, banking and \nfinancial\
    \ services, healthcare, sales and marketing, \ntransportation, social networking,\
    \ and many others.\n– Cybersecurity and threat intelligence: Cybersecurity is\
    \ \none of the most essential areas of Industry 4.0. [114], \nwhich is typically\
    \ the practice of protecting networks, \nsystems, hardware, and data from digital\
    \ attacks [114]. \nMachine learning has become a crucial cybersecurity \ntechnology\
    \ that constantly learns by analyzing data to \nidentify patterns, better detect\
    \ malware in encrypted \ntraffic, find insider threats, predict where bad neigh-\n\
    borhoods are online, keep people safe while browsing, \nor secure data in the\
    \ cloud by uncovering suspicious \nactivity. For instance, clustering techniques\
    \ can be \nused to identify cyber-anomalies, policy violations, etc. \nTo detect\
    \ various types of cyber-attacks or intrusions \nmachine learning classification\
    \ models by taking into \naccount the impact of security features are useful [97].\
    \ \nVarious deep learning-based security models can also \nbe used on the large\
    \ scale of security datasets [96, 129]. \nMoreover, security policy rules generated\
    \ by associa-\ntion rule learning techniques can play a significant role \nto\
    \ build a rule-based security system [105]. Thus, we \ncan say that various learning\
    \ techniques discussed in \nSect. Machine Learning Tasks and Algorithms, can \n\
    enable cybersecurity professionals to be more proac-\ntive inefficiently preventing\
    \ threats and cyber-attacks.\n– Internet of things (IoT) and smart cities: Internet\
    \ of \nThings (IoT) is another essential area of Industry 4.0. \n[114], which\
    \ turns everyday objects into smart objects \nby allowing them to transmit data\
    \ and automate tasks \nwithout the need for human interaction. IoT is, therefore,\
    \ \nconsidered to be the big frontier that can enhance almost \nall activities\
    \ in our lives, such as smart governance, smart \nhome, education, communication,\
    \ transportation, retail, \nagriculture, health care, business, and many more\
    \ [70]. \nSmart city is one of IoT’s core fields of application, using \ntechnologies\
    \ to enhance city services and residents’ liv-\ning experiences [132, 135]. As\
    \ machine learning utilizes \nexperience to recognize trends and create models\
    \ that \nhelp predict future behavior and events, it has become a \ncrucial technology\
    \ for IoT applications [103]. For exam-\nple, to predict traffic in smart cities,\
    \ parking availabil-\nity prediction, estimate the total usage of energy of the\
    \ \ncitizens for a particular period, make context-aware and \ntimely decisions\
    \ for the people, etc. are some tasks that \ncan be solved using machine learning\
    \ techniques accord-\ning to the current needs of the people.\n– Traffic prediction\
    \ and transportation: Transportation \nsystems have become a crucial component\
    \ of every \ncountry’s economic development. Nonetheless, several \ncities around\
    \ the world are experiencing an excessive \nrise in traffic volume, resulting\
    \ in serious issues such as \ndelays, traffic congestion, higher fuel prices,\
    \ increased \nCO2 pollution, accidents, emergencies, and a decline in \nmodern\
    \ society’s quality of life [40]. Thus, an intelligent \ntransportation system\
    \ through predicting future traffic \nis important, which is an indispensable\
    \ part of a smart \ncity. Accurate traffic prediction based on machine and \n\
    deep learning modeling can help to minimize the issues \n[17, 30, 31]. For example,\
    \ based on the travel history \nand trend of traveling through various routes,\
    \ machine \nlearning can assist transportation companies in predict-\ning possible\
    \ issues that may occur on specific routes and \nrecommending their customers\
    \ to take a different path. \nUltimately, these learning-based data-driven models\
    \ help \nimprove traffic flow, increase the usage and efficiency of \n \nSN Computer\
    \ Science (2021) 2:160\n160 \nPage 16 of 21\nSN Computer Science\nsustainable\
    \ modes of transportation, and limit real-world \ndisruption by modeling and visualizing\
    \ future changes.\n– Healthcare and COVID-19 pandemic: Machine learning \ncan\
    \ help to solve diagnostic and prognostic problems in \na variety of medical domains,\
    \ such as disease prediction, \nmedical knowledge extraction, detecting regularities\
    \ in \ndata, patient management, etc. [33, 77, 112]. Coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19)\
    \ is an infectious disease caused by \na newly discovered coronavirus, according\
    \ to the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) [3]. Recently, the learning \ntechniques\
    \ have become popular in the battle against \nCOVID-19 [61, 63]. For the COVID-19\
    \ pandemic, the \nlearning techniques are used to classify patients at high \n\
    risk, their mortality rate, and other anomalies [61]. It \ncan also be used to\
    \ better understand the virus’s ori-\ngin, COVID-19 outbreak prediction, as well\
    \ as for dis-\nease diagnosis and treatment [14, 50]. With the help of \nmachine\
    \ learning, researchers can forecast where and \nwhen, the COVID-19 is likely\
    \ to spread, and notify those \nregions to match the required arrangements. Deep\
    \ learn-\ning also provides exciting solutions to the problems of \nmedical image\
    \ processing and is seen as a crucial tech-\nnique for potential applications,\
    \ particularly for COVID-\n19 pandemic [10, 78, 111]. Overall, machine and deep\
    \ \nlearning techniques can help to fight the COVID-19 virus \nand the pandemic\
    \ as well as intelligent clinical decisions \nmaking in the domain of healthcare.\n\
    – E-commerce and product recommendations: Product rec-\nommendation is one of\
    \ the most well known and widely \nused applications of machine learning, and\
    \ it is one of \nthe most prominent features of almost any e-commerce \nwebsite\
    \ today. Machine learning technology can assist \nbusinesses in analyzing their\
    \ consumers’ purchasing his-\ntories and making customized product suggestions\
    \ for \ntheir next purchase based on their behavior and prefer-\nences. E-commerce\
    \ companies, for example, can easily \nposition product suggestions and offers\
    \ by analyzing \nbrowsing trends and click-through rates of specific items. \n\
    Using predictive modeling based on machine learning \ntechniques, many online\
    \ retailers, such as Amazon [71], \ncan better manage inventory, prevent out-of-stock\
    \ situa-\ntions, and optimize logistics and warehousing. The future \nof sales\
    \ and marketing is the ability to capture, evaluate, \nand use consumer data to\
    \ provide a customized shopping \nexperience. Furthermore, machine learning techniques\
    \ \nenable companies to create packages and content that are \ntailored to the\
    \ needs of their customers, allowing them to \nmaintain existing customers while\
    \ attracting new ones.\n– NLP and sentiment analysis: Natural language pro-\n\
    cessing (NLP) involves the reading and understanding \nof spoken or written language\
    \ through the medium of \na computer [79, 103]. Thus, NLP helps computers, for\
    \ \ninstance, to read a text, hear speech, interpret it, ana-\nlyze sentiment,\
    \ and decide which aspects are significant, \nwhere machine learning techniques\
    \ can be used. Virtual \npersonal assistant, chatbot, speech recognition, document\
    \ \ndescription, language or machine translation, etc. are \nsome examples of\
    \ NLP-related tasks. Sentiment Analy-\nsis [90] (also referred to as opinion mining\
    \ or emotion \nAI) is an NLP sub-field that seeks to identify and extract \npublic\
    \ mood and views within a given text through blogs, \nreviews, social media, forums,\
    \ news, etc. For instance, \nbusinesses and brands use sentiment analysis to under-\n\
    stand the social sentiment of their brand, product, or \nservice through social\
    \ media platforms or the web as \na whole. Overall, sentiment analysis is considered\
    \ as a \nmachine learning task that analyzes texts for polarity, \nsuch as “positive”,\
    \ “negative”, or “neutral” along with \nmore intense emotions like very happy,\
    \ happy, sad, very \nsad, angry, have interest, or not interested etc.\n– Image,\
    \ speech and pattern recognition: Image recogni-\ntion [36] is a well-known and\
    \ widespread example of \nmachine learning in the real world, which can identify\
    \ an \nobject as a digital image. For instance, to label an x-ray \nas cancerous\
    \ or not, character recognition, or face detec-\ntion in an image, tagging suggestions\
    \ on social media, \ne.g., Facebook, are common examples of image recog-\nnition.\
    \ Speech recognition [23] is also very popular that \ntypically uses sound and\
    \ linguistic models, e.g., Google \nAssistant, Cortana, Siri, Alexa, etc. [67],\
    \ where machine \nlearning methods are used. Pattern recognition [13] is \ndefined\
    \ as the automated recognition of patterns and \nregularities in data, e.g., image\
    \ analysis. Several machine \nlearning techniques such as classification, feature\
    \ selec-\ntion, clustering, or sequence labeling methods are used \nin the area.\n\
    – Sustainable agriculture: Agriculture is essential to the \nsurvival of all human\
    \ activities [109]. Sustainable agri-\nculture practices help to improve agricultural\
    \ productiv-\nity while also reducing negative impacts on the environ-\nment [5,\
    \ 25, 109]. The sustainable agriculture supply \nchains are knowledge-intensive\
    \ and based on informa-\ntion, skills, technologies, etc., where knowledge transfer\
    \ \nencourages farmers to enhance their decisions to adopt \nsustainable agriculture\
    \ practices utilizing the increas-\ning amount of data captured by emerging technologies,\
    \ \ne.g., the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile technologies \nand devices, etc.\
    \ [5, 53, 54]. Machine learning can be \napplied in various phases of sustainable\
    \ agriculture, such \nas in the pre-production phase - for the prediction of crop\
    \ \nyield, soil properties, irrigation requirements, etc.; in the \nproduction\
    \ phase—for weather prediction, disease detec-\ntion, weed detection, soil nutrient\
    \ management, livestock \nmanagement, etc.; in processing phase—for demand esti-\n\
    mation, production planning, etc. and in the distribution \nSN Computer Science\
    \ (2021) 2:160 \nPage 17 of 21 \n160\nSN Computer Science\nphase - the inventory\
    \ management, consumer analysis, \netc.\n– User behavior analytics and context-aware\
    \ smartphone \napplications: Context-awareness is a system’s abil-\nity to capture\
    \ knowledge about its surroundings at any \nmoment and modify behaviors accordingly\
    \ [28, 93]. \nContext-aware computing uses software and hardware \nto automatically\
    \ collect and interpret data for direct \nresponses. The mobile app development\
    \ environment \nhas been changed greatly with the power of AI, particu-\nlarly,\
    \ machine learning techniques through their learning \ncapabilities from contextual\
    \ data [103, 136]. Thus, the \ndevelopers of mobile apps can rely on machine learning\
    \ \nto create smart apps that can understand human behavior, \nsupport, and entertain\
    \ users [107, 137, 140]. To build \nvarious personalized data-driven context-aware\
    \ systems, \nsuch as smart interruption management, smart mobile \nrecommendation,\
    \ context-aware smart searching, deci-\nsion-making that intelligently assist\
    \ end mobile phone \nusers in a pervasive computing environment, machine \nlearning\
    \ techniques are applicable. For example, context-\naware association rules can\
    \ be used to build an intelligent \nphone call application [104]. Clustering approaches\
    \ are \nuseful in capturing users’ diverse behavioral activities by \ntaking into\
    \ account data in time series [102]. To predict \nthe future events in various\
    \ contexts, the classification \nmethods can be used [106, 139]. Thus, various\
    \ learning \ntechniques discussed in Sect. “Machine Learning Tasks \nand Algorithms”\
    \ can help to build context-aware adap-\ntive and smart applications according\
    \ to the preferences \nof the mobile phone users.\nIn addition to these application\
    \ areas, machine learning-\nbased models can also apply to several other domains\
    \ such \nas bioinformatics, cheminformatics, computer networks, \nDNA sequence\
    \ classification, economics and banking, robot-\nics, advanced engineering, and\
    \ many more.\nChallenges and Research Directions\nOur study on machine learning\
    \ algorithms for intelligent \ndata analysis and applications opens several research\
    \ issues \nin the area. Thus, in this section, we summarize and discuss \nthe\
    \ challenges faced and the potential research opportunities \nand future directions.\n\
    In general, the effectiveness and the efficiency of a \nmachine learning-based\
    \ solution depend on the nature and \ncharacteristics of the data, and the performance\
    \ of the learn-\ning algorithms. To collect the data in the relevant domain, \n\
    such as cybersecurity, IoT, healthcare and agriculture dis-\ncussed in Sect. “Applications\
    \ of Machine Learning” is not \nstraightforward, although the current cyberspace\
    \ enables the \nproduction of a huge amount of data with very high fre-\nquency.\
    \ Thus, collecting useful data for the target machine \nlearning-based applications,\
    \ e.g., smart city applications, \nand their management is important to further\
    \ analysis. \nTherefore, a more in-depth investigation of data collection \nmethods\
    \ is needed while working on the real-world data. \nMoreover, the historical data\
    \ may contain many ambiguous \nvalues, missing values, outliers, and meaningless\
    \ data. The \nmachine learning algorithms, discussed in Sect “Machine \nLearning\
    \ Tasks and Algorithms” highly impact on data qual-\nity, and availability for\
    \ training, and consequently on the \nresultant model. Thus, to accurately clean\
    \ and pre-process \nthe diverse data collected from diverse sources is a chal-\n\
    lenging task. Therefore, effectively modifying or enhance \nexisting pre-processing\
    \ methods, or proposing new data \npreparation techniques are required to effectively\
    \ use the \nlearning algorithms in the associated application domain.\nTo analyze\
    \ the data and extract insights, there exist many \nmachine learning algorithms,\
    \ summarized in Sect. “Machine \nLearning Tasks and Algorithms”. Thus, selecting\
    \ a proper \nlearning algorithm that is suitable for the target application \n\
    is challenging. The reason is that the outcome of different \nlearning algorithms\
    \ may vary depending on the data charac-\nteristics [106]. Selecting a wrong learning\
    \ algorithm would \nresult in producing unexpected outcomes that may lead to \n\
    loss of effort, as well as the model’s effectiveness and accu-\nracy. In terms\
    \ of model building, the techniques discussed \nin Sect. “Machine Learning Tasks\
    \ and Algorithms” can \ndirectly be used to solve many real-world issues in diverse\
    \ \ndomains, such as cybersecurity, smart cities and healthcare \nsummarized in\
    \ Sect. “Applications of Machine Learning”. \nHowever, the hybrid learning model,\
    \ e.g., the ensemble of \nmethods, modifying or enhancement of the existing learning\
    \ \ntechniques, or designing new learning methods, could be a \npotential future\
    \ work in the area.\nThus, the ultimate success of a machine learning-based \n\
    solution and corresponding applications mainly depends \non both the data and\
    \ the learning algorithms. If the data \nare bad to learn, such as non-representative,\
    \ poor-quality, \nirrelevant features, or insufficient quantity for training,\
    \ then \nthe machine learning models may become useless or will \nproduce lower\
    \ accuracy. Therefore, effectively processing \nthe data and handling the diverse\
    \ learning algorithms are \nimportant, for a machine learning-based solution and\
    \ eventu-\nally building intelligent applications.\nConclusion\nIn this paper,\
    \ we have conducted a comprehensive overview \nof machine learning algorithms\
    \ for intelligent data analysis \nand applications. According to our goal, we\
    \ have briefly dis-\ncussed how various types of machine learning methods can\
    \ \n \nSN Computer Science (2021) 2:160\n160 \nPage 18 of 21\nSN Computer Science\n\
    be used for making solutions to various real-world issues. \nA successful machine\
    \ learning model depends on both the \ndata and the performance of the learning\
    \ algorithms. The \nsophisticated learning algorithms then need to be trained\
    \ \nthrough the collected real-world data and knowledge related \nto the target\
    \ application before the system can assist with \nintelligent decision-making.\
    \ We also discussed several \npopular application areas based on machine learning\
    \ tech-\nniques to highlight their applicability in various real-world \nissues.\
    \ Finally, we have summarized and discussed the chal-\nlenges faced and the potential\
    \ research opportunities and \nfuture directions in the area. Therefore, the challenges\
    \ that \nare identified create promising research opportunities in the \nfield\
    \ which must be addressed with effective solutions in \nvarious application areas.\
    \ Overall, we believe that our study \non machine learning-based solutions opens\
    \ up a promising \ndirection and can be used as a reference guide for potential\
    \ \nresearch and applications for both academia and industry \nprofessionals as\
    \ well as for decision-makers, from a techni-\ncal point of view.\nDeclaration\

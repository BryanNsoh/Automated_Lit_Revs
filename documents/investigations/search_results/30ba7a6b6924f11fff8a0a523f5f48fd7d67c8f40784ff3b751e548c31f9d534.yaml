    managed with high inputs of fertilizer and irrigation. The objectives of this
    study were to evaluate the interaction between N-fertilizer rates and irrigation
    scheduling using soil moisture sensor irrigation controllers (SMS) on yield, irrigation
    water use efficiency (IWUE) of bell pepper cultivated under plastic mulch and
    drip irrigation. Treatments included three irrigation scheduling and three N-rates
    (176, 220, and 330 kg/ha). Irrigation treatments were: SS 10 , water application
    controlled by SMS-based irrigation set at 10% volumetric water content (VWC) which
    was allotted five irrigation windows daily and bypassed events if the soil VWC
    exceeded the established threshold; SS 12 , threshold set at 12% VWC; and TIME,
    control with irrigation being applied once a day similar to grower irrigation
    management. Marketable yields ranged between 16 and 29 Mg/ha. The SMS treatments
    reduced the applied irrigation in 7 to 62% compared to TIME treatment without
    reducing yield. The treatments SS 10 and SS 12 reduced nitrate leaching by 25
    to 73% compared to TIME treatment. Introduction Florida is the most important
    center of production and distribution of vegetables in the southeastern United
    States with 73,500 ha planted in 2006 and a crop value greater than $1.2 billion
    (USDA 2008). Green bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) represents almost 18% of the
    state vegetable value (FDACS 2007). Most of the pepper produced in Florida is
    cultivated in coarse-textured soils with low water holding capacity and soil organic
    matter content. Agricultural practices such as the use of polyethylene mulch and
    drip irrigation are common for pepper production and they provide growers with
    a viable option to reduce crop water requirements and thus conserve water resources,
    especially when compared to traditional irrigation methods. As an additional advantage
    of use of drip irrigation, the scheduling application of soluble fertilizer through
    the irrigation system provides nutrient quantities that closely match short-term
    crop nutrient requirements (Hartz and Hochmuth 1996; Hochmuth 1992). Conversely,
    due to its highly localized water application, when not properly managed, drip
    irrigation may increase nutrient leaching beyond the rooting zone and pollute
    groundwater resources (Cook and Sanders 1991; Rajput and Patel 2006; Vazquez et
    al. 2006). A perceived negative consequence of using drip irrigation is that the
    wetted soil volume may be limited consequently reducing the crop root development
    (Mmolawa and Or 2000). Roots grow preferentially around the wetted emitter area
    and concentrate within the top 0.4 m of the soil profile (Machado et al. 2003;
    Oliveira et al. 1996). The root volume (also described as root intensity or density)
    of bell pepper has been found to be largely within 0–0.25 m depth in diverse environments
    (Goyal et al. 1988; Hulugalle and Willatt 1987). In fact, maximum root growth
    has been shown to occur when adequate mineral nitrogen is present (Bloom 1997;
    Lecompte et al. 2008), which indicates that lack of nitrogen in certain root zones
    may limit root growth, especially for fertilization injected in drip systems.
    A substantial input of nitrogen fertilizer is required to maximize crop growth
    and profits of vegetable crops. Maximum crop N accumulation by pepper plants is
    on the order of 193 – 234 kg N ha − 1 (Locascio et al. 1985; Tei et al. 1999)
    and between 30 to 65% of the N is accumulated in the fruit (Santiago and Goyal
    1985), therefore, high nitrogen rates can potentially increase nitrate leaching.
    High N application rates results in low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) values as
    low as 24% (Tei et al. 1999) and NUE typically decreases as N-fertilizer application
    rates increase (Olsen et al. 1993; Tei et al. 1999). In addition, irrigation management
    plays an important role on NUE and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) for
    vegetable crop production. The use of frequent but low water application volumes
    is superior to the more traditional scheduling of few applications of large irrigation
    volumes in terms of IWUE (Dukes et al. 2010; Locascio 2005; Zotarelli et al. 2009).
    Excessive irrigation on vegetables may cause yield decreases relative to optimum
    irrigation amounts as determined by pan evaporation on fresh market tomato (Locascio
    et al. 1989), on field grown tomato (Ngouajio et al. 2007), on fresh market tomato
    in south Florida (Muñoz-Carpena et al. 2005a), on bell pepper (Sezen et al. 2006),
    and as determined by soil moisture sensor (SMS) control, on green bell pepper
    (Dukes et al. 2003). Recent technological advances on soil moisture sensing have
    provided growers real-time feedback on the effect of irrigation management on
    the actual soil water status. Therefore, such approaches provide a powerful tool
    for improving irrigation scheduling and can greatly enhance crop water use efficiency.
    The use of SMS-based irrigation systems can maintain soil water status within
    upper and lower limits determined by type of soil and crop preventing over irrigation
    and saving water (Dukes and Scholberg 2005). Capacitance-based (e.g., time domain
    reflectometry and time domain transmission) soil moisture measurement devices
    have been shown to have relatively accurate soil moisture measurement in sandy
    soils common to Florida (Irmak and Irmak 2005), with low maintenance once installed
    (Muñoz-Carpena et al. 2005b). The potential of capacitance probes in automatic
    irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops has been reported in the literature.
    SMS irrigation control has been used on drip irrigated zucchini squash to increase
    yield by 35%, IWUE by 274%, and NUE by 40% relative to single daily timed irrigation
    representative of grower practices (Zotarelli et al. 2008). In general, this study
    found that a simple and inexpensive irrigation controller coupled with commercially
    available soil moisture probes (Muñoz-Carpena et al. 2008) was effective at reducing
    both irrigation water application and nitrogen leaching. Zotarelli et al. (2009),
    reported irrigation savings of 40 to 65% less than typical grower based time irrigation
    scheduling while increasing tomato yield by 11 to 45%. Appropriate irrigation
    scheduling and matching irrigation amounts with the effective water holding capacity
    of the effective rootzone thus may provide ways to minimize the incidence of excess
    N leaching associated with overirrigation. The objective of this study was therefore
    to identify suitable irrigation scheduling methods to reduce irrigation water
    application as well as to evaluate the effect on optimal N-fertilizer rate and
    pepper yield, plant biomass, and N accumulation. We hypothesize that use of SMS-based
    irrigation systems will reduce pepper irrigation water requirements and consequently
    reduce NO 3 – N leaching below the root zone while maintaining or increasing marketable
    yield. Materials and Methods During the spring of 2005, 2006, and 2007, field
    experiments were carried out at the University of Florida, Plant Science Research
    and Education Unit, near Citra, Florida. The soil has been classified as Candler
    sand (Buster 1979) with 97% sand-sized particles in the upper 1 m of the profile
    (Carlisle et al. 1988). The field capacity was in the range of 0.10 – 0.12 ( m
    3 m − 3 ) in the 0–0.3 m depth (Icerman 2007). The average of initial soil nitrate
    content at beginning of the seasons was 1.84 ± 0.84 , 1.22 ± 0.61 , and 0.91 ±
    0.39 mg kg − 1 at 0–0.3, 0.3–0.6, and 0.6–0.9 m depth, respectively. The average
    of nitrate content of the irrigation water weekly measured was 0.64 ± 0.25 mg
    L − 1 . Three weeks before transplanting, the area was rototilled and raised beds
    were constructed with 1.8-m distance between bed centers. Granular fertilizer
    was incorporated into the beds at a rate of 112 kg ha − 1 of P 2 O 5 . Beds were
    fumigated (80% methyl bromide and 20% chloropicrin by weight) at a rate of 340
    kg ha − 1 after placement of both drip tapes in the center of the bed and plastic
    mulch in a single pass 13 days before transplanting. Irrigation was applied via
    drip tape (turbulent twin wall, 0.20-m emitter spacing, and 0.25-mm thickness,
    0.75 L h − 1 emitter − 1 at 69 kPa, Chaplin Watermatics, N.Y.). Water applied
    by irrigation and/or fertigation was recorded by positive displacement flowmeters
    (V100 16-mm diameter bore with pulse output, AMCO Water Metering Systems, Inc.,
    Ocala, Fla.). Weekly manual meter measurements were manually recorded while data
    from transducers that signaled a switch closure every 18.9 L were collected continuously
    by data loggers (HOBO event logger, Onset Computer Corp., Inc., Bourne, Mass.)
    connected to each flow meter. Pressure was regulated by inline pressure regulators
    designed to maintain an average pressure in the field of 69 kPa during irrigation
    events. Plots were 15 m long, and a tractor mounted hole puncher was used to make
    50 mm wide openings at 0.30-m intervals along the production bed. Green bell pepper
    transplants (Capsicum annuum L., var. “Brigadier”) were set on April 7, 2005,
    April 10, 2006, and April 10, 2007. Weekly fertigation consisted of injecting
    dissolved fertilizer salts into fertigation lines according to Maynard et al.
    (2003). All plots received 247 kg ha − 1 of K 2 O as potassium chloride and 12
    kg ha − 1 of Mg as magnesium sulfate. The experimental design consisted of a complete
    factorial arrangement of three N-rates and three irrigation treatments randomized
    within blocks. The N-rate treatments corresponded to 176, 220, and 330 kg ha −
    1 of N applied as calcium nitrate. Weekly N application rates, expressed as a
    percentage of the total N application, corresponded to 5.5% at weeks 1, 2, and
    13; 7.1% at weeks 3, 4, and 12; and 8.9% at weeks 5–11 (Maynard et al. 2003).
    The crop establishment period was characterized by application of similar irrigation
    volume to all irrigation treatments. This period lasted 14, 14, and 12 DAT in
    2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. In the same year order above, the volume of
    water applied via irrigation corresponded to 50, 72, and 64 mm (Fig. 1). Following
    this period, irrigation treatments were initiated. Two irrigation treatments were
    regulated by the commercial RS500 SMS controller manufactured by Acclima, Inc.
    (Meridian, Id.). The RS500 unit controls irrigation application by bypassing time
    clock initiated irrigation events if soil moisture was at or above a preset threshold
    of volumetric water content (VWC) at 0.10 or 0.12 m 3 m − 3 , respectively, SS
    10 and SS 12 , according to the factory calibration. The SMS probes were installed
    at a 45° angle between two plants that measured the soil moisture in the top 0.15
    m of the bed. Timed irrigation windows were specified as five possible events
    per day, starting at 8:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m.
    for 24 min each ( 2 h day − 1 total). A reference treatments (TIME) were established,
    a time-based irrigation treatment with one fixed 2 h irrigation event per day.
    Fig. 1. Cumulative irrigation and estimated evapotranspiration ( ET c ) after
    initial green bell pepper establishment as affected by different irrigation scheduling
    methods during the spring of 2005, 2006, and 2007 A weather station located within
    500 m of the experimental site provided temperature, relative humidity, solar
    radiation, and wind speed data and this information was used to calculate daily
    reference evapotranspiration ( ET 0 ) according to FAO-56 (Allen et al. 1998).
    Crop evapotranspiration ( ET c ) was based on the product of ET 0 and the crop
    coefficient ( K c ) for a given growth stage (Simonne et al. 2007). Fruit Yield,
    Plant Biomass, and Water Use Efficiency Plots were harvested on 60, 74, and 77
    days after transplanting (DAT) in 2005; on 58, 70, and 74 DAT in 2006 and on 69
    and 83 DAT in 2007. The harvested area consisted of a central 10.5-m long region
    within each plot. Pepper fruits were graded into culls, U.S. Number 2 (medium),
    U.S. Number 1 (large), and Fancy (extralarge) according to USDA (2005) grading
    standards for fresh market sweet peppers. Marketable weight was calculated as
    total harvested weight minus the weight of culls. The number and weight of fruits
    per grading class were recorded for individual plots. IWUE expressed in kg of
    fruits m − 3 was calculated by taking the quotient of the marketable yields (
    kg ha − 1 ) and the total applied seasonal irrigation depth ( m 3 ha − 1 ) . Plant
    N Accumulation and Nitrogen Use Efficiency Maximum biomass accumulation was evaluated
    by harvesting two representative plants per treatment replicate at 74, 70, and
    78 DAT for 2005, 2006, and 2007 trials, respectively. Vegetative and reproductive
    plant parts were separated. Shoot and fruit tissues were dried at 65 ° C for subsequent
    dry weight determination. Shoot and fruit tissue samples were ground in a Wiley
    mill to pass through a 2-mm screen and a thoroughly mixed 5-g portion of each
    sample was stored. Tissue material was digested using an aluminum block digestion
    procedure of Gallaher et al. (1975) and analyzed for total Kjeldahl N at the Analytical
    Research Laboratory (University of Florida, Gainesville) using U.S. EPA method
    351.2 (Jones and Case 1991). Nitrogen accumulation by the plant was calculated
    by multiplying weights of stems plus leaves, and fruit tissue by the corresponding
    N concentrations. NUE was defined as N uptake by the plants divided by the total
    amount of N supplied from weekly fertigation plus initial soil nitrate. In 2005,
    leaf samples were also taken at 47 DAT. The 12 most recently matured leaves were
    collected between 9 and 11 a.m. from each treatment plot. The petiole base was
    cut at 15 mm from the stem attachment and crushed in a stainless steel garlic
    crusher. Sap NO 3 – N concentration in the sap was determined by an ion electrode
    method using C-141 Cardy Nitrate Meter (Horiba, Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield,
    Ill.) Monitoring Soil Water Percolation and Nitrate Leaching The VWC of the top
    soil of the production beds was monitored by coupling time domain reflectometry
    (TDR) probes (CS-616, Campbell Scientific, Inc. Logan, Utah) with a data logger
    (CR-10X, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah). Soil moisture probes were placed
    in the beds at two subsequent soil layers which recorded soil moisture values.
    The upper probe was inserted at an angle in order to capture soil moisture in
    the top 0.25 m of the profile and the lower probe was inserted vertically below
    the upper probe recording soil moisture between 0.25 and 0.55 m. Zero tension
    drainage lysimeters were located 0.75 m below the surface of the bed (Zotarelli
    et al. 2007). The drainage lysimeters were constructed out of 208-L capacity drums
    that were cut in half lengthwise with a length of 0.85 m, a diameter of 0.55 m,
    and a height of 0.27 m. A total of 24 lysimeters were used to evaluate percolated
    volume and nitrate leaching in all irrigation treatments under N-rate treatments
    of 220 and 330 kg ha − 1 (four replicates for each treatment). A vacuum pump was
    used to extract the leachate accumulated at the bottom of the lysimeter. The leachate
    was removed weekly one day prior to the next fertigation event by applying a partial
    vacuum (35–40 kPa) using 20-L vacuum bottles for each drainage lysimeter. The
    use of weekly samplings combined with a partial vacuum allowed for an effective
    extraction of leachate at the bottom of the drainage lysimeter and the absence
    of anaerobic conditions. After sampling, soil water in the bottom of the barrel
    dropped to 15 to 20% VWC and the soil system remained oxygenated between samplings,
    thereby minimizing denitrification potential. Total leachate volume was determined
    gravimetrically and subsamples collected from each bottle were analyzed for NO
    3 – N and thus total N loading rates could be calculated. Nitrate samples were
    analyzed using an air-segmented automated spectrophotometer (Flow Solution IV,
    OI Analytical, College Station, Tex.) coupled with a Cd reduction approach [modified
    U.S. EPA Method 353.2 (Jones and Case 1991)]. Statistical Analysis Statistical
    analyses were performed using PROC GLM procedure of SAS (SAS 2002) to determine
    treatment effects for total plant biomass and N accumulation, yield, IWUE, and
    NUE. When the F value was significant, a multiple means comparison was performed
    using Duncan’s multiple range test at a P value of 0.05. For repeated measurements
    such as percolated volume and nitrate leaching, the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS
    with residual maximum likelihood estimation approach and least-squares means of
    fixed effects were pairwise compared. Results and Discussion Irrigation and Soil
    Water During the crop season, programmed irrigation events were skipped, which
    significantly reduced the amount of water applied to SMS based treatments. The
    overall volume of irrigation increased in order SS 10 < SS 12 < TIME , except
    in 2006 when SS 10 received similar volume of irrigation water as SS 12 (Fig.
    1). It was observed that both SMS treatments failed to bypass irrigation events
    in the beginning of the season. The locations of both treatment sensors were assessed
    35 DAT and reburied in a different location in the bed. The location of the sensor
    relative to drip line and plant plays an important role in the sensing irrigation
    systems. Regardless that the treatments were set at different thresholds, if the
    SS 10 soil moisture probe was placed in a drier spot, it could result in higher
    irrigation volume applied than the SS 12 . However, after 35 DAT, both treatments
    were bypassing and irrigating the same scheduled events and applying same irrigation
    amounts. The problem was attributed to cross communication between the capacitance
    sensors, causing each of the irrigation controllers to receive signals from only
    one of the two wired sensors. Several adjustments were made, but the problem was
    not solved until each controller was wired to a separate individual irrigation
    timer, which occurred at 58 DAT, when the SMS treatments began to irrigate independently
    of each other (Fig. 1). The contribution of rainfall to pepper water requirements
    was not considered in the calculations, due to the presence of plastic mulch and
    the absence of a perched water table, while coarse sandy soils also typically
    demonstrate very limited lateral flow. Although, it was observed that high intensity
    precipitation events ( > 8 mm h − 1 ) increased the soil water content as measured
    by TDR. For both SMS treatments, there was no increase in number of skipped events
    after rainfall. For example, precipitation events of 44, 48, and 45 mm occurring
    in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively [Figs. 2(d-f)], showed a slight increase
    (around 1%) in VWC in the 0 to 0.25-m depth layer (data not shown). The SS 10
    treatment received an average of 1.0, 4.7, and 2.6 mm day − 1 of irrigation water
    in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. For the same respective year order, the
    corresponding average irrigation rates for the SS 12 treatment were 2.2, 4.5,
    and 3.7 mm day − 1 and for the TIME treatment were 4.3, 5.1, and 4.4 mm day −
    1 . Fig. 2. Minimum, maximum, average daily temperatures and cumulative daily
    growing degree days (GDD), daily and cumulative rainfall and daily and cumulative
    solar radiation during the spring of 2005, 2006, and 2007 pepper growing season
    The soil moisture had a noticeable increase after each irrigation event for SMS
    treatments and TIME (Fig. 3). However, due to the reduced number of irrigation
    events for the SS 10 treatment, variations in soil moisture at 0–0.25 m soil depth
    layer were not as distinct as the SS 12 and TIME treatments. SMS-based irrigation
    treatments irrigated for short periods of time, in this case, 24 min, which resulted
    in a relatively small increase in soil moisture in the upper soil layer, consequently
    decreasing the volume of percolate [Figs. 3(b-d)]. In fact, slight oscillations
    in soil moisture were during the irrigation events observed in the deep monitored
    layer for SS 10 and SS 12 treatment. On the other hand, the TIME treatment was
    irrigated for a longer time period (2 h), which resulted in very pronounced soil
    moisture fluctuations [Figs. 3(e, f)]. For TIME treatment, after each irrigation
    event, the soil moisture content from 0.10 to 0.15 m 3 m − 3 . Soil moisture content
    returned to field capacity within 12 h. The spikes also indicate that the soil
    water content as measured by the TDR probes rapidly reaches a point above the
    soil water holding capacity in the soil upper layer, inducing percolation to deeper
    soil layers and explaining the higher percolate values for the TIME treatment
    compared to the SMS treatments. In fact, similar spikes in soil water content
    were observed at 0.25–0.55 m showing appreciable soil water percolation though
    the soil profile throughout the entire production cycle. In terms of soil water
    availability to plants, the TIME treatment initially may provide more favorable
    growth conditions since the soil remains wetter, thus reducing potential water
    stress. However, excessive water percolation also may reduce N retention and crop
    N supply and thereby reduce yield for green bell pepper (Table 1). Fig. 3. Example

    and 15–55-cm depth right column) for pepper at flowering stage during the spring

    were no interactions between irrigation and N-rate treatments for total and marketable
    yield, maximum plant biomass accumulation, or IWUE (Table 1). The overall total
    yield for green bell pepper ranged between 26.7 to 32.0 Mg ha − 1 in 2005; 18.2
    to 19.4 Mg ha − 1 in 2006; and 24.7 and 28.2 Mg ha − 1 in 2007. Except in 2006,
    when unfavorable environmental conditions occurred, bell pepper yield obtained
    in these experiments were in the range of those reported in the literature for
    sandy soils in Florida (Dukes et al. 2003; Maynard and Santos 2007; Simonne et
    al. 2006). The lower yield in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2007 was attributed to
    the effect air temperature on plant development and flowering. Low night temperatures
    were shown to have a considerable effect on flower morphology and functioning,
    larger flowers, with swollen ovaries and shorter styles in comparison with flowers
    grown under higher temperature conditions. This effect of low temperatures has
    a direct effect on pepper production by decreasing the total number of pollen
    grains formed and by reducing their viability and germination capacity (Aloni
    et al. 1999; Polowick and Sawhney 1985; Pressman et al. 2006; Shaked et al. 2004).
    According to Polowick and Sawhney (1985), nonextreme conditions such as 18 ° C
    day and 15 ° C night caused stamen deformation with abnormal, nonviable pollen,
    which resulted in functionally male-sterile flowers. A detailed analysis of measured
    air temperature during the entire crop cycle revealed that in 2006, pepper plants
    were exposed to temperatures below 14 ° C during 311 h, while in 2005 and 2007,
    the cumulative hours with low temperatures ( < 14 ° C ) were 181 and 185 h, respectively.
    In addition, temperatures below 14 ° C occurred during the entire plant development
    and reproduction stages in 2006 (Fig. 2), while in 2005, the low temperatures
    occurred exclusively during the beginning of the season (until 35 DAT). In 2007,
    low temperatures occurred throughout the season for short periods of time, however,
    between 49 and 63 DAT (peak of flowering stage) there was no occurrence of low
    temperatures. Air temperature may have affected the relation of marketable and
    total yield. In 2006, the weight of fruits classified as culls (total yield minus
    marketable yield) reached 3.4 Mg ha − 1 , which corresponded to 18% of total yield.
    Reduced proportion of culls was reported in 2005 and 2007, 10 and 3%, respectively
    (Table 1). Differences in pepper yield between seasons also can be attributed
    to substantial differences in solar radiation. The cumulative solar radiation
    measured was 1,535, 1,482, and 1 , 849 MJ m − 2 for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively
    [Fig. 2(g-i)]. During the period between the end of May and beginning of June
    in 2005 and 2006, there was a reduction in solar radiation availability due to
    elevated number of cloudy/rainy days. Conversely, in 2007 the reduced number of
    rain events resulted in higher solar radiation availability compared to 2005 and
    2006. The higher cumulative solar radiation in 2007 may have benefited pepper
    yield in response to the low temperatures occurred during reproductive phase compared
    to 2005, since both years yielded similarly. There was no significant effect (
    P ≤ 0.05 ) of N-rates on pepper yield. Only for 2007 conditions, a linear response
    of application of N-rates was observed (Table 1). The increase of N-rate from
    176 to 220 kg ha − 1 and from 220 to 330 kg ha − 1 resulted in an increase of
    6% (nonsignificant) of marketable yield. Complementally, the only statistical
    difference was observed between N-rates of 176 and 330 kg ha − 1 for that particular
    year. The lack of yield response to N-rates above 220 kg ha − 1 has been reported
    for other vegetable crops for drip irrigated production systems in Florida (Hochmuth
    and Cordasco 2000; Zotarelli et al. 2008; Zotarelli et al. 2009). The use of SMS
    to control irrigation significantly affected the IWUE in 2005 and 2007 (Table
    1). The treatment ranking for IWUE was as follows: SS 10 > SS 12 > TIME . The
    TIME treatment had a lowest IWUE values ( < 8 kg m − 3 ) due to the high irrigation
    rates applied. In 2006, reduced yields associated to the high volume of irrigation
    applied for all treatments were responsible for the lower IWUE values ( < 5.7
    kg m − 3 , Table 1). It is important to point out that high irrigation rates as
    applied for TIME did not increased yield, conversely, the use of scheduling irrigation
    by using SMS allowed application of less water, divided in five possible irrigation
    events per day (low volume, high frequency), which resulted in higher IWUE values.
    While TIME treatment had a single irrigation event (high volume, low frequency),
    which promotes excessive water percolation (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Cumulative leachate
    volume of drainage lysimeters in the spring of 2005, 2006, and 2007 and fall of
    2006 and 2007. Different letters indicate differences at the 95% confidence level.
    Error bars represent ± standard error from the mean, n = 4 . Yield measurements
    showed that reduced irrigation volume application and proper irrigation scheduling
    showed potential to produced more pepper fruits with less irrigation water. In
    2006, even with different irrigation scheduling (one single application for TIME
    versus five irrigation windows for SS 10 and SS 12 ), the volume of irrigation
    was very similar between treatments, therefore the pepper yield was identical.
    Differences between SS 10 and SS 12 in 2005 and 2007 can be also explained based
    on the estimated cumulative crop evapotranspiration and the cumulative irrigation
    water application for each treatment. When comparing pepper yield of treatments
    SS 10 and SS 12 in 2005, it is important to point out that after the establishment
    period (14 DAT), the cumulative irrigation volume for SS 10 was below the cumulative
    ET c (Fig. 1), while, the cumulative irrigation volume for SS 12 was always on
    or slightly above the ET c curve during the entire plant cycle including flowering
    (Fig. 1). Thus, yields for SS 12 were higher than SS 10 due to reduced irrigation
    water application for SS 10 , but no statistical differences in biomass accumulation
    were observed. However, in 2007, the cumulative irrigation for SS 10 was above
    the ET c curve until 50 DAT and slightly below after 50 DAT. On the other hand,
    SS 12 cumulative irrigation volume was always above the ET c curve. Thus, SS 10
    had adequate water most of the season which optimized yields, whereas, yield on
    SS 12 was reduced due to excessive watering (and N leaching) which was observed
    on TIME in all years and SS 10 and SS 12 in 2006. Shoot biomass accumulation ranged
    between 1.30 to 1.58 Mg ha − 1 in 2005, 0.81 to 0.84 Mg ha − 1 in 2006 and 1.08
    to 1.30 Mg ha − 1 in 2007. There was no significant ( P ≤ 0.05 ) difference between
    SMS-based treatments and TIME treatments, neither between N-rates. However, in
    2007 the fruit biomass accumulation was superior under SS 10 treatment (Table
    1), following the same pattern for marketable yield. In the same year, the N-rates
    of 220 and 330 kg ha − 1 resulted in higher fruit and shoot biomass accumulation,
    however they did not differed between each other. Plant N Accumulation and Nitrogen
    Use Efficiency Pepper plant N nutrition was slightly enhanced by SMS-based irrigation
    systems and N accumulation in fruits and shoots were significant ( P ≤ 0.05 )
    greater in 2005 and 2007 compared to TIME treatment (Table 1). The corresponding
    increase in shoot N uptake for SMS-based systems occurred for SS 12 in 2005 and
    SS 10 in 2007 in the order of 20 and 14%, respectively. Moreover, the overall
    N accumulation increased in the order of 2005 > 2007 > 2006 , thus mirroring the
    overall plant dry weight accumulation and yield trends. Complementary measurements
    of plant N levels using petiole sap NO 3 – N status were taken at 46 DAT. Petiole
    sap NO 3 – N concentration of SS 10 ( 1 , 648 mg L − 1 ) and SS 12 ( 1 , 353 mg
    L − 1 ) were significantly ( P ≤ 0.05 ) higher than TIME ( 1 , 061 mg L − 1 )
    treatment. The petiole sap NO 3 – N concentration found was within the range of
    optimum concentration reported Hochmuth (1994), except for TIME treatment, which
    showed a NO 3 – N sap concentration 20% below the lower limit. These differences
    NO 3 – N sap concentration among irrigation treatments corroborated with nitrate
    leaching patterns and NUE, in general, higher nitrate leaching resulted in lower
    nitrate sap concentration in the plant. Except in 2006 when shoot and fruit N
    accumulation were not affected by the N-rate (Table 1), the N-rate of 176 kg ha
    − 1 showed reduced N shoot and fruit accumulation. In 2007, with more favorable
    climatic conditions, a linear response of biomass and N accumulation to the N-rate
    treatments was detected (Table 1). In other words, more favorable growth conditions
    resulted in higher N uptake capacity, increasing the N-rate from 176 to 220 kg
    ha − 1 and from 220 to 330 kg ha − 1 resulted in an overall increase of 10 to
    20% in total N accumulation. The effect of N-rate treatments on petiole sap NO
    3 – N concentration evaluated at flowering stage showed values of 1,141, 1,419,
    and 1 , 342 mg L − 1 for N-rates of 176, 220, and 330 kg ha − 1 , respectively,
    with no significant differences between N-rates of 220 and 330 kg ha − 1 . It
    is also important to note that there were no differences in fresh marketable yield
    between those three N-rates in 2005 and 2006 seasons and between N-rates of 220
    and 330 kg ha − 1 in 2007. Results of petiole sap NO 3 – N concentration indicated
    that the N-rate of 330 kg ha − 1 may be exceeding the N of a pepper plant needs
    and possibly inducing N luxury consumption. Though, the extra consumption did
    not result in higher yields, in fact, for TIME treatment this N-rate showed higher
    NO 3 – N leaching. NUE was significantly ( P ≤ 0.05 ) higher when lower N-rates
    were applied (Tables 2). The use of SMS resulted in higher NUE in 2005 for SS
    10 and SS 12 , and SS 10 in 2007. Again, there was no interaction between N-rate
    and irrigation treatment on NUE. The NUE increased with the increase in yield
    level. The NUE values ranged between 33 and 42% in 2005, 14 and 20% in 2006, and
    25% and 30% in 2007. Linear NUE values decreased with increasing N-rates (Table
    1) may be related to limitation in uptake and sink capacities resulting in a saturation
    response (e.g., “law of the diminishing returns”). In other words, as N supply
    continues to increase, factors other than N limit growth and yield. In 2005 and
    2007, the TIME treatment showed consistently lower values of NUE, which was related
    to the higher irrigation volumes being applied resulting in increased N dilution
    and displacement thus reducing N uptake efficiency (Scholberg et al. 2002). In
    addition, a significant increase in nitrate leaching was observed with the increase
    of N-rate. Table 2. Cumulative NO 3 – N Leached Measured by Drainage Lysimeters

    are not significantly different ( P ≤ 0.05 ) according to Duncan’s multiple range
    test for N-rate treatments within season. Drainage and Nitrate Leaching Water
    percolation during crop establishment was identical for all treatments; 8, 10,
    and 8 mm for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. According to the statistical
    analysis for the postestablishment period, an overall decrease ( P ≤ 0.05 ) in
    soil water percolation was obtained when SMS-based irrigation controlled the water
    application. The TIME treatment resulted in the highest volume of water percolated
    below the effective root zone and captured in the lysimeters (Fig. 4). The volume
    percolated ranged between 32 and 52 mm (Fig. 4), which corresponded to 10 to 16%
    of the applied irrigation water. Excluding 2006 season, the volume percolated
    under SS 10 treatment was 6 and 10 mm, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, which corresponded
    to only 5% of the total irrigation water applied. Similar comparison showed that
    SS 12 treatment percolated 21 and 24 mm in 2005 and 2007, respectively, which
    was translated to 9 and 11% of the total irrigation water applied, respectively.
    There was no interaction between irrigation and N-rate treatments for cumulative
    nitrate loads below root zone. The TIME treatment resulted in the most NO 3 –
    N leaching. Cumulative NO 3 – N leaching values were ranged between 40 and 47
    kg ha − 1 for TIME treatment (Table 2). The single high volume daily application
    of the TIME treatment is likely the cause of the appreciable drainage and NO 3
    – N leaching below the rootzone compared to the irrigation scheduling. A consistent
    reduction in NO 3 – N leaching was observed when scheduling irrigation associated
    to the use of SMS was adopted. These reductions were on the order of 25 to 74%,
    which can be translated to range of 10 to 35 kg ha − 1 of N. Independently of
    the irrigation treatment, the increase in N-rate from 220 to 330 kg ha − 1 , significantly
    ( P ≤ 0.05 ) increased the NO 3 – N leaching in 2005 and 2006 (Table 2). Conclusions
    The initial premise that sound irrigation management can enhance N retention greatly
    in the active root zone, resulting in improved NUE was confirmed in this study.
    It is concluded that better irrigation practices enhanced overall pepper yield,
    and NUE, while reducing water percolation and NO 3 – N leaching. It is proposed
    that the relatively inefficient N use typically observed in commercial vegetable
    operations is related mainly to excessive irrigation, resulting in premature N
    displacement below the root zone. For our experimental conditions, soil-moisture
    sensor based irrigation systems in bell pepper significantly reduced the applied
    irrigation resulting in 7 to 62% less irrigation water applied compared to fixed
    time irrigation (TIME) treatment without compromising marketable yield. The TIME
    treatment resulted in excessive N leaching and dilution thereby further hampering
    N uptake and further compounding the low fertilizer use efficiency. The treatments
    SS 10 and SS 12 successfully reduced NO 3 – N leaching by 25 to 73%. In addition,
    excessively high N application rates ( > 220 kg ha − 1 ) may increase the NO 3
    – N leaching below the active root zone. It is concluded that appropriate use
    of SMS and/or sensor-based irrigation controllers can allow growers to sustain
    yield while reducing irrigation application and reducing NO 3 – N leaching in
    low water holding capacity soils. Acknowledgments Research supported by Florida

    Soil moisture, Water productivity, Water use efficiency Irrigated maize is produced
    on about 3.5 Mha in the U.S. Great Plains and western Corn Belt. Most irrigation
    water comes from groundwater. Persistent drought and increased competition for
    water resources threaten long-term viability of groundwater resources, which motivated
    our research to develop strategies to increase water productivity without noticeable
    reduction in maize yield. Results from previous research at the University of
    Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) experiment stations in 2005 and 2006 found that it was
    possible to substantially reduce irrigation amounts and increase irrigation water
    use efficiency (IWUE) and crop water use efficiency (CWUE) (or crop water productivity)
    with little or no reduction in yield using an irrigation regime that applies less
    water during growth stages that are less sensitive to water stress. Our hypothesis
    was that a soil moisture-based irrigation management approach in research fields
    would give similar results in large production-scale, center-pivot irrigated fields
    in Nebraska. To test this hypothesis, IWUE, CWUE, and grain yields were compared
    in extensive on-farm research located at eight locations over two years (16 site-years),
    representing more than 600 ha of irrigated maize area. In each site-year, two
    contiguous center-pivot irrigated maize fields with similar topography, soil properties,
    and crop management practices received different irrigation regimes: one was managed
    by UNL researchers, and the other was managed by the farmer at each site. Irrigation
    management in farmer-managed fields relied on the farmers traditional visual observations
    and personal expertise, whereas irrigation timing in the UNL-managed fields was
    based on pre-determined soil water depletion thresholds measured using soil moisture
    sensors, as well as crop phenology predicted by a crop simulation model using
    a combination of real-time (in-season) and historical weather data. The soil moisture-based
    irrigation regime resulted in greater soil water depletion, which decreased irrigation
    requirements and enabled more timely irrigation management in the UNL-managed
    fields in both years (34% and 32% less irrigation application compared with farmer-managed
    fields in 2007 and 2008, respectively). The average actual crop evapotranspiration
    (ETC) for the UNL- and farmer-managed fields for all sites in 2007 was 487 and
    504 mm, respectively. In 2008, the average UNL and average farmer-managed field
    had seasonal ETC of 511 and 548 mm, respectively. Thus, when the average of all
    sites is considered, the UNL-managed fields had 3% and 7% less ETC than the farmer-managed
    fields in 2007 and 2008, respectively, although the percentage was much higher
    for some of the farmer-managed fields. In both years, differences in grain yield
    between the UNL and farmer-managed fields were not statistically significant (p
    = 0.75). On-farm implementation of irrigation management strategies resulted in
    a 38% and 30% increase in IWUE in the UNL-managed fields in 2007 and 2008, respectively.
    On average, the CWUE value for the UNL-managed fields was 4% higher than those
    in the farmer-managed fields in both years. Reduction in irrigation water withdrawal
    in UNL-managed fields resulted in $32.00 to $74.10 ha-1 in 2007 and $44.46 to
    $66.50 ha-1 in 2008 in energy saving and additional net return to the farm income.
    The results from this study can have significant positive implications in future
    irrigation management of irrigated maize systems in regions with similar soil
    and crop management practices. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 57 Share

    \x06\a\nAbstract: The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) has been\
    \ demonstrated to provide\naccurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration (ET)\
    \ and yield at diﬀerent spatial scales even under\nhighly heterogeneous conditions.\
    \ However, validation of the SEBAL using in-ﬁeld direct and\nindirect measurements\
    \ of plant water status is a necessary step before deploying the algorithm as\n\
    an irrigation scheduling tool. To this end, a study was conducted in a maize ﬁeld\
    \ located near the\nVenice Lagoon area in Italy. The experimental area was irrigated\
    \ using a 274 m long variable rate\nirrigation (VRI) system with 25-m sections.\
    \ Three irrigation management zones (IMZs; high, medium\nand low irrigation requirement\
    \ zones) were deﬁned combining soil texture and normalized diﬀerence\nvegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) data. Soil moisture sensors were installed in the diﬀerent IMZs\
    \ and used to\nschedule irrigation. In addition, SEBAL-based actual evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETr) and biomass estimates\nwere calculated throughout the season. VRI management\
    \ allowed crop water demand to be matched,\nsaving up to 42 mm (−16%) of water\
    \ when compared to uniform irrigation rates. The high irrigation\namounts applied\
    \ during the growing season to avoid water stress resulted in no signiﬁcant diﬀerences\n\
    among the IMZs. SEBAL-based biomass estimates agreed with in-season measurements\
    \ at 72, 105\nand 112 days after planting (DAP; r2 = 0.87). Seasonal ET matched\
    \ the spatial variability observed in\nthe measured yield map at harvest. Moreover,\
    \ the SEBAL-derived yield map largely agreed with\nthe measured yield map with\
    \ relative errors of 0.3% among the IMZs and of 1% (0.21 t ha−1) for the\nwhole\
    \ ﬁeld. While the FAO method-based stress coeﬃcient (Ks) never dropped below the\
    \ optimum\ncondition (Ks = 1) for all the IMZs and the uniform zone, SEBAL Ks\
    \ was sensitive to changes in water\nstatus and remained below 1 during most of\
    \ the growing season. Using SEBAL to capture the daily\nspatial variation in crop\
    \ water needs and growth would enable the deﬁnition of transient, dynamic\nIMZs.\
    \ This allows farmers to apply proper irrigation amounts increasing water use\
    \ eﬃciency.\nKeywords: SEBAL; variable rate irrigation; evapotranspiration; water\
    \ use eﬃciency\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is a major and ineﬃcient consumer\
    \ of fresh water and the competition with other\nsectors for water is likely to\
    \ increase exponentially in the next decades [1]. For this reason, a more\nreasonable\
    \ and eﬃcient use of water in agriculture is a crucial aspect in order to meet\
    \ the food needs of\nthe rapidly increasing world population [2,3].\nVariable\
    \ rate irrigation (VRI) has been demonstrated to provide better water use eﬃciency\
    \ (WUE)\nwhile increasing crop yields [4–6]. VRI systems are today integrated\
    \ with a wide variety of information\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2069; doi:10.3390/rs11172069\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2069\n2 of 18\nin order\
    \ to deﬁne proper rates for each irrigation management zone (IMZ), ranging from\
    \ soil moisture\nsensing to thermal imagery [7–10].\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ is an important factor in estimating crop water demand and has\nbeen used to\
    \ estimate yields and schedule irrigation [8,11]. Commonly, ETc from agricultural\
    \ areas is\ncalculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration (ET0; [12])\
    \ by a constant crop coeﬃcient\nwithout considering the possible ETc spatial variations\
    \ in water or nutrient-limited zones ([13]).\nEnergy balance techniques [14–17]\
    \ have been extensively used to map evapotranspiration at\nthe local or regional\
    \ scale through satellite-based image-processing tools such as the surface energy\n\
    balance algorithms for land (SEBAL; [18]) and mapping evapotranspiration at high\
    \ resolution with\ninternalized calibration (METRIC™; [13]). These approaches\
    \ have been tested under diﬀerent soil and\nclimate conditions in more than 30\
    \ countries worldwide [19–22] with typical ﬁeld scale accuracy in ET\nestimates\
    \ ranging between 85% for one single-day events up to 95% on a seasonal basis\
    \ [20].\nSEBAL estimates the evapotranspiration component converting the sensed\
    \ satellite radiances\n(visible, near infrared and thermal-infrared) into surface\
    \ parameters such as surface temperature, surface\nalbedo, and normalized difference\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI). The different components of the energy\nbalance equation\
    \ are then calculated using these surface parameters [13]. SEBAL’s main advantages\n\
    are (i) limited input data required, (ii) it estimates ET without a priori knowledge\
    \ on soil, crop and\nmanagement conditions (no land use classification required),\
    \ (iii) it is based on a physical concept,\napplicable for various climates and\
    \ (iv) it can be applied at different spatial and temporal resolution [18].\n\
    While remote sensing-based energy balance techniques (e.g., SEBAL) have been extensively\n\
    used to map evapotranspiration at diﬀerent scales with interesting results [21,22],\
    \ the eﬀort in using\nremotely sensed data to evaluate water management practices\
    \ and schedule irrigation has been limited.\nSome authors [23] argued the temporal\
    \ and spatial resolution of currently available remote sensing data\nare not sufficient\
    \ to use actual evapotranspiration estimates for on-farm research. Typical turnaround\n\
    time for satellite image acquisition and processing is between one and three weeks\
    \ [23], whereas ET maps\nshould be delivered almost in real-time to correctly\
    \ use the remotely sensed information for irrigation\nscheduling. Moreover, the\
    \ spatial resolution of ET maps calculated applying remote sensing-based\nenergy\
    \ balance techniques frequently does not match with spatial resolution requested\
    \ for VRI.\nHowever, data fusion, sub-pixel extraction [23] and temporal integration\
    \ techniques [24–26] could\nrepresent an alternative to improve both spatial and\
    \ temporal resolution. The availability of new\nsatellite platforms with higher\
    \ temporal and spatial resolution is a need for a better deployment of these\n\
    models. In addition, evapotranspiration estimates need to be validated by means\
    \ of well-established\nmethods, such as soil moisture sensing, shown to be a strong\
    \ indicator of plant water status in order to\ndeﬁne speciﬁc irrigation thresholds\
    \ [10].\nThe objective of this study is to calculate SEBAL-based actual ET estimates\
    \ in a pivot-irrigated\nﬁeld in North-Eastern Italy and compare the results to\
    \ soil moisture data and crop stress coeﬃcients\n(Ks). Accuracy of the SEBAL results\
    \ is then assessed by comparing spatially distributed biomass and\ncrop yield\
    \ measurements.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Area and Plant Material\n\
    To validate SEBAL-based ET and biomass estimates, a study was conducted on a pivot-irrigated,\n\
    16-ha ﬁeld located in Pettorazza Grimani, Italy (45◦6′7.19′′N, 12◦0′45.51′′E;\
    \ Figure 1). Maize (Zea mais\nL.) seeds of PR32B10 (Pioneer Hi-Bred International,\
    \ Inc., Johnston, IA, USA) variety were planted\non April 13th, 2015 at 0.45 m\
    \ inter-row spacing and seeding rate of 8 seeds m−2. Prior to planting,\ncultivation\
    \ operations included an autumn plowing at 30 cm depth and a seedbed preparation\
    \ carried\nout by using a spring tine cultivator. Fertilization included a base-dressing\
    \ of 65 kg N ha−1 with\nmanure, 92 kg P2O5 ha−1, 111 kg K ha−1 K2O before the\
    \ autumn plowing and a top-dressing of 184 kg\nN ha−1 (urea). Maize was harvested\
    \ on September 7th, 2015.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2069\n3 of 18\nFigure 1. Aerial\
    \ image of the study area with the ﬁeld boundaries (in red).\n2.2. Soil Sampling\
    \ and Management Zone Delineation\nIrrigation management zones were deﬁned integrating\
    \ soil texture and NDVI data. A mixed-\nsampling scheme of the top soil layer\
    \ (0–0.3 m) was followed based on a regular grid: 55 samples were\ncollected at\
    \ the nodes of 55 m × 65 m grids and 48 additional points at the nodes of 16 transects\
    \ at 2.5,\n15 and 30 m from each randomly chosen grid node, resulting in a total\
    \ of 103 samples (Figure 2a; [27]).\nSoil texture was determined for all the 103\
    \ disturbed soil samples (Figure 2b,c) using a Malvern\nMastersizer 2000 (Malvern\
    \ Instruments Ltd, Great Malvern, UK) laser particle size analyzer (see\nSupplementary\
    \ Materials for texture analysis method) and spatially interpolated using ordinary\n\
    kriging. Maize spatial variability in NDVI was estimated at the peak of plant\
    \ vigor (tasseling/silking\ngrowth stage) from previous seasons using LANDSAT\
    \ 7 images of June 29th, 2009 and June 24th,\n2013 [28]. LANDSAT 7 images were\
    \ selected since they have the same spatial resolution as the VRI\ncenter pivot\
    \ (30 m x 30 m pixels). Moreover, these images were selected since they represented\
    \ the\nmaize variability in NDVI during two extremely diﬀerent growing seasons:\
    \ A rainy (2009) and a dry\n(2013) year.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2069\n4 of 18\n\
    Figure 2. Soil sampling scheme utilized for the determination of soil texture\
    \ with the 103 sampling\npoints (a), clay content (expressed as percentage, %;\
    \ b) and sand (expressed as percentage, %; c) content\nmaps resulting from ordinary\
    \ kriging. Modiﬁed from [28].\nThe investigated area was then divided into three\
    \ IMZs based on the management zone analyst 1.0’s\nfuzziness performance index\
    \ (FPI) and the normalized classiﬁcation entropy (NCE) [29]. As discussed\nin\
    \ [29], the optimal number of zones (clusters) was identiﬁed when each index had\
    \ its minimum\nrepresenting the least membership sharing (FPI) or greatest amount\
    \ of organization (NCE). In addition,\na fourth IMZ was deﬁned and treated as\
    \ the uniform irrigation zone.\n2.3. Soil Moisture Assessment and Variable Rate\
    \ Irrigation System Assessment\nTo monitor the soil moisture condition in the\
    \ ﬁeld, three 5TE soil moisture sensors (Decagon\nDevices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA)\
    \ were installed in each IMZ at three diﬀerent depths, 0.1, 0.3 and\n0.5 m below\
    \ the soil surface. Each array of soil moisture sensors was connected to an EM50G\
    \ wireless\ncellular data logger (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Before\
    \ ﬁeld installation, all sensors\nwere calibrated in the laboratory (accuracy\
    \ of ± 4%; [28]). The sensors collected soil moisture data\nevery 30 min. Data\
    \ were averaged for each array of sensors to get daily averages for the three\
    \ diﬀerent\ndepths and then a unique average for each location. In the three IMZs,\
    \ irrigation was scheduled when\nvolumetric water content (VWC) approached 35%\
    \ for zone 1, 32% for zone 2 and 28.5% for zone 3.\nThe speciﬁc irrigation thresholds\
    \ were deﬁned based on soil hydraulic parameters for the diﬀerent\nIMZs. Having\
    \ the zones diﬀerent soil characteristics, the thresholds were deﬁned accordingly.\
    \ In the\nUniform IMZ, irrigation was applied at the maximum rate (38 mm) each\
    \ time one of the other IMZs\nwas irrigated.\nIrrigation was supplied using a\
    \ 270-m long, center pivot equipped with a Valley® (Valley Irrigation,\nValley,\
    \ USA) variable rate irrigation system. Each sprinkler was controlled (on or oﬀ)\
    \ by a pneumatically\nactuated ﬂow control valve. The 96 sprinklers were grouped\
    \ into 10 zones, each about 25 m in length.\nThe uniformity of the irrigation\
    \ system was assessed before the beginning of the growing season,\nfollowing the\
    \ American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) standards\
    \ and the\n“catch can” layout proposed by [28,30,31]. The uniformity of application\
    \ of the conventionally operated\npivot (without VRI) was evaluated using the\
    \ Hermann and Hein (CUHH) uniformity coeﬃcient [32]\nand the lower quarter distribution\
    \ uniformity (DUlq) coeﬃcient [30]. The uniformity test resulted in\nhigh CUHH\
    \ and DUld (93.9 and 0.91, respectively). Moreover, measured collector volumes\
    \ (observed)\nwere compared to the predicted volumes (expected) [33] in order\
    \ to test the performance of the VRI\nsystem. The application rates were set at\
    \ 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% of the maximum pivot rate\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11,\
    \ 2069\n5 of 18\n(30 mm). The catch cans were placed following two patterns, transect\
    \ and arc-wise. Root mean square\nerror (RMSE) of 1.7 and r2 = 0.86 highlighted\
    \ a good ﬁt between expected and observed rates [28].\n2.4. Evapotranspiration,\
    \ Biomass and Yield Estimates Using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for\n\
    Land (SEBAL)\nThe surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) determines\
    \ the actual evapotranspiration\n(ETr) of each pixel by solving the energy balance\
    \ equation (Equation (1); [18]):\nλE = Rn − G0 − H,\n(1)\nwhere Rn is the net\
    \ radiation, λE is the latent heat ﬂux, G0 is the soil heat ﬂux and H is the sensible\n\
    heat ﬂux.\nRn is calculated from surface reﬂectance and surface temperature, the\
    \ soil heat ﬂux (G0) as a\nfunction of Rn, surface temperature and NDVI. H is\
    \ considered proportional to the ratio between the\nsurface-air temperature diﬀerence\
    \ (dT) and bulk aerodynamic resistance (rah) [18,24]. SEBAL computes\nthe sensible\
    \ heat ﬂux H through a “calibration” procedure where dry (Rn = H + G0, thus λEdry\
    \ ~ 0)\nand wet (Rn = G0 + λE, Hwet ~ 0) pixels are selected and used to calculate\
    \ the vertical temperature\ndiﬀerence (∆T) required to match the variation in\
    \ H between the dry and wet pixels [26]. The wet pixel\nwas identiﬁed as a very\
    \ well watered crop pixel (low temperature, low albedo and high NDVI) and\nthe\
    \ dry pixel was searched between poorly vegetated or base soil areas with high\
    \ temperature, high\nalbedo and low NDVI.\nTherefore, SEBAL calculates the evaporative\
    \ fraction (Λ) considering the H and λE components ([18];\nEquation (2)).\nΛ =\n\
    λE\n(Rn − G0) = Rn − Go − H\nRn − Go\n(2)\nMoreover, the evaporative fraction\
    \ (Λ) is assumed to be constant throughout the day. In fact, the\ndiﬀerence between\
    \ the Λ at the moment of image collection and the 24-h Λ average is considered\
    \ as\nnon-signiﬁcant [24,26].\nThe latent heat ﬂux λE is then calculated multiplying\
    \ the Λ by the diurnal net radiation (Rn24h) as\nin Equation (3):\nλE = Λ × Rn24h.\n\
    (3)\nLandsat 7 and 8 satellite images from April 19th, May 14th and 29th, June\
    \ 6th and 30th, July 8th,\n16th and 24th, August 9th and 17th, and September 2nd,\
    \ 2015 were downloaded and automatically\nprocessed using a web-based platform\
    \ called Tethys (Centrale Valutativa s.r.l.) to estimate the energy\nbalance components.\
    \ All dates had favorable clear-sky weather conditions. Visible bands (bands 1,\
    \ 2,\n3, 4, 5 and 7) were used for albedo (α), and vegetation index calculations.\
    \ Thermal band (band 6) was\nused for surface temperature (Ts) and sensible heat\
    \ (H). The spatial resolution was 30 m × 30 m on the\nvisible bands and 60 m ×\
    \ 60 m on the thermal band. An atmospheric correction was performed to\nconvert\
    \ the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance into surface reﬂectance using the second\
    \ simulation of\nsatellite signal in the solar spectrum algorithm (6S; [34]).\n\
    To overcome the lack of satellite images on a daily basis, actual evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETr) was\ncalculated for each of the aforementioned satellite image acquisition\
    \ dates. Then, ETr on the date\nj was divided by the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET0) on the same date j to calculate the fraction\nETrFj. ET0 was estimated\
    \ using the FAO-56 method (Penman–Monteith equation) [35]. The fraction\nETrFj\
    \ = ETr/ET0 was then considered constant for the time period between j and the\
    \ successive\nacquisition date j + 1 [24,26]. Seasonal actual evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETseasonal) was then calculated using\nEquation (4).\nETseasonal =\nX\nj\n\
    (ETrFj ×\nXtj+1\ni=tj ET0i),\n(4)\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2069\n6 of 18\nwhere\
    \ tj and tj + 1 represents the time period between two consecutive image acquisition\
    \ dates.\nMaize aboveground biomass production (in kg ha−1 day−1) for each pixel\
    \ of the satellite images\nwas calculated from Tethys using the fraction of absorbed\
    \ photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) =\nabsorbed PAR (APAR)/total PAR\
    \ (PAR), the evaporative fraction (Λ) and light use eﬃciency (e’). fPAR\nwas estimated\
    \ from NDVI values as shown in Equation (5) [17]:\nfPAR = −0.161 + 1.257 × NDVI.\n\
    (5)\nThe light use eﬃciency factor was set at 4 g/MJ [34]. Total biomass (BIO)\
    \ production was converted\ninto total above-ground biomass as total biomass (BIO)\
    \ × 0.77 (Equation (6); [17]).\nBIO = e′ × Λ × fPAR × 0.84.\n(6)\nMaize yield\
    \ was obtained multiplying the total aboveground biomass for each of the irrigation\n\
    management zones by a speciﬁc harvest index (HI) factor equal to 0.5. Measured\
    \ and SEBAL-derived\nyield averages were also calculated for each IMZ, uniform\
    \ zone and for the rainfed portion of the\nﬁeld (top right corner). Moreover,\
    \ diﬀerences between the measured and SEBAL-estimated yield were\ncalculated for\
    \ each pixel as in Equation (7):\nDelta = SEBAL yield − observed yield\nobserved\
    \ yield\n× 100.\n(7)\n2.5. Crop Growth Data\nTo monitor crop growth during the\
    \ season, biomass samples were collected on three sampling\ndates, at 72 (June\
    \ 24th, 2015), 102 (July 24th, 2015) and 115 (August 6th, 2015) days after planting\
    \ (DAP).\nOn each sampling date, two 1 m2 sections were destructively harvested\
    \ for each IMZ. The biomass\nwas then dried for 24 h in a forced-air oven to determine\
    \ the total above-ground dry weight (DW)\nin kg ha−1.\nYield data was collected\
    \ at harvest using a New Holland CR8080 (New Holland Agriculture,\nItaly) combine\
    \ harvester equipped with a yield monitor (grain mass ﬂow and moisture sensor)\
    \ and a\ndiﬀerential global positioning system (DGPS). The harvester had a 7.5\
    \ m header and collected yield\ndata every second. Raw data, expressed as 14%\
    \ grain moisture content, was imported using SMS™\nAdvanced (AgLeader Technology,\
    \ Ames, USA), cleaned to exclude ﬁeld-edge eﬀect and low yield values\ndue to\
    \ combine maneuvers and expressed as dry matter per hectare (DM ha−1). The combine-derived\n\
    data points were interpolated and resampled at 30 m × 30 m to match the spatial\
    \ resolution of the\nSEBAL yield map.\n2.6. SEBAL-Based and Soil Moisture Data-Based\
    \ Water Stress Coeﬃcient\nWater stress coeﬃcients (Ks) were calculated for each\
    \ soil moisture sensor location using the\nmoisture data collected at the three\
    \ diﬀerent depths. Water content at −33 KPa (ﬁeld capacity) and\n−1500 KPa (permanent\
    \ wilting point) were estimated from the soil characteristics of each IMZ using\n\
    the “Rosetta” model [36]. Soil moisture-based Ks was then calculated on a daily\
    \ basis using the FAO-56\nmethod as follows [12]:\nKs = TAW − Dr\nRAW\n,\n(8)\n\
    where TAW (mm) is the total available soil water in the root zone, Dr (mm) is\
    \ root zone depletion and\nRAW is the fraction of the TAW that a crop can extract\
    \ from the root zone before reaching water stress\n(RAW assumed 0.5 × TAW).\n\
    The SEBAL-based Ks (Ks SEBAL) was calculated by extracting the SEBAL actual Kc\
    \ (Kc SEBAL) for\neach sensor location on a daily basis. Therefore, Ks SEBAL was\
    \ divided by the basal crop coeﬃcient to\nestimate the speciﬁc Ks (Equation (9)).\n\
    Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2069\n7 of 18\nKs SEBAL = KcSEBAL\nKcb\n,\n(9)\nwhere Kcb\
    \ is the basal crop coeﬃcient estimated according to the FAO method [35] and Kcsebal\
    \ is the\nactual crop coeﬃcient calculated from SEBAL.\nKs SEBAL is assumed to\
    \ be equal to 1 when Kcsebal ≥ Kcb. The Ks values were compared over the\nirrigation\
    \ season to investigate a possible relationship between the two methods and the\
    \ sensitivity of\nKc SEBAL in capturing water stress-related changes in evapotranspiration.\n\
    2.7. Statistical Analyses\nA regression analysis was used to evaluate SEBAL performances\
    \ in estimating the biomass\ncollected on the aforementioned sampling dates. The\
    \ coeﬃcient of determination was also calculated\nto describe the proportion of\

    \ moving along the north-south axis with\ncoeﬃcient of variation of 25% for sand\
    \ and 23% for clay. The sandy areas were located in the southern\npart while the\
    \ north part of the ﬁeld had high clay content (Figure 2). NDVI maps were strongly\n\
    dependent on the season with the sandy areas showing high NDVI values in rainy\
    \ seasons as in the 2009\nmap (Supplementary Materials Figure S1) and low values\
    \ in dry seasons (2013 map, Supplementary\nMaterials Figure S1) [28]). Soil texture\
    \ (sand and clay; Figure 2) and NDVI data were integrated\nin order to delineate\
    \ the IMZs using the aforementioned Management Zone Analyst software. The\noptimal\
    \ number of management zones was selected based on the fuzziness performance index\
    \ (FPI)\nand the normalized classiﬁcation entropy (NCE) indices as shown in Figure\
    \ 3 [29]. The cluster analysis\nidentiﬁed a total of four zones but only the three\
    \ IMZs under the pivot-irrigated area were considered\nfor the experiment (Figure\
    \ 4a): Zone 1, located in the north-eastern part of the ﬁeld, was characterized\n\
    by silty loam texture; Zone 2, located in the central part of the ﬁeld, by loam\
    \ texture, and Zone 3, in the\nsouth-western part of the ﬁeld, by sandy-loam texture.\
    \ The irrigation application map (Figure 4b) was\ndeveloped matching the aforementioned\
    \ management zones (zone 1, 2 and 3), and a fourth, uniform\nirrigated area to\
    \ the resolution of the center pivot. The application map was then downloaded\
    \ to the\nVRI controller and used for every irrigation event.\nFigure 3. Fuzziness\

    3.2. Soil Moisture Data and Irrigation Prescriptions\nIn 2015, rainfall totaled\
    \ 272.8 mm between planting and harvest (Figure 5). The growing season\nwas characterized\
    \ by a dry April, July, August, September and a wet period between June and July.\n\
    Total irrigation rates applied for each IMZ and the uniform zone are presented\
    \ in Table 1 [28]. The high\nwater demand during the growing reason resulted in\
    \ a progressive decrease of the VWC below ﬁeld\ncapacity from mid-July (93 DAP)\
    \ to the beginning of August, since the time required from the pivot for\na complete\
    \ rotation was the limiting factor (Figure 6).\nFigure 5. Daily maximum (black\

    \ the maize biomass values in t DM ha−1 hand harvested for each IMZ on the three\n\
    aforementioned sampling dates (blue bars). The high irrigation amounts applied\
    \ during the growing\nseason to avoid water stress in the experimental area resulted\
    \ in no signiﬁcant diﬀerences among\nthe four irrigation zones. SEBAL-based biomass\
    \ values extracted from the sensor locations at 72, 102\nand 115 DAP resulted\
    \ in a good agreement with observed data (r2 = 0.87, Supplementary Materials\n\
    Figure S2). However, as shown in Figure 7, SEBAL considerably underestimated the\
    \ measured biomass\nat every sampling date. This underestimation in biomass could\
    \ be related to the diﬀerent spatial\nresolutions of the two systems: While biomass\
    \ samples were collected on a 1 m2 sections, SEBAL\nprovided biomass estimates\
    \ on 30 m pixels × 30 m pixels.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2069\n11 of 18\nFigure\

    \ 2nd, July 2nd and August 6th (Figure 8) exhibited a marked\ntemporal variation\
    \ across the ﬁeld (NDVI maps used to calculate ETr are shown in Supplementary\n\
    Materials Figure S3). While early season ETr maps as June 2nd, 2015 presented\
    \ a limited variability\nin ET with values ranging between 3.4 and 4.3 mm/d (Figure\
    \ 8a), late in the season the variability\nincreased as in the case of August\
    \ 6th, 2015 (Figure 8c) with ET values between 4.0 and 6.2 mm/d.\nIn general,\
    \ the central part of the ﬁeld had greater ETr values and the right-hand part\
    \ had low ETr.\nFigure 8. Temporal variability in SEBAL actual evapotranspiration\

    \ map\n(ETseasonal; Figure 9). Seasonal ET ranged between 471 mm to 554 mm with\
    \ the lowest values in the top\nright part of the ﬁeld and the highest values\
    \ in the central area. ETseasonal map largely matches the\nspatial variability\
    \ of the measured yield map, with high seasonal ET associated with high yielding\n\
    zones and low ET characterizing the low yielding zones (Figure 10a).\nRemote Sens.\

    Figure 10. Measured (a) and SEBAL (b) yield maps, relative error map (c) between\
    \ measured and\nSEBAL yield values.\nThe SEBAL-based yield map (Figure 10b) had\
    \ a similar spatial pattern when compared to the\nmeasured yield map. Measured\
    \ yield values ranged between 5.2 to 13.2 t ha−1, whereas SEBAL yield\nranged\
    \ between 7.5 to 11.1 t ha−1. In both maps, low maize yields were generally observed\
    \ in the\nright-hand part of the ﬁeld, with the lowest yielding area at the top\
    \ right corner. Moreover, a relative\nerror map was generated as the diﬀerence\
    \ between measured and SEBAL yield values on a pixel\nbasis (Figure 10c). Almost\
    \ all the pixels with relative errors higher than 25% are located outside the\n\
    pivot-irrigated area in the rainfed portion of the ﬁeld, indicating actual biomass\
    \ or harvest index (HI)\ncould have been overestimated. However, more than 75%\
    \ of the map presented relative errors lower\nthan 25% between measured and SEBAL\
    \ yields with most of the pixels having errors below 15%.\nAt the whole ﬁeld,\
    \ SEBAL underestimated the measured yield by less than 1 % (0.21 t DM ha−1), which\n\
    represents an excellent performance in agreement with [37].\nIn addition, measured\
    \ and SEBAL yield were averaged at the IMZ scale, considering also the\nrainfed\
    \ part of the ﬁeld (top right corner; Table 2). Measured yield averages between\
    \ 10.47 and 10.92 t\nha−1 in the irrigated areas and 9.39 t ha−1 in the rainfed\
    \ portion. Diﬀerences in yield were not signiﬁcant\nbetween the VRI and the uniform\
    \ irrigated areas, however, VRI resulted in water savings up to 42 mm\nRemote\

    \ (Ks) was used to estimate possible reduction in the potential\nevapotranspiration\
    \ over the season. Daily Ks were calculated using the previously described FAO\n\
    method and the SEBAL actual evapotranspiration. Figure 11 shows the FAO Ks (orange\
    \ lines) and the\nSEBAL-based Ks (blue lines) values calculated for all the IMZs\
    \ and the uniform area.\nVWC never exceeded the FAO 50% TAW threshold in all the\
    \ management zones (Figure 6) and\nin consequence FAO Ks was always equal to 1\
    \ [36]. Conversely, the SEBAL Ks showed changes over\nthe growing season in all\
    \ the management zones with values frequently lower than the optimum\nKs = 1.\
    \ Moreover, the trend in SEBAL Ks resulted similar in all the zones probably because\
    \ of the\nhigh frequency of irrigation events allowed to maintain the crop well\
    \ watered irrespectively of the\nsoil variability.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2069\n\

    \ did not allow us to fully exploit the VRI\npotentials. Indeed, exceptionally\
    \ high temperatures and prolonged drought were observed starting\nbefore maize\
    \ ﬂowering to mid-August. These conditions smoothed the diﬀerences between IMZs\
    \ in\nterms of water retention capabilities and, as a consequence, between irrigation\
    \ volumes. Nevertheless,\nthe VRI system coupled with the soil moisture sensors\
    \ optimized the irrigation scheduling and\nmaximized yields, allowing for ﬁne\
    \ tuning of the irrigation, particularly in IMZ 1 and IMZ 3. In turn,\nmaize yield\
    \ did not show any signiﬁcant diﬀerences among the management zones, while water\n\
    savings compared to the business-as-usual regime ranged from 8 mm (low irrigation\
    \ requirement\nzone) to 40 mm (high irrigation requirement zone). In particular,\
    \ it is worth pointing out that in the\nsandy area (i.e., IMZ 3), it was possible\
    \ to obtain a reduction of irrigation volumes, still maintaining\nyield performances\
    \ not diﬀerent from the irrigated control treatment (uniform IMZ).\nIn the current\
    \ study we supported the hypothesis that SEBAL estimated parameters such as actual\n\
    evapotranspiration, crop coeﬃcient and daily biomass accumulation could be used\
    \ to understand the\nspatial and temporal variation in the maize water status.\
    \ Moreover, whether the integration between\nSEBAL parameters and soil moisture\
    \ information could represent a viable tool for scheduling irrigation\nand providing\
    \ better crop yields while reducing the irrigation amounts.\nSEBAL was able to\
    \ describe 87% of in-ﬁeld biomass variability, but average data were overestimated\n\
    with respect to the actual values. These discrepancies could be related to the\
    \ diﬀerent spatial resolution\nbetween SEBAL and in situ operations. While the\
    \ former calculated the biomass on a 30 m × 30 m grid,\nthe hand harvested samples\
    \ were collected on 1 m2 plots. Improving the sampling pattern, collecting a\n\
    more representative sample for each selected pixel, or using SEBAL parameters\
    \ with higher spatial\nresolution could represent possible alternatives to increase\
    \ the accuracy of estimates on both sides [17].\nConversely, SEBAL-estimated maize\
    \ yield well correlated to the measured yield map in all the\naforementioned management\
    \ zones but also on a pixel basis (average error less than 1%; 0.21 t ha−1).\n\
    The relative error map (Figure 10c) reinforces the excellent performance of the\
    \ algorithm as noted\nby [37]. Moreover, SEBAL exhibited the highest overestimation\
    \ of maize yield in the rainfed area\n(+6.4%). The authors suggest this was probably\
    \ related to uncertainties in harvest index (HI), which\ncould be aﬀected by plants\
    \ stress conditions. In fact, the integration of a crop stress-related harvest\n\
    index model could represent a way to provide better SEBAL-based yield estimates\
    \ especially for zones\nunder non optimal conditions, as rainfed areas, or when\
    \ stress periods occur even in irrigated portions\nover the growing season [38].\n\
    ETr and crop coeﬃcient maps calculated by SEBAL, clearly highlight the potentialities\
    \ of the\nmodel to optimize VRI. Unfortunately, it was not possible to compare\
    \ the accuracy of SEBAL and\nFAO methods with respect to ﬁeld ET measurements\
    \ (e.g., lysimeters and ﬂux towers). As discussed\nin many other studies, SEBAL\
    \ resulted in underestimation of ET when compared to the FAO dual\ncoeﬃcient method\
    \ [19,22,35]. In addition, FAO-56 tabulated Kc and Kcb has been shown to overestimate\n\
    the observed crop coeﬃcients and ET for humid regions up to 40% [39,40] due to\
    \ the complexity of\nthe interactions between several soil, weather and plant\
    \ physiological factors. Moreover, weather\nconditions (e.g., cloud cover and\
    \ net radiation) at the time of the satellite overpass and the selection of\n\
    dry and wet pixels could strongly inﬂuence the ﬁnal ETc values calculated from\
    \ SEBAL [41,42].\nAnyway, SEBAL ETr maps and Ks values showed a marked variability\
    \ over the growing season\neven if the FAO method suggested no stress occurred\
    \ (Ks = 1). While the widely-used FAO method does\nnot account for spatial variability\
    \ in crop evapotranspiration, the SEBAL ability to use pixel-speciﬁc\nestimates\
    \ of plant water status represent a promising tool for the deﬁnition of transient\
    \ irrigation\nmanagement zones as the season moves, thus enabling dynamic variable\
    \ rate irrigation.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, the surface energy balance\
    \ algorithm for land (SEBAL) was used to map crop\nevapotranspiration and biomass\
    \ accumulation and estimate crop yield in a pivot-irrigated maize\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2019, 11, 2069\n16 of 18\nﬁeld. Moreover, SEBAL estimates of crop water stress\
    \ were coupled with in-season soil moisture\nsensing data in order to deﬁne an\
    \ irrigation scheduling strategy able to integrate these two approaches.\nMeasured\
    \ biomass and maize yield values showed a good agreement with SEBAL estimates,\
    \ indicating\nthe algorithm could be used to provide accurate estimates of crop\
    \ growth and maize ﬁnal production.\nThe SEBAL sensitivity to the complex interactions\
    \ between several soil, weather and plant physiological\nfactors, allowed also\
    \ to describe the spatiotemporal variability of crop water demands at the ﬁeld\n\
    scale. These results suggest that the integration of SEBAL with in-ﬁeld soil moisture\
    \ sensing could\nallow farmers to optimize irrigation scheduling for variable\
    \ rate irrigation systems, overcoming the\nsimpliﬁed FAO single or dual coeﬃcients\
    \ methods. However, major advancements are still needed\nfor a successful use\
    \ of SEBAL for irrigation purposes. The speciﬁc relationship between SEBAL Ks\n\
    values and crop water status should be deﬁned in order to identify the proper\
    \ dynamic variable rate\nirrigation zones. SEBAL should be coupled with crop simulation\
    \ models (e.g., DSSAT) to overcome its\nlimited use during long cloudy periods.\
    \ SEBAL applications should be based on satellites data with\nhigher spatial and\
    \ temporal resolutions.\nAnyway, SEBAL adoption for precision agriculture irrigation\
    \ will allow us to advance the irrigation\nscience particularly in environments\
    \ where water availability is scarce or the quality of irrigation water\nis poor.\n\

    Get rights and content Highlights • Soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation
    system successfully produced Cymbidium hybrid regardless of substrates. • Bark,
    coconut husk chips, and coir dust showed similar shoot growth of Cymbidium at
    a similar matric potential. • Coarse substrates required about 8 times more water
    than fine substrates to maintain a similar matric water potential. • Fine substrate
    increased water and nutrient use efficiency without diseases caused by wet conditions.
    Abstract Most orchid growers use bark as substrate to avoid too wet conditions,
    although it requires excessive water use of leaching. We conducted research to
    investigate the applicability of a soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation
    system in Cymbidium production for efficient irrigation management and compared
    the growth and water use of Cymbidium under various substrate conditions. One-year-old
    Cymbidium ‘Hoshino Shizuku’ plantlets were grown in bark, coconut husk chips,
    coir dust, or a commercial growing mix at a similar matric potential within the
    easily available water range. Irrigation occurred when the substrate dried below
    the volumetric water content thresholds at 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, and 0.40 m3 m−3 in
    the bark, coconut husk chips, coir dust, and the commercial growing mix, respectively.
    Pseudobulb size, net photosynthetic assimilation rate, fresh shoot, and root weight
    of the Cymbidium showed no differences among the substrates, although Cymbidium
    grown in the commercial growing mix had better shoot growth than plants in the
    other substrates. The amount of irrigation was higher (ca. 6 times) in coarse
    substrates (bark and coconut husk chips) than fine substrates (coir dust and the
    commercial growing mix), indicating that fine substrates with higher water-holding
    capacity could use water more efficiently. The amount of irrigation and nutrient
    availability of the substrate in the coarse substrates were much lower than those
    in the fine substrates, producing a difference in growth of the Cymbidium among
    the substrates. Water use efficiency was 8–9.5 times higher in Cymbidium grown
    in fine substrates than plants grown in coarse substrates. Overall, the soil moisture
    sensor-based automated irrigation system could provide an appropriate moisture
    level for Cymbidium grown in fine substrates, avoiding too wet conditions, and
    produced quality Cymbidium with more efficient water and nutrient use than orchids
    produced in coarse substrates. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    efficiency 1. Introduction In the horticultural industry, orchid species, including
    Cattleya, Cymbidium, Dendrobium, Oncidium, Paphiopedilum, and Phalaenopsis, have
    become very popular and important floricultural crops over the last few decades
    (Lee, 2018). The Cymbidium species originate from tropical and subtropical Asia
    and is one of the most popular orchids in the floriculture market throughout the
    world because of its variety of flower size, shape, and color and longevity of
    the flower (Barman and Naik, 2017; De et al., 2015). Since Cymbidium generally
    requires a long cultivation period of ca. 5 years for sale as cut flowers or potted
    plants in commercial production, they require continuous long-term care, and efficient
    management for production is critical (Kim et al., 2011). Orchid species have
    specialized root anatomy with a velamen layer that can absorb atmospheric moisture
    and nutrients, and terrestrial orchids such as Cymbidium generally require much
    more moisture than epiphytic orchids (Lee, 2018). In commercial orchid production,
    most terrestrial orchids are commonly damaged by overwatering rather than underwatering,
    as overwatering leads to root rot and many other diseases such as black rot, bacterial
    soft rot, and bacterial brown rot (De et al., 2015; Pal et al., 2020). Therefore,
    the substrate for orchids should provide good aeration as well as an adequate
    water-holding capacity. Bark is the most common substrate for orchids in many
    countries, including Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States (Lee, 2018; Kwon
    et al., 2015; Wang and Konow, 2002). Although bark can provide adequate aeration
    for orchid species with its large porosity, it can lead to a waste of a massive
    amount of water and fertilizers by leaching. For example, Cymbidium growers in
    Korea usually irrigate 9000 L of water per 1 ha every day during the growing season
    via overhead sprinklers, and 75 % of the water with dissolved fertilizer is leached
    (Lee et al., 2014). Many studies have been conducted to find alternative substrates
    that can provide both good water-holding capacity and aeration for Cymbidium to
    enhance water use efficiency without reducing production quality (De et al., 2015;
    Lee et al., 2014; Mott, 1955). These reports showed that alternative substrates
    such as carbonized rice husk, sphagnum moss, coconut husk, clay soil, peat moss,
    sawdust, and various substrate mixes were able to enhance the growth and flowering
    of Cymbidium compared with bark. However, most orchid growers are reluctant to
    change their substrate because of the difficulty of water management in orchids
    on substrates with high water-holding capacity. In addition, most orchid growers
    irrigate plants based on their experience, and changing the substrate from bark
    to another would require growers to adopt a new irrigation method. Furthermore,
    although the effect of substrates on Cymbidium growth has been reported in several
    studies, the moisture levels in the substrates were not clearly described, and
    this might have affected the results. With the development of sensor technology,
    several sensor-based irrigation technologies have been developed over the years
    for efficient irrigation management. Various soil moisture sensors, including
    tensiometers, gypsum blocks, capacitance, frequency domain reflectometry, and
    neutron proves, can directly measure soil moisture (Lea–Cox, 2012). In particular,
    capacitance or frequency domain reflectometry sensors are suggested as suitable
    soil moisture sensors for the automated irrigation system in nursery and greenhouse
    production because of easy maintenance, low costs, and reliability (Jones, 2004;
    van Iersel et al., 2013). Soil moisture sensor-based irrigation has been successfully
    used for horticultural crops such as Ocimum basilicum (Nam et al., 2020), Hypericum
    hidcote (Bacci et al., 2008), and Hydrangea macrophylla (Bañón et al., 2019) to
    enhance crop yield and productivity. In the case of Cymbidium, there was a study
    using the precision irrigation system to find the optimum volumetric water content
    and water use efficiency. When the plants grown in coir dust substrate, the range
    of 0.35−0.40 m3 m−3 showed the highest water use efficiency with good growth (An
    et al., 2021). Therefore, we conducted the current study to investigate the effect
    of four substrates (bark, coconut husk chip, coir dust, and a commercial growth
    media) on Cymbidium growth using a soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation
    system. Irrigation threshold levels for each substrate were designated to consider
    the moisture retention properties of each substrate to provide a similar matric
    potential. The objectives of the current study were 1) to investigate the applicability
    of a soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system for Cymbidium production
    with efficient irrigation management and 2) to compare the growth and water use
    of Cymbidium in various substrates with a similar moisture availability condition.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Plant, substrate materials, and growth conditions
    One-year-old Cymbidium ‘Hoshino Shizuku’ plantlets (Bio-U. Ltd., Zentuji, Kagawa,
    Japan) were obtained from a commercial orchid nursery (Haepyeong Orchids Farm,
    Gongju, Korea) on 29 March 2019. The plants were manually watered for five weeks
    to acclimate them to the experimental greenhouse environment, located in Seoul
    National University Farm, Suwon, Korea. After washing all the roots, the plants
    were transplanted in 1,330 mL plastic pots (15 cm diameter, 13 cm height), filled
    with one of four substrates: pine bark (Hyundae Bark, Gimhae, Korea; originated
    from China), coconut husk (Satis International Co., Ltd. Seoul, Korea; originated
    from Sri Lanka), coir dust (Satis International Co., Ltd.), and a commercial horticultural
    growing mix (Sunshine Mix4; Sun Gro Horticulture, Agawam, MA, USA). After transplanting,
    plants were placed in the same greenhouse and carefully managed for seven weeks
    to acclimate them to each substrate for root stabilizing to the new substrates.
    Plants were fully irrigated on 21 June and were not irrigated until the automated
    irrigation began on 26 June. When the treatments began on 26 June, the number
    of leaves, length and width of the uppermost fully expanded leaf, the number of
    pseudobulbs, the longest pseudobulb diameter, and chlorophyll content (SPAD value)
    were 16.6 ± 0.31 (mean ± SE, n = 12), 42.9 ± 0.78 cm, 1.9 ± 0.01 cm, 1 ± 0.00,
    20.1 ± 0.34 mm, and 53.6 ± 1.60, respectively. The experiment was carried out
    for 21 weeks from 26 June to 13 November 2019. The temperature, vapor pressure
    deficit, and daily light integral inside the greenhouse were monitored using a
    temperature and humidity sensor (VP-3; Meter Group, Pullman, WA, USA) and a photosynthetic
    active radiation sensor (SQ-110-SS; Apogee Instruments, Logan, UT, USA) connected
    to a data logger (CR1000; Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). During the experiment,
    the daily average temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit, and
    daily light integral in the greenhouse were 19.9 ± 2.6 °C (mean ± SD), 68.6 ± 8.1
    %, 1.6 ± 0.4 kPa, and 5.2 ± 1.8 mol m–2·d–1, respectively. 2.2. Moisture retention
    and chemical properties of the substrates Moisture retention curves of each substrate
    were investigated to determine the proper irrigation threshold volumetric water
    content (VWC, v/v) level for each substrate using a Hyprop (Meter Group, Pullman,
    WA, USA), following the method described by O’Meara et al. (2014). Each set point
    for irrigation was determined in the range around easily available water (EAW)
    for soilless media (-1 and -5 kPa suctions; De Boodt and Verdonck, 1972); the
    determined set point for each substrate is described as VWC (v/v) in Table 1.
    Since bark and coconut husk chips had a relatively narrow VWC range (less than
    0.05 m3 m−3) within the EAW (0.22–0.27 and 0.29–0.31 m3 m−3 for bark and coconut
    husk chips, respectively), their midpoints were selected as their set points.
    Coir dust and Sunshine Mix4 displayed a wider VWC range (higher than 0.25 m3 m−3)
    for EAW (0.34–0.65 and 0.37–0.62 m3 m−3 for coir dust and Sunshine Mix4, respectively).
    Since coir dust and Sunshine Mix4 have a much higher water-holding capacity, the
    set VWC for irrigation with coir dust and Sunshine Mix4 was selected around the
    4.5 kPa range to avoid too wet conditions. Each VWC set point for bark, coconut
    husk chips, coir dust, and Sunshine Mix4 was determined as 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, and
    0.40 m3 m−3, respectively. The chemical properties were analyzed using soil chemical
    analysis methods (NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Science), 2010). The
    pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of each substrate were determined by the substrate:distilled
    water (1:5) method using a pH and EC meter (Orion 3 Star; Thermo Fisher Scientific
    Inc., Beverly, MA, USA). The contents of exchangeable cations K+, Na+, Ca2+, and
    Mg2+ were quantified by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Integra XL, GBC Scientific,
    Melbourne, Australia). Available P2O5 was determined by Lancaster methods, and
    NO3-N and NH4-N were analyzed with Kjeldahl methods. Table 1. Volumetric water

    + β. 2.3. Automated irrigation system Twelve capacitance soil moisture sensors
    (EC-5; Meter Group) were connected to a data logger (CR1000; Campbell Scientific)
    to measure and control the VWC in pots. The data logger powered the soil moisture
    sensors with 2.5 V excitation, and substrate-specific calibration was conducted
    following the method of Rhie and Kim (2017). Each sensor (5.5 cm length and 1.0 cm
    width) was inserted diagonally from the top of the substrate in the center of
    a pot, where the roots were located, to a depth of ca. 6.0 cm. The data logger
    was connected to a relay driver (SDM-CD16AC; Campbell Scientific), which controlled
    the power to 12 solenoid valves (NaanDanJain Irrigation Ltd., Rehovot, Israel).
    Each experimental unit had five plants as sub-replicates, and the VWC was measured
    for one pot in the center for each experimental unit every 20 min. Plants were
    irrigated using a sprinkler (Vibro-spreader 35 L/H; Rain-Tal Ltd., Kibbutz Barkai,
    Israel), and each irrigation event provided ca. 10 mL per pot. If the VWC reading
    of the capacitance sensors in an experimental unit dropped below the assigned
    VWC set point, the data logger opened the solenoid valve for that experimental
    unit for 120 s. The irrigation duration was chosen to maintain VWC constantly
    close to the irrigation set point. The data logger recorded each irrigation application,
    and the total amount of water applied to the plants was calculated as water use.
    During the experiment, plants were provided with a 15N–4.8P–10.8 K + 2 Mg + TE
    controlled-release fertilizer (Osmocote Plus; Everris International B.V., Heerlen,
    The Netherlands) at a rate of 4 g per pot. The fertilizer was administered on
    the surface of each substrate when the automated irrigation treatment was initiated.
    2.4. Plant growth parameters and water use efficiency At the end of the experiment,
    the total number of leaves, the length and width of the uppermost fully expanded
    leaf, and the fresh and dry weight of shoots and roots were measured. The pseudobulb
    diameter was measured at the widest point of the pseudobulb using a digital vernier
    caliper (ABS Digimatic Caliper; Mitutoyo Co., Ltd., Tsukuba, Japan). Chlorophyll
    content was measured on the uppermost fully expanded leaves using a chlorophyll
    meter (SPAD 502; Minolta, Osaka, Japan). Dry weights were determined after drying
    samples in an oven at 80 °C for 7 d. Water use efficiency (WUE) of the plants
    was calculated as the total dry weight of the plants divided by the water use
    amount calculated from the automated irrigation system. 2.5. Photosynthetic gas
    exchange Photosynthetic gas exchange was measured using a portable photosynthesis
    measuring system (Li 6400; Li-Cor Co., Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) from 11:00 to 13:00
    for 17 weeks after the treatment. Three plants per experimental unit were randomly
    selected and used for measurement. The uppermost mature leaf was clamped onto
    a 6 cm2 LED head chamber with photosynthetic photon flux density at 1000 μmol m−2∙s-1.
    Relative humidity and temperature in the chamber were maintained at 60–75 % and
    20 °C, respectively. The rate of airflow through the chamber was 500 mL min–1
    with a CO2 level of 400 μmol mol–1. After a steady-state of gas exchange had been
    achieved, the net photosynthetic assimilation rate (An) was determined. 2.6. Experimental
    design and statistical analysis The experiment used a randomized complete block
    design with four treatments and three blocks. The chemical properties of the substrates
    and the effects of the substrates on the growth and development parameters at
    harvest were analyzed using analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s honestly
    significant difference test at α = 0.05 using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
    USA). Regression analysis was used for the substrate-specific VWC calibration
    and to investigate the relationships between electrical conductivity and the amount
    of irrigation using SigmaPlot (SigmaPlot 11.0, Systat Software Inc., San Jose,
    CA, USA). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Moisture retention and chemical properties
    of the substrates Based on the properties of capacitance soil moisture sensors,
    proper calibration for the specific substrate is required (Rhie and Kim, 2017).
    Substrate-specific calibration was conducted to accurately measure the VWC, and
    the calibration coefficients are listed in Table 1. Since each substrate has its
    unique water-retention properties and hydraulic conductivity, determining VWC
    set points with a similar matric potential level around EAW range would be beneficial
    to compare the effect of substrates on plant growth without any drought or waterlogging
    effects. In the analysis of the chemical properties of each substrate, the coconut
    husk chips had the highest pH at 5.83, and the pH of bark was higher than that
    of coir dust or Sunshine Mix4 (Table 2). However, the pH range of all the substrates
    was within the optimum range to grow orchids, which is between 5.0 and 6.5 (De
    et al., 2015). EC levels were also different across the substrates, with the highest
    EC in coconut husk chips (0.83 dS m−1), followed by coir dust (0.74 dS m−1), Sunshine
    Mix4 (0.46 dS m−1), and bark (0.16 dS m−1). Although the commercial growing mix
    Sunshine Mix4 had a lower EC than coconut husk chips and coir dust, it had significantly
    higher contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium than any other substrates,
    indicating the proper range of nutrients for a plant-growing substrate (Table
    2). The high EC of coconut-based substrates (coconut husk chips and coir dust)
    was mostly due to high potassium and sodium. Lee (2018) previously reported that
    the coconut-based substrate must be thoroughly washed to get rid of any salts
    such as sodium before use, because coconut trees usually grow near the seashore.
    Thus, the coconut-based substrates used in this study were washed thoroughly to
    avoid high sodium levels. The EC level of substrates was not severe and allowed
    Cymbidium growth without salt accumulation during the experimental period (Pal
    et al., 2020). Since the bark has been aged and decomposed for months, EC and
    most nutrients in the bark were the lowest among all the substrates; calcium content
    was highest in the bark. To avoid nutrient deficiency in substrates for Cymbidium,
    controlled-release fertilizer was provided as described in the Materials and Methods.

    of the soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system Generally, the automated
    irrigation system performed as programmed in the data logger (Fig. 1). Although
    bark and coconut husk chip treatments reached their set VWC as soon as the treatment
    started, coir dust and Sunshine Mix4 treatments did not receive their first automated
    irrigation for 14 days after treatment was initiated. As bark and coconut husk
    chips are substrates with coarse particles with high porosity, water leaching
    in the substrate was relatively fast, and their VWC reached the set VWC immediately
    after treatment started. However, coir dust and Sunshine Mix4 are substrates with
    much higher water-holding capacity (Arguedas et al., 2007; Raviv and Lieth, 2008),
    providing plants with water within the EAW range for the first 14 days without
    the need for irrigation. Although there were missing data or some peak for a few
    days from a technical issue with the automated irrigation system caused by an
    electrical outage and malfunction of a sensor at the greenhouse, the soil moisture
    sensor-based automated irrigation could maintain the VWC of the substrates according
    to the set VWC threshold as scheduled throughout the experimental period of 21
    weeks (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (149KB) Download : Download

    cultivation using a sensor-based automated irrigation system. Setpoints were designated
    at 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, and 0.40 m3·m−3 for bark, coconut husk chip, coir dust, and
    Sunshine Mix4, respectively. Error bars indicate SD (n = 3). 3.3. Growth of Cymbidium
    Cymbidium grown in Sunshine Mix4 had the highest number of leaves compared with
    those in other substrates; no significant differences were observed in leaf number
    among plants grown in bark, coconut husk chips, and coir dust (Table 3). Leaf
    width and length were also highest in Cymbidium grown in Sunshine Mix4, but the
    differences were not significant compared with those grown in coir dust. Plants
    grown in bark and coconut husk chip had fewer and smaller leaves, although the
    substrate matric potential was similar among the treatments. Chlorophyll content
    showed similar trends to those of leaf parameters, with the highest content in
    Cymbidium grown in Sunshine Mix4. The size of pseudobulbs is generally regarded
    as the major factor for measuring the growth of Cymbidium because pseudobulb is
    an important organ (sink) to store photosynthetic assimilates from leaves (source)
    during the vegetative period (Ng and Hew, 2000; Yong and Hew, 1995). In the current
    study, the pseudobulbs were fully grown, and the sizes of pseudobulbs were not
    different across the substrates. Overall, the shoot growth was higher in fine
    substrates (coir dust and Sunshine Mix4) than coarse substrates (bark and coconut
    husk chips), but the difference was not remarkable. Table 3. Growth of Cymbidium

    in a column with a different letter are significantly different by Tukey’s honestly
    significant difference test at P =  0.05. In contrast to shoot growth, the root
    length was significantly shorter in plants in coir dust than the other substrates
    (Table 3, Fig. 2). Ichihashi (1997) reported that soggy conditions cause diseases
    such as root rot in orchids, but the diseases were not observed during the current
    study. The previous study also reported that aeration is another important factor
    for orchid roots and must be ensured during watering. Although both are classified
    as fine substrates, Sunshine Mix4 has greater porosity than coir dust, likely
    due to the perlite in the growing mix. Thus, aeration through the air space of
    substrates might affect the root growth of the plants. Download : Download high-res

    ‘Hoshino Shizuku’ grown in bark, coconut husk chips, coir dust, and Sunshine Mix4
    using a sensor-based automated irrigation system at harvest after 21 weeks of
    cultivation. Similar to the pseudobulb size results, there was no significant
    difference in photosynthetic parameters, such as An, among the substrates (P = 
    0.3) (Fig. 3). The value of An in the current study was within a similar range
    in previous studies, which is lower than those of most other C3 plants (Kim et
    al., 2013; Pan et al., 1994). Although An is relatively lower, the photosynthetic
    activity of orchids is sensitive to environmental factors, such as drought (Hew
    and Yong, 2004). However, our results showed no significant difference in photosynthetic
    activity across the treatments, indicating that the similar matric potential across
    the substrates did not affect the photosynthetic activity of the plants. Consistent
    with the photosynthetic data, shoot and root fresh weights of Cymbidium were not
    significantly different across the substrates (Table 3). Although the root dry
    weight also showed no significant difference across the treatments, the shoot
    dry weight of Cymbidium grown in Sunshine Mix4 was higher than those grown in
    the other substrates. The highest shoot dry weight in Sunshine Mix4 is consistent
    with the results of the highest number of leaves, leaf size, and chlorophyll contents
    in the Cymbidium grown in Sunshine Mix4. Download : Download high-res image (115KB)

    and Sunshine Mix4 with volumetric water content at 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, and 0.40 m3·m−3,
    respectively. Error bar indicates SE (n = 3). Pun (2019) reported that Cymbidium
    etythrostylum grown in bark had the lowest shoot growth, including pseudobulbs,
    compared with those grown in other substrates. Pumice (Kwon et al., 2015) and
    bark 1: hydrophilic polymer 1 (Yamane and Sakuramato, 1992) were also recommended
    to improve the growth and flowering of Cymbidium compared with bark as the substrate;
    these findings are inconsistent with our results showing no difference in shoot
    growth among plants in bark, coconut husk chips, and coir dust. Although these
    inconsistent results between the previous studies and our study might be from
    different stages of the plantlets or other environmental conditions, different
    substrate moisture conditions among the substrates might have affected the results.
    In our study, bark, coconut husk chips, and coir dust showed similar shoot growth
    of Cymbidium at similar substrate matric potential. 3.4. Water use The total amount
    of irrigation was significantly higher in the coarse substrates (bark and coconut
    husk chips) than the fine substrates (coir dust and Sunshine Mix4) (Table 4).
    The bark and coconut husk chips required 7–8 times more water to retain the substrate-specific
    VWC threshold than Sunshine Mix4. Based on growth and water use, the WUE was highest
    in the Cymbidium grown in Sunshine Mix4, where it was about 9.5 times higher than
    those of coarse substrates. Since the bark and coconut husk chips are coarse substrates
    and had a narrow EAW range (0.05 and 0.03 m3 m−3 for bark and coconut husk chips,
    respectively, Table 1), these substrates were irrigated more frequently to replenish
    the water that was absorbed by the plant and mostly lost by leaching to maintain
    the EAW range. However, the fine substrates, coir dust and Sunshine Mix4, had
    higher water-holding capacity with the wider EAW range (0.31 and 0.25 m3 m−3 for
    coir dust and Sunshine Mix4, respectively, Table 1), and they were better able
    to absorb the applied water, thus required less frequent irrigation than the coarse
    substrates. Table 4. The total amount of irrigation, EC, and water use efficiency

    automated irrigation system successfully produced Cymbidium regardless of the
    substrate. The coarse substrates required about 8 times more water than the fine
    substrate to maintain a similar matric potential, but the plant growth was similar
    across the substrates, except for the plants grown in a commercial growing mix.
    Our results were inconsistent with previous studies, which reported that the growth
    of Cymbidium in bark was low; this might be because the substrate moisture conditions
    were different from the tested substrates. From our results, if proper moisture
    conditions were supplied, there was no problem in the growth of the Cymbidium
    even the plants were grown in bark as high porous substrate. Nevertheless, bark
    was not the optimal substrate for Cymbidium since it was water and nutrient inefficient
    compared with the fine substrates. Fine substrates provided many benefits for
    water- and nutrient-holding capacities, increasing water and nutrient efficiency.
    As orchid species require enough aeration due to their specialized root system,
    growers have been reluctant to use fine substrates because of irrigation management
    difficulty. However, the current results showed that the soil moisture sensor-based
    automated irrigation system could successfully produce Cymbidium with fine substrates
    with much more efficient irrigation than the conventional way. These results are
    expected to help reduce labor and production costs and contribute to sustainable
    orchid production with efficient water and nutrient use. Credit author statement

    irrigation scheduling and evaluates water use efficiency. • Tool for outdoor woody
    and greenhouse horticultural crops with drip irrigation. • Data from moisture
    sensors are used to determine soil water deficit. • Water use efficiency is evaluated
    by WFC, RIS and irrigation scheduling analysis. Abstract The digitalization of
    the agricultural sector through the implementation of cutting-edge technologies
    allows for the optimization of the use of water, whose scarcity has become one
    of the most relevant and complex environmental global problems. Water consumption
    data collected on site using different technologies is key to achieving optimal
    irrigation scheduling. Technology is also a useful tool that provides a real and
    transparent inventory of water use in irrigated crops. The water footprint obtained
    in accordance with ISO standard 14046 (using the Life Cycle Analysis methodology)
    and jointly with irrigation management information allows determining water use
    efficiency with great accuracy. This work presents a decision support system developed
    for precision irrigation management at farm scale called DSSPIM. The system provides
    a verifiable inventory of water use and an analysis/diagnosis of the adequacy
    of the irrigation performed using information and communication technologies (ICTs),
    as well as real-time knowledge of water inputs and outputs during crop development
    based on data received from water meters and soil moisture sensors installed in
    the field. Additionally, to achieve both purposes, a methodology is proposed to
    more accurately estimate rainwater use (green water) based on real measurements
    and the use of ICTs. The proposed methodology was applied during one season in
    two organic crops (greenhouse tomatoes and orange trees) located in southern Spain.
    The model allowed detecting inefficiencies in irrigation water use. A comparison
    between the actual management practices and the practices recommended by the DSSPIM
    underlines the importance of irrigation management in improving water use. In
    the case of orange trees, different irrigation system management scenarios were
    compared and showed that the application of controlled deficit irrigation strategies
    using DSSPIM can reduce irrigation water use by 20%. Previous article in issue

    has become one of the greatest and most complex challenges in the world as human
    activity is one of the main drivers of water resources pressures (UNESCO, 2009).
    Irrigated agriculture is the largest human activity using water resources. Agricultural
    production accounts for 70% of the world’s freshwater withdrawals (FAO, 2017).
    The demand for freshwater in the agricultural sector is driven by increasing food
    demand, which is directly linked to population growth. Due to exponential demographic
    growth, the new production systems are characterized by a greater use of inputs
    (Sanz, 1990). The growing use of inputs along with climate change has intensified
    the negative effects on both the quantity and quality of water resources (FAO,
    2017). To address this problem, global agriculture must increase food production
    without compromising environmental preservation (Monaghan et al., 2013) through
    strategies for more efficient water use. In this context, the implementation of
    precision irrigation systems using cutting-edge technologies is among the proposed
    strategies to use water more efficiently. Information gathered from the field
    through remote sensors and sent to be analyzed using information and communication
    technologies (ICTs) is key to accurately determine crop water needs and apply
    the optimal amount of water at the right time (Fernández García et al., 2020).
    Several authors have developed ICT tools to support irrigation water management.
    González Perea et al. (2017) developed a mobile and desktop application that uses
    ICT tools to determine the daily irrigation time for strawberry crops in southwestern
    Spain using agroclimatic and soil information as well as the hydraulic characteristics
    of the irrigation network. Alcaide et al. (2019) used climate forecasting to determine
    the optimal fertigation schedule for olive groves in real time based on the theoretical
    soil water balance, the quality of the irrigation water and the crop and soil
    characteristics. In both works, soil moisture sensors were used to control scheduled
    irrigation. Goldstein et al. (2018) applied machine learning techniques to meteorological
    data, soil moisture sensor readings and historical irrigation schedules to capture
    the unstructured decision-making process of the irrigation manager and automatically
    provide irrigation scheduling. Similar works (Casadesús et al., 2012, Millán et
    al., 2019) have also performed a water balance readjusted with sensor information
    to determine irrigation scheduling but only for woody crops. Although rainfall
    is an essential parameter in optimal irrigation scheduling, some works do not
    take it into account (Goldstein et al., 2018). Irrigation programming models usually
    include rainfall in a simplistic way through general formulations to estimate
    the effective rainfall and to account for the rainwater water used by the crop
    (Alcaide et al., 2019, Smith and FAO, 1992). The water footprint (WF) indicator
    is a useful tool for analyzing potential water scarcity scenarios because it quantifies
    the volume of direct and indirect crop water use to produce a unit of output (Hoekstra,
    2003). Since it was first introduced in 2002, the WF concept has been in constant
    evolution and some authors have addressed it in the context of life cycle analysis
    (LCA) in terms of potential impacts on the environment (Bayart et al., 2010, Berger
    and Finkbeiner, 2010, Boulay et al., 2016, Chapagain and Orr, 2009, Jefferies
    et al., 2012, Pfister et al., 2009). For this reason, ISO standard 14046 (ISO,
    2014) aims to unify the multiple definitions and methodologies of WF assessment
    in the methodological context of LCA (ISO standard 14040, ISO, 2006). The accuracy
    and interpretation of WF results depend on the spatial-temporal scale and quality
    of the WF inventory phase (González Perea et al., 2016, Montesinos et al., 2011).
    In this phase, the water input and outputs of the system being assessed are recorded
    and quantified. In irrigated crops, water footprint accounting can be applied
    to evaluate water use efficiency through the relationship between water use and
    crop yield (García Morillo et al., 2015). However, WF does not provide information
    about the adequacy of applied irrigation. For this reason, it is essential to
    obtain verifiable, quality data on farm water use to identify problems in irrigation
    facilities and/or their operation. Irrigation management indicators, such as relative
    irrigation supply (RIS) (Levine, 1982), are used to diagnose such situations and
    make decisions to improve water use efficiency. Some authors have used ICTs to
    acquire the data needed to accurately account for crop WF and linked this information
    with additional indicators to provide details of how irrigation has been carried
    out (García Morillo et al., 2015, González Perea et al., 2016). However, recorded
    data have not yet been used to perform optimal irrigation scheduling that takes
    into account crop water needs in real time. This study aims to develop an irrigation
    management tool that takes full advantage of the utilities of the available field
    technology (sensors and telecommunication systems) by jointly analyzing WF, RIS
    and irrigation scheduling to maximize water use efficiency. To this end, a decision
    support system (DSS) has been developed to determine the real-time scheduling
    of a precision irrigation system for outdoor woody crops and greenhouse horticultural
    crops with a drip irrigation system. The methodological approach involves the
    use of weather forecasts and real-time data recorded by soil water sensors and
    water meters combined with ICTs to update irrigation scheduling in real time.
    The information is also analyzed to obtain verifiable WF inventories and irrigation
    performance indicators and evaluate the efficiency of the precision irrigation
    system at farm scale (in accordance with the ISO standard 14046). In addition,
    the proposed decision support system includes a procedure to estimate the amount
    of green water used by the crops from real soil water data. The methodology was
    applied during the 2019/2020 irrigation season on two commercial farms that produce
    greenhouse tomato and orange crops in southern Spain. 2. Methodology 2.1. Decision
    support system for precision irrigation management The decision support system
    developed for precision irrigation management (DSSPIM) uses data recorded by sensors
    installed in the field, as well as data on the crop characteristics, soil type,
    hydraulic characteristics of the irrigation network, climate (historical and predicted
    data) and information on water availability and crop yield to provide an optimal,
    weekly irrigation schedule. Additionally, DSSPIM measures the amount of water
    the crops use in real time throughout the growing season to obtain an accurate
    and verifiable WF and uses several irrigation management indicators to assess
    the irrigation water efficiency. Thus, DSSPIM is composed of four modules: farm
    characteristics, climate and irrigation monitoring data, irrigation scheduling
    and water use analysis/diagnosis. Each of the modules is described below and their
    interrelations are shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (377KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flowchart of DSSPIM (Decision Support
    System for Precision Irrigation Management). 2.1.1. Farm characteristics This
    module collects and manages information about the cultivation of drip irrigated
    crops on a given farm, as well as the data needed to estimate the WF of the crops.
    For woody crops, the required data are plantation frame (m∙m) and average diameter
    of the tree canopy (m). In the case of greenhouse crops, the required data include
    planting dates, the spacing between crop lines, the slope of the greenhouse roof
    (°), the start and end dates of roof whitening and the whitening dose (kg lime/100 L
    of water). The irrigation network is characterized by the number of pipes per
    crop line, the distance between emitters (m), the nominal flow rate of the emitters
    (L/h) and the sector area (ha). Farm water management and use depend on the contracted
    electricity rate. Power supply rates differ according to the number, duration
    and distribution of tariff periods. The daily number of hours available for irrigation
    are usually limited due to the farm’s electricity rate (low-cost period) or operational
    conditions. To keep the recommended irrigation time within the limits of the available
    irrigation hours, the user must select the tariff type and the irrigation period
    or manually enter the maximum number of hours available for irrigation from Monday
    to Friday and weekends. Finally, the water allowance (m3/ha∙year), electrical
    conductivity of irrigation water (dS/m), soil texture, the yield of the previous
    season and the first day of the growing season and the last day of harvest (t/ha)
    must be known. 2.1.2. Climate and irrigation monitoring data collection This module
    collects climate and water use monitoring data by means of ICTs. The information
    is then used to calculate the theoretical crop irrigation needs. Historical climate
    date and weather forecasts are obtained from public weather services. Using web
    scraping techniques, real precipitation (P) and historical potential evapotranspiration
    (ETo) records are obtained from the nearest public agroclimatic station (NAS)
    of the regional agroclimatic information network (RIA, 1999). The complete ETo
    time series is used to determine the historical crop requirements. Daily crop
    evapotranspiration under optimal and well-watered conditions (ETc) (Pereira et
    al., 2021) is estimated based on ETo forecasts calculated from open weather data
    (maximum and minimum daily relative humidity information, %) and data obtained
    from online weather forecasts (maximum and minimum temperature, °C; cloud index,
    %; wind speed, km/h). The open weather data were taken from the AEMET Open Data
    system, which is the API REST (application programming interface representational
    state transfer) of the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET, 2015). The online
    weather forecast data were obtained from the eltiempo.es website (Pelmorex Corp,
    2017) by web scraping techniques. These data are used to calculate the ETo of
    outdoor crops for the next 7 days by the Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al.,
    1998). The ETo for greenhouse crops is estimated using the equation of a locally
    calibrated radiation method proposed by Fernández et al. (2010). Weather precipitation
    forecasts are also obtained from eltiempo.es and used in the irrigation scheduling
    of outdoor crops. Soil moisture sensors and water meters are used to monitor crop
    water use. Although several types of commercial sensors are available for this
    purpose, frequency domain reflectrometry (FDR) capacitance moisture sensors are
    the most widely used to monitor and measure changes in soil volumetric water content
    (VWC) due to their reliability and ease of use (Vera et al., 2017). For each crop,
    a measurement device with three ECHO20 10HS capacitive sensors (Meter Group, USA)
    was placed at different soil depths to record variations in soil moisture due
    to crop absorption during the growing season. The three sensors were installed
    in different soil layers: one in the upper soil layer (at a depth of 10–15 cm),
    one at the depth with the highest root density (20–35 cm) and one in the bottom
    soil layer with few roots. A high moisture content in the deepest layer indicates
    water losses by percolation and hence an inefficient use of irrigation water.
    Since irrigation scheduling is done for homogeneous sectors, it is necessary to
    install at least one soil moisture monitoring device in a representative location
    of each irrigation sector. The level of sectorization of each farm will depend
    on the variability of several factors (soil, topography and crop variety, among
    others). Inadequate sectorization would compromise the accuracy of DSSPIM. The
    amount of water used is recorded by water meters installed at the inlet of each
    irrigation sector. These water meters have an electronic sensor that emits a signal
    once a volume unit has flowed through the meter. Soil moisture sensors and water
    meters are connected to dataloggers with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) communication
    that records and transmits measured data in real time to a cloud platform accessible
    via an API. 2.1.3. Irrigation scheduling The aim of this module is to determine
    daily irrigation time for outdoor and greenhouse crops. For outdoor crops, soil
    water content is an essential variable in irrigation scheduling. When the amount
    of water stored in the soil can satisfy crop irrigation needs, then irrigation
    is not necessary. To determine whether irrigation is needed or not, a daily soil
    water balance is performed. For greenhouse crops that do not receive rainwater
    and are watered with high frequency irrigation, the soil’s function as a water
    store is negligible, and it can be assumed that soil water content does not change
    over time (Fernández et al., 2001). The soil water balance is updated daily using
    the information gathered in the data collection modules. The irrigation scheduling
    module is described in what follows and the module flowchart is shown in Fig.
    2. Download : Download high-res image (788KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Flowchart of the irrigation scheduling module. The total water available
    in the soil (TAW, mm) for a crop is a function of the crop’s depth of roots (Zr,
    m) and the soil water contents at field capacity (θFC, m3/m3) and at the permanent
    wilting point (θPWP, m3/m3). The last two parameters depend on the hydrophilic
    characteristics of the soil. They were estimated using the soil water retention
    curves resulting from the application of the ROSETTA model, which bases its estimations
    on the soil texture characteristics (Schaap et al., 2001). Soil textures were
    determined in the laboratory from soil samples taken on each farm. Only a fraction
    of TAW is available for the crop, what is known as the readily available water
    (RAW, mm) (Allen et al., 1998). When the soil moisture deficit (Dr, mm), or level
    of moisture depletion, reaches RAW in the root zone, water extraction is more
    difficult for the plant and its ETc is reduced. The RAW for the orange grove was
    50% of TAW (Allen et al., 1998). Therefore, to avoid a decrease in ETc, 20% of
    TAW was set as the threshold of the allowable depletion level (ADL, mm) in the
    soil to start irrigation. To determine Drn (mm) in the soil at the end of day
    n (soil water balance), Drtheoretical,n (mm) and Drreal,n (mm) must be previously
    calculated using Eqs. (1), (2), respectively, adapted from Allen et al. (1998).
    Eq. (1) estimates the soil water deficit without considering runoff and percolation
    losses. (1) Where Drn-1 is the soil moisture depletion of the previous day (mm),
    ERn is the effective rainfall on day n (mm) whose calculation is described below
    for outdoor crops (Section 2.1.3.1), and for greenhouse crops ERn is zero. In
    is the real applied irrigation depth measured by the water meter (mm) and is the
    crop evapotranspiration (mm) calculated as the product of ETo on day n and the
    crop coefficient (Kc). can be calculated from historical ETo values (recorded
    by the nearest agroclimatic station) or ETo predictions (calculated using the
    methodology described in Section 2.1.2). When the objective is to determine the
    Dr value of the current day, the ETo value recorded the previous day by the NAS
    is used. However, if the purpose is to estimate the Dr of the next 7 days, ETo
    predictions are used. Kc at day n (Allen et al., 1998) which depends on the crop
    type and stage of development. In woody crops, Kc is related to the ground area
    shaded by trees (Castel Sánchez, 2001), while for greenhouse crops it is a function
    of the accumulated thermal time (ATT) since emergence (Fernández et al., 2001).
    Ks is a non-dimensional coefficient of water stress (Allen et al., 1998) that
    quantifies the reduction in transpiration when the soil water deficit exceeds
    the RAW. If the water depletion in the root zone is less than the RAW, the value
    of this coefficient is equal to 1. Eq. (2) calculates actual soil moisture depletion
    from the VWC at field capacity and the VWC recorded on site (θreal, m3/m3). The
    latter value is the average of soil moisture records taken at sunset by sensors
    located in the top and middle soil layers. (2) After irrigation, the soil water
    content exceeds θFC for a while, after which the soil drains and the water content
    is stabilized. At sunset, the sensors provide information about the remaining
    water content in the soil after the daily evapotranspiration period. When θreal
    exceeds a certain percentage of the θFC value, x, the moisture deficit at the
    end of the day (Drn) is considered 0 and the soil at field capacity. Conversely,
    if θreal is lower than the set threshold, the value assigned to Drn will be the
    highest between Drreal,n and Drtheorical,n, so the most limiting value was considered
    to determine the irrigation timing (3). (3) Once the irrigation timing is determined
    using Drn, daily crop irrigation requirements are calculated according to equation
    ( 4): (4) Where ETc is the crop evapotranspiration under optimal and well-watered
    conditions and is calculated using the forecast ETo values. The coefficients fCE,
    fPte and fRs are correction factors that depend on the electrical conductivity
    of irrigation water, the slope of the greenhouse roof and whitening, respectively
    (Fernández et al., 2001). For outdoor crops, the value of the fPte and fRs factors
    is 1. In water scarce regions, deficit irrigation strategies are usually applied
    in woody crops when the water irrigation requirements exceed water rights. Therefore,
    the theoretical daily irrigation dose (INn) is calculated according to Eq. (5),
    where IDCn is the irrigation deficit coefficient and ranges from 0 to 1 depending
    on the selected irrigation strategy. (5) When the crop irrigation needs are fully
    satisfied (FIR strategy), IDCn is equal to 1 for the entire irrigation season.
    In a sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) strategy, IDCn is a fraction of the crop
    irrigation needs and its value remains constant throughout the irrigation season.
    On the other hand, in a regulated deficit irrigation strategy (RDI) a variable
    fraction of crop irrigation requirements is applied throughout the irrigation
    season. This fraction of the crop irrigation needs depends on the crop cycle and
    aims to prevent or reduce to the greatest possible extent water stress in the
    most sensitive crop stages such as flowering or fruit set (Gonzalez-Altozano and
    Castel, 1999). Therefore, IDC varies during the irrigation season. The total amount
    of irrigation water to be applied in the irrigation season cannot exceed the irrigation
    water allowance (IWA), regardless of the irrigation strategy chosen. For this
    reason, IDC is combined with the average fortnightly ETc (historical data) to
    distribute the water allowance according to the crop irrigation needs and a fortnightly
    IWA (IWAf) is set. Any deviation from the established limit is recorded by the
    irrigation meter and at the end of each fortnight the remaining allocation is
    redistributed proportionally to the irrigation needs of the remaining months of
    the irrigation season, readjusting the established limits every 15 days. To avoid
    exceeding the IWA value at the end of the irrigation season, a daily limit of
    water availability (ILn) is established. ILn is the quotient between IWAf and
    the number of days in each half-month (between 13 and 16 days). Therefore, the
    actual crop irrigation requirement (IRn), i.e., the volume of water to be applied
    in each irrigation event, will be equal to the minimum of INn and ILn Eq. (6).
    (6) The theoretical irrigation time tt,n (hours) is calculated by Eq. (7) considering
    the efficiency of the irrigation system IE, the area of the irrigation sector
    A (ha), the nominal emitters flow qe (l/h) and the number of emitters of the irrigation
    sector ne (7) The programmed watering time cannot exceed the number of available
    irrigation hours established in the electric supply contract (te,n). Thus, the
    recommended irrigation time (tr,n) is the minimum of tt,n and te,n. Fig. 2 shows
    the flowchart of the irrigation scheduling procedure using data collected by the
    sensors via ICTs. The boxes with rounded edges and thick lines in the figure indicate
    that the data are from the farm characteristics module. In the boxes with dashed
    lines, the data have been recorded by sensors (on site or remotely) and sent via
    ICTs to the climate and irrigation monitoring data module. The precipitation and
    ETo records at the NAS, as well as the soil moisture content readings at sunset
    are updated according to the weather forecasts. The aim of this DSSPIM module
    is to provide daily optimal irrigation programming for a week, so predictions
    of the soil moisture depletion for the next 7 days are needed. To do this, the
    last Drn that was calculated is used as a starting value, In is the recommended
    irrigation depth (In = IRn) and the effective precipitation, ERn, is obtained
    with Eq. (8) using precipitation predictions for the value of Pn. The accuracy
    of the irrigation programming affects the values of blue and green water uses
    by the crops and hence the irrigation water use efficiency. 2.1.3.1. Efficient
    rainfall estimation for outdoor crops The water needs of outdoor crops are partially
    satisfied with rainwater. Effective rainfall, ERn in Eq. (1), is the rainwater
    fraction stored in the soil that can be used by the plant. Most existing methodologies
    estimate ER based on monthly rainwater volume (Ali and Mubarak, 2017, Allen et
    al., 1998, Smith and FAO, 1992, Villalobos et al., 2009), which reduces the accuracy
    of daily irrigation scheduling. To overcome this problem, DSSPIM includes a procedure
    to calculate daily ER that considers the water storage capacity of the soil, which
    depends on the soil type and the soil moisture content at the onset of the rainfall
    event. Eq. (8) estimates the effective rainfall using information from the previous
    day’s soil moisture deficit, Drn-1 (Eq. 3), and the gross rainfall at day n, (mm).
    This equation uses rainfall forecasts and rainfall data recorded by the NAS. NAS
    rainfall data are used to calculate the effective rainfall of the last day. When
    the purpose is to predict the effective rainfall of the next 7 days, precipitation
    forecasts are used (8) If Pn is lower than , the total gross precipitation can
    be stored, so ERn equals Pn. Otherwise, ER is 0 because soil moisture content
    is at field capacity. The 7-day forward irrigation scheduling requires the ERn
    and ETc, n forecasts. Thus, Eq. (8) is calculated using ETo and rainfall forecasts.
    2.1.4. Water use analysis/diagnosis This module determines the adequacy of the
    amount of water used according to the crop irrigation needs by means of a joint
    analysis of the WF and RIS indicators. The module performs a WF inventory according
    to ISO standard 14046 (ISO, 2014), which provides information on the volume of
    water used to produce a unit of product. The WF inventory estimates the crop water
    footprint (WFC) as the sum of the blue (WFblue) and green (WFgreen) water footprint
    components. Grey water has not been considered in the WF inventory because it
    is not a real volume of water used by crops. This water represents the amount
    of fresh water that would theoretically be needed to restore the quality of irrigation
    water returns that have been contaminated during the production process. For this
    reason, ISO 14046 does not include grey water in the calculation of WF of products
    and/or services (Lovarelli et al., 2016). WFC is normally expressed in m3/t or
    in L/kg and is the sum of the green crop water footprint (WFcgreen) and the blue
    crop water footprint (WFcblue). WFcgreen can be calculated as green crop water
    use (CWUgreen, m3/ ha) divided by the crop yield (Y, t/ha): (9) CWUgreen is calculated
    by Eq. (10) for outdoor crops and is null for greenhouse crops: (10) Where the
    term 10 is a unit conversion factor to change mm into m3/ha, lds is the duration
    of the crop growing season in days and ERn is calculated by Eq. (8). For permanent
    crops, the first day of the growing season is the last harvest day of the previous
    season. To estimate WFcblue, the following equation is applied (11) Where CWAblue
    (m3/ha) is the total volume of blue water applied to the crop as recorded by the
    water meters installed on the farm. The approach to calculate WFblue presented
    here differs from other works where WFblue is estimated with the CWUblue indicator,
    which is calculated using theoretical irrigation requirements (Chapagain and Orr,
    2009, Hoekstra et al., 2009). These methodologies do not take into account indirect
    water uses or water losses (water that does not return to the environment) due
    to inefficiencies in the irrigation system. Furthermore, it ignores situations
    of over- or under-irrigation due to the irrigation strategies applied. Thus, CWAblue
    includes all water applications during the crop season, including water applied
    to satisfy crop irrigation needs and water used in different crop management practices
    (e.g., soil preparation, salt washing, pipe cleaning, etc.) and water leaks in
    the irrigation system. Unless crop management practices involving water use are
    performed during non-irrigation periods or via a separate water network, it is
    difficult to identify the fraction of the water volumes recorded in the meter
    that correspond to irrigation or other uses required to obtain the product. Therefore,
    the amount of blue water used during the cropping season is obtained by Eq. (12).
    (12) Where In is the daily applied blue water depth (mm) recorded by the water
    meter i, wm represents the total number of water meters installed on the farm
    and Ai is the area (ha) associated to each water meter i installed in the different
    irrigation sectors. The denominator of this equation represents the total surface
    area of the farm monitored with irrigation meters. Since CWAblue is used to calculate
    WFblue, it provides information about the amount of blue water used directly and
    indirectly to produce a crop production unit. In short, the crop water footprint
    is determined by Eq. (13). (13) When used alone, the WF only reports information
    about how much water was used to obtain a unit of product, but it does not provide
    information about whether the amount of water applied was correct or not. Therefore,
    to check irrigation water use suitability, irrigation adequacy indicators should
    be used in combination with the WF. To evaluate the suitability of the actual
    applied irrigation, the RIS indicator was used (Levine, 1982). RIS (Eq. 14) relates
    the amount of water applied (recorded in the water meters) and the theoretical
    crop irrigation requirements during crop growing (García Morillo et al., 2015,
    González Perea et al., 2016). (14) RIS values around 1.2 indicate that irrigation
    has been adequately performed, considering the inefficiencies of the soil and
    the irrigation system. Values below and above 1.2 indicate deficit and excess
    irrigation, respectively. 2.2. Case studies The methodology was tested on two
    organic farms in southern Spain: one with orange tree crops (37° 44′ 9.39′’ N,
    −5° 6′ 58.69′’ W) and the other with greenhouse tomato crops (36° 51′ 23.32′’
    N, −2° 24′ 37.54′’ W). The citrus fruit plantation (Navelina variety) is located
    in the Guadalquivir valley, an area that receives about 600 mm of average annual
    rainfall and where a high percentage of the cultivated land area is dedicated
    to irrigated crops 28.92% of total national irrigation; (MAPA, 2019). The high
    demand for irrigation water in the Guadalquivir basin means that water rights
    are usually lower than the crop water requirements. Consequently, deficit irrigation
    strategies are a common practice in the region. The planting frame of the trial
    orange grove was 5.5 m x 4 m and was drip irrigated by an irrigation network organized
    in 2-ha sectors where irrigation water is distributed through two irrigation laterals
    per tree line. The nominal flow rate of the emitters was 2.8 L/h (1 m separation
    between emitters) with a pressure compensation range of 10–40 m. The farm receives
    water from the Fuente Palmera Irrigation Association from 00:00–8:00 a.m. Monday
    to Friday and 24 h a day on weekends. During the 2019 irrigation season, the water
    allocation assigned to this farm was 5000 m3/ha with a daily ETo in the range
    0.5–7.8 mm. The soil texture of the farm was analyzed in the laboratory and identified
    as sandy loam with a moisture content at field capacity of 0.28 m3/m3 and a permanent
    wilting point of 0.1 m3/m3. The average annual yield of the orange grove was 15 t/ha,
    considering the growing season as the natural year from the time the harvest finishes
    in January. The trial tomato greenhouse is located in Almería, southeast Spain.
    The water resources in this area are very scarce and under severe pressure from
    intensive agriculture, which aggravates problems of overexploitation, pollution
    and the salinization of aquifers (Gallardo et al., 2013). These circumstances
    require the optimal use of irrigation water, so greenhouse tomatoes are particularly
    interesting for testing the methodology developed. The greenhouse tomato cycle
    extends from mid-August to the end of May without rainfall inputs. The greenhouse
    roof whitening technique was applied from planting to mid-September at a dose
    of 0.25 kg lime/L. This technique is used to reduce the temperature inside the
    greenhouse, but it also reduces solar radiation inside the greenhouse, leading
    to a reduction in ETo (Fernández et al., 2010). During the 2019–2020 season, the
    ETo values inside the greenhouse ranged from 0.1 to 4.5 mm. The water source for
    the greenhouse is an irrigation pond fed by a groundwater intake. The irrigation
    network is composed of four irrigation sectors (0.7 ha) in which each drip pipe
    irrigates a line of plants spaced 2.05 m apart. The nominal flow rate of the drippers
    was 4 L/h (non-pressure compensating) placed every 0.4 m. The average electrical
    conductivity of the irrigation water was 2 dS/m. The greenhouse soil was of loamy
    texture and 27 cm in depth (bounded by a hardened profile). The moisture content
    at field capacity was 0.34 m3/m3 and the permanent wilting point was 0.08 m3/m3.
    Under these conditions, the average yield of the tomato greenhouse was 109 t/ha
    (10.9 kg/m2) for a planting density of 1.5 plants/m2 (branch and cocktail varieties).
    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Application of DSSPIM to the case studies To test
    the effectiveness of the methodology described in this work, DSSPIM was implemented
    during the 2019 crop season to manage the precision irrigation systems of two
    commercial organic farms that produce oranges and greenhouse tomatoes. In both
    case studies, weather forecasts from the AEMET Open Data system (AEMET, 2015)
    and the eltiempo.es website (Pelmorex Corp, 2017) were used. Historical climate
    data were obtained from the public agroclimatic stations closest to each farm
    (Palma del Río for the orange trees and Almería for the greenhouse tomatoes).
    Likewise, the evolution of soil water content was monitored using capacitive sensors
    installed at depths of 15, 40 and 55 cm in the orange tree test plot and at depths
    of 10, 17 and 25 cm in the tomato greenhouse. 3.1.1. Irrigation management of
    the orange grove DSSPIM was applied to analyze various irrigation scheduling strategies
    (FIR and RDI) in an orange grove farm during the growing season. The results of
    DSSPIM have been compared with the actual irrigation scheduling. Three scenarios
    defined for different irrigation strategies were studied. In scenario 1, the FIR
    strategy was applied (Fig. 3), while the RDI strategy was applied in scenario
    2 (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows the actual irrigation management on the farm (scenario
    3) during the study season. Download : Download high-res image (227KB) Download

    moisture depletion level throughout the crop season with respect to the allowable
    depletion level (ADL), readily available water (RAW) and total available water
    (TAW). DOY is the day of the year. To calculate the daily soil moisture deficit
    in scenarios 1 and 2, Eq. (1) was used. In scenario 3, Eq. (3) was used to determine
    Drn, taking 0.2 as the value of parameter “x”. Fig. 3A shows the daily rainfall
    distribution recorded at the NAS and the effective rainfall (ER), which were calculated
    from January 1 to December 31, 2019 (365 days of the year [DOY]) using Eq. (8).
    The irrigation scheduling proposed by DSSPIM for the FIR strategy is presented
    in Fig. 3B and Fig. 3C, which show the evolution of the soil moisture depletion
    level throughout the crop season with respect to the ADL, RAW and TAW thresholds
    of soil water deficit (Section 2.1.3). Although the objective of this irrigation
    strategy was to satisfy crop irrigation needs, the irrigation schedule was conditioned
    by the IWA (500 mm), since the water needs of the orange trees exceeded this value
    by 42%. The total irrigation applied following this strategy was 495 mm. The soil
    water content decreased rapidly during the first months of the year due to low
    rainfall (Fig. 3C), so the irrigation season started in mid-March. Several precipitation
    events in spring (Fig. 3A) from DOY 90 to DOY 120 increased the soil water content
    above the ADL level, so irrigation was not necessary. Later, in the summer months,
    crop water demand was higher than the applied irrigation (limited by IWA), so
    the plants took water from the soil until the soil moisture deficit (Dr) reached
    the RAW value (Fig. 3C). From this threshold, water extraction was more difficult
    for the plants and ETc was reduced (Ks < 1), so the rate of increase of the moisture
    deficit decreased. In the autumn months, from DOY 300, Dr decreased due to new
    rainfall events and the amount of water stored in the soil increased. In 2019,
    the gross precipitation recorded on the farm by the NAS was 318 mm and the total
    effective precipitation estimated for 2019 using the FIR strategy was 247 mm.
    For the same precipitation value, the lower the soil moisture deficit (which depends
    on the irrigation strategy), the lower the ER value. Thus, for example, on DOY
    31 (Fig. 3A), when the gross precipitation was 22 mm, only 5 mm were useful for
    the plants and the rest of the gross precipitation was lost by percolation, runoff
    or evaporation. In contrast, from DOY 91–121, ER was equal to P because the value
    of Dr was high, and the soil had the capacity to store all the precipitation.
    Fig. 4 shows the irrigation management in the second scenario in which the RDI
    strategy was applied using IDC values adapted to the local conditions (García-Tejero
    et al., 2010). Unlike the first scenario, daily irrigation scheduling was not
    as constrained by the daily IWA value. The theoretical irrigation requirements
    at the critical phenological stages of the crop were more restrictive than the
    daily IWA values. This situation caused the moisture deficit to exceed the RAW
    for a longer time and the plants were subjected to a reduction in ETc. In the
    first scenario (Fig. 3C), this situation occurred between DOY 198 and 323, while
    in the second scenario (Fig. 4C) it started 28 days earlier (DOY 170). However,
    both strategies prevented the reduction of ETc during flowering, the most sensitive
    period for the crop. At this phenological stage, water stress can lead to yield
    losses. In the RDI strategy, 403 mm of irrigation water were applied, 20% less
    than that applied with the FIR strategy. This irrigation strategy, which led to
    higher values of the moisture deficit at the end of summer, achieved higher ER
    values (266 mm for the whole season) than scenario 1 and scenario 3. The actual
    irrigation management is shown in Fig. 5. In the 2019 irrigation season, the total
    irrigation water use recorded in the water meter was 497 mm (Fig. 5B). The total
    volume of water applied was equal to the recommended volume obtained by the FIR
    strategy. However, because the irrigation management performed by the farmer was
    not the same as the schedule obtained with DSSPIM, the evolution of the soil moisture
    differed significantly from that shown in Fig. 3C. Due to the longer duration
    and frequency of irrigations, the soil moisture content was maintained at values
    close to θFC, thus indicating non-optimal water use. In this situation, the soil
    moisture content is sufficient to meet the ETc requirements of the plants and
    no further irrigations would be necessary until Dr reaches ADL. Even so, the farmer
    applied irrigations between DOY 150 and 197. Moreover, unlike the first two scenarios,
    the Dr in the actual irrigation management was kept close to the RAW between DOY
    143 and 150 (end of May); a situation that should have been avoided since reductions
    in ETc during flowering can affect yield. As a result, the calculated ER for this
    scenario was 238 mm, which represents 75% of the gross annual precipitation (318.4 mm).
    When using ER calculation procedures based on empirical equations (Smith and FAO,
    1992), the ER is higher (between 7% and 20%) than that obtained with DSSPIM, as
    the other procedures do not consider the soil moisture content before rainfall
    events. The moisture deficit in winter is very low (Fig. 5C) so the soil can only
    store a small portion of the rainwater. 3.1.2. Irrigation management of the tomato
    greenhouse In the case study of greenhouse tomato, there is no limit for water
    allocation and the soil’s water storage capacity is not considered in the irrigation
    scheduling of this type of crops (Fernández et al., 2001). Consequently, irrigation
    programming is only conditioned by crop evapotranspiration and since it is a horticultural
    crop, the FIR irrigation strategy is used to manage irrigation. The crop growing
    season started on August 20, 2019 and ended on May 25, 2020. Because water meters
    were installed after the crops were planted, only water inputs were monitored
    during the growing period, without considering previous watering for soil preparation.
    In this case, the soil moisture sensors were used only to monitor the applied
    irrigation. Fig. 6 shows both the actual water application during the irrigation
    season and the irrigation scheduling computed by DSSPIM. Download : Download high-res

    management by DSSPIM for greenhouse tomatoes throughout the 2019/2020 crop season.
    DOY is the day of the year. The actual amount of irrigation water applied by the
    farmer during the season was 558 mm (according to the water meter records), while
    the volume recommended by DSSPIM was 654 mm. From DOY 352 (2019), significant
    deviations were observed between the proposed and actual schedule. In contrast
    to the recommended irrigation schedule, in the actual schedule there were days
    when no irrigation occurred. This is because certain environmental conditions
    inside the greenhouse (relative humidity and ventilation) were not included in
    DSSPIM. The main difference occurred in the last month of the crop season (May,
    from DOY 122–146) when the farmer decided to apply 65% of the water needs in the
    first fortnight and reduced irrigation to 33% of the crop needs on the last 10
    days. This decision was related to yield decline at the end of the crop cycle.
    3.2. Water use analysis in the organic orange grove and greenhouse tomatoes The
    aim of DSSPIM is to analyze current irrigation management practices with a view
    to future decisions. The analysis/diagnostic module described in Section 2.1.4
    was performed using the WF and RIS indicators. The results of the main indicators
    of the water use analysis for the orange and greenhouse tomato crops are presented
    in Table 1. Table 1. Water use analysis for the 2019/2020 season. Crop Orange

    RIS – relative irrigation supply; WFgreen – green component of crop water footprint;
    WFblue – blue component of crop water footprint; WFC – crop water footprint The
    amount of blue water used (CWUblue) for both crops was obtained from the records
    of the water meters installed on each farm. For the crops grown outdoors, CWUgreen
    is the total amount of rainwater available for the crops and is estimated from
    the measurements of the soil moisture sensors. The crop yield data of the studied
    season were provided by the farm managers. Under the actual irrigation management,
    the crop yield values for oranges and greenhouse tomatoes were 16.50 t/ha and
    109.5 t/ha, respectively. Both farms are classified as organic farms, so quality
    is given priority over quantity. Consequently, when these crops are produced under
    conventional agricultural conditions, they can reach higher yield values (around
    20% higher than on organic production farms). For the orange groves, 7348 m3/ha
    of water were used to obtain a crop yield of 16.50 t/ha. Of the total amount of
    water used, 2382 m3/ha corresponded to green water and 4966 m3/ha corresponded
    to blue water for irrigation and other cultivation practices. The total applied
    irrigation water was lower than the IWA (5000 m3/ha) and considerably lower than
    the theoretical crop irrigation needs (7112 m3/ha). The RIS value was 0.7, thus
    indicating the application of a deficit irrigation strategy. The total WForange
    value was 445 m3/t, of which 68% was WFblue. The production of tomatoes was not
    affected by rainwater, so CWUgreen was zero. The CWUbllue value in this crop was
    5576 m3/ha and lower than CWR (6536 m3/ha). The RIS value for the entire irrigation
    season was 0.85 due to the deficit irrigation performed by the farm manager at
    the end of the season. Given the high production of greenhouse crops, the resulting
    WFtomato was 51 m3/t, which is much lower than the WF of the orange crop. Although
    the methodology has been tested on orange and tomato greenhouse crops, the methodology
    is applicable to outdoor woody crops and greenhouse horticultural crops with similar
    characteristics and management, e.g. olive trees (outdoor) or greenhouses crops
    like cucumber, pepper and eggplant. The information obtained from the water use
    analysis and the results of the DSSPIM simulations enable detecting moments when
    the irrigator’s management differs from the recommended irrigation schedule. Identifying
    the causes and consequence of this difference allows the irrigator to take corrective
    measures and improve irrigation management in the following season. DSSPIM uses
    ICT tools and weather forecasts and records to estimate effective precipitation
    from daily soil moisture content measurements and obtain more accurate daily irrigation
    schedules than other DSSs that use only historical weather records and general
    formulations to estimate effective rainfall (Alcaide et al., 2019, González Perea
    et al., 2017, Mérida García et al., 2018). Moreover, the increase in water use
    efficiency through precision irrigation scheduled by DSSPIM, in which various
    irrigation strategies such as controlled deficit irrigation can be considered,
    are evaluated by the joint use of WF and RIS indicators (García Morillo et al.,
    2015, González Perea et al., 2016) together with the irrigation schedules. Finally,
    DSSPIM permits comparing water use (total volume and timing) based on schedules
    to a farm’s usual irrigation programming to identify irrigation inefficiencies
    which, if corrected, can lead to water savings of up to 20% while maintaining
    the same level of production and reducing costs for the farmer. However, DSSPIM
    has certain limitations. The accuracy of the results could be conditioned by the
    quality of the information used (weather forecasts, soil water content measured
    by soil sensors, water consumption recorded by water meters, etc.), failures in
    the coverage of the communication system of the sensors, as well as the inadequate
    maintenance of the control devices. The suitability of the network sectorization
    (depending on the spatial variability of soils, topography, etc.) determines the
    minimum number of soil moisture sensors (one per sector) needed to obtain accurate
    results. Precise sectorization may be unaffordable for some farms to obtain quality
    results with DSSIPM. Other disadvantages include constraints related to crop development,
    personnel management, market prices or environmental conditions inside the greenhouse
    which affect irrigation management and are known by the farmer but not addressed
    in the current version of DSSPIM. 4. Conclusions A precision irrigation management
    decision support model, DSSPIM, has been developed to perform and evaluate optimal
    irrigation management for outdoor crops as well as for greenhouse horticultural
    crops. The procedure performs an optimal weekly irrigation scheduling adapted
    to the characteristics of each farm using ICTs and real data are collected on
    site by remote sensors and from open data weather forecasts. The on-site remote
    sensors are used to send information in real time to the calculation platform
    via ICTs, which is then stored in the cloud for subsequent analysis. Real-time
    information on the applied crop water and the evolution of soil moisture content
    is used to determine the optimal irrigation timing, as well as the amount of water
    to be applied. Accurate data on daily crop water use (green and blue water) are
    evaluated in the water use analysis module. The use of soil water content information
    in outdoor crops allows the determination of daily effective rainfall (green water)
    on a more precise and appropriate time scale for optimal irrigation, which in
    turn improves the management of water resources and allows for more accurate green
    water accounting. DSSPIM was developed and applied to two organic farms (orange
    grove and greenhouse tomatoes) during an agricultural season in southern Spain.
    Optimal irrigation schedules were obtained for each crop. At the end of the crop
    season, crop water use was accounted for and analyzed in the water use analysis
    module. The comparison between scenarios of different irrigation management systems
    (FIR and RDI) in orange trees shows that the application of regulated deficit
    irrigation strategies in tree crops can reduce irrigation water use by 20%. Moreover,
    the model maintains the irrigation water recommendation below the water allocation
    in all the simulated scenarios. Additionally, the results show that for the same
    irrigation water consumption, the differences in irrigation management (frequency
    and duration) result in a lower use of rainwater stored in the soil. In the tomato
    crop, the management recommended by DSSPIM and the actual irrigator’s management
    closely matched the crop needs, with the exception of the end of the cycle, when
    the farmer made a decision related to factors not considered in DSSPIM. The joint
    analysis of WFC, RIS and DSSPIM irrigation schedules provide useful information
    about both the amount of water needed to obtain a unit of product and the level
    of adequacy of the applied irrigation. This information is essential to detect
    inefficiencies in irrigation management and deviations in the actual irrigation
    schedule compared to the recommended DSSPIM schedule and undertake improvement
    actions aimed at increasing water use efficiency. The automation of irrigation
    scheduling using DSSPIM data, as well as the incorporation of other factors that
    affect irrigation scheduling (crop management, production status, prices, etc.)
    and improved irrigation network sectorization (increasing the number of sensors
    to better monitor crop and environmental conditions on farms or in greenhouses)
    could contribute to irrigation scheduling that is more in line with the reality
    of each farm; a key aspect for irrigators to rely on tools such as this one. Declaration

    • Data is collected from an open field Internet of Things drip irrigation experiment.
    • System Identification Toolbox in MATAB is used for model identification. • Different
    model structures are evaluated using statistical analysis. • A state space model
    presents a better dynamics of the system. Abstract In the face of increasing water
    scarcity and uncertainties of climate change, improving crop water use efficiency
    and productivity, while minimizing negative environmental impacts, is becoming
    crucial to meet the surging global food demand. Smart irrigation has a potential
    of improving water use efficiency in precision agriculture especially when efficient
    irrigation control strategies are adopted. Conventionally, irrigation systems
    rely on heuristic methods to schedule irrigation which either leads to over-irrigation
    or under-irrigation. This influences the crop physiological characteristics as
    well as the water use efficiency. To tackle this menace, model-based irrigation
    management has been overemphasized. A closed-loop irrigation control strategy
    relies on a mathematical model of the system for irrigation scheduling decisions.
    In this study, a data-driven approach was used to learn soil moisture dynamics
    from a drip irrigated tomato in an open field agricultural system. A total number
    of 9674 data samples were collected using an ATMOS41 weather station, TERROS 12
    soil moisture sensor and a YFS-201 flow sensor for crop evapotranspiration and
    precipitation, soil moisture and irrigation volumes respectively. Data driven
    modelling was then performed using the system identification toolbox in a MATLAB
    environment. The model formulation was a multi-input single-output (MISO) system
    with reference evapotranspiration, irrigation and rainfall as inputs and soil
    moisture as the output. Different model structures including transfer functions,
    state space models, polynomial models and ARX models were evaluated. Model performance
    was evaluated using the mean square error (MSE), final prediction error (FPE)
    and estimated fit of the model approaches. Simulation results indicate that the
    soil moisture dynamics model provides a satisfactory approximation of the process
    dynamics with a state space model giving an estimated fit of 97.04 %, MSE and
    FPE of and respectively. This model will be used to design a model predictive
    controller for smart irrigation scheduling in open field environmental conditions.

    scarcity at a global scale is increasing, making it perplexing to achieve sustainable
    agricultural production [1], [2], [3]. Agricultural water scarcity is projected
    to increase in more than 80 % of the world''s countries by the year 2050 [4].
    This coupled with the increasing population, climate change impacts and competition
    from other sectors, puts food security at stake [5]. Irrigated agriculture is
    one of the major water users accounting for about 70 % of freshwater withdraws
    [6],[7]. Irrigation accounts for 40 % of the world''s food and fibre production
    and will therefore play a crucial role in feeding the 9.7 billion people by 2050
    [8],[9]. Water withdrawal for irrigation is projected to hit 29000 km3 by 2050
    with most of the high demand in developing countries translating into 20 million
    hectares under irrigation [10]. The need to enhance water use efficiency has never
    been over emphasized throughout the research community and industry as it is presently.
    Enhancing water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture necessitates effective
    use of available water resources to respond to real-time crop irrigation requirements.
    This requires monitoring water use and controlling how the irrigation water is
    applied. The goal of monitoring the crop environment in real-time is to control
    the root zone soil moisture between specific thresholds; field capacity and permanent
    wilting point [11]. On the other hand, irrigation control deals with applying
    what will keep the soil moisture between that threshold at the set time with precision.
    Emerging technologies, such as wireless communications, remote sensing, machine
    learning, crop physiology and soil environment monitoring systems, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and big data, have expounded the scope of irrigation monitoring
    and control [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. These technologies facilitate the generation
    of large amounts of data which when processed and analyzed can be utilized for
    predictions. This has given rise to the paradigm shift from open loop irrigation
    control to model-based irrigation management [17,18]. In model-based irrigation
    management, data from soil, weather and plant makes an integral part of the predictive
    control strategy to improve crop water use efficiency while minimizing negative
    environmental consequences [19], [20], [21], [22]. Over the years, the soil agro-hydrological
    model has been utilized to depict the soil moisture dynamics in the rootzone [23]
    as a basis for model based irrigation scheduling. The model characterizes the
    hydrological cycle between the soil, the atmosphere, and the crop [24]. Modelling
    soil moisture dynamics is very critical in irrigation automation. Unlike conventional
    irrigation systems that rely on open-loop irrigation strategies, closed-loop irrigation
    control for smart irrigation uses a plant model and the system''s current state
    to predict future irrigation amounts [25], [26], [27]. Nonetheless, these models
    have been developed for controlled environment agricultural systems especially
    in developed countries like USA, China and Australia. About, 95 % of food consumed
    in developing countries is from open field agricultural systems where most of
    the water losses occur. Therefore, developing models on which irrigation scheduling
    decisions can be based in open field agriculture is of significant importance.
    Several researchers have modelled soil moisture dynamics in an attempt to improve
    irrigation scheduling. For example, Saleem et al. [28] and Lozoya et al. [29]
    developed a soil moisture dynamics model for closed-loop irrigation The authors
    assumed negligible precipitation and ignored the crop coefficient in the evapotranspiration
    model. The drawback then becomes its suitability in different agroclimatic zones
    where supplementary irrigation is necessary. Additionally, crops need different
    volumes of water per growth stage. Similarly, Mao et al. [30] used the agro-hydrological
    model to predict the future states of an agricultural system. The authors, however,
    rely on historical data for irrigation scheduling. This means real-time plant
    water needs are dependent on past data instead of real-time soil, weather, and
    plant system parameters. Recently, Abioye et al. [31] developed an Internet of
    Things (IoT) and data-driven modelling to model soil moisture dynamics in a controlled
    environment agricultural system. The authors developed a multi-input single-output
    (MISO) system with evapotranspiration and irrigation volumes as inputs and soil
    moisture as the output. Open field agricultural systems, however, depict a more
    dynamic nature of soil moisture with many factors contributing to changes in soil
    moisture compared to controlled environment agricultural systems. There is considerably
    a small body of studies that modelled soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural
    systems using data-driven approaches. This is partly attributed to the costly
    monitoring equipment required to provide the data for all the parameters in the
    water balance equation. The major objective of this study is to therefore develop
    a soil moisture dynamics model in an open field agricultural system to aid model-based
    irrigation management for enhancement of water use efficiency in arid and semi-arid
    regions. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The experiment was conducted
    at the University for Development Studies, Nyankpala campus at WACWISA experimental
    site located at 90 24’ 37” N and 00 58’53” E of the Equator as shown in Fig. 1.
    A drip irrigation experiment was designed on a 20*18m plot under tomato production
    spaced at 0.5m. The drip irrigation system consisted of 20mm HDPE laterals with
    online emitters with a flow rate of 2.1litres per hour. The experimental data
    was collected from September 21st to November 26, 2022, resulting in 9674 data
    sets for developing the soil moisture dynamics model collected in 10-mibute time-steps.

    model describes the soil moisture dynamics in an open field agricultural system.
    The agro-hydrologic balance model states that changes in rootzone soil moisture
    at a particular point in time is due to water inflows including rainfall, capillary
    rise, irrigation less the water outflows, deep percolation, water runoff and evapotranspiration
    as depicted in Fig. 3 [27]. The agro-hydrological model can be mathematically
    expressed as in Eq. (1) [28,32]. (1) Download : Download high-res image (151KB)

    , , , , , and In most agricultural fields the lateral water inflow is negligible,
    or the total effect is always zero. Likewise, the capillary rise contribution
    in soils with a deep-water table is zero. The runoff in a well-designed smart
    irrigation system is taken as zero, and thus the change in rootzone soil moisture
    becomes as shown in Eq. (2). (2) 2.2.1. Evapotranspiration The crop evapotranspiration
    then is a product of reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient as
    depicted in Eq. (3) [33]. Allen et al. [33] defines the crop evapotranspiration
    under standard conditions, denoted as ETC, as the evapotranspiration from disease-free,
    well-fertilized crops, grown in large fields, under optimum soil water conditions,
    and achieving full production under the given climatic conditions. The FAO Penman
    Monteith model for reference evapotranspiration was adopted for this study. (3)
    Where; ETc is the crop evapotranspiration(mmday−1), ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration(mmday−1)
    and Kc is the crop factor which depends on the growth stage of the plant. (4)

    pressure (kpa) An ATMOS 41 weather station was used to monitor the plant environment
    in real-time and the data was sent to a wireless Zentrac data logger and stored
    in the cloud. The automated weather station gives solar radiation, air temperature,
    vapour pressure, vapour pressure deficit, precipitation, and wind speed among
    other parameters. Net radiation at the crop surface Rn, Soil heat flux density
    G, slope vapour pressure curve and psychometric constant were derived from measured
    parameters using procedures described in Allen et al. [33]. Weather data used
    in the calculation of reference evapotranspiration was collected at 10-minute
    intervals and stored on the Zetracloud. Using the FAO Penman Monteith Equation,
    a 10-minute reference evapotranspiration was determined for the 9674 samples.
    2.2.2. Soil Moisture Soil moisture measurements were conducted by using a Terros
    12 volumetric water content sensor from meter group. The sensor was located at
    a depth of 30 cm in order to measure the soil moisture at the effective rootzone
    depth of tomato crop. The crop grows over a sandy loam type of soil with a field
    capacity and permanent wilting point of 24.5 and 12.6, respectively and an infiltration
    rate of 12 l/h. 2.2.3. Irrigation Similarly, in order to estimate the irrigation
    volume, the IoT based flowmeter produces a digital output pulse which has been
    counted by the IoT Expresso board to calculate the water flow rate during irrigation.
    The water flowrate is calibrated in Eq. (5) and flow volume in Eq. (6). (5) (6)
    2.3. Model Structure 2.3.1. Transfer functions For a dynamical system that does
    not change over time, the transfer function provides a useful representation.
    [34]. Inspection or basic algebraic manipulations of the differential equations
    that characterize the systems can yield the transfer function. Even infinite-dimensional
    systems driven by partial differential equations may be understood with the help
    of transfer functions. Experiments on a system can be used to establish its transfer
    function. Eq. 7 depicts the mathematical formulation of a transfer function [35].
    (7) Where are matrices 2.3.2. The Box Jenkins Model The Box Jenkins model uses
    a rational polynomial function to give totally separate parameterization for the
    dynamics and noise. Eqs. 8a and b represent the Box Jenkins model [36]. (8a) Where
    (8b) Water content in volume at time t is denoted by y(t), input variables are
    denoted by u(t), and estimate error is denoted by e(t). A(x), B(x), C(x), D(x),
    and F(x) are the polynomials that determine the model''s output, inputs, and estimate
    errors, respectively. 2.3.3. The State Space Model In statistics, a state-space
    model is a kind of probabilistic graphical model that graphically expresses the
    probabilistic dependency between a latent state variable and an observed measurement.
    [37]. It represents the dynamics of an Nth order system as a first-order differential
    equation in an N-vector, which is called the state [38]. The important attribute
    of the state vector x(t) in the state space formulation is that it entirely specifies
    the system at a time t [39]. Future states are determined solely by the current
    state, x(t), and any inputs, u(t), at time t and beyond. The current state x(t)
    summarizes all previous states and the full input history; it thus encompasses
    all of the system''s memory. Eqs. 9a and 9b can be used to represent state space
    models. (9a) (9b) Where, is the state vector at time n, u is a vector of inputs,
    A is an state transition matrix, B is an input coeffient matrix, is a column vector
    of the output variables , is an matrix of the constant-coefficient that weight
    of state variables and is an m x n matrix of the constant-coefficient weight of
    the system inputs. 2.3.4. The Output Error Model When only white measurement noise
    is affecting the process output, the Output Error model structure is used as represented
    in Eqs. 10a and b [40]. (10a) This model can be expressed as (10b) 2.3.5. The
    Autoregressive with External Input Model (ARX) Model The ARX model is derived
    from Eq. 11 [41]. (11) Where and . These are polynomial matrices; d is the delay
    of the system. The ARX model is therefore simplified using equation 12 as shown.
    (12) 2.3.6. The Autoregressive Moving Average with Extra Input Model This autoregressive
    moving average with external input model (ARMAX) is in broader structure compared
    to the ARX as shown in Eq. 13. (13) Where . This is a polynomial where the noise
    term is explicitly modelled and expressed as shown in Eq. 14. (14) 2.4. System
    Identification in MATLAB Environment System identification toolbox in MATLAB was
    used to model the soil moisture dynamics starting with a lower order, increasing
    and decreasing the order of the polynomial and the variable delay. Fig. 4 shows
    the interface of the system identification toolbox where various model structures
    were used. A total of 9674 samples collected at 600s time steps were used in the
    modelling with 70 % of the data as estimation and 30 % as validation data. Additionally,
    pre-processing of the experimental data was performed to get rid of the trends,
    outliers, and means. as suggested by [42]. Download : Download high-res image

    toolbox. 2.5. Model Evaluation With the help of the lowest order of the system''s
    dynamics, the models constructed inside the MATLAB system identification toolbox
    are able to predict the behaviour of the system''s output and graphically represent
    the relationship between the system''s input and output variables [31]. Best fit,
    final prediction error (FPE), and mean square error (MSE) are three statistical
    measures that may be used to evaluate the efficacy of the developed models [31].
    2.5.1. Final Prediction Error Model quality is quantified by the absolute value
    of the prediction error obtained during validation on an independent data set.
    According to Abdul-Rahim et al. [43] the accuracy of the derived model is dependent
    on how small the FPE is. This is expressed in Eq. 15. (15) Where; Estimation data
    is denoted by N, and the associated prediction errors are represented by e(t),
    a vector of dimensions (n, -1). The estimated parameters are denoted by , while
    the total number of parameters is denoted by d 2.5.2. Mean Square Error The mean
    square error (MSE) is a statistical metric used to evaluate prediction quality
    in the same unit of the variable. The MSE score is near to zero, indicating that
    the model prediction is correct. The MSE is defined by Eq. 16: (16) Where; are
    observed and predicted values at time (i = 1,2,3,…n) and n is the data point.
    2.5.3. Estimated Fit The estimated fit (%) is a measure of the correlation between
    the measured output and the predicted output . This is computed as shown in Eq.

    the relationship between reference evapotranspiration , and Solar Radiation Rs,
    during the experimental data collection. It is observed that peak solar radiation
    received in the afternoon which translates into peak values of . The maximum recorded
    during the study period is 4.8 mmday−1 while the maximum solar radiation was 1357.9

    full-size image Fig. 5. A graph of Solar radiation vs ET0 during the experimental
    period. 3.2. Reference evapotranspiration, water content and precipitation The
    soil moisture content at the start of the experiment was 0.34 m3/m3 as depicted
    in Fig. 6. During this time precipitation values were high given that the rainy
    season was coming to an end. As the precipitation reduced, the soil moisture content
    reduced to field capacity where it was being maintained through irrigation. The
    dynamics may be seen altering because of plant water absorption and environmental
    (weather) effects that induce water loss from the soil, resulting in a changing
    variation in the volumetric water content. As evapotranspiration causes water
    loss, the volumetric water content of the soil changes, indicating that more or
    less water is required to be provided for irrigation. As a result, these variables
    have a direct influence on the amount of water applied to the plant. Download

    period. 3.3. Statistical Performance of the Models From the system identification
    simulation results in MATLAB presented in Table 1, it is evident that state space
    model performed better than other model structures (Transfer Functions, ARMAX,
    Box Jenkins, ARX and Output Error model). The state space mode yielded an estimated
    fit of 97.04 % being the highest amongst all the model structures evaluated. Additionally,
    in terms of the mean square error and final prediction error, the state space
    model performed better with the least values of the statistical criterion. The
    Output Error model on the other hand performed poorly amongst all the model structures.
    It could not mimic the soil moisture dynamics in the field and hence was not chosen
    for a model predictive controller design. The step ahead prediction results presented
    in Table 2 also support the state space model''s ability to represent the dynamic
    nature of the soil-water agricultural system. With a 5-steo ahead prediction it
    gives an estimated fit of 98.92 % making it the best choice for MPC design. The
    chosen model estimated the parameters as shown in Eqs. 15 and 17 in discrete-time
    state space model. Fig. 7 shows the 5-step ahead prediction of the system. Table

    the step response of the model structures evaluated in the MATLAB environment.
    The model structures are graded using the lowest order of the dynamic response.
    The first-order models'' output was found to be steady, with no overshoot or undershoot
    but a sluggish response time. There is no lag and a faster rising time compared
    to other models, even the Box Jenkins model with an offset. The frequency response
    curve, shown in Fig. 9, reveals that the dynamics of all model structures are
    identical over a wide range of frequencies. The purpose of this data-driven modelling
    was to create the forecasting models integral to creating a model-based controller
    for the physical system. The results show that despite the nonlinearity of the
    inputs, the output is quite steady. Despite experimental validation, the prediction
    model created in this study has some margin of error. Download : Download high-res

    Curve. The step and frequency response of the models can provide valuable information
    for practical agricultural purposes. For example, the step response can help to
    understand how quickly the system responds to changes in input (e.g., irrigation)
    and to identify any delays or oscillations in the response. The frequency response
    can help to identify the natural frequencies of the system and to design controllers
    that can regulate the system at different frequencies. 4. Conclusion Improving
    water use efficiency in precision agriculture is of paramount importance. Model-based
    irrigation management is one of the approaches through which irrigation scheduling
    can be responsive in real time especially for open field agricultural systems.
    This study demonstrates a data-driven approach where data from monitoring sensors
    in a drip irrigated tomato experiment is used to develop a soil moisture dynamics
    model using system identification. The resulting model is a state space model
    for great performance in terms of statistical evaluation criteria. In comparison
    to other model structures, it gives an estimation of fit of 97.04%, mean square
    error of 1.74 × 10−7 and final prediction error of 1.75 × 10−7. Future research
    will involve utilizing the state space model to develop a model predictive controller
    which will later be deployed on a micro-controller in an open field agricultural
    system. Funding Information The Institute de Recherché pour le Development (IRD),

    Irrigation is important to sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) production and efficient
    irrigation management is critical for yield, sugar concentration, water use, and
    environment quality. Two irrigation studies were conducted to investigate sugarbeet
    response to deficit irrigation under conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT)
    systems in 2016 and 2018. The irrigation treatments included full irrigation (100%
    crop evapotranspiration, 100ETc) and deficit irrigation (66% crop evapotranspiration,
    66ETc), and two irrigation cutoff dates (15 and 30 d before harvest). Plant population,
    soil moisture, sugarbeet root yield, sucrose concentration, and impurity value
    were measured. Although deficit irrigation at 66ETc did not affect the sugarbeet
    root yield, sucrose concentration, and sugar yield in 2016, it reduced the root
    yield, sugar yield, and extractable sugar yield by 5.5, 1.2, and 1.2 Mg ha−1 under
    CT and 12.4, 2.1, and 1.9 Mg ha−1 under NT systems in 2018. Soil moisture in NT
    showed great depletion at 15- and 38-cm depths in July and August in 2018. Results
    indicate the potential of implementing a deficit irrigation strategy in sugarbeet
    to reduce the water supply and increase the water use efficiency, but in-situ
    soil moisture sensors should be installed to monitor soil moisture to avoid severe
    water stress. Stopping irrigation 30 d before harvest slightly reduced the sugarbeet
    root yield but did not affect extractable sugar yield, suggesting that omitting
    one irrigation late in the growing season may not reduce root yield and quality.
    Deficit irrigation in conjunction with a no-till system could reduce production
    costs and bring environmental benefits. Abbreviations 66ETc 66% crop evapotranspiration

    crop in the United States, with over 450,000 ha in 2018 generating US$1.6 billion
    values (USDA-NASS, 2018). As a biennial crop, sugarbeet germinates and develops
    to rosette in the first year and it flowers in the second year for seed production.
    Commonly, the roots are harvested for sugar or biofuel production in the first
    year before the onset of winter frost (Panella et al., 2014). Sugarbeet produced
    for sugar is processed following a series of phases different than sugarbeet produced
    for bioenergy. After harvest, beet plants are cleaned and fermentable sugars are
    extracted. Sugarbeet produced for bioenergy is fermented to obtain alcohol and
    alcohol by-products; however, for sugar production the sugar juice is evaporated
    to obtain crystalized sugar (Webster et al., 2016). Sugarbeet is commonly grown
    under irrigation in the arid and semi-arid areas of the world and efficient water
    management is critical for achieving an optimum yield and sucrose concentration.
    Good water management will also minimize water loss and environmental contamination
    by chemical fertilizers. Irrigation scheduling is a management tool used to accurately
    apply water so that supply matches the crop water requirement (Trout & DeJonge,
    2018). This is commonly estimated by calculating the crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    as the function of a reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient (kc).
    The ET0 is usually calculated using the Penman–Monteith equation, which combines
    weather parameters to predict the energy transfer at the crop surface (Allen,
    Pereira, Raes, & Smith, 1998). The ETc can also be measured using a water balance
    approach by either implementing a lysimeter technique (Doorenbos & Pruitt, 1977;
    Jensen & Allen, 2016; Wright, 1982) or the measurement of water inputs including
    irrigation and rainfall, as well as the soil moisture changes during the growing
    season (Garcia y Garcia & Strock, 2018; Nilahyane, Islam, Mesbah, & Garcia y Garcia,
    2018; Trout & DeJonge, 2018). Improper irrigation management can negatively affect
    root yield and sucrose concentration and impurity values (IV) (Eckhoff, Bergman,
    & Flynn, 2005; Yonts, Palm, & Reichert, 2003). Moreover, excess water may cause
    nitrate leaching and groundwater contamination. In the sprinkler-equipped field,
    excessive irrigation also increases fuel/electricity costs of irrigation. Several
    irrigation studies have been conducted on sugarbeet under drip and low-pressure
    sprinkler systems (Tognetti, Palladino, Minnocci, Delfine, & Alvino, 2003), under
    furrow irrigation (Yonts, 2006), and using different sprinkler methods (Eckhoff
    et al., 2005; Evans, Iversen, Stevens, & Jabro, 2010). Eckhoff et al. (2005) showed
    that sugarbeet quality was lower under sprinkler irrigation than under flood irrigation
    as a result of higher impurity values under sprinkler irrigation than under flood
    irrigation. In recent years, newer sugarbeet varieties have been developed with
    higher yield potential; therefore, irrigation amount and scheduling need to be
    reevaluated. Deficit irrigation may reduce the water and energy use and minimize
    water and N leaching, but how deficit irrigation is going to affect the yield
    and quality of sugarbeet is still unknown. Furthermore, sugarbeet is traditionally
    grown in conventionally tilled fields and the conventional tillage (CT) system
    employs ripping, disking, mulching, leveling, and hilling practices, which not
    only consume large amounts of fossil fuel and labor hours, but also cause soil
    organic matter degradation and soil erosion (Afshar et al., 2019). Some sugarbeet
    growers in Montana and North Dakota have adopted conservation tillage, especially
    no-till (NT) in recent years. The conservation tillage could change the soil water
    regime and sugarbeet growth, thus altering irrigation management, because tillage
    changes soil physical properties such as surface organic residue cover, bulk density,
    and porosity, which, in turn, affects water infiltration, water holding capacity,
    and soil surface evaporation (Cerdan et al., 2010; Hungria, Franchini, Brandão-Junior,
    Kaschuk, & Souza, 2009). Irrigation studies reported in the literature showed
    limited information regarding the tillage affecting water management on sugarbeet.
    Therefore, irrigation studies, especially deficit irrigation, on no-till sugarbeet
    production is urgently needed. Core Ideas Deficit irrigation of 66ETc showed potential
    for sugarbeet production Withholding irrigation 30 days before harvest did not
    affect extractable sugar yield Combining NT with deficit irrigation may bring
    economic and environmental benefits Both conventional and no-till sugarbeet growers
    have difficulty determining the time to stop irrigation prior to harvest, because
    sugarbeet root yield and sucrose concentration at harvest determine the sugar
    yield and profit to the growers. The sugar factory pays growers based on root
    yield (Mg ha−1) and sucrose concentration (%), and sugarbeet roots with lower
    sucrose concentration will result in a price penalty. The sucrose concentration
    at harvest is affected by irrigation management; water stress prior to harvest
    often increases the sucrose concentration of sugarbeet (Carter, Traveller, & Rosenau,
    1980). Therefore, some farmers stop irrigating the crop a few weeks before harvest
    to boost the sucrose concentration of sugarbeet. However, stopping irrigation
    too early might result in a yield loss. There is no clear information in the literature
    showing the optimal timing to stop water application before harvest to ensure
    an elevated sucrose concentration without compromising the root yield. The objectives
    of this study were to determine the effect of deficit irrigation and irrigation
    cutoff time on root yield, sucrose concentration, impurity values (IV), and extractable
    sugar yield of sugarbeet grown under CT and NT practices. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
    2.1 Study site Two field experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2018 at the Montana
    State University Eastern Agricultural Research Center (EARC) irrigated farm located
    near Sidney, MT (47°43′32″ N, 104°9′5″ W), under a sprinkler irrigation system.
    Average monthly temperature (>70 yr) during the growing season (April–September)
    ranges from 7 to 15 °C and average annual rainfall is 360 mm, with 278 mm occurring
    during the growing season. The soil is characterized as Savage clay loam (fine,
    smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls) with a pH of 8.3 and organic C content of
    8.9 g kg–1. 2.2 Experimental design Study 1 was under CT management, which was
    initiated in 2016 and repeated in 2018. Study 2 was under NT and conducted in
    2018 only. For both studies, two irrigation treatments were considered as main
    plots and the irrigation withholding times were considered as sub-plots. Two irrigation
    treatments were 66 and 100% of crop evapotranspiration (66ETc and 100ETc, respectively).
    Within each irrigation treatment, two irrigation withholding times (15 and 30
    d before harvest) were investigated. All treatments were replicated four times
    in a randomized complete block design. The preceding crop for all studies was
    spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Sugarbeet seed (cv. American Crystal S360RR)
    was planted on 6 May 2016 and 27 Apr. 2018 with 0.14 m between plants and 0.60
    m between rows. For the CT system, the field was tilled in the fall by conventional
    practices, which consisted of one pass of deep ripping, two passes of deep disking,
    and two passes each of mulch packing and leveling. For the NT system, the sugarbeet
    seeds were sown directly into wheat stubble without any seedbed preparation using
    a vacuum NT planter equipped with trash removers and row cleaners. The individual
    plot size was 15 m long and 11 m wide. For the CT system, fertilizers (168 kg
    N ha−1, 11 kg P ha−1, and 33 kg K ha−1) were broadcasted and incorporated into
    the soil by tillage (following the common practices the farmers are using). For
    the NT system, the same amount of fertilizers was broadcasted as were used in
    the CT system. All fertilizers were applied 2 wk after emergence. Weed management
    was performed using glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine) following the recommendation
    developed by Montana State University. Cercospora leaf spot disease (Cercospora
    beticola Sacc.) was managed using one application of Minerva-Duo fungicide (Triphenyltin
    hydroxide + Tetraconazole), with an application rate of 1.17 L a.i. ha−1, in August.
    2.3 Irrigation water management Irrigation was performed using an overhead linear-move
    sprinkler system. Irrigation treatments were implemented after seedlings were
    established. From planting to seedling establishment, all plots received equal
    amounts of water to promote better crop establishment. Irrigation scheduling was
    based on ETc calculated as a product of ET0 and a single kc (Allen et al., 1998).
    Daily ET0 was calculated using the modified FAO Penman–Monteith equation (Walter
    et al., 2001). The weather data were obtained from an automated weather station
    located at the experimental site. Irrigation water was applied when soil-available
    water was below 50% of the management allowable depletion. The dynamics of soil
    water content were monitored in 2018 under no-till management during the growing
    season using Watermark sensors (Irrometer Company, Inc.). The sensors were installed
    on the main plots at three different depths (15, 38, and 76 cm). A data logger
    was installed outside the experimental plots to log data via radio transmission.
    The temporal variations in soil water content were reflected by changes in electrical
    resistance between two electrodes implanted within the granular matrix of the
    sensor. The sensor readings were recorded in centibars in every 30 min and were
    converted to soil volumetric water content using the method described by Gardner
    (1958) and the calibration equation developed by Jabro, Evans, Kim, and Iversen
    (2009) for the experimental site at the EARC. 2.4 Root yield and sugar quality
    Before harvesting for final yield, sugarbeet plants were mechanically defoliated
    and the plants in each plot were counted. Sugarbeet plants were harvested on 19
    Sept. 2016 and 17 Sept. 2018 using a custom-made single row beet harvester to
    dig the roots in a 10 m row-length of the inner row in each plot. The roots were
    weighed by a scale mounted to the beet harvester. The pre-washed root weight was
    recorded and then a sub-sample of at least 12 roots from each plot was sent to
    the nearby sugarbeet factory (Sidney Sugars Inc.) and a laboratory for yield,
    sugar content, and sugar quality analysis (Campbell & Fugate, 2015). Sugar yield
    was calculated as a product of root yield and sucrose concentration. Sodium, K,
    and amino-N contents in sugarbeet were analyzed to measure impurities in the juice.
    The impurity value, sugar loss to molasses (SLM), and extractable sugar yield
    were calculated using Equations 1-3 (Carruthers, Oldfield, & Teague, 1962 and
    as modified by the American Crystal Sugar Co.). (1) (2) (3) Growing degree days
    (GDD) were calculated using Equation 4. (4) where Tmax and Tmin are the daily
    maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively. The base temperature was considered
    as 1.1 °C, whereas the upper threshold temperature was considered as 30 °C for
    sugarbeet. For GDD calculation, Tmax was set equal to 30 °C if the actual maximum
    temperature was more than 30 °C and Tmin was set equal to 1.1 °C if the actual
    minimum temperature was <1.1 °C (Holen & Dexter, 1997). 2.5 Statistical analysis
    Statistical analyses were performed for Study 1 and Study 2 separately using SAS
    software (version 9.4, SAS Institute, 2012) with the PROC GLIMMIX procedure. In
    Study 1, year, irrigation treatment, irrigation withholding time, and their interactions
    were considered fixed effects under conventional tillage management; in Study
    2, irrigation treatment, irrigation withholding time, and their interactions were
    considered as fixed effects under no-till management. Treatment replications were
    considered as random effects. Differences among treatment means for all variables
    were assessed using the LINES option in the LSMEANS statement, which were denoted
    by letters in the figures. Since higher variability is often observed in sugarbeet
    field studies, the effects were considered significant at the P ≤ .10 probability
    level in this study. Soil moisture data at multi-depths were averaged across all
    four replications at the time they were recorded by the logger and plotted against
    their respective recording time. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Growing conditions In 2016, a total
    of 71 mm rainfall was recorded at the beginning of the season compared with 119
    mm recorded during the same period during the 2018 season (Figure 1). The cumulative
    rainfall was 186 and 235 mm during the 2016 and 2018 growing seasons, respectively
    (Figure 1a,b). This partially affected the frequency and amounts of irrigation
    water applied (Figure 1c,d). Sprinkler irrigation was provided eight times with
    a total of 362 mm for full irrigation treatment (100ETc) during the 2016 growing
    season, compared with seven times with a total of 231 mm of water applied under
    100ETc during the 2018 growing season. Total cumulative water use was greater
    in 2016 compared with total cumulative water use in 2018. FIGURE 1 Open in figure
    viewer Figures on the left represent cumulative irrigation water used (line graphs)
    in 2016 (a) and 2018 (b) for both conventional and no-tillage managements. Vertical
    bars are daily recorded rainfall. Figures on the right represent total water (irrigation
    + rainfall) used The growing conditions were favorable during both years of the
    study with no major pest problems or wind damage to the plants. Sugarbeet needed
    140 cumulative GDD to emerge in 2016 and 148 cumulative GDD in 2018 (Table 1).
    The plants undergo many phases with rapid growth occurring during the high-temperature
    period of late June and July. This allowed the plants to cover >90% of the ground
    and started translocation of photosynthesis assimilates to roots. Root development
    started at least 77 d after planting, which is equivalent to about 175 cumulative
    GDD after planting. Plants reached maximum root development in early September.
    Sugarbeet harvest was carried out usually in mid-September each year with average
    cumulative 2,382 GDD across years. TABLE 1. Sugarbeet growth stages in 2016 and

    Root yield and sugar quality Sugarbeet plant density was not affected by year
    and was similar under all irrigation treatments (Table 2). In 2016 plant density
    was 83,928 plants ha−1 whereas the plant density was 78,958 plants ha−1 in 2018.
    The average plant density was 79,402 plants ha−1 under 66ETc and 83,483 plants
    ha−1 under 100ETc, indicating a normal seed germination and seedling emergence
    in both years. TABLE 2. Summary statistics (P > F) for dependent variables assuming

    affected by irrigation treatments (Table 2). A year × irrigation interaction was
    significant, which indicates the different irrigation effects in 2016 and 2018;
    the irrigation treatment had no effect on root yield in 2016 but greater root
    yield was achieved when the 100ETc treatment was applied in 2018 (Figure 2a).
    Increased yield under 100ETc in 2018 contributed to overall increase of 5.6 Mg
    ha−1 in root yield. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer Visual representation of the
    interaction between year and irrigation treatments on sugarbeet root yield (a),
    sugar concentration (b), sugar yield (c), impurity value (d), sucrose loss to
    molasses (e), and extractable sugar yield (f) under conventional tillage management
    in 2016 and 2018. Different letters between two bars within that year represent
    significant difference between their means at P ≤ .10. Error bars represent standard
    error of the mean A similar trend was observed in terms of irrigation withholding
    time effect on root yield (i.e., the water withholding × year interactions were
    significant; Table 2). Overall, greater root yield was obtained when irrigation
    was withheld 15 d before harvest compared with 30 d before harvest. This increase
    in overall root yield (6.7 Mg ha−1) was due to the increase root yield in 2018
    when irrigation was withheld 15 d before harvest. In 2016, root yield was not
    affected by irrigation withholding time (Figure 3a). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer
    Visual representation of the interaction between year and irrigation withholding
    time on sugarbeet root yield (a), impurity value (b), and sucrose loss to molasses
    (c) under conventional tillage management in 2016 and 2018. Different letters
    between two bars within that year represent significant difference between their
    means at P ≤ .10. Error bars represent standard error of the mean Sugar concentration
    in the root was slightly higher (9.4 g kg−1) in 2016 compared with sugar concentration
    in 2018 (Table 2; Figure 2b). When comparing irrigation treatments, sugar concentration
    was greater when there was no water deficit (100ETc) in 2018, but there was no
    difference between the irrigation treatments in 2016 (Figure 2b). Overall, sugar
    yield increased when there was no water deficit in 2018, but the sugar yield did
    not differ between the irrigation treatment in 2016 (Figure 2c). The increase
    in root yield and sugar content under 100ETc in 2018 contributed to the overall
    increase in sugar yield. A significant interaction between year and irrigation
    indicated that deficit irrigation did not result in water stress in 2016, but
    sugarbeet growth was negatively impacted by deficit irrigation in 2018. Impurity
    value was calculated using the concentration of K, Na, and amino-N in the juice
    (Equation 1). The value was then used to calculate the amount of SLM by multiplying
    by 1.5 (Equation 2). Therefore, similar outcomes were expected on these two quality
    measurements (Table 2). Higher impurities and greater SLM were observed in 2018
    compared with 2016. Although the interactions of year × irrigation and year ×
    withholding time on IV and SLM were significant, the effects of irrigation (Figure
    2d,e) and withholding time (Figure 3b,c) on impurities were not significant in
    2016 or 2018. Because sugar impurities were not affected by irrigation treatments,
    and root yield and sugar concentration were greater under 100ETc, the extractable
    sugar yield was therefore greater with no water deficit in 2018 (Figure 2f). However,
    the extractable sugar yield was not affected by irrigation (Figure 2f) in 2016.
    The water withholding time did not affect the extractable sugar yield, even though
    the 30 d water withholding reduced root yield (Table 2). 3.3 Study 2 (no-till)
    3.3.1 Root yield and sugar quality The irrigation study under no-till condition
    showed similar irrigation effects as with conventional tillage in 2018 (Table
    2 and Table 3). The deficit irrigation affected the sugarbeet root yield, sugar
    yield, and extractable sugar yield, but irrigation did not affect the plant population,
    sucrose concentration, and impurities (Table 3). Deficit irrigation at 66ETc decreased
    root yield, sugar yield, and extractable sugar yield by 12.4, 2.1, and 1.9 kg
    ha−1, respectively, from the 100ETc (Figure 4a,b,c). The water withholding time
    did not affect the sugarbeet plant population, root yield, sucrose concentration,
    impurities, and sugar yield (Table 3). TABLE 3. Summary statistics (P > F) for

    standard error of the mean 3.3.2 Soil moisture The volumetric soil water content
    monitored during the growing season using Watermark sensors installed at three
    soil depths (15, 38, and 76 cm) for each irrigation treatment showed that the
    temporal variation of the soil water was the greatest in the top 38 cm for the
    two irrigation levels (Figure 5a,b). Within the 38-cm depth, at planting, the
    soil was near field capacity, which is necessary for crop emergence and establishment.
    Plants started depleting the soil water profile, especially during the hot days
    of July and August. Irrigation water was provided as needed to replenish the soil
    profile and get it back as much as possible to the soil field capacity (0.35 cm3
    cm−3). The amount of water applied under 100ETc was able to maintain soil moisture
    at field capacity. The amount of water applied for deficit irrigation treatment
    at 66ETc showed soil moisture declined below field capacity at 15- and 38-cm depths
    at the late growing season during July and August, which may have affected the
    sugarbeet root yield (Figure 5a,b). The deep sensors at the 76-cm depth showed
    stable water dynamics after crop establishment except in May (Figure 5c). The
    soil moisture at 76 cm was below field capacity in May for both irrigation levels
    due to no irrigation being applied until 20 d after planting in 2018 (Figure 1b).
    The 66ETc treatment has exhibited greater fluctuation in moisture content than
    the 100ETc treatment in the late growing season. The soil moisture at 15 and 38
    cm declined rapidly starting at early to mid-July due to the greatest plant growth
    and water uptake during this period. The soil moisture at 15 cm recovered some
    due to irrigation and rainfall, but the soil at 38 cm was not replenished from
    the irrigation and rainfall, indicating a water stress to the plants. FIGURE 5
    Open in figure viewer Soil water dynamics measured using Watermark (WM) sensors
    for 66ETc and 100ETc irrigation treatments at 0.15 m (a), 0.38 m (b), and 0.76
    m (c) during the growing season under no-till management. Horizontal dashed lines
    represent the field capacity (0.351 cm3 cm−3) for the savage clay loam soil at
    the experiment station near Sidney, MT 4 DISCUSSION In this study, the irrigation
    amount was calculated based on ETc = ETo × kc. The results showed that the deficit
    irrigation at 66ETc did not affect sugarbeet root yield in 2016, but it decreased
    sugarbeet root yield in 2018. The soil moisture sensors installed at 15- and 38-cm
    depths also showed dramatic decline during July and August when the plant had
    maximal daily growth and water uptake. This result indicates that the crop did
    not receive adequate irrigation water for growth. Irrigation scheduling should
    be based on accurate calculations considering weather conditions, crop growth
    stage, and soil water content. In this study, we did not use soil moisture data
    for scheduling, and the irrigation amount was determined by subtracting rainfall
    from the calculated ETc. Since the growing season in 2018 had more rainfall amount
    than in 2016 (Figure 1a,b), we irrigated less in 2018. Apparently, the 66ETc did
    not provide sufficient water to meet the need for sugarbeet growth and resulted
    in decreased root yield (Figure 2a, Figure 4a). Kim, Evans, and Iversen (2008)
    developed a sensor-based variable irrigation system that provides stable remote
    access to field conditions and real-time control and monitoring of the variable-rate
    irrigation controller. The system offers a potential solution to support site-specific
    irrigation management and allows producers to maximize their productivity while
    saving water. Water withholding time of 15 and 30 d prior to harvest did not affect
    root yield and sucrose concentration under the NT system in 2018. Under CT, withholding
    water 30 d before harvest reduced root yield but not extractable sugar yield in
    2018, and the water withholding did not affect root and sugar yield in 2016. Water
    stress prior to harvest has been reported to increase sucrose concentration of
    sugarbeet (Carter et al., 1980), but the effect was not significant in this study.
    Yonts et al. (2003) evaluated deficit irrigation strategies and reported that
    reducing water supply late in the growing season reduced sugarbeet root yield
    but increased sucrose concentration and therefore sugar yield remained unchanged.
    Additionally, over-estimating the sugarbeet water requirement may produce a shallow
    root system by discouraging deep root growth (Vamerali, Guarise, Ganis, & Mosca,
    2009). Adjusting irrigation scheduling in sugarbeet by reducing water application
    during the late season and stopping irrigation a few weeks before harvest has
    potential advantages. These include lowering the irrigation water demand; reducing
    energy input by decreasing irrigation labor and pumping costs; increasing sucrose
    concentration, which lowers the cost of sugar extraction; and reducing the water
    content of sugarbeet at harvest, resulting in lower weight and volume for transportation.
    However, it is not easy to do because the weather is unpredictable and unpredicted
    rainfall events could occur during September and October in this region (Figure
    1a,b). Considering the negative consequences of CT on soil and environment, including
    soil erosion, organic matter degradation, and fossil fuel consumption, it is beneficial
    to opt for NT practices to enhance the overall profitability and sustainability
    of sugarbeet production. Results from recent studies (Sutradhar, Frank, Garza,
    & Chen, 2020) showed that desired plant population and greater root yield can
    be obtained through appropriate residue management and use of improved planting
    equipment with disc openers and row cleaners. In a 3-yr study, Afshar et al. (2019)
    reported that tillage management had no impact on plant stand, root yield, and
    recoverable sucrose yield. The estimated cost of tillage operation was $111 ha−1
    more under CT management. In addition, the presence of previous crop residues
    under NT prevents soil erosion and conserves soil water within the root zone (Peterson,
    Schlegel, Tanaka, & Jones, 1996), which makes NT a beneficial option for sugarbeet
    growers. Although evaluation of irrigation effects on sugarbeet under conventional
    and no-till management was considered as two separate studies in this article,
    the two trials were conducted in the same field side by side in 2018 with the
    same irrigation treatments. The 66ETc irrigation treatment resulted in reduced
    root yield and sugar yield both in CT and NT (Figure 2a,c; Figure 4a,b). Withholding
    water for 30 d reduced root yield in CT (Figure 3a) but did not affect the root
    yield in NT (Table 3). No root yield reduction with 30 d of withholding water
    might be related to the greater water holding capacity in the no-till soil. 5
    CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate the potential of implementing a
    deficit irrigation strategy in sugarbeet as a beneficial tool to reduce the amount
    and increase the efficiency of the irrigation water applied under CT and NT systems,
    but in the future, in-situ soil moisture sensor data must be incorporated into
    the irrigation scheduling to avoid severe water stress under deficit irrigation.
    Stopping irrigation 30 d before harvest slightly reduced the sugarbeet root yield
    but did not affect extractable sugar yield, suggesting that omitting one irrigation
    late in the growing season may not reduce root yield and quality, and could bring
    some benefits of lower transportation weight and volume. Deficit irrigation in
    conjunction with a NT system could be a beneficial strategy for sustainable sugarbeet
    production. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This project was supported by Western SARE Grant no.

    Precision Agriculture ((PRPRA)) Abstract Precision irrigation aims at improving
    productivity and sustainability by addressing spatial as well as temporal variability
    of soil and crop water status. This chapter presents three case studies from south-eastern
    USA, Israel and Spain which relate to different attributes of precision irrigation:
    (1) type of precision: whether it targets the spatial variability by using variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system or the temporal variability by using automatic triggering
    of the irrigation, (2) type of irrigation system, and (3) type of data the system
    uses for irrigation decisions. Each of the case studies addresses a unique combination
    of attributes and together they draw a more complement picture of precision irrigation.
    All case studies have shown that well-timed data provides decision support for
    VRI management, i.e. soil moisture sensor-data (south-eastern USA and Spain) and
    thermal aerial imagery (Israel). The three case studies showed that precision
    irrigation treatments performed better than uniform irrigation. Yield increased
    by 4.3–12% and water-use efficiency (WUE) was improved by 14–40%. The reliance
    on point-sensor data in the case studies from south-eastern USA and Spain dictated
    the use of pre-determined irrigation management zones (IMZ), yet, enabled adaptive
    in season irrigation management. In season remotely sensed images can be further
    used for adaptive IMZ, i.e. to modify their boundaries, yet it currently suits
    VRI in drip irrigation. From these case studies, it can be seen that full VRI
    implementation, which adapts for spatial and temporal changes, faces “site-specific”
    challenges, i.e. every irrigation system is unique, and thus requires tailored
    solutions. Keywords Variable-rate-irrigation Automatic-irrigation Soil-sensors

    for more than 70% of total water withdrawals on a global basis (The World Bank;
    https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water-in-agriculture). The inevitable competition
    between agriculture and other users of limited water resources will require that
    farmers become more efficient at producing crops with a finite water supply. In
    addition, because irrigated agriculture provides about 40% of the global food
    supply on 20% of the total cultivated land, the pressure to produce even more
    food on irrigated land will also intensify as global population increases. Productivity
    per unit of water consumed would increase by implementation of crop location strategies
    (optimal soil and climate attributes), conversion to crops with higher economic
    value, and adoption of alternate drought-tolerant crops as well as by the implementation
    of precision irrigation (Evans and Sadler 2008). These high-technology tools will
    not only allow adjustments of the water schedule depending on the needs of the
    crops at each moment and the characteristics of the soil, but will also increase
    the farmer’s expertise and be more attractive to new generations of young farmers.
    The term precision agriculture (PA) in general and precision irrigation in particular
    is perceived differently by stakeholders from research, extension, industry and
    by the farmers themselves. From the perspective of the research community, PA
    aims at improving productivity and sustainability by addressing spatial and temporal
    variation within fields. Automated irrigation scheduling is recognized as precision
    irrigation, and even though it does not address spatial variation, it addresses
    temporal variation. This chapter presents three case studies from south-eastern
    USA, Israel and Spain which relate to different attributes of precision irrigation:
    (1) type of precision: whether it targets the spatial variation using a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system or temporal variation by automatic triggering of the irrigation,
    (2) type of irrigation system and (3) type of data the system uses for irrigation
    decisions. Each of the case studies addresses unique combinations of attributes
    and together they draw a more complete picture of precision irrigation. Yet they
    are not totally separated from each other because they share some attributes which
    connect them (Fig. 11.1). The first case study from south-eastern USA describes
    VRI with centre pivots based on soil sensors, the second case study from Israel
    deals with variable-rate drip irrigation (VRDI) based mainly on thermal remote
    sensing, and the third case study from Spain presents an automatic drip irrigation
    system triggered by soil sensors. Figure 11.1 summarizes the shared and complementary
    attributes. Fig. 11.1 Shared and complementary attributes of the case studies.

    Irrigation with Centre Pivot in South-Eastern USA 11.2.1 Introduction Precision
    irrigation has its roots in VRI technology developed for centre pivot irrigation
    systems by the University of Georgia (UGA) Precision Agriculture team in 2001
    (Perry et al. 2002; Perry and Podcknee 2003). The UGA Precision Agriculture team
    recognized that variable-rate application of irrigation water was a key enabling
    technology for the adoption of PA in south-eastern USA. This was because fields
    in this region have very variable soil type and texture, moisture holding capacity
    and slope. If site-specific water needs are disregarded while attempting to vary
    other inputs such as fertilizers, then this would not result in the desired gains
    in efficiency theoretically possible with PA. An additional reason was that in
    the south-eastern USA, irrigation of agronomic crops such as cotton (Gossypium
    spp.), maize (Zea mays), peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and soya bean (Glycine max),
    is now done almost exclusively with centre pivot irrigation systems. Conventional
    centre pivots apply the same rate of water along the entire length of the pivot
    and cannot account for within-field variability or non-farmed areas. The UGA VRI
    technology was commercialized by FarmScan, an Australian electronics company.
    The large pivot manufacturers began offering their own VRI systems once the original
    patent expired in 2012. The VRI allows centre pivots to vary water application
    rates along the length of the pivot using electronic controls to cycle sprinklers
    and control pivot speed. Sprinklers are controlled individually or together typically
    in groups of 2–10 depending on the level of resolution desired by the farmer.
    Each group or bank of sprinklers represents a grid with a 1–10-degree arc in which
    the application rate of irrigation water can be set as a percentage of the normal
    application rate; for example from 0 to 200% of normal (Fig. 11.2c). The number
    of degrees in the arc is determined by the level of resolution desired. A 50%
    application rate is half the normal rate and is achieved by cycling the sprinklers
    on and off every 30 s. A 150% application rate is achieved by leaving the sprinklers
    on continuously while decreasing the travel speed of the pivot. If other grids
    along the length of the pivot require smaller rates of application, the VRI controller
    adjusts the sprinkler cycling pattern within those grids accordingly. Fig. 11.2

    rates. Cells grouped into the same colour represent the IMZs delineated in (b).
    The yellow circles represent potential locations of soil moisture sensor nodes
    Full size image The VRI can be installed retroactively on most existing pivots.
    Installation costs vary widely by brand and are also a function of the length
    of the pivot and the level of resolution desired by the farmer to address the
    variability of the field. Application rates are determined from an application
    or prescription map. A short video describing VRI is available at (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgexX_IToI0).
    11.2.2 Prescription Maps The prescription map for a field is developed jointly
    by the farmer and VRI dealer on desktop software (Fig. 11.2a, b, c) and then downloaded
    to the VRI controller on the pivot. The field is divided into irrigation management
    zones (IMZs) and application rates assigned to each of the IMZs using whatever
    information is available. In almost all VRI applications, the prescription maps
    are static. In other words, they are typically developed once and used thereafter.
    Static prescription maps do not respond to environmental variables such as weather
    patterns and other factors that affect soil moisture conditions and rates of crop
    growth. Although VRI offers a great leap forward in improving water-use efficiency
    (WUE), the system can be greatly enhanced with real-time information on crop water
    needs to control the application rates. One approach for creating dynamic prescription
    maps is to use soil moisture sensors to estimate the amount of irrigation water
    needed to return each IMZ to an ideal soil moisture condition (Fig. 11.2c). This
    case study describes the on-farm application of a dynamic VRI control system developed
    by the UGA Precision Agriculture Team. The control system couples real-time soil
    moisture sensing networks, an irrigation scheduling decision support system (DSS),
    and VRI . 11.2.3 A Dynamic VRI System The operational paradigm of the UGA dynamic
    VRI control system is that the field is divided into IMZs and a soil moisture
    sensing network with a high density of sensor nodes is installed to monitor soil
    conditions within the IMZs. Between one and three nodes are installed in each
    IMZ depending on the zone’s size. Soil moisture data are uploaded hourly to a
    web-based user interface. At the web-based user interface, the soil moisture data
    are used by the DSS running in the background to develop irrigation scheduling
    recommendations for each IMZ . The recommendations are then approved by the user
    (farmer) and downloaded wirelessly to the VRI controller on the pivot as a precision
    irrigation prescription. When the pivot is engaged by the farmer, the pivot applies
    the recommended rates. Figure 11.3 shows the dashboard of the UGA dynamic VRI
    system. Fig. 11.3 Dashboard of the UGA dynamic VRI system as seen by the user.
    The system requires the user to approve and then download the daily prescription
    map to the VRI controller located on the pivot. Real-Time Soil Moisture Sensing
    Network Full size image 11.2.3.1 Real-Time Soil Moisture Sensing Network A key
    requirement of a soil moisture sensor based dynamic VRI system is a dense network
    of sensor nodes that is inexpensive, reliable, wireless, energy efficient, easy
    to install and remove, and that does not interfere with farming operations. These
    types of networks are only now becoming commercially available. The UGA smart
    sensor array (UGA SSA) soil moisture sensor network was specifically developed
    for the dynamic VRI system described here. The UGA SSA consists of smart sensor
    nodes and a base station. The term sensor node refers to the combination of electronics
    and sensor probes installed within a field at a single location. The electronics
    include a circuit board for data acquisition and processing, and a radio frequency
    (RF) transmitter. The UGA SSA uses Watermark® soil moisture sensors that measure
    soil moisture in terms of soil water tension (SWT)—the absolute value of soil
    matric potential in units of kilopascals (kPa). Each soil moisture probe integrates
    up to three Watermark® sensors. In addition, each node supports two thermocouples
    for measuring soil and or canopy temperature. For deep-rooted field crops like
    cotton or maize, the sensors on the probe are arranged so that when installed
    they are at 20, 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface although any combination of
    depths is possible. For shallow-rooted crops like peanut, 10, 20 and 40-cm depths
    are used. Users access the data through a dedicated web-based user interface.
    11.2.3.2 Web-Based User Interface and Decision Support System The purpose of the
    web-based interface is to allow users to visualize their soil moisture data and
    to make irrigation recommendations for each IMZ . A PHP (Personal Home Page) and
    JavaScript programming languages were used to create different visualizations
    of the soil moisture data (Fig. 11.4). The different visualizations provide users
    with the opportunity to view instantaneous SWT , time series of SWT and IMZ delineation
    of their fields. The user interface was smartphone compliant. Fig. 11.4 Two different
    visualizations of UGA SSA data. On the left is current SWT displayed through colour
    coded gauges. Touching the gauges with the cursor or finger enlarges them. On
    the right are SWT curves for three depths for the entire growing season. Note
    the difference in response between nodes in the same field Full size image The
    web-based user interface also included a DSS which offers irrigation recommendations
    for each IMZ (Liakos et al. 2015). The DSS uses a modified Van Genuchten model
    to convert SWT data to volumetric water content (Liang et al. 2016). The strength
    of the method is that it uses soil properties readily available from the United
    States Department of Agriculture – Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS)
    Web Soil Survey (https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/) to translate measured
    SWT into irrigation recommendations that are specific to the soil moisture status
    of each IMZ . The DSS uses mean SWT data collected at 07:00 h from all nodes within
    an IMZ to calculate the volume of irrigation water needed to bring the soil profile
    back to the desired soil moisture condition, which could be field capacity or
    a percentage of field capacity (for example 75% of field capacity) (Fig. 11.5).
    Each node’s SWT value is a weighted average of the SWT values of the three Watermark®
    sensors of the node as shown in Eq. (11.1) where α, β and γ are weighting factors
    based on the phenological stage of the crop. Early in the growing season when
    the root system is not fully developed, more weight is given to the shallow sensors.
    As the root system develops, the weighting factors change accordingly. For peanut,
    at maturity, α, β and γ were 0.5, 0.3 and 0.2 respectively. Weighting factors
    may differ by crop. Fig. 11.5 The experimental design of the field used in the
    2017 case study showing four pairs of parallel VRI and conventional strips (brown).
    The VRI strips maintain the delineated IMZ . The yellow circles indicate the location
    of 30 UGA SSA sensor nodes. The table to the right indicates the depth of water
    that is recommended for each IMZ by the DSS . The recommendations are provided
    for shallow and deep-rooted crops Full size image $$ \mathrm{Weigh}t\mathrm{ed}\
    SWT=\alpha \times {\mathrm{SWT}}_{10\mathrm{cm}}+\beta \times {\mathrm{SWT}}_{20\mathrm{cm}}+\gamma
    \times {\mathrm{SWT}}_{40\ \mathrm{cm}} $$ (11.1) Irrigation recommendations may
    use the same SWT threshold across all of the crop’s phenological stages or thresholds
    could be adjusted by phenological stage. For example, UGA cotton physiologists
    recommend a 70-kPa threshold before flowering and a 40-kPa threshold after flowering
    (Meeks et al. 2017). 11.2.3.3 On-Farm Testing of the UGA Dynamic VRI Control System
    The UGA dynamic VRI control system was field-tested on commercial farms with funding
    from the United States National Peanut Board’s Southern Peanut Research Initiative
    (SPRI). Because of the funding source, the work was conducted with peanut (Arachis
    hypogaea L.). A farmer who already operated several VRI-enabled centre pivots
    was recruited to participate in the project. Before this project, the farmer had
    used his VRI systems only to turn sprinklers off over non-farmed areas in the
    field. He had not varied application rates over farmed areas. The evaluation compared
    the performance of the dynamic VRI control system to the farmer’s standard method
    for scheduling irrigation on large fields. The case study below describes the
    on-farm evaluation conducted in 2017. The 94-ha field was divided into IMZs using
    soil electrical conductivity, digital elevation models (DEMs), hydrography and
    the Management Zone Analyst geostatistical software (MZA) (Fridgen et al. 2004).
    Eight alternating 120–row wide (109 m) conventional irrigation and precision irrigation
    strips were then superimposed over the IMZs. The precision irrigation strips retained
    the IMZ boundaries while the conventional strips did not (Fig. 11.5). After planting,
    UGA SSA sensor nodes were installed in each of the IMZs in the precision irrigation
    strips. Sensor nodes were located close to the centre of each IMZ to avoid boundary
    effects created by changing the rates of water application as the VRI system transitioned
    from one IMZ to another. Three sensor nodes were also installed in each of the
    conventional strips. A total of 30 nodes, 22 in IMZs and 8 in the conventional
    strips, were installed. Each probe contained Watermark® sensors at 10, 20 and
    40-cm depths below the soil surface. The UGA SSA sensor probes installed in the
    conventional irrigation strips were used only to monitor soil moisture conditions.
    Each conventional strip was irrigated uniformly by the farmer using Irrigator
    Pro (Davidson Jr. et al. 2000) to make irrigation decisions. Irrigator Pro is
    a public domain peanut crop growth model and irrigation scheduling tool developed
    by USDA that uses soil temperature, ambient temperature and precipitation to provide
    yes/no irrigation decisions for peanuts. The user decides how much water to apply.
    The farmer installed his own soil thermometers and a rain gauge in the field and
    manually collected data two to three times a week. He then entered the data into
    the Irrigator Pro model running on his personal computer to make irrigation decisions.
    Each uniform strip was irrigated uniformly. All irrigation decisions and the amount
    of irrigation water applied for the precision irrigation strip IMZs were made
    using the DSS . At each irrigation event, the DSS used mean weighted SWT from
    each IMZ to calculate the irrigation water needed to return the soil profile of
    the zone to 75% of field capacity. The irrigation recommendations for each IMZ
    were then transferred manually to the prescription map that was downloaded wirelessly
    to the pivot VRI controller. In this field, approximately 72 h were required for
    the pivot to irrigate the field. Because of this, a new prescription map was downloaded
    every morning during an irrigation event to address soil moisture changes that
    occurred over the past 24 h. 11.2.3.4 Yield and Water-Use Efficiency Yield was
    aggregated by strip. Water-use efficiency (WUE) was calculated by dividing yield
    by the irrigation applied to each strip. The 2017 peanut growing season was relatively
    dry with 272 mm of precipitation, which is about half of the normal precipitation
    received in this area. Since each IMZ within the VRI strips received different
    amounts of irrigation, the irrigation assigned to each VRI strip was weighted
    by the area of each IMZ . Table 11.1 presents a summary of the results. Every
    VRI strip had greater WUE than the conventional uniformly irrigated strips. Three
    of the VRI strips had larger yields than the uniform strips. Overall, the VRI
    strips resulted in a 39.7% increase in WUE and 4.3% more yield . Table 11.1 Comparison
    of results between the VRI and Uniform treatments for the entire field Full size
    table 11.2.4 Conclusions Pivot manufacturers have observed the outcomes of this
    study and dynamic VRI experiments conducted by other research groups and have
    begun to develop their own solutions to this issue. Lindsay Corporation which
    manufactures the Zimmatic brand centre pivot irrigation systems is offering its
    version of dynamic VRI under the trade name of FieldNET® Advisor (https://www.lindsay.com/usca/en/irrigation/brands/fieldnet/resources/).
    This system uses FAO-56 type evapotranspiration models to estimate daily crop
    water use in each IMZ . This estimate and soil properties from the NRCS Web Soil
    Survey are used to calculate a daily soil water balance. When the soil water balance
    reaches a predetermined threshold, the IMZ is irrigated. Data from the model automatically
    populate a prescription map that is downloaded wirelessly to the pivot’s panel.
    This is likely to be a more adoptable dynamic VRI solution until sensor costs
    are greatly reduced and installation and removal requires less effort than current
    sensor solutions. However, models might not account accurately for soil differences
    within IMZs that may be accounted for with a high-density sensor network. 11.3
    Case Study 11.2. Variable-Rate irrigation with Drip irrigation in Israel 11.3.1
    Introduction Approximately half of the agricultural land in Israel is irrigated
    and the majority of that (around 60%) is irrigated with drip systems. The widespread
    implementation of drip irrigation has made a major contribution to the increase
    in irrigation water-use efficiency (WUE) in Israel, in terms of production per
    irrigation unit. Irrigation WUE in Israel has increased steadily since the 1960s
    and doubled in the period 2000–2010. Yet, it hardly changed after 2011. Evans
    and Sadler (2008) argue that emerging computerized GNSS-based precision irrigation
    technologies for self-propelled sprinklers and micro-irrigation systems will enable
    growers to apply water and agrochemicals more precisely and site-specifically
    to match soil and plant status and needs using wireless sensor networks. While
    VRI technology for centre pivot irrigation systems goes back to the 2000s and
    is already implemented by farmers (case study 1 from south-eastern USA), it is
    still under development for micro irrigation systems like sprinklers and drip
    systems. There are two primary challenges for variable-rate drip irrigation (VRDI)
    development: a lack of mobility and a lack of variable-rate emitters. A few recent
    studies have applied VRDI in vineyards (e.g. McClymont et al. 2012; Nadav and
    Schweitzer 2017). To overcome the lack of mobility, the vineyards were subdivided
    into management zones each with valves and piping necessary for autonomous irrigation.
    The abovementioned studies differed in zonation methodology. McClymont et al.
    (2012) assumed relative stability of the IMZ condition over time, i.e. a zone
    with less vigour in 1 year was assumed likely to exhibit less vigour in other
    years. Accordingly, the vineyard was designed to irrigate a few pre-determined
    management zones that differed in size and shape based on multi-year NDVI maps
    and a canopy temperature map. In this way, the number of valves and hence the
    cost of the system is reduced. In contrast to this, several studies have shown
    that IMZs are dynamic and can change from year to year and vary even during a
    single season (O’Shaughnessy et al. 2015; Scudiero et al. 2018). Sanchez et al.
    (2017) and Bahat et al. (2019) used a ‘blind’ zonation based on regular polygons
    of equal sizes allowing greater flexibility and adaptation to in-season spatial
    changes of IMZ . Despite differences in zonation approach, and how irrigation
    decisions were made for each zone, all have shown a decrease in spatial variation
    in yield or in water status. Currently, there are no off-the-shelf VRDI systems,
    but prototypes have already been installed and tested in a few orchards. This
    section described how precision irrigation studies in Israel have evolved over
    the last 20 years following three central themes, i.e. (1) thermal imaging collection
    and analysis to map the variation in water status, (2) creation of irrigation
    prescription maps and (3) implementing variable-rate drip irrigation to address
    variability in a commercial field. 11.3.2 Thermal Imaging for Mapping Variation
    in Water Status Drip irrigation is very efficient compared to other irrigation
    systems, therefore, most of the precision drip irrigation studies in Israel have
    focused on crops that it would benefit most: cotton and vineyards. Both cotton
    and wine grape (Vitis vinifera) vineyards are grown under controlled regimes of
    water stress, therefore, the best irrigation practices involve monitoring of plant
    water status. This section focuses on cotton. In Israel, irrigation scheduling
    is predetermined and water stress corrections are made by modifying irrigation
    amounts. Quantities of irrigation water are estimated according to the equation:
    $$ \mathrm{Irrigation}\ \mathrm{quantity}=\alpha \times {K}_c\times {\mathrm{ET}}_0
    $$ (11.2) where ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration, (Kc) is the crop coefficient
    (FAO56; Allen et al. 1998) and α is the water status (or water stress) coefficient.
    Real-time daily values of ET0 for many locations in Israel are available from
    the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development’s (MARD) Agro-meteorology website
    (meteo.co.il). The Kc tables are also available on the web, For example, this
    is the link for cotton: https://www.moag.gov.il/shaham/professionalinformation/documents/daily_exhalation_user_guide_2014.pdf.
    In addition, an app was developed for most crops by MARD’s Extension Service (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=il.gov.moag.shaham.irrigationapp).
    The Kc of cotton while in its vegetative growth stage is further adjusted according
    to the rate of plant growth and in the boll-filling period to a measure of plant
    water status, leaf water potential (LWP). For these, growers measure, among other
    properties, height and LWP of a few plants in the field once or twice a week.
    Based on target curves of these properties that were developed by the cotton board
    they can estimate crop water status, ∝, and further correct irrigation quantities.
    Direct plant measures are reasonably reliable and reflect individual plant water
    status, but they do not represent the spatial variability of water status in the
    plot and are laborious and therefore expensive. Thermal infrared (TIR) images
    have been used in most of the precision irrigation studies as alternatives for
    estimating and mapping water status in the productive periods. Initial studies
    focused on correlating the crop water stress index (CWSI) (Idso et al. 1981) extracted
    from thermal images and leaf or stem water potential (Cohen et al. 2005; Möller
    et al. 2007). The CWSI is defined as follows: $$ \mathrm{CWSI}=\frac{T_{\mathrm{canopy}}-{T}_{\mathrm{wet}}}{T_{\mathrm{dry}}-{T}_{\mathrm{wet}}}
    $$ (11.3) where Tcanopy is leaf or canopy temperature, and Twet and Tdry are approximations
    of minimum and maximum canopy temperatures, respectively. Correlations between
    CWSI calculated using ground-based thermal images and LWP /SWP in both cotton
    and vines were strong (r = 0.85–0.92). Further studies examined whether robust
    relationships exist between the two measures throughout a cotton growing season,
    for different varieties, across years and in different geographical areas (different
    climates and soils) (Cohen et al. 2015). To test this, a dataset from three cotton
    growing seasons and from different geographical areas was created. A linear CWSI–LWP
    relationship was found to be appropriate, and had with a high coefficient of determination
    (r = 0.84). To upscale the use of thermal imaging to commercial application, aerial
    thermal images over commercial cotton fields were used to map the variation in
    LWP and to produce prescription maps according to water status levels (Cohen et
    al. 2017b). Transformation of raw aerial thermal images into CWSI to be used further
    to map LWP requires a simple, rapid and yet accurate procedure to extract Twet.
    An extensive comparison between various wet baselines that were used to calculate
    CWSI in cotton have shown the superiority of bio-indicator wet baselines including
    the average temperature of the coolest 5–10% of the canopy pixels in the overall
    field (Alchanatis et al. 2010; Rud et al. 2014; Gonzalez-Dugo et al. 2013). Furthermore,
    the statistical bio-indicator for wet-baseline (Twet) has minimal requirements
    (measurements of air temperature) compared to other existing alternatives, thus
    paving the way towards commercialization. Based on bio-indicators, prescription-like
    maps which were based on the LWP recommended curve for several commercial fields
    were produced on three dates during the season (Fig. 11.6 presents maps for one
    of the fields). The variation in water status was not constant (Cohen et al. 2017b).
    The maps show the importance of in-season mapping of the variation for rational
    irrigation management. This means that to improve VRI , in-season IMZ ’s should
    be used. Fig. 11.6 Multi-temporal LWP variability maps of a 15 ha commercial cotton
    fields in Yavne, Israel. The LWP maps are based on aerial thermal images acquired
    on 10/7/11 (a), 27/7/11 (b), 18/8/11 (c) Full size image 11.3.3 Thermal-Based
    Water Status Maps for Irrigation Management 11.3.3.1 Irrigation Management Experiment
    in Cotton Cotton is an important crop in the crop rotation widely practiced in
    Israel. Cotton yield and quality are very dependent on an adequate supply of water
    and in the boll-filling growth stage they are grown under controlled water stress
    to allow balance between vegetative growth and cotton production. While it has
    been proved efficient, adoption of LWP as a complementary tool for irrigation
    management has been limited because of the time and manpower needed to obtain
    manual measurements. In addition, these measurements do not necessarily represent
    the entire field or its variability. The experiment described in this section
    compared thermal-imaging based irrigation management to LWP-based management (Rosenberg
    et al. 2014). Field Plots and Irrigation Treatments: Field measurements were conducted
    in the summer of 2013 at Kibbutz Givat Brener, Israel. Experimental plots were
    planted with cotton, Gossypium hirsutum × Gossypium barbadense hybrid (“Acalpi”)
    at the beginning of April and were drip-irrigated with one drip line every other
    row. Each plot was 18 m × 19 m. Plots were irrigated with four different treatments
    and with six replicates (a total of 24 sub-plots). Irrigation amounts were determined
    based on ET0 and crop coefficients, and stress factor (α) corrections were made
    according to height measurements in the vegetative period and LWP in the boll-filling
    period. The treatments differed by the estimation stress factor α and thus the
    irrigation amounts. In one treatment, denoted Reg-LWP, α was estimated according
    to the commercial practice, i.e. based on a few direct LWP measurements conducted
    twice a week and irrigation decisions were made based on a recommended LWP curve.
    In the three other treatments, denoted Reg-TIR, Def-TIR (deficit irrigation) and
    Oir-TIR (over-irrigation) α was estimated based on LWP calculated by thermal images
    acquired once a week. Different LWP curves were used for the different treatments.
    In Reg-TIR, like the Reg-LWP, irrigation decisions were based on a recommended
    LWP curve. In Def-TIR and Oir-TIR, irrigation decisions were based on water saving
    and over-irrigation LWP curves, respectively. Image Acquisition: Oblique thermal
    images were acquired above the experimental plots using uncooled infrared thermal
    cameras (SC655 and SC2000, FLIR systems, Oregon, USA) that were attached to a
    vertical 20 m mast (mounted to a tractor). The two cameras are sensitive in the
    thermal range of 7.5–13 μm and have measurement sensitivity and accuracy of 0.1
    °C and ± 2 °C, respectively. Image acquisition was carried out on 4 days in the
    boll-filling period: 04/08/13, 11/08/13, 18/08/13 and 25/08/13. The thermal images
    were acquired a few hours before irrigation, around solar noon (11:00–15:00 h
    daylight saving Israel Standard Time, GMT +3). Processing of Thermal Images and
    LWP Calculation: To estimate Tcanopy separation between vegetation and background
    pixels in the thermal images was first done empirically following Meron et al.
    (2010). Second, the mean canopy temperature was extracted for each sub-plot. The
    CWSI was calculated according to Eq. (11.3). The Tdry was used in its empirical
    form, i.e. Tair + 5 °C which gave a reasonable estimate of the maximum leaf temperature
    for cotton (Alchanatis et al. 2010). To estimate Twet temperature, a reference
    strip adjacent to the experimental plot was double irrigated using a drip-line
    every row. The temperature of this strip was extracted each time from the thermal
    images similar to the extraction of the Tcanopy. Last, LWP was determined from
    a linear CWSI–LWP relationship (Eq. 11.4) based on a multi-year database (Cohen
    et al. 2015). $$ \mathrm{LWP}=-1.77\mathrm{CWSI}-1.28-K $$ (11.4) where K is a
    transformation constant between the LWP [MPa] measurement methodology and other
    methodologies (Cohen et al. 2017b). The LWP Measurements: Parallel to image acquisition,
    4–6 leaves from each replicate were sampled and their LWP was measured with a
    pressure chamber (model ARIMAD 1, Mevo Hama Instruments, Israel), as described
    by Meron et al. (1987). 11.3.4 Results The CWSI-based and measured LWP were well
    correlated with r = 0.88 and RMSE of 0.14 MPa. In addition, the slope of the regression
    model was not significantly different from 1. Until day 30 from onset (21/07/2013)
    the entire field received homogeneous irrigation of 316.4 mm. From 31 days after
    onset, treatments were irrigated differently as LWP measurements or calculations
    were used for Kc corrections. From 22/7/2013 until 28/8/2013 Def-TIR and Oir-TIR
    received 70.6 and 156.1 mm, respectively while Reg-LWP and Reg-TIR received very
    similar irrigation amounts (96.5 and 90.0 mm, respectively). Figure 11.7 shows
    the yield and irrigation water-use efficiency (WUE) of the four treatments. The
    WUE here was not calculated for the seasonal irrigation amounts but for the irrigation
    amounts given during the irrigation experiment (during the reproductive stage;
    from 31 days after onset onwards). The yields of the different treatments were
    very similar (one-way ANOVA, F = 0.26, p = 0.85). In terms of irrigation amounts,
    both regular treatments (Reg-LWP and Reg-TIR) were larger than the deficit irrigation
    treatment and smaller than the over-irrigation treatment. Significant differences
    were found in WUE (one-way ANOVA, F = 169.9, p < 0.01; n = 24). With a standard
    error of the difference (SED) of 1.3 and least significance difference (LSD) of
    2.7 it can be said that WUE of Reg-TIR (88.3 kg mm−1 ha−1) was significantly larger
    than that of Reg-LWP (79.1 kg mm−1 ha−1) (Fig. 11.7). The results suggest that
    remotely sensed thermal data can replace direct pressure chamber measurements,
    while maintaining at least the same yield with similar amounts of water application.
    Furthermore, it has the potential to improve WUE . It is assumed that despite
    the imperfect estimation of LWP measurements by the thermal images, the images
    can represent most if not all the plants leading to sound irrigation decisions.

    treatment. The WUE was calculated from the irrigation given at the reproductive
    stage only Full size image 11.3.4.1 Addressing the Natural Variation in Water
    Status in a Commercial Cotton Field The experiment in Givat Brener, described
    above, demonstrated the ability of thermal based LWP maps to aid irrigation decisions
    by correcting Kc. As mentioned above, variable-rate drip irrigation is challenging
    and its efficiency should be justified by either increasing yield and or WUE and
    or reducing variability. For that, an experiment was conducted in a highly variable
    zone in a commercial cotton field in Bnei-Darom farm near to the coastline plain
    of southern Israel, a well-known area for cotton cultivation. This experiment
    aimed at demonstrating the implementation of VRI in a drip irrigation system and
    its efficiency compared to unified commercial irrigation. The northern part of
    the field is characterized by considerable natural variability in soil type and
    water holding capacity. Figure 11.8 shows there is a patch of sandy soil in the
    northern part of the field (white arrow). The experimental area was divided into
    three treatments, one commercial and two VRIs, denoted COM, VRI , TIR (Fig. 11.8a)
    with 8 blocks (Fig. 11.8b) assuming each block to have similar soil texture characteristic.
    Every treatment was divided into eight cells (24 m wide by 30–40 m long), giving
    a total of 24 cells. From each, a soil sample was taken for texture. In addition,
    the height of three plants was measured twice a week in every cell from May to
    July, and LWP of four leaves was measured once a week from July to the end of
    August (boll-filling period). All treatments were irrigated similarly by the farmer
    until the boll-filling period (beginning of July). In general, the farmer followed
    the cotton board recommendations, but he added 10% to the recommended irrigation
    amounts relying on his experience that this area is sandy and requires more water.
    From the boll-filling period, the commercial treatment (COM) was irrigated by
    the farmer as for the Reg-LWP described in the previous section. The VRI and TIR
    were irrigated as for Reg-TIR, i.e. LWP was calculated from CWSI extracted from
    weekly aerial thermal images. The two treatments were differentiated by the size
    of their management cell (Fig. 11.8a). In TIR, the eight cells were grouped into
    two irrigation units (outlined in green in Fig. 11.8a), i.e. the northern and
    southern four cells were irrigated individually based on their averaged calculated
    LWP . In general, the northern cells are sandier (62% on average) than the southern
    cells (41% on average). In VRI , each of the eight cells (outlined in black in
    Fig. 11.8a) were irrigated individually based on their averaged calculated LWP
    . Figure 11.8a presents the map of accumulated irrigation amounts for each irrigation
    unit. Focusing on both VRI treatments (VRI and TIR), it can be seen that the northern
    areas were irrigated more than the southern areas, which are less sandy and experienced
    less water stress (as indicated by their calculated LWP in different dates, data
    not shown). Fig. 11.8 Treatment borders and accumulated seasonal irrigation (a)
    and yield (b) for every cell. The white arrow marks a patch of sandy soil Full
    size image The unified irrigated strip (COM) was irrigated with 476 mm and 386
    mm in the northern and southern irrigation units, respectively. The northern and
    the southern irrigation units of TIR treatment were irrigated with 440 mm (−8%
    vs COM) and 347 mm (−10% vs COM), respectively. Irrigation in the VRI strip ranged
    between 329 mm (−15% vs COM) and 590 mm (+24% vs COM). Table 11.2 presents a summary
    of the yield (before ginning) and WUE results. Yield for the whole experiment
    area ranged between 6714 and 12 388 kg ha−1 and WUE ranged between 15.7 kg ha−1
    mm−1 and 26.6 kg ha−1 mm−1. No significant differences were found between blocks
    in both yield and WUE and no significant differences were found between treatments
    (Two-way ANOVA, no repetition, p > 0.05). Four of the VRI blocks had larger yields
    than uniform irrigation (COM) while three blocks had smaller yields. Additionally,
    in four of the VRI blocks greater WUE was observed compared to the conventional
    uniformly irrigation (COM). Overall, the VRI treatments resulted in 6% more yield
    and 4% increase in WUE . The TIR treatment showed lower performance in yield (−3.2%)
    while better performance in WUE (6.1%). It might be related to the precision scale.
    The TIR treatment represents a lower resolution of VRI having only two irrigation
    units compared with eight irrigation units of the VRI . A similar experiment was
    conducted in the 2019 season in which VRI was practiced throughout the whole irrigation
    period. In the 2019 experiment seven out of eight blocks had more yield and WUE
    than the uniform irrigation treatment (COM). The VRI treatments resulted in 15.5%
    more yield (not significant) with 17.4% larger WUE (significant; data not shown).
    Table 11.2 Comparison of results between the VRI , TIR and Uniform (COM) treatments
    by blocks Full size table 11.3.5 Conclusions Multi-year studies on thermal-remote
    sensing for water status mapping and for irrigation management have been summarized
    briefly. The results suggest that remotely sensed thermal data can replace manual
    measurements of water status, with the same or higher yields and similar or less
    amounts of water application. Thus, thermal imaging has the potential to improve
    WUE . It is assumed that despite the imperfection in the estimation of LWP by
    thermal imaging, the latter has the advantage of measuring many more of the plants,
    leading to better irrigation decisions. Another step towards the implementation
    of this technique was a field irrigation experiment in which natural variation
    of water status in a commercial cotton field was addressed by variable-rate drip
    irrigation. Larger, though not significant, yields were obtained. Since this is
    the first attempt in using VRDI in field crops, more experiments should be conducted
    to prove its added value. Thermal imaging, however, can be used not only for VRI
    but also for better estimation of the field water status and to improve irrigation
    decisions. Because of its relatively high cost, to assimilate thermal imaging
    for commercial use more cost effective methods should be developed (Cohen et al.
    2017a). 11.4 Case Study 11.3. Automatic Irrigation of Orchards Using Soil Moisture
    Sensors (IRRIX Model) 11.4.1 Introduction At the scientific level, the processes
    that determine the water demand of crops are well known, and various methodologies
    have been developed to improve irrigation efficiency. The water balance method,
    in which the water inputs of the soil-plant system must be balanced to the expected
    outputs (Allen et al. 1998), is the most widely used system to determine the irrigation
    needs of a crop. One of the drawbacks of the water balance method is that any
    inaccurate parameterization will produce a systematic error that will accumulate
    throughout the crop cycle due to deviations that occur between estimated values
    and actual consumption. Irrigation control based on feedback from moisture sensors
    is a viable alternative to the water balance method, having as its main advantage
    the ability to adjust irrigation to the needs of a specific plot (Casadesús et
    al. 2012). However, there are also drawbacks to irrigation control based only
    on sensors such as the risk of sensor breakdown, variability in the measurements
    (Nolz and Kammerer 2017) and difficulty in interpreting sensor results, especially
    for drip irrigation where soil water distribution is heterogeneous. In general
    terms, as both the water balance and sensor-based irrigation control methods have
    their pros and cons, combining both approaches seem to be the best way to improve
    the efficiency of irrigation in agricultural systems. This can be done by determining
    the irrigation dose from a water balance model and then using sensors to adjust
    that model to the real situation of each plot. Information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) can be used to attain this objective. In the last decade, most of the studies
    that have been published on automatic irrigation controllers have focused on regulating
    soil water content (SWC) or soil water tension (SWT) with feedback-based on/off
    strategies (Luthra et al. 1997; Miranda et al. 2005; Cáceres et al. 2007; Tahar
    et al. 2011). These devices are relatively inexpensive and easy to use, but ground
    water measurements imply certain limitations: they require a large number of sensors
    and do not consider plant status and response. Xiang (2011) and Zhu and Li (2011)
    published a study on irrigation controllers that used a combination of SWC and
    weather data to control drip irrigation. Romero et al. (2012) concluded that the
    approach of combining weather data with soil moisture signals could increase irrigation
    efficiency in almond trees. O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) and Peters and Evett
    (2008) proposed irrigation controllers aimed at regulating canopy temperature
    instead of SWC sensors. Software tools and web applications are of fundamental
    importance when it comes to determining when and how much irrigation should be
    applied in response to crop development, crop type and environmental conditions
    (Casadesús et al. 2012). Various computer software packages have been developed
    to monitor soil properties and irrigation scheduling over a wide range of irrigation
    systems (Hess 1996; Abreu and Pereira 2002). Kim and Evans (2009) developed decision
    support software to collect information from wireless sensor networks (WSN) and
    control a site-specific linear-move irrigation system on a malting barley (Hordeum
    vulgare L.) field. A similar approach was described in the first case study of
    this chapter. There are also researchers who have developed software tools that
    allow operation in combination with the water balance approach and crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) estimation using soil or plant humidity sensors to enable subsequent readjustment
    of the ETc estimation (Bacci et al. 2008; Casadesús et al. 2012; Osroosh et al.
    2016). In addition, there are researchers who used a DSS that executed a pre-established
    irrigation schedule in which regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) was applied without
    human intervention in a Japanese plum crop (Prunus salicina) (Millán et al. 2019)
    and a hedgerow olive orchard (Millán et al. 2020) combining the water balance
    method with soil moisture sensors. 11.4.2 Semi Commercial Testing of an Automatic
    Irrigation System To demonstrate the use of an automatic irrigation system (IRRIX),
    an experiment was conducted during 2018 (FERTINNOWA Project) on a commercial farm
    called “Finca El Chaparrito”. The farm belongs to the company Haciendas Bio S.A.,
    and is in the municipality of Pueblonuevo del Guadiana, Badajoz (latitude 38°5
    6′ 13.59″ N, longitude 6° 45′ 21.98″ W, WGS84), Spain. Three different varieties
    of early-maturing peach (Prunus persica) were present in the measurement area
    (4.5 ha): Kay-sweet (1.5 ha), Almaneb (1.5 ha) and UFO-4 (1.5 ha). All trees were
    planted in the spring of 2009 at a spacing of 5 m × 3 m, in an east-west row orientation.
    The trees were irrigated daily using a drip system with a single lateral line
    per tree row located 0.5 m from the base of the tree and on-line emitters with
    discharge rates of 2.2 l h−1, spaced at 0.5 m. The irrigation sector was separated
    into two parts for each variety, thus allowing the establishment of two irrigation
    management systems for each variety. 11.4.2.1 Selection of the Testing Zone An
    analysis of soil and plant spatial variation was carried out to select the best
    area to install the IRRIX system and enable comparison between it and the irrigation
    system carried out by the farmer (FARMER). For this purpose, the most homogeneous
    zone possible was selected. To determine soil heterogeneity, the apparent electrical
    conductivity (ECa) of the soil was measured with a Dualem-1S non-contact sensor
    (Dualem, Inc., Milton, Ontario, Canada), equipped with a global positioning system
    (GPS) antenna. The entire field was surveyed for ECa, obtaining both shallow (0–50
    cm) electrical conductivity (ECs) and deep (0–150 cm) electrical conductivity
    (ECd) values. The ECs data were used as most root activity occurs in the first
    50 cm. The final data set consisted of 3386 measurements for ECs. Figure 11.9
    shows the ECs values, with the green line indicating the division of irrigation
    sectors. This line separates each variety into different irrigation sectors for
    IRRIX installation and allows comparison with the application carried out by the
    farmer. The data obtained with the soil sensor indicate a less variation in soil
    characteristics between the corresponding irrigation sectors in the zone of the
    Kay-sweet (red) than between those of the Almaneb (purple) and UFO-4 (brown) varieties.

    to the different varieties Kay-sweet, Almaneb and UFO-4 varieties, respectively
    Full size image Sentinel-2 (ESA) satellite images were used to study crop variability.
    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were used to characterize
    spatial variation within the different varieties and sectors (Fig. 11.10). The
    maximum and minimum NDVI values for the different irrigation sectors of the varieties
    show different values in the sectors for each variety (Table 11.3). In the pre-harvest
    period, the greatest variability occurred in the Kay-sweet variety. Fig. 11.10

    varieties Kay-sweet, Almaneb and UFO-4 respectively Full size image Table 11.3
    Maximum and minimum NDVI values for different varieties in the pre- and post-harvest
    period Full size table The soil and crop values indicated that the best location
    to develop the trial was in the Kay-sweet area because the soil was less variable
    and crop development was similar, especially in the post-harvest period. The area
    occupied by the Kay-sweet variety was delimited by a central pipeline controlled
    by two solenoid valves that allowed two types of irrigation in two zones. In one
    of the zones (FARMER), traditional irrigation was carried out by the farmer following
    his experience in irrigation scheduling, replacing ETc in pre-harvest and a deficit
    irrigation strategy at 75% of ETc post-harvest. Irrigation doses were applied
    using a general irrigation programmer (Agronic 2500, Progrés, Spain) installed
    on the farm. In the other zone, an IRRIX system was installed to automate irrigation
    decisions. The IRRIX treatment was applied through the IRRIX application, and
    the seasonal plan that was introduced in IRRIX was the same as in the FARMER treatment.
    11.4.2.2 Automatic Irrigation System The IRRIX system was calibrated in a national
    project (RTA2013-00045-C04) funded by the Spanish Agrarian and Food Research Institution
    (INIA) with different crops. The IRRIX system comprised two components: (a) sensors
    installed in the field and (b) a cloud-hosted web platform (IRRIX) which uses
    a control algorithm combines a water-balance-based estimate of crop water needs
    with readjustment based on sensor readings: (a) Various sensors and other devices
    were installed in the field: (1) Soil moisture sensors at three selected control
    points (Cp). At each Cp, five 10HS soil moisture sensors (Decagon Devices Inc.,
    Pullman, WA, USA) were installed at different depths and locations in relation
    to dripper position (two sensors at a depth of 30 cm and located under the dripper;
    one sensor at a depth of 60 cm and located under the dripper; one sensor at a
    depth of 30 cm and located between drippers; one sensor at a depth of 60 cm and
    located between drippers; Fig. 11.11). The 10HS sensors used the general calibration
    proposed by the manufacturer for mineral soils, (2) an air temperature sensor
    (CS2015, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, US), (3) a solenoid valve, (4) a
    water meter and (5) a relay. All sensors were connected to a CR1000 data logger
    (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, US). All data were collected every 5 minutes
    and downloaded to the IRRIX server four times a day. Fig. 11.11 Location of soil
    moisture sensors Full size image Other soil moisture measurement points were selected
    in the farm: (1) Observation points (Op) were also used to monitor soil moisture,
    but not to control IRRIX. Op1 was installed in the FARMER zone using the Hidrosoph®
    system with soil moisture sensors every 10 cm to a maximum depth of 80 cm; and
    (2) Op2 was installed in the IRRIX zone using the same configuration as Cp above.
    (b) A cloud-hosted web platform (IRRIX) carried out the following daily tasks
    for water scheduling: 1. Data collection from sensors installed in the field.
    IRRIX downloads sensor data at periodic intervals during the day. The reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0) is estimated daily from the air temperature sensor using
    the Hargreaves equation (Hargreaves and Allen 2003). 2. Analysis of all data and
    calculation of irrigation water volumes. The IRRIX analyses all incoming data
    to detect anomalies and detect if any important event has occurred in the system
    (irrigation, rain). IRRIX interprets the soil moisture sensors by focusing on
    the trend, between consecutive days, of the driest measurement of each day (SWCd).
    Then, to reduce variability between sensors, IRRIX normalizes these values specifically
    for each sensor through Eq. (11.4). $$ \mathrm{NSWCd}=\left(\mathrm{SWCd}-\mathrm{SWCW}\mathrm{P}\right)/\left(\mathrm{SWCFC}-\mathrm{SWCW}\right)
    $$ (11.4) where soil water content wilting point (SWCWP) and soil water content
    field capacity (SWCFC) correspond to the values that this sensor would record
    under wilting point and field capacity conditions, respectively. In practice,
    the SWCFC is taken at the beginning of the campaign from actual measurements of
    the system under field conditions, while the value assigned to the SWCWP is the
    expected SWC value under wilting point conditions for this type of soil. To obtain
    a single value to summarize the state of an irrigation sector, IRRIX performs
    a weighted average of the values obtained with the 15 sensors installed in a sector
    where the weight of each sensor is the product of its reliability and representativeness.
    The reliability of a sensor is related to the quality of the data that a sensor
    records, in other words, whether the sensor is operating correctly or not due
    to some unexpected anomaly. IRRIX automatically estimates sensor reliability on
    a daily basis with a scale of values ranging from 0 to 1. All sensors have an
    initial value of 1, and each time an anomaly is detected the reliability value
    is decreased (multiplied by a value ranging between 0 and 0.5) depending on the
    seriousness of the anomaly. If the sensor stops working, IRRIX automatically removes
    it from the system (value of 0) and does not take the data from the sensor into
    account in its estimates. The representativeness of each sensor refers to whether
    the information provided by the sensor is relevant or not for the decision-making
    process in the irrigation control system. The level of representativeness is not
    set automatically by IRRIX but by the user according to his or her criteria. In
    practice, representativeness takes the value 1. The automatic system and its control
    algorithms are described in Millán et al. (2019). Then, IRRIX analyses the set
    of data to determine and adjust the irrigation dose according to the information
    provided by the soil sensors. 3. Irrigation scheduling. IRRIX sends the updated
    irrigation doses to the data logger. Then, the IRRIX system orders the solenoid
    valve to be opened and closed in order to apply the corresponding irrigation dose
    as indicated by the water meter. 4. Interaction with users. IRRIX is an autonomous
    system whose main objective is to free the user from work. The main function of
    the user is to check that the system has worked correctly, and the irrigation
    campaign has been undertaken as expected. Any anomaly in the system must also
    be resolved manually. 5. In addition, before starting the irrigation season, the
    user must input a seasonal plan to IRRIX that includes a rough forecast of how
    the water will be distributed throughout the irrigation season. For this purpose,
    a set of curves has to be defined, and the automated control system positioned
    between those curves (limits of the system) to ensure it has maximum and minimum
    cumulative irrigation values. Between these points, IRRIX can modify the irrigation
    schedule on the basis of the data provided by the soil sensors. The Cp and Op
    were located in relation to the soil texture characteristics of the farm. The
    ECs map was used to select 46 points to measure the surface (0–30 cm) and deep
    (30–60 cm) soil properties. Soil sample texture was analyzed using the method
    introduced by Gee and Bauder (1986). Computation of variograms for ordinary kriging
    is unreliable with so few data points (Webster and Oliver 1992), therefore, regression
    kriging with the dense ECs data was used. Goovaerts and Kerry (2010) showed that
    the relationship between soil and dense ancillary data can account for a large
    proportion of the spatial variation and thus, a smaller sample size (around 50
    points) can be used when a multi-variate geostatistical approach like regression
    kriging is used. Regression kriging involves regression between, for example,
    the sand and ECs data, computation of a variogram of the residuals and then kriging
    of the residuals (Millán et al. 2019) (Fig. 11.12). Regression kriging was conducted
    using the Geostatistical Analyst extension of the ArcGIS software (version 10.3,
    ESRI, Inc., Redlands, Cal.). The sand and clay content values measured on the
    map allowed us to identify similar areas between the two zones (Fig. 11.12 a,
    b). The area next to the dividing line of the sector (black line) was identified
    as the most representative area for both zones. The three Cps were installed in
    this area in the IRRIX zone (right-hand side of map), with the distance between
    the different control points for automatic irrigation limited by the maximum possible
    cable distance to maintain the electrical signal with sufficient quality. The
    Op1 was installed in the FARMER zone (left-hand side of map). Another Op (Op2)
    was installed in the IRRIX zone to allow monitoring of another point location
    at the highest elevation for potential pipe leakage problems (Fig. 11.12c), and
    to carry out checks with respect to the Cp, but becoming part of decision-making
    process. Fig. 11.12 Prediction maps of soil properties (a) sand (%), (b) clay
    (%) according to the method described by Millan et al. (2020) and elevation (c)
    elevation (metres) in trial part of the farm. The Cp (control point) and Op (observation
    point) location shown in the map. The black line is the zone where the sector
    was divided into farmer and IRRIX zones Full size image Figure 11.13 shows the
    average soil moisture values at the Cp and Op sites integrated in the root zone
    (first 60 cm of soil depth). Information from the sensors indicated water application
    above irrigation needs during the pre-harvest period at all points. This is traditional
    practice to avoid a loss of fruit size during the pre-harvest period. In this
    period, the IRRIX system had minor correction limits, determined in the seasonal
    plan by the farmer, with irrigation doses above crop needs. During the post-harvest
    period, the farmer uses RDI strategies and so the system limits are larger and
    allow RDI-based adjustment. With Cp-sourced soil sensor data (Fig. 11.13 a, b,
    c), the IRRIX management system enabled a significant reduction of irrigation
    water during the post-harvest period, thereby reducing the large water content
    in the soil (below the stress line). However, in the case of FARMER management,
    the decrease was less, resulting, as can be seen in Fig. 11.13e (Op1), in the
    crop maintaining its water status within the buffer zone of the system (solid
    and dashed lines). This indicates that the crop was not under the desired stress
    (dashed line) and that the farmer’s goals were not being achieved during this
    phase. This was subsequently confirmed with the measured stem water potential
    values (data not shown). The Op2 (Fig. 11.13d), installed at another point of
    the IRRIX zone at a higher elevation, showed a lower soil water content (due to
    different water pressure) closer to the stress situation (dashed line) intended
    by the farmer. Fig. 11.13 Evolution of soil moisture, average value of sensors
    in root zone (0–60 cm) at the different control and observation points: Cp1 (a),
    Cp2 (b), Cp3 (c), Op2 (d) and Op1 (e). Solid line indicates field capacity and
    dashed line indicates the start of crop stress. The vertical line marks the harvest
    date Full size image The IRRIX system not only allowed automation of the irrigation
    of a commercial plot, but also adjustment of the irrigation dose, reducing the
    application of water during the post-harvest period and resulting in water savings
    of 20–25% for all of the irrigation periods (Fig. 11.14a), especially in the post-harvest
    period. With respect to the impact of the IRRIX strategy on the following year’s
    yield . The yield was evaluated for 12 trees in each of the zones (FARMER and
    IRRIX). No losses were observed (Fig 11.14b), with a similar commercial yield
    between treatments (no significant differences). Fig. 11.14 Automatic (IRRIX)
    and traditional (FARMER) irrigation and rainfall (p) in the different water scheduling

    error Full size image 11.4.3 Conclusions For efficient management of fruit crop
    irrigation and the possible implementation of water-saving irrigation strategies,
    soil moisture control systems provide important benefits with knowledge of the
    amount of water available to the plant in each crop phase; they are cheap, easy-to-install
    and can measure soil moisture content continuously. However, these systems also
    have some drawbacks, with the trickiest issues involving sensor positioning, possible
    errors and inconsistencies in sensor readings, the treatment given to the sensor
    readings, interpretation of the data obtained and the decision making process.
    In this sense, advances in computer science combined with the development of ICTs
    and improvement of communication systems have revolutionized the possibilities
    for the integration of crop monitoring sensors in DSS . Automatic irrigation systems
    such as IRRIX allow the integration of DSS with sensors in the field, enabling
    early estimation of irrigation needs. Having a mechanism of readjustment based
    on feedback control from soil sensors allows selection of the most reliable data.
    Such interpretation of the results is very useful for decision making. The correct
    installation of the soil moisture sensors in a representative area of the farm
    is an important factor to obtain useful data for the water management objectives
    set by the farmer. The use of PA techniques to characterize spatial variation
    in the soil and plants and selection of the correct zone to install the sensors
    has also been a major advance. This enables representative data to be obtained
    of the hydraulic state of the soil that can be applied to the whole plot and helps
    to avoid irrigation programs that influence each zone in a different way. The
    IRRIX system could be very useful to farmers in the application of RDI strategies,
    saving water and reducing vegetative growth (pruning) while at the same time maintaining
    yield and fruit quality. 11.5 Conclusions for the Chapter Three precision irrigation
    case studies have been described above that address a range of challenges associated
    with incorporating precision irrigation. The case study from south-eastern USA,
    presented the use a commercial VRI for pivot irrigation system, the case study
    from Spain demonstrated an automatic irrigation system for a drip irrigated orchard
    and the one from Israel described the first steps towards VRDI implementation.
    Until recently, precision irrigation was based on pre-determined IMZ , essentially
    based on historical and soil data and predetermined irrigation scheduling based
    primarily on weather data. Adaptive irrigation control strategies can use both
    historical data and (near) real-time quantitative measurements of crop status,
    weather and soil, either singly or in combination, to adjust the irrigation application
    locally, as required, to account for temporal and spatial variation in the field
    (McCarthy et al. 2010). All three case studies have shown that timely data provide
    decision support for VRI management, i.e. soil moisture sensor data (south-eastern
    USA and Spain) and thermal aerial imagery (Israel). The three cases studies showed
    that precision irrigation treatments performed better than uniform irrigation.
    Yield increase was 4.3, 6–15, and 12% in south-eastern USA, Israel and Spain,
    respectively. In addition, in all cases but one (in Israel, 2018) WUE was improved
    by 14, 25 and 40% in Israel, Spain and southern USA, respectively. The reliance
    on point-sensor data in the case studies from south-eastern USA and Spain dictated
    the use of pre-determined IMZ , yet, enabled adaptive in-season irrigation management.
    In-season remotely sensed images can be used further for adaptive IMZ , i.e. to
    modify their boundaries (Fontanet et al. 2020). The use of satellite imagery and
    to some extent aerial imagery, however, currently have a relatively long revisit
    time which limits their use with VRI pivot irrigation systems. Irrigation of a
    field with VRI pivot irrigation systems is lengthy, thus a snapshot image does
    not adequately represent the variation in plant water status that is relevant
    to irrigation decisions. To overcome that, a sensor network mounted on the lateral
    of an irrigation system (O’Shaughnessy and Evett 2010) was suggested. The case
    study from Israel, by comparison showed that remotely sensed imagery might depict
    the variation in water status well in drip irrigated fields, enabling the delineation
    of dynamic management zones. In this case, however, the implementation of precision
    irrigation is limited by the current lack of VRI for drip irrigation. From these
    case studies, it can be seen that full VRI implementation, which adapts for spatial
    and temporal changes, faces ‘site-specific’ challenges, i.e. every irrigation
    system is unique, and requires unique solutions. Precision irrigation is studied
    widely, but is still in its infancy in terms of assimilation and commercialization.
    Similar to other PA disciplines, PI management is mainly based on: (1) data acquisition
    mostly from remote and proximal sensing, (2) data processing, (3) modelling and
    development of spatial decision support systems to manage within-field variability
    and create prescription maps, and (4) variable-rate application (VRA) devices.
    Previous scientific efforts regarding PI have concentrated on data acquisition
    and processing. Until recently, industries have focused mainly on the development
    of VRI systems. Both scientific and industrial communities currently invest increasing
    effort to develop advanced decision-making methods and tools (e.g. Navarro-Hellín
    et al. 2016; McCarthy et al. 2014). More effort should be invested in developing
    irrigation decision support systems that integrate atmospheric data with timely
    data from soil sensors and in-season spatial plant data from remote sensing. Moreover,
    to shift from purely responsive irrigation control that relies on past and ‘near
    real time’ soil and plant sensing data, forecasts of soil and plant water status
    that are based on crop models should also be incorporated into DSS . References

    et al to CW text 21-10-11.pdf 691.3 kB Public - - Abstract Farm-scale trials are
    being conducted to assess the benefits of variable rate irrigation (VRI). Three
    farms have been selected where existing sprinkler irrigation systems have recently
    been modified to provide variable rate control of each individual sprinkler. Irrigation
    is being varied according to soil and crop differences, and is also being shut
    off over exclusion zones, such as drains and raceways, and for farm operations
    such as pasture renovation. Under each VRI irrigator, soil variability has been
    quantitatively assessed using a mobile soil mapping system, which consists of
    an electromagnetic (EM) sensor pulled behind an all-terrain vehicle, with an on-board
    accurate RTK-GPS, datalogger and field computer. The EM sensor measures soil apparent
    electrical conductivity (EC), and the resulting soil EC maps were ground-truthed
    and used to define irrigation management zones. Soil moisture sensors have been
    installed into each zone to monitor real-time soil moisture status. This information
    is then used for variable rate irrigation scheduling. Trial plots have been established
    in each zone at each site to compare a blanket uniform rate of irrigation to all
    zones with variable rates of irrigation fine-tuned to zone differences. A goal
    of this research is to assess irrigation water use efficiency of a VRI system,
    as well as to develop a precision irrigation system with capability for full automation.

    16 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Corn is the major irrigated crop in the Texas
    High Plains (THP) and uses 53% of the total agricultural regional water resource
    budget. Currently, the declining water level of the Ogallala Aquifer, coupled
    with irrigation pumping restrictions by regional groundwater conservation districts,
    is challenging sustainable, high level corn production. The objective of this
    article is to review production levels and evaluate corn management practices
    in the THP with reduced or limited levels of irrigation. Long-term field studies
    demonstrate that yield and water use efficiency (WUE) have increased significantly
    over the last forty years while seasonal corn evapotranspiration (ET) under full
    irrigation conditions has not increased. Among management practices, irrigation
    remains the single-most important factor in corn production. With recent advances
    in corn breeding and genetics, irrigation requirements can be reduced by up to
    25% in some years and result in similar yields as compared to irrigation amounts
    at the 100% ET level. Also, WUE is generally maximized at irrigation levels meeting
    75–80% ET demand. Newly developed drought tolerant corn hybrids have been shown
    to provide yield benefits of 10–15% under limited (reduced) irrigation water levels.
    At the higher irrigation levels (75–100% ET requirement), corn yield increased
    as seeding rate increased initially but did not increase further when the seeding
    rate exceeded 94,000 seeds ha−1. Also, a multi-year planting date study indicated
    that high corn yields can still be achieved with a long-season hybrid when planted
    in the middle of May and early June. When the planting date is delayed to late
    June and early July, mid- and short- season hybrids showed a yield advantage over
    the long season hybrids. The Texas High Plains (THP) is one of the most productive
    agricultural regions in the U.S. From 2009 to 2012, the Texas panhandle portion
    of this region had 58% corn, 41% wheat, 20% grain sorghum, 13% cotton, 63% ensilage,
    and 10% forage crops of the crop production in the State of Texas. Together with
    other crops and forages, the annual economic value of crop production in the region
    was nearly $1.7 billion, with corn production alone accounting for 40% ($688 million)
    of the total crop value (Amosson et al. 2015). In 2016, 2.9 million acres of corn
    were planted in Texas and nearly half of the state acreage (1.4 million acres)
    was in the THP region (Figure 1) (NASS 2016a, b). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Corn planted acres in (A) the U.S. and (B) Texas in the 2016 growing

    (B) https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Texas/Publications/County_Estimates/ce_maps/ce_corn.php.)
    In the THP, high corn productivity has heavily relied on irrigation for consistency
    and profitable operations. Among the major crops, corn uses 53% of the entire
    regional water budget annually for irrigation (1.76 billion m3). Almost all irrigation
    in the THP is from the Ogallala Aquifer, with development of irrigation in this
    region significantly increasing since the 1950s. The Ogallala Aquifer is a finite
    water resource with minimal recharge, and the dramatic increase in water extraction
    for crop irrigation has resulted in significant decline of aquifer capacity with
    some areas experiencing a 50% or greater reduction in saturated thickness. Irrigated
    land area has decreased from a peak of 2.4 million ha in 1974 to 1.9 million ha
    in 2000 (Colaizzi et al. 2009). Therefore, sustained corn production faces challenges
    as THP irrigation water resources continue to decline. The development of profitable
    management strategies with limited irrigation scenarios is important for reducing
    production risk, maintaining profitability, and conserving water resources. The
    objective of this article is to review production levels and evaluate corn management
    practices in the THP with reduced or limited levels of irrigation based on long-term
    field experiments at Bushland and Etter, Texas. Corn Yield, Evapotranspiration,
    and Water Use Efficiency Figure 2 shows changes in corn yield from the mid-1970s
    to recent years at three levels (national, THP county average, and Research &
    Demonstration (R&D) plots) (Musick and Dusek 1980; Howell et al. 1995, 2015a;
    Yazar et al. 1999; AgriPartners 2007; Colaizzi et al. 2011; Hao et al. 2015).
    The yield data from THP county and R&D level were largely conducted at the 100%
    ET demand level. The national average corn yield was compiled from combined irrigated
    and rain-fed yield data. Although corn yield varied from year to year, there was
    a clear trend that yield has increased linearly over the last 40 years, with an
    annual increase of about 120 kg ha−1. Interestingly, the slope of the increase
    is virtually the same at all three levels. Figure 2 shows that corn yield at the
    county level in the THP was always higher than the national average, and that
    the THP corn yield increased more than the national and R&D levels. At the county
    level, average yield increased from about 6–8 Mg ha−1 in the 1970s to about 13
    Mg ha−1 in recent years (e.g., 2013). Corn yields of the R&D plots were higher
    than those of the county level, ranging from about 8 Mg ha−1 in 1970s to 16 Mg
    ha−1 in recent years (e.g., 2011–2013). The higher yield of the R&D plots is generally
    due to the smaller, more intensively managed production areas, as compared to
    field based production practice. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Corn
    yield from 1975 to recent time at National level, County level (average of top
    26 counties in the Texas Panhandle), and Research and Demonstration (R&D) plots
    in the Texas High Plains. (Data sources: NASS; long-term field studies at Bushland
    and Etter, TX). Corn has a high evapotranspiration (ET) demand (both daily and
    seasonally) in the THP (Howell et al. 1995, 2015a). Daily corn ET has been measured
    in large, monolithic weighing lysimeters at Bushland, Texas, and often exceeds
    10 mm d−1 for significant periods of time (Figure 3) (Howell et al. 1996). In
    contrast, daily ET rarely exceeds 10 mm d−1 in the central Great Plains of Nebraska
    (Grassini et al. 2011). Seasonal ET requirement for corn under varied irrigation
    levels has been studied at Bushland, Texas since the 1970s. Early studies under
    furrow irrigated conditions showed that seasonal ET ranged from 667 mm to 984
    mm under full irrigation (Musick and Dusek 1980; Eck 1984). Field studies using
    sprinkler irrigation showed that seasonal ET ranged from 750–973 mm (mostly between
    800–900 mm) in the 1990s at irrigation of 100% ET requirement (Howell et al. 1995,
    2015a; Schneider and Howell 1998; Yazar et al. 1999; Evett et al. 2000). Corn
    ET levels in producer’s fields had a larger variation and ranged from 750 mm to
    1200 mm. In recent studies at both Bushland and Etter, Texas, a lower seasonal
    ET was recorded under full irrigation at Etter than at Bushland. The ET is generally
    higher in the south than north, and in the east than west, in the THP region.
    Colaizzi et al. (2011) conducted a three-year experiment using a subsurface drip
    irrigation system and seasonal corn ET ranged from 711 mm to 818 mm at Bushland
    at irrigation level of 100% ET requirement. Hao et al. (2015) showed that corn
    under irrigation of 100% ET requirement ranged from 634 mm to 796 mm, depending
    on year and hybrid. Figure 4 shows that seasonal corn ET has a decreasing trend
    while WUE varied linearly over the years under full irrigation (100% ET requirement
    or greater) in the THP. In comparison, seasonal corn ET under full irrigation
    in other regions of the Great Plains was generally less than that in the THP,
    according to Rudnick et al. (2017) who summarized irrigation studies across the
    central and southern Great Plains from Nebraska and Colorado to Texas. In Nebraska,
    seasonal corn ET under full irrigation ranged from 526 mm to 655 mm in several
    field studies (van Donk et al. 2012; Irmak et al. 2015a, b; Rudnick et al. 2016).

    (ET) and (B) water use efficiency (WUE) under full irrigation conditions from
    1975 to 2013 in the research plots (Data sources: long-term field studies at Bushland
    and Etter, TX). The yield-ET relationship and WUE in corn have been reported in
    different studies at Bushland and Etter, Texas at different irrigation levels
    (Musick and Dusek 1980; Howell et al. 1995, 2015a; Yazar et al. 1999; Colaizzi
    et al. 2011; Hao et al. 2015). For comparison, an analysis of the corn yield-ET
    relationship was used using three data sets, representing differing time periods
    in the THP. The first data set was from Musick and Dusek (1980). They conducted
    field studies at different furrow irrigation levels and frequencies from 1975
    to 1977. The second data set was compiled from a field study using center pivot
    sprinkler irrigation in 1994 and 1995 (Schneider and Howell 1998). The third data
    set was from recent field studies conducted at Etter, Texas from 2011 to 2013
    using different hybrids and planting densities (Hao et al. 2015). During all three
    time periods, corn yield increased linearly as seasonal ET increased (Figure 5).
    Linear regression between corn yield and ET resulted in a slope of 0.0243, 0.0277,
    and 0.0285 (the unit is Mg ha−1 mm−1) in the studies of 1975–1977, 1994–1995,
    and 2011–2013, respectively. Based on the three linear equations in Figure 5,
    a threshold ET can be calculated for each study. Threshold ET is the ET level
    at which the first grains are initiated (Musick et al. 1994; Schneider and Howell
    1998). The threshold ET value was 346 mm for the 1975–1977 study, 310 mm for the
    1994–1995 study, and 214 mm for the 2011–2013 study. Schneider and Howell (1998)
    summarized the slopes of the linear regressions of yield and ET and threshold
    ET values in different studies conducted at Bushland, Texas. The slopes ranged
    from 0.02 to 0.34 and the threshold ET values ranged from 147 mm to 467 mm (Schneider
    and Howell 1998). Although the smaller threshold ET value in the 2011–2013 study
    (214 mm) may indicate management improvement over the decades as compared to the
    1975–1977 study (346 mm), the yield-ET relationship can be affected by many factors.
    Nevertheless, comparing yield and ET in the three studies, corn yield increased
    at any ET level from 1975 to 2013, indicating overall corn yield improvement in
    the last four decades. Greater yields in the studies of 1994–1995 and 2011–2013
    at lower ET levels (<600 mm) indicate that drought tolerance technology in new
    corn hybrids has improved in the last four decades. The improvement of drought
    and other stress tolerance in corn hybrids has also been reported in the U.S.
    Corn-belt region and Canada (Tollenaar and Lee 2002; Hammer et al. 2009). Figure
    5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The relationship between corn yield and seasonal
    evapotranspiration (ET) in the periods of 1975–1977, 1994–1995, and 2011–2013
    in the Texas High Plains (Data sources: Musick and Dusek 1980; Schneider and Howell
    1998; Hao et al. 2015). As WUE is the ratio of yield to seasonal ET, factors affecting
    both yield and ET will affect the WUE values. In the THP, WUE values were affected
    by irrigation amount, frequency, and management methods (Howell et al. 1995; Schneider
    and Howell 1998; Hao et al. 2015). Under full irrigation conditions (100% ET requirement
    or greater), WUE has increased from about 1.00 kg m−3 in the 1975–1977 study to
    about 2.00 kg m−3 in the 2011–2013 study (Figures 2, 4). The increased WUE in
    recent years (2011–2013) reflects the yield improvement over the last four decades.
    Studies have also shown that the maximum WUE is generally achieved at less than
    the 100% ET requirement level (Howell et al. 1995; Payero et al. 2008; Colaizzi
    et al. 2011; Hao et al. 2015). Corn WUE at the 100% ET level and 75% ET level
    ranged from 1.80 to 2.17 kg m−3 at Bushland (Colaizzi et al. 2011). WUE values
    at the same two irrigation levels ranged from 1.51 to 2.57 kg m−3 with a relatively
    low WUE (1.51–2.15 kg m−3) in 2011 and a relatively large WUE (1.70–2.57 kg m−3)
    in 2012 and 2013 in a study at Etter, Texas (Hao et al. 2015). In a two-year (1992
    and 1993) field study at Bushland Texas, a lower corn WUE of 1.58–1.75 kg m−3
    was reported by Howell et al. (1995). However, WUE decreased significantly as
    irrigation levels were reduced to 50% ET requirement or less (Schneider and Howell
    1998; Hao et al. 2015). For example, irrigation at the 25% ET level can result
    in crop failure (Schneider and Howell 1998). Irrigated Corn Management Practices
    in the Texas High Plains A declining water table coupled with irrigation pumping
    restrictions by groundwater districts could challenge sustainable corn production
    in the region. Limited irrigation, the application of less irrigation water than
    the plants require for full crop ET (100% level), will be the primary practice
    in the future in the THP. As such, development of advanced management practices
    is important to continue improving the yield and WUE relationship under water-limited
    conditions. Generally, there are two approaches to improve crop performance: breeding
    and management practices. Improving corn yield and WUE through breeding has been
    a major focus in both private (Pioneer, Monsanto, and Syngenta companies) and
    public sectors (e.g., universities). Management practices are as important, or
    possibly more so, than breeding when water-limited conditions exist (Passioura
    and Angus 2010). Improved crop management is responsible for the larger portion
    of increased productivity under water-limited conditions (Anderson 2010). Irrigation
    Management Although many management factors affect corn production in the THP,
    irrigation management remains the most effective way to sustain high crop productivity.
    In the THP, irrigation systems and accommodating agricultural practices have changed
    significantly in the last four decades, from furrow irrigation (1950s-1970s) to
    center pivot sprinkler and to (a lesser degree) subsurface drip irrigation systems
    that are currently being used. The history and trends of irrigation research and
    development in the region have been reviewed in different eras from the 1990s
    to recent time (Musick et al. 1990; Colaizzi et al. 2009; Evett et al. 2014).
    The details of irrigation history, economic impact, research, and development
    trends can be found in the aforementioned three review papers. Based on these
    papers, there are three generally inferred statements regarding irrigation in
    the THP. First, the irrigation supply from the Ogallala Aquifer is declining.
    Second, irrigation efficiency through systems conversion has been dramatically
    increased over the last few decades in the THP. Third, the future challenge is
    how to efficiently use the reduced amounts of irrigation while sustaining corn
    yields. The last is further challenged by the fact that future increases in other
    regional needs (such as municipal demand, power generation, etc.) will be added
    to the expense of the irrigation supply (PWPG 2011). However, preserving irrigation
    is crucial to sustainable crop production in the region (as well as national security
    item) since irrigation significantly increases WUE as compared to dryland production
    (Evett et al. 2014). To increase the efficiency of the irrigation applications,
    events should be scheduled using measurements of ET, soil moisture depletion,
    and/or plant based measurements. Irrigation scheduling to enhance the WUE includes
    the management of both water and soils. Crop ET is typically calculated using
    a crop specific coefficient (Kc) and reference evapotranspiration (ETο). ETο is
    calculated evapotranspiration from a reference crop (turf grass or alfalfa) using
    the meteorological parameters of temperature, relative humidity, precipitation,
    wind speed, and solar radiation. Irrigation can also be scheduled according to
    changes in soil moisture. Soil moisture sensors can provide information on soil
    moisture fluxes in the root zone, which provide information on when to initiate
    and terminate irrigation events. Irrigation scheduling using ET, a soil water
    balance method, or a combination of the two can be successfully employed in irrigated
    corn production. The seasonal average irrigation for (grain) corn is approximately
    500 mm in the THP Region A (Top 26 Counties of Texas, Marek et al. 2011). However,
    irrigation demand can vary and be much higher during a severe drought year such
    as in 2011, with a seasonal ET of 900 mm and irrigation of 754 mm (Hao et al.
    2015). Based on multiple-year studies at Bushland and Etter, using irrigation
    to meet a 75–80% of ET demand level can result in similar yields as compared to
    years where 100% of the ET demand was achieved with average or above average seasonal
    rainfall. Also, WUE is generally maximized at the 75–80% irrigation level. Unless
    adequate seasonal rainfall (normally > 250 mm) and excellent soil water storage
    exist at the time of planting, lowering irrigation levels to a 50% ET requirement
    or less significantly reduced corn yield (Schneider and Howell 1998; Collaizzi
    et al. 2011; Hao et al. 2015). Irrigation levels at the 25% ET level can result
    in yield failures based on studies conducted by Schneider and Howell (1998) and
    Colaizzi et al. (2011). Hybrid Selection Hybrid selection is another impacting
    factor for corn producers and is increasingly becoming different from choices
    of the past. Drought and irrigation system capacity remain the most important
    producer concern in the THP. Figure 5 shows that corn yield has increased sufficiently
    at lower ET levels from 1970s to the present, indicating corn drought tolerance
    has improved. Drought tolerance has been considered (and marketed) as an important
    component in the success of corn hybrids grown in semi-arid or arid regions such
    as the THP and western Corn-belt (Cooper et al. 2014). Studies conducted at Etter,
    Texas demonstrated that recently released drought-tolerant AQUAmax hybrids P1151HR
    and P1564HR consistently showed yield benefit as compared to a conventional hybrid
    (33D49) at lower irrigation levels (75% and 50% ET demands), especially under
    severe water stress conditions (e.g., 50% ET demand; Hao et al. 2015). Comparable
    results were found by Cooper et al. (2014), who reported that AQUAmax hybrids
    showed higher grain yield than regular drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive
    hybrids under drought conditions. Breeding for drought tolerance in corn is a
    major goal to improve yield stability under drought conditions. Furthermore, corn
    yield performance under non-drought conditions should also be considered when
    breeding for drought tolerance since producers are unlikely to adopt drought-tolerant
    hybrids if there is a significant yield penalty in well-watered environments (Boyer
    et al. 2013). Hao et al. (2015) showed that AQUAmax hybrids (P1151HR and P1564HR)
    had greater grain yield than the check hybrid (33D49) at irrigation levels of
    75% and 50% ET demands. However, no significant yield penalty was observed with
    either P1151HR or P1564HR at the 100% ET levels (Hao et al. 2015). Although the
    newly developed drought tolerant corn hybrids provide significant yield benefits
    (10–15%) under lower irrigation levels, a conventional new hybrid would yield
    the same as drought tolerant hybrids if there was sufficient water. Seeding Rate
    Due to the high corn seed prices, producers are concerned about seeding rate.
    Regarding corn seeding rate in the U.S. and Canada, only about 10% of corn acreage
    is planted at 89,000 or more seeds per hectare. About a third of the corn area
    planted is at 81,000 to 89,000 seeds per hectare (Butzen 2016). Marek et al. (2016)
    evaluated interactions of hybrids and seeding rate at multiple irrigation levels.
    The seeding rate ranged from 64,000 to 138,000 seeds per hectare. At the 100%
    ET level, corn yield increased as population increased initially but did not increase
    further at populations higher than 94,000 or 109,000 seeds per hectare, depending
    on hybrids (Marek et al. 2016). An optimal economic seeding rate (a seeding rate
    where yield increase from the next increment of seed no longer exceeds the seed
    cost) increased as yield potential increased. For example, the economic optimum
    seeding rate was determined to be 77,000 seeds ha−1 for 9.4 Mg ha−1 corn yield,
    but it increased to 96,000 seeds ha−1 for 15.1 Mg ha−1 yield. Based on published
    literature and the trial results of Marek et al. (2016), a rate of 99,000 seeds
    ha−1 or less would be sufficient for corn in the THP if the yield target is about
    15.6 Mg ha−1. Planting Date Corn planting dates in the THP range from mid-April
    to late May. Field trials were conducted and planting date and hybrid interaction
    for corn yield and water use were evaluated (Xue et al. 2014). The planting dates
    tested were May 15, June 1, June 15, and July 1. The results from this study indicated
    that high yield (13 Mg ha−1) can still be achieved with a longer-season hybrid
    (e.g., > 111-day) when planted from mid-May to early June. When the planting date
    was delayed to late June and early July, corn yields were significantly reduced
    (about 3.6–7.7 Mg ha−1, depending on the hybrid) for the long-season hybrids.
    However, yields in a short-season hybrid (96–day) were relatively consistent (8–10
    Mg ha−1) as planting date was delayed to late June. Although delaying planting
    to late June or early July could reduce corn yield potential, late planting can
    save irrigation water while maintaining greater water use efficiency. Future Perspectives
    Although progress has been made to improve corn yield and WUE in the last few
    decades in the THP, corn production still faces formidable challenges with declining
    irrigation water resources and from the additional potential of abiotic stresses
    suggested by climate change and the increased risk of frequent droughts. The amount
    of irrigation water available for corn production in the THP continues to decline.
    Although irrigation technologies have been dramatically improved over the years,
    management and genetic improvement are foreseen as extremely important in corn
    production. Drought stress is typical during the corn growing season with limited
    irrigation in semi-arid and arid regions, so improving both heat and drought tolerance
    through breeding will be an important component of overall crop improvement. Current
    research efforts have focused on grain yield, but very little attention has been
    given to grain quality including mycotoxin contamination. High mycotoxin levels
    can lead to the rejection of grains and as a result cause the WUE to decline to
    almost zero in the economic aspect. An improved understanding of crop response
    to drought stress factors and the identification of plant traits as affected by
    each will lead to the development of improved germplasm and hybrids in this region.
    It is also envisioned by many that additional supporting data using unmanned aerial
    systems (UAV’s) should aid in the assessment of these characteristics and improve
    limited water production and management practices, particularly with the more
    water sensitive crops such as corn. Acknowledgements We appreciate the grant supports

    Get rights and content Abstract Florida is the largest producer of fresh-market
    tomatoes in the United States. Production areas are typically intensively managed
    with high inputs of fertilizer and irrigation. The objectives of this 3-year field
    study were to evaluate the interaction between N-fertilizer rates and irrigation
    scheduling on yield, irrigation water use efficiency (iWUE) and root distribution
    of tomato cultivated in a plastic mulched/drip irrigated production systems. Experimental
    treatments included three irrigation scheduling regimes and three N-rates (176,
    220 and 230 kg ha−1). Irrigation treatments included were: (1) SUR (surface drip
    irrigation) both irrigation and fertigation line placed right underneath the plastic
    mulch; (2) SDI (subsurface drip irrigation) where the irrigation line was placed
    0.15 m below the fertigation line which was located on top of the bed; and (3)
    TIME (conventional control) with irrigation and fertigation lines placed as in
    SUR and irrigation being applied once a day. Except for the “TIME” treatment all
    irrigation treatments were controlled by soil moisture sensor (SMS)-based irrigation
    set at 10% volumetric water content which was allotted five irrigation windows
    daily and bypassed events if the soil water content exceeded the established threshold.
    Average marketable fruit yields were 28, 56 and 79 Mg ha−1 for years 1–3, respectively.
    The SUR treatment required 15–51% less irrigation water when compared to TIME
    treatments, while the reductions in irrigation water use for SDI were 7–29%. Tomato
    yield was 11–80% higher for the SUR and SDI treatments than TIME where as N-rate
    did not affect yield. Root concentration was greatest in the vicinity of the irrigation
    and fertigation drip lines for all irrigation treatments. At the beginning of
    reproductive phase about 70–75% of the total root length density (RLD) was concentrated
    in the 0–15 cm soil layer while 15–20% of the roots were found in the 15–30 cm
    layer. Corresponding RLD distribution values during the reproductive phase were
    68% and 22%, respectively. Root distribution in the soil profile thus appears
    to be mainly driven by development stage, soil moisture and nutrient availability.
    It is concluded that use of SDI and SMS-based systems consistently increased tomato
    yields while greatly improving irrigation water use efficiency and thereby reduced
    both irrigation water use and potential N leaching. Previous article in issue

    a major component of Florida agriculture encompassing about 72,000 ha for production
    and presenting a crop value of 1.5 billion dollars. In 2004, Florida tomato production
    represented 42% of the 1.6 billion of tons of U.S. fresh-market field-grown tomato
    production (USDA, 2007). Most of the vegetable crops in Florida are irrigated
    and due to the coarse-textured soils and high temperatures, many of the soils
    have low water holding capacity and soil organic matter content (Carlisle et al.,
    1988). Since irrigation and fertilization are intrinsically linked, appropriate
    irrigation management is required for these soils in order to avoid nitrate leaching
    and groundwater pollution, especially in tomato production systems, which require
    substantial inputs of nitrogen fertilizer. Hochmuth and Cordasco (2000) summarized
    more than 15 fertilization trials under drip irrigated conditions in Florida,
    and they concluded that in 87% of these trials tomato yield did not increase with
    rates above 224 kg ha−1 of N and inefficient fertilizer use and excessive nitrate
    leaching may be the underlying cause for yield responses to excessively high N-application
    rates. Despite the N-fertilizer rate recommendation for mineral soils with drip
    irrigation in Florida being 224 kg N ha−1 (Olson et al., 2005), growers may opt
    to apply excessively high N rates to minimize risk of yield reductions due to
    nitrogen limitations. In addition, on sandy soils, proper irrigation management
    is decisive to maximize yield, fertilizer and irrigation water use efficiency
    (iWUE) for vegetable crop production. On the other hand, significant reductions
    in water availability for irrigation use in southeast United States have increased
    the importance of implementation of water conservation practices in agriculture.
    Agricultural practices such as the use of plastic mulch, drip irrigation and quantitative
    irrigation scheduling are common in Florida, and they provide growers with a viable
    option to reduce crop water requirements and thus conserve water resources, especially
    when compared to traditional irrigation methods. Even with these advances, there
    remains a need for advancements in irrigation management by using real-time monitoring
    techniques combined with high frequency irrigation application methods based on
    actual plant water requirement. In practice, irrigation management and scheduling
    are commonly based on management skills (Fereres et al., 2003) but they may be
    further improved when factors such as plant evaporative demand, soil characteristics,
    root distribution are taken into account as well. The use of frequent but low
    volume irrigation applications via drip irrigation is superior to the more traditional
    scheduling of few but large applications (Locascio, 2005). In the past few years,
    sensor technology that permits continuous on-farm monitoring of soil water status
    has become increasingly accessible to commercial producers. Soil moisture sensors
    (SMS) measure volumetric soil water content (SWC), which can be used to more accurately
    balance specific crop water requirements. The use of SMS-based irrigation systems
    can maintain soil water status within upper and lower limits determined by type
    of soil and crop preventing over irrigation and saving water (Dukes and Scholberg,
    2005, Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005). Recently, Zotarelli et al. (2008) reported
    that use of SMS-based irrigation allowed more efficient use of irrigation water
    resulting in a reduction in irrigation water use by 33–80% compared to a daily
    fixed time irrigation scheduling for zucchini squash in sandy soils. Subsurface
    drip irrigation (SDI) is an adaptation of drip irrigation, where the irrigation
    drip tube is installed below the soil surface to reduce water losses due to soil
    evaporation thereby increasing water use efficiency (Ayars et al., 1999). A potential
    limitation to the use of subsurface drip irrigation in sandy soils is the establishment
    period when root systems are confined to the upper 5–10 cm and plant water supply
    depends on capillary rise which may be limited on sandy soils. In order to overcome
    this limitation, and to also reduce potential nitrate leaching, Zotarelli et al.
    (2008) combined surface applied fertigation via drip tape with subsurface drip
    irrigation controlled by soil moisture sensor irrigation. This combination resulted
    in a significant increase in water and nitrogen use efficiency and yield by zucchini
    squash, while it also increased N-retention in the top soil and thereby was also
    very effective in reducing N leaching. In fact, subsurface drip irrigation is
    an adaptation of a partial root zone drying technique, which requires wetting
    part of the root zone and leaving the other part dry, thereby utilizing reduced
    amount of irrigation water applied. It is expected that such a practice may increase
    irrigation-water-use efficiency (iWUE) leading to reduction in irrigation water
    requirement, while maintaining tomato yields (Kirda et al., 2004, Zegbe et al.,
    2006). A perceived negative consequence of using drip irrigation is that the wetted
    soil volume may be limited consequently reducing the crop root development (Mmolawa
    and Or, 2000). Independent of the use of surface or subsurface drip irrigation,
    roots grow preferentially around the wetted emitter area and concentrate within
    the top 40 cm of the soil profile (Oliveira et al., 1996, Machado et al., 2003).
    In fact, maximum root growth has been shown to occur when adequate mineral nitrogen
    is present (Bloom, 1997), which indicates that lack of inorganic nitrogen in certain
    root zones may limit root growth. There is very little data on the effect of irrigation
    and fertigation management on tomato root distribution in sandy soil and its effect
    on water use efficiency and yields. The objective of this study was therefore
    to identify suitable irrigation scheduling methods, drip irrigation system design
    to reduce crop water use and to evaluate their effect on the optimal N-fertilizer
    rate, tomato yield and root distribution. We hypothesized that use of soil moisture
    sensor based irrigation systems will reduce irrigation water requirements of intensively
    managed tomato production systems. 2. Materials and methods Field experiments
    were carried out at the University of Florida, Plant Science Research and Education
    Unit, near Citra, FL, during the spring of 2005, 2006 and 2007. The soil has been
    classified as Candler sand and Tavares sand (Buster, 1979) containing 8.2 and
    3.0 g kg−1 soil organic matter in the 0–30 and 30–90 cm soil layer. These soils
    contain 97% sand-sized particles in the upper 1 m of the profile (Carlisle et
    al., 1988) with a field capacity in the range of 0.10–0.12 (v/v) in the 0–30 cm
    depth (Icerman, 2007). Averaged initial soil nitrate content at beginning of the
    seasons was 1.8 ± 0.6, 2.6 ± 0.7 and 2.7 ± 0.7 mg kg−1 for the 0–30, 30–60 and
    60–90 cm soil depths, respectively. The average of nitrate content of the irrigation
    water was 0.4 ± 0.3 mg L−1. The area was rototilled and raised beds (0.30 m height)
    were constructed with 1.8 m distance between bed centers. Granulated fertilizer
    was incorporated into the beds at a rate of 112 kg ha−1 of P2O5. Beds were fumigated
    (80% methyl bromide, 20% chloropicrin by weight) at a rate of 604 kg ha−1 after
    placement of both drip tapes and plastic mulch in a single pass 13 days before
    transplanting. Irrigation was applied via drip tape (Turbulent Twin Wall, 0.20
    m emitter spacing, 0.25 mm thickness, 0.7 L h−1 at 69 kPa, Chapin Watermatics,
    NY). Water applied by irrigation and fertigation was recorded by positive displacement
    flowmeters (V100 16 mm diameter bore with pulse output, AMCO Water Metering Systems
    Inc., Ocala, FL, USA). Weekly meter measurements were manually recorded while
    data from transducers that signaled a switch closure every 18.9 L, were collected
    continuously by data loggers (HOBO event logger, Onset Computer Corp., Inc., Bourne,
    MA, USA) connected to each flow meter. Pressure was regulated by inline pressure
    regulators designed to maintain an average pressure in the field of 69 kPa during
    irrigation events. Plots were 15 m long, and a tractor mounted hole puncher was
    used to make 50 mm wide openings at 0.30 m intervals along the production bed.
    A weather station located within 500 m of the experimental site provided temperature,
    relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed data and this information was
    used to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) according to FAO-56
    (Allen et al., 1998). Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was based on the product of
    ET0 and the crop coefficient (Kc) for a given growth stage (Simonne et al., 2004)
    and values were reduced by 30% to account for the effect of plastic mulch on crop
    ET (Amayreh and Al-Abed, 2005) until the plant canopy was 80% full cover of raised
    bed area, which occurred around 35–40 days after transplanting. Tomato transplants
    (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. var. “Florida 47”) were set on 7 April 2005, 10
    April 2006, and 10 April 2007. Weekly fertigation consisted of injecting dissolved
    fertilizer salts into fertigation lines according to Maynard et al. (2003). All
    plots received 247 kg ha−1 of K as potassium chloride and 12 kg ha−1 of Mg as
    magnesium sulphate. The experimental design consisted of a complete factorial
    arrangement of three N-rates and three irrigation treatments randomized within
    blocks. The N-rate treatments corresponded to 176, 220 and 330 kg ha−1 of N applied
    as calcium nitrate. Weekly N application rates, expressed as a percentage of total
    N application, corresponded to 5.5% at weeks 1, 2 and 13; 7.1% at weeks 3, 4 and
    12; and 8.9% at weeks 5–11 (Maynard et al., 2003). The irrigation treatments were
    differentiated by their arrangement of drip irrigation lines. The treatments were
    identified as surface drip irrigation (SUR), whereby both irrigation and fertigation
    drip lines were positioned on the soil surface (Fig. 1). The second treatment
    was identified as subsurface drip irrigation, with the irrigation drip line positioned
    at 0.15 m below soil surface while the fertigation drip line was positioned on
    the soil surface (Fig. 1). For both treatments irrigation events were controlled
    by a Quantified Irrigation Controller (QIC) system (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2008),
    which included a 0.20 m long ECH2O probe (Decagon Devices Inc. Pullman, WA) to
    monitor soil moisture. Probes were inserted vertically in order to integrate the
    soil water content in the upper 0.2 m at 0.05 m from the irrigation drip line.
    The QIC irrigation controllers allowed a pre-programmed timed irrigation event
    if measured soil water content was below a volumetric water content (VWC) value
    of 0.10 m3 m−3 (translating to a 510 mV reading) during one of five daily irrigation
    events, with each potential irrigation event lasting 24 min. Based on these readings
    up to a maximum of five irrigation events could occur per day totaling 2 h. A
    reference treatment employed a fixed time-based irrigation (TIME) featuring one
    fixed 2-h irrigation event per day. As well as SUR treatment, for TIME treatment
    it was used of twin line, one for irrigation and one for fertigation. This was
    due to the experimental convenience; however, the commercial grower would have
    one drip line for irrigation and fertigation (Fig. 1). Download : Download full-size

    and sampling scheme. 2.1. Plant growth, yield and irrigation water use efficiency
    Plots were harvested on 70, 77 and 84 days after transplanting (DAT) in 2005;
    on 70, 77 and 86 DAT in 2006 and on 76, 83 and 90 DAT in 2007. The harvested area
    consisted of a central 10.5 m long region within each plot. Tomato fruits were
    graded into culls, U.S. Number 2 (medium), U.S. Number 1 (large), and Fancy (extra-large)
    according to USDA (1997) grading standards for fresh-market tomato. Marketable
    weight was calculated as total harvested weight minus the weight of culls. The
    number and weight of fruits per grading class were recorded for individual plots.
    Irrigation water use efficiency expressed in kg of fruits m−3 was calculated by
    taking the quotient of the marketable yields (kg ha−1) and the total applied seasonal
    irrigation depth (m3 ha−1). Maximum biomass accumulation was evaluated by harvesting
    one representative plant per treatment replicate at 84, 86 and 90 DAT for 2005,
    2006 and 2007 trials, respectively. For the 2005 and 2006 trials one representative
    plant was also harvested for each plot at bi-weekly intervals and used for growth
    analysis. Vegetative and reproductive plant parts were separated. Shoot and fruit
    tissues were dried at 65 °C for subsequent dry weight determination. 2.2. Root
    sampling and analysis Roots were collected during the spring of 2006 at 24, 45
    and 66 DAT for all irrigation treatments across the recommended N-rate (220 kg
    ha−1) treatment combination. Using a 0.05 m diameter soil auger of known volume,
    soil cores were extracted at four different depths: 0–0.15, 0.15–0.30, 0.3–0.6
    and 0.6–0.9 m and three different surface positions on a transversal line perpendicular
    to the plant line: underneath the irrigation/fertigation drip line (P1); in-row
    at 0.125 m distance from the drip line and immediately adjacent to a tomato plant
    (P2) and in-row at 0.25 m distance from the drip line close to the raised bed
    side, giving 12 unique sample locations (Fig. 1). After washing away the soil
    above a fine sieve, roots and organic debris were stored in plastic bags at 4
    °C until further cleaning. Samples were then placed in a glass bowl placed above
    a light plate and roots were handpicked and placed in Petri dishes. Root length
    density (RLD) for each soil core was then determined with Winrhizo (Régent Instrument
    Inc., Quebec City, Canada) software and hardware. The RLD surface maps were plotted
    in Surfer 8 (Golden Software Inc., Golden, CO, USA). Penetrometer resistance was
    measured in 0.05 m increments to a depth of 0.45 m using a hand-held digital cone
    penetrometer with a 30° conical probe and 12.8 mm diameter (Spectrum Technologies,
    Plainfield, IL, USA). Ten penetrometer measurements equidistant 0.08 m were taken
    across the bed on a transversal line perpendicular to the plant line. 2.3. Monitoring
    soil water and soil nitrate The volumetric water content of the top soil of the
    production beds was monitored by coupling time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes
    (CS-615, Campbell Scientific Inc. Logan, UT, USA) with a datalogger (CR-10X, Campbell
    Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA). Soil moisture probes were placed in the beds
    at two subsequent soil layers which recorded soil moisture values. The upper probe
    was inserted at an angle in order to capture soil moisture in the top 0.25 m of
    the profile at 0.05 m from the irrigation drip and the lower probe was inserted
    vertically below the upper probe recording soil moisture between 0.25 and 0.55
    m (Fig. 1). Soil samples were collected with a 0.05 m diameter soil auger every
    2 weeks in each plot 6 days after the previous fertigation event and 1 day prior
    to the following fertigation event. Composite samples were taken at the 0–0.3,
    0.3–0.6, and 0.6–0.9 m soil depths. The center of the auger was placed at 0.10
    m from the irrigation drip (Fig. 1). Collected soil samples were placed on ice
    and refrigerated until further analysis. A 10 g subsample was extracted with 50
    mL of 2 M KCl and filtered within 1 day of soil sampling. Soil core extracts were
    stored at −18 °C until nitrate and nitrite analyses were conducted. Samples were
    analysed using an air-segmented automated spectrophotometer (Flow Solution IV,
    OI Analytical, College Station, TX, USA) coupled with a Cd reduction approach
    (modified US EPA Method 353.2, Jones and Case, 1990). 2.4. Statistical analysis
    Statistical analyses were performed using PROC GLM procedure of SAS (SAS, 2002)
    to determine treatment effects for total plant biomass, fruit grade, yield and
    iWUE. When the F value was significant, a multiple means comparison was performed
    using Duncan Multiple Range Test at a P value of 0.05. For repeated measurements
    such as plant biomass N and P accumulation in 2005 and 2006, root length density,
    the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS with residual maximum likelihood estimation approach
    and least squares means of fixed effects were pair-wise compared. 3. Results and
    discussion 3.1. Soil water dynamics The crop establishment period was characterized
    by application of similar irrigation volume to all irrigation treatments (Fig.
    2). This period lasted 11, 14 and 13 DAT in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively
    and there were two fertigation events during the establishment period. Following
    this period, irrigation treatments were initiated. Each soil moisture sensor controller
    was programmed to bypass irrigation if the probe read soil moisture at or above
    the set threshold at the beginning of an irrigation window. During the crop season,
    programmed irrigation events were skipped which significantly reduced the amount
    of water applied to soil moisture sensor based treatments. The volume of irrigation
    increased in order SUR < SDI < TIME (Fig. 2). Calculated total ETc for each year
    was 194 mm for 2005, 198 mm for 2006 and 232 mm for 2007 (Fig. 2). Download :

    (ETc) after initial plant establishment as affected by different irrigation scheduling
    methods during the 2005, 2006, 2007 tomato growth season. The contribution of
    rainfall to crop water requirements was not considered in the calculations, due
    to the presence of plastic mulch and the absence of a perched water table while
    coarse sandy soils also typically demonstrate very limited lateral flow. Still
    it was observed that high intensity precipitation events (>8 mm h−1) increased
    the soil water content as measured by TDR. For example, precipitation events of
    44, 48 and 45 mm occurring in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively (Fig. 3D–F), showed
    a slight increase (around 1%) in volumetric soil water content in the 0–25 cm
    depth layer (data not shown). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Minimum,
    maximum, average daily temperatures and cumulative daily growing degree days (GDD,
    temperature base of 10 °C), daily and cumulative rainfall and daily and cumulative
    solar radiation during the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tomato-growing season. The SUR
    treatment received an average of 1.1, 2.6 and 2.9 mm day−1 of irrigation water
    in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Even with similar ETc between 2005 and 2006,
    SUR applied lower irrigation volume in 2005 compared to 2006, due to unfavorable
    growth conditions and disease occurrence which lowered the crop water requirements.
    This result was confirmed by the lower biomass accumulation in 2005 compared to
    2006 (Table 2). The corresponding average irrigation rates for the SDI treatment
    were 2.6, 3.8 and 4.6 mm day−1, for 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Use of
    SDI system resulted in higher water application, even though soil moisture content
    thresholds were the same for both the SUR and SDI treatments. The water savings
    for SDI compared to TIME treatments ranged from 7 to 29% (Fig. 2). These values
    are very low when compared to the potential water savings of SUR treatment (40–51%)
    achieved in 2006 and 2007. Higher water application for SDI may be attributed
    to the position of the soil moisture probe with respect to the irrigation line.
    The irrigation drip line for this treatment was buried at a depth of 15 cm under
    the surface. The probe was however positioned the same as SUR so that it averaged
    the soil moisture from the surface down to a depth of 20 cm. Due to the lower
    placement of the drip tape the top 15 cm of soil would be relatively dry due since
    capillary rise in sandy soils is limited and therefore fewer irrigation events
    were bypassed due to high soil moisture readings. The soil moisture content as
    measured by TDR probes had a noticeable increase in soil moisture after each irrigation
    event throughout the growing season for SUR and TIME (Fig. 4A–I). However, due
    to the TDR position (0–25 cm) in relation to the irrigation drip position (15
    cm below surface) for the SDI treatment, variations in soil moisture during each
    irrigation event were not as distinct as for the other treatments. Soil moisture
    sensor based irrigation treatments irrigated for short periods of time which resulted
    in a relatively small increase in soil moisture, consequently decreasing the volume
    of percolate. This was true for both the SUR and SDI treatment, which received
    a higher volume of water than SUR (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the TIME treatment
    was irrigated for a longer time period which resulted in very pronounced soil
    moisture fluctuations (Fig. 4G–I). These spikes in soil moisture were only temporary,
    as excess soil moisture that rapidly drained in this sandy soil. Soil moisture
    content returned to field capacity within 12 h. The spikes also indicate that
    the soil water content as measured by the TDR probes rapidly reaches a point above
    the soil water holding capacity in the soil upper layer, inducing percolation
    to deeper soil layers, and explaining the higher percolate values for the TIME
    treatment compared to the other treatments (Fig. 4A–F). In fact, similar spikes
    in soil water content were observed at 25–55 cm showing appreciable soil water
    percolation though the soil profile throughout the entire production cycle (Fig.
    4G–I). In terms of soil water availability to plants, the TIME treatment initially
    may provide more favorable growth conditions since the soil remains wetter, thus
    reducing potential water stress. However, excessive water percolation also may
    reducing N retention and crop N supply and thereby reduce yield for tomato (Table
    2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Daily irrigation events and volumetric
    soil water content (0–25 and 25–55 cm depth) for tomato during three crop development
    stages (vegetative growth, 2nd bloom and harvesting period) during the spring
    of 2006 for SDI (A–C), SUR (D–F), and TIME (G–I) treatment. The arrows indicate
    fertigation events. By comparison, irrigation water from the SUR and SDI treatments
    produced relatively constant soil moisture values over time, as irrigation water
    was distributed across multiple irrigation events according to the soil moisture
    threshold and thus crop water demand. In addition, almost no spikes in soil moisture
    were registered by TDR probes at 25–55 cm soil depth layer, indicating that the
    volume of water applied at the soil surface did not exceed root water extraction.
    Vazquez et al. (2006) compared high and low irrigation frequencies for tomato
    crop and concluded that high irrigation frequency (8 events of 15 min day−1) increased
    water use efficiency and resulted in almost no leaching. 3.2. Plant growth, yield
    and irrigation water use efficiency There were no interactions between irrigation
    and N-rate treatments for yield, biomass accumulation or irrigation water use
    efficiency, but irrigation treatments had an important impact on iWUE and tomato
    yield (Table 1). The use of soil moisture sensors increased marketable tomato
    yield 69–80% in 2005; 20–26% in 2006 and 11–21% in 2007 when compared to the TIME
    treatment (Table 2). There was no significant difference on tomato marketable
    yield for SDI and SUR treatments, averaging 32 Mg ha−1 in 2005 and 59 Mg ha−1
    and in 2006. However, in 2007, SUR treatments out-yielded SDI treatments (85.7
    Mg ha−1 vs. 78.9 Mg ha−1). Except in 2005, when unfavorable growth conditions
    hampered plant growth, tomato yield obtained in these experiments were in the
    range of those reported in the literature for sandy soils in Florida (Doss et
    al., 1975, Everett, 1978, Rhoads et al., 1988, Rhoads et al., 1996, Scholberg
    et al., 2000b). The increase in tomato yield in 2006 and 2007 compared to 2005
    was attributed to several factors. First, the overall volume of irrigation applied
    was higher in the two last years compared to 2005, allowing for more water uptake.
    Also higher temperatures and the occurrence of disease in 2005, increased stress
    on the crop. Appreciable differences in temperature, rainfall and solar radiation
    were registered in each of the 3 years of experiment. The spring of 2005 was characterized
    by wetter and hotter season compared to the subsequent seasons which interfered
    with effective disease control and also resulted in premature blooming. The cumulative
    rainfall at the final harvest was 472, 357 and 323 mm for 2005, 2006 and 2007,
    respectively (Fig. 3). The cumulative precipitation during May of 2005 in the
    experimental site was 111 mm, which was around 20% higher than the historical
    29-year average (NOAA, 2007) and about 40% higher compared to 2006 and 2007. The
    exceptional high rain intensity and wetter condition in 2005 promoted favorable
    condition to appearance of bacterial spot disease (Xanthomonascampestris) at beginning
    of the crop season. Frequent applications of fungicide were used to prevent disease
    spread but warm and wet conditions hampered complete disease suppression. During
    2006 and 2007, favorable weather conditions characterized by lower temperatures,
    humidity, and precipitation occurred during the reproductive phase (Fig. 3) resulting
    in low disease pressure. During the reproductive and harvest period (after 41
    DAT), the average maximum temperatures were 29.6, 28.1 and 27.0 °C for 2005, 2006
    and 2007, respectively. The number of days with temperatures above 28 °C (which
    adversely affects fruit production) was also greatest in 2005, followed by 2006
    then 2007. Significant decreases in fruit weight and number was observed by Peet
    et al. (1997) when daily mean temperatures increased from 25 to 29 °C attributed
    to ovule development and post-pollen production processes. A similar trend was
    observed during this experiment as tomato yield and dry biomass increased when
    cooler temperatures occurred. The percentage of culls also decreased under cooler
    temperatures (total yield minus marketable yield, Table 2). Another effect of
    temperature was reflected in the duration of the crop cycle, which in 2007 was
    4–6 days longer than 2005 or 2006. Differences in tomato yield also can be attributed
    to substantial differences in solar radiation during the three crop seasons. The
    cumulative solar radiation measured was 1606, 1699 and 2022 MJ m−2 for 2005, 2006
    and 2007, respectively (Fig. 3G–I). During the period between the end of May and
    beginning of June in 2005 and 2006, there was a reduction in solar radiation availability
    due to elevated number of cloudy/rainy days. In 2007, there was a reduced number
    of rain events, resulting in higher solar radiation availability than 2005 and
    2006. Moreover, due to unfavorable growth conditions crop canopies in 2005 were
    sparser and plant height was also lower, thus also reducing radiation interception
    as well, which results in reduced potential production (Scholberg et al., 2000a).
    In fact, the association of all stress factors cited above indicated that the
    plants were not transpiring at maximum levels which resulted in water application
    lower than the ETc for SUR treatment in 2005 (Fig. 2). Table 1. Analysis of variance

    There was no significant effect (P ≤ 0.05) of N-rates on tomato yield. Above ground
    biomass at the end of the crop cycle was significantly (P ≤ 0.05) greater for
    soil moisture sensor treatments compared to the TIME treatment. Shoot biomass
    accumulation for TIME ranged between 1.28 and 1.61 Mg ha−1, which was significantly
    (P ≤ 0.05) lower than SMS-based treatments in 2005 and 2006. However, in 2007
    the shoot biomass accumulation also differed between SMS-based treatments as well
    (Table 2). The maximum daily biomass accumulation rate was 148, 151 and 119 kg
    of dry matter per accumulated degree day, for SDI, SUR and TIME, respectively
    (data not shown). For the TIME treatment, the peak in dry matter accumulation
    occurred at 50 DAT, corresponding to 10 and 14 days earlier than SDI and SUR.
    Higher rates of biomass accumulation for SMS-based treatments may be associated
    to the higher nitrate availability in the soil profile (Zotarelli et al., 2008).
    The use of different drip position arrangements significantly affected the iWUE
    and yield (Table 2). The treatment ranking for iWUE was as follows: SUR > SDI
    > TIME. The TIME treatment had a lowest iWUE values (8.7–18.4 kg m−3) due to the
    high irrigation rates applied, and also due to the lower marketable yield (Table
    2). In this case, two relevant aspects played an important role in the iWUE results.
    First the use of SMS allowed application of water in five possible irrigation
    events per day (low volume and high frequency), while TIME treatment had a single
    irrigation event (high volume and low frequency), which promotes excessive water
    percolation due to the very limited soil water holding capacity of the sandy soil
    (Fig. 4). 3.3. Root length density distribution The values of RLD observed in
    2006 revealed different rooting patterns among irrigation treatments, but consistently
    larger concentrations of roots found in the upper soil layers. There were interactive
    effects between the date of sampling, irrigation treatment, sampling position
    and depth (Table 3). During the reproductive phase (66 DAT), about 51–78% of root
    length density was found between 0 and 15 cm of the soil profile. Below 15 cm,
    the root length density decreased greatly with 15–28% being present at 15–30 cm;
    5–11% at 30–60 cm soil depth; and 4–10% at the lowest (60–90 cm) soil layer (Table
    4). In addition to crop specific root distribution pattern dynamics, differences
    in soil bulk density provide some explanation of tomato root proliferation in
    the soil profile. The lower bulk density (1.45 g cm−3) of the upper soil layer
    (0–30 cm) due to the soil cultivation during the raised bed formation and slightly
    higher content of soil organic matter, soil moisture and nutrients may promote
    root growth. Conversely, lower soil layers (below 30 cm) which had bulk density
    of 1.7 g cm−3, certainly created some impedance to root growth. In fact, soil
    resistance measured with a cone penetrometer in the upper soil layer (0–20 cm)
    ranged between 0 and 0.1 MPa (data not shown). Soil resistance increased with
    depth. In the 20–30 cm depth layer, the resistance increased in depth from 0.1
    to 0.5 MPa and in the 30–50 cm depth, the soil resistance also increased with
    depth from 0.5 to 3.0 MPa (data not shown). Table 3. Significance of date, irrigation,

    irrigation. Considering the equivalent impact of bulk densities across irrigation
    treatments, the three-way interaction between sampling position across the bed,
    irrigation treatment and sampling depth implies that the use of SDI systems increased
    the RLD in the upper soil layer after 45 DAT compared to the SUR and TIME treatments
    (Table 3 and Fig. 5). Root length density decreased exponentially with soil depth
    and at greater soil depths it was similar for all irrigation treatments (Bryla
    et al., 2003, Machado and Oliveira, 2005). However, based on the visual presentation
    in Fig. 5, it appears that there was a tendency for TIME treatments to have greater
    root concentrations at greater soil depth, whereas the SMS-based systems root
    length densities > 0.25 cm cm−3 was clearly confined to the upper 20–30 cm of
    the soil profile. Higher root colonization at greater soil depth for TIME seems
    to mimic wetting and leaching patterns observed with this treatment and may be
    related to higher nitrate availability (Bloom et al., 2003) below 60 cm due to
    the higher nitrate leaching (Zotarelli et al., 2008). Download : Download full-size

    and distance to the bed center at 24, 45 and 66 days after transplanting (DAT).
    Note that darker shades indicate higher root densities. Across all positions and
    depths, the total RLD increased significantly from 24 to 66 DAT for all irrigation
    treatments. While there were no statistical differences between TIME and SUR,
    at 45 and 66 DAT, SDI showed 48–54% higher RLD than SUR and TIME, respectively.
    Root length density significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased in the position P1 (underneath
    the drip irrigation/fertigation) and P2 (0.125 m from drip and adjacent to the
    tomato plant) from 24 to 66 DAT. No similar pattern was observed in the position
    P3 (0.25 m distance from the drip line). Independent of the sampling date, there
    was a 41% reduction in RLD from P1 to P2 and 70% from P1 to P3 (Table 5). In general,
    the SDI treatment showed a wider distribution of roots across the bed. The RLD
    at P2 and P3 in this particular depth layer for SDI was significantly (P ≤ 0.05)
    higher than SUR and TIME. Table 5. Root length density (cm cm−3) by interactions

    soil moisture sensor; SUR: surface drip irrigation controlled by soil moisture
    sensor; TIME: time-fixed irrigation. The root distribution patterns showed that
    independently of the irrigation treatment, the RLD concentrated preferentially
    around the fertigation emitters. These results are in agreement with Machado et
    al. (2003) and Oliveira et al. (1996), which irrigation and fertigation were applied
    through the same drip tape at different depths. At 66 DAT, the RLD at P1 for SDI
    treatment at 0–15 cm reached 10.5 ± 3.9 cm cm−3 compared to 2.6 ± 1.7 and 2.5
    ± 0.9 cm cm−3 for SUR and TIME, respectively. At the same sampling position in
    the 15–30 cm depth layer, RLD decreased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) for SUR (0.6
    cm cm−3) and SDI (0.4 cm cm−3) treatments compared to TIME (1.1 cm cm−3). Between
    30 and 90 cm depth, RLD values were <0.2 cm cm−3 for SDI and SUR, however, RLD
    for TIME was significantly higher 0.7 and 0.9 cm cm−3 for 30–60 and 60–90 cm depth
    layer, respectively. There were no differences in RLD across irrigation treatments
    for 30–60 and 60–90 cm depth layer and the values ranged between 0.07 and 0.36
    cm cm−3. The combination of reduced irrigation rate and drip irrigation position
    in the SDI treatment directly affected the soil water movement dynamics, and increased
    the residual soil nitrate concentration in the 0–0.3 m depth layer. Average soil
    nitrate concentration at 74 DAT (6 days after the fertigation event) for SDI was
    32 mg of N-NO3− kg−1 of soil, while respective values for SUR and TIME were 12
    and 2 mg of N-NO3− kg−1 of soil in the 0–30 cm depth. In the 30–60 cm depth, TIME
    showed the lowest value of nitrate concentration (1.5 mg kg−1), followed by SDI
    (7 mg kg−1) and SUR (10 mg kg−1). The frequent application of small volumes of
    water tended to result in the wetting front being closer to the surface and center
    and thereby also in a reduction of N displacement/leaching. As a result, this
    greatly enhanced root proliferation in the moist and N enriched zone close to
    the surface. Therefore root length densities were relatively high compared to
    systems where the wetting volume and displacement depth is much greater. Low frequency
    high volume irrigation systems tended to induce dilution and/or displacement of
    N-fertilizer in TIME treatment, which resulted in higher root proliferation (Bloom,
    1997) below 0.3 m at the bed center underneath the fertigation drip compared to
    root density values observed for SDI and SUR. However, the total RLD for SUR and
    TIME was similar (Fig. 5). Relatively high root concentrations at greater soil
    depths for TIME did not result in relative yield benefits. In contrast, despite
    that roots may have proliferated at greater soil depth, the overall resource utilization
    may have been reduced for the TIME treatment. For the SMS-based treatments both
    water and nutrient retention near the surface appears to mimic the genetic tendency
    of the crop to form, especially during initial growth, most of its roots near
    the surface. The increase in root density for SUR and SDI, could not overcome
    the much faster displacement of labile nutrients and thus did not result in additional
    yield or biomass accumulation benefits. In the case of TIME leaching was often
    very intense (Fig. 4) resulting in soil N values invariably low despite high N
    application rates. 4. Conclusions Soil-moisture sensor based irrigation systems
    in tomato significantly reduced the applied irrigation on tomato, with the surface
    drip irrigation controlled by soil moisture sensor treatment resulting in 15–51%
    less irrigation water applied compared to fixed time irrigation (TIME) treatments.
    Corresponding reductions in irrigation water application for subsurface drip irrigation
    controlled by soil moisture sensor were 7–29%. However, due to the soil moisture
    sensor positioning as related to the location of the irrigation drip, higher irrigation
    water application occurred. Tomato yield was also increased 11–26% for SMS-based
    treatments compared to the TIME treatment, in 2006 and 2007, when weather was
    not a yield-limiting factor. Tomato roots were most concentrated in the vicinity
    of the irrigation/fertigation drip line and significantly higher concentration
    of roots were found in the upper 15 cm for the SDI treatment, which may be related
    to lower nitrogen leaching in the soil profile. Use of N application rates above
    176 kg ha−1 of N did not result in yield benefits. It is concluded that appropriate
    use of SDI and/or sensor-based irrigation systems can allow growers to sustain
    profitable yield while reducing irrigation application in low water holding capacity
    soils. Acknowledgements Research supported by Florida Department of Agricultural

    • Our studies investigated options and difficulties to improve water-efficient
    practices. • Technological improvements have not brought full benefits through
    water efficiency. • Farmers lack adequate means to know current on-farm water-efficiency
    levels. • Farmers have weak incentives to make extra efforts for more efficient
    practices. • A knowledge-exchange system is necessary so that stakeholders can
    share responsibility. Abstract Innovative irrigation practices can enhance water
    efficiency, gaining an economic advantage while also reducing environmental burdens.
    In some cases the necessary knowledge has been provided by extension services,
    helping farmers to adapt and implement viable solutions, thus gaining more benefits
    from irrigation technology. Often investment in technological improvements has
    incurred higher water prices, however, without gaining the full potential benefits
    through water efficiency. Farmers generally lack adequate means and incentives
    to know crops’ water use, actual irrigation applications, crops’ yield response
    to different water management practices, and thus current on-farm water-efficiency
    levels. Those general difficulties are illustrated by our two case studies investigating
    options, stimuli and difficulties to improve water-efficient practices. The two
    areas have strong stimuli for improvement but lack a knowledge-exchange system
    to help farmers and resource managers identify scope for improvements. Partly
    for this reason, farmers’ responsibility for efficient water management has been
    displaced to hypothetical prospects, e.g. extra supplies from reuse of treated
    wastewater or a long-term low water pricing. In both cases a displaced responsibility
    complements the default assumption that farmers’ irrigation practices already
    have adequate water-use efficiency. Under current circumstances, agricultural
    water management will maintain the unknown water-efficiency level and farmers
    will have weaker incentives to make efforts for more efficient practices. A continuous
    knowledge-exchange is necessary so that all relevant stakeholders can share greater
    responsibility across the entire water-supply chain. On this basis, more water-efficient
    management could combine wider environmental benefits with economic advantage
    for farmers. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Innovative

    system 1. Introduction Irrigation systems have been under pressure to produce
    more with lower supplies of water. Various innovative practices can gain an economic
    advantage while also reducing environmental burdens such as water abstraction,
    energy use, pollutants, etc. (Faurès and Svendsen, 2007). Farmers can better use
    technological systems already installed, adopt extra technologies, enhance their
    skills in soil and water management, tailor cropping patterns to lower water demand
    and usage, reduce agrochemical inputs, etc. Water-efficient practices potentially
    enhance the economic viability and environmental sustainability of irrigated agriculture,
    without necessarily reducing water usage. To inform such practices, experts have
    developed various models of water efficiency, yet these are little used by farmers.
    Through two case studies in the EU context, this paper will address the following
    questions: • When an irrigation area invests in innovative technology, how can
    its operation help farmers to achieve the full potential benefits together, e.g.
    an economic advantage, greater water-use efficiency and lower resource burdens?
    • Why are innovative technologies often applied in ways which miss the full potential
    benefits? • What tensions arise among various objectives and potential benefits?
    • How can these difficulties be addressed? The paper first surveys analytical
    perspectives on irrigation efficiency – especially the means, incentives and limitations
    – as a basis to analyse two cases and draw general conclusions. 2. Innovative
    irrigation practices: Analytical perspectives Innovative irrigation technology
    is generally promoted as raising water-use efficiency along with multiple benefits,
    but these remain elusive in practice, as outlined in the first sub-section below.
    The limitations have fundamental reasons, as outlined in Section 2.2. To address
    these issues, our case studies are introduced in Section 2.3. 2.1. Practical limitations
    of water-efficient irrigation technology EU policy frameworks place great expectations
    upon technologies to improve water efficiency. The European Commission emphasises
    ‘technological innovation in the field of water, given that water efficiency will
    be an increasingly important factor for competitiveness’ (CEC, 2008). According
    to the European Parliament, solutions should be found in ‘clean technologies that
    facilitate the efficient use of water’ (EP, 2008). Such technological expectations
    arise in expert reports on agricultural water use: Water-efficient irrigation,
    irrigation on demand and irrigation using brackish water are technologies that
    will enable the better husbandry of more scarce freshwater resources. Technological
    developments in respect of irrigation will encompass sensors and communication,
    intelligent watering systems and high-efficiency delivery mechanisms for water
    and nutrients, as well as the means of incorporating all of these elements into
    irrigation ‘packages’ (EIO, 2011: 25). Likewise water efficiency can be enhanced
    by better using current installations and/or by adopting new equipment (WssTP,
    2012: 9). The main European farmers’ organisation has likewise advocated technological
    means to increase water efficiency. In particular this needs ‘investments in more
    efficient irrigation systems, use of new technologies (e.g. soil moisture and
    canopy sensors) to better match irrigation with plant needs, and good agricultural
    practices’, such as conservation tillage, management of soil fertility and water
    retention capacity, and scheduling of irrigation during night to reduce evaporation
    (COPA-COGECA, 2007: 4). The basis for improvement is described as follows: … water
    efficiency measures that provide complementary benefits, such as reduced energy
    needs or other environmental benefits, will also deliver better results. In many
    Member States, efforts are being made to increase the water storage capacity of
    soil under agricultural land use. The modernisation of irrigation systems has
    steadily progressed and water productivity has also improved considerably (COPA-COGECA,
    2013: 3) As indicated above, greater water-use efficiency depends on better agricultural
    practices alongside extra technology. Yet companies generally promote irrigation
    technology as if it inherently brings all the benefits (interview, COPA-COGECA,
    08.07.13). Improperly managed ‘hi-tech’ systems can be as wasteful and unproductive
    as poorly managed traditional systems (Perry et al., 2009). When incorrectly applied,
    irrigation technology ‘can cause losses arising on investments made by farmers,
    thus decreasing the economic water productivity index and the overall sustainability’
    (Battilani, 2012). Beyond a problem-diagnosis of inefficiency, moreover, intensive
    farming practices can degrade soil and water resources, especially through more
    input-intensive farming in crops such as maize, vegetables, orchard and vine cultivation:
    Intensive arable production is partly responsible for poor soil structure, soil
    erosion, loss of soil OM [organic matter] and pollution from fertilisers and pesticides….
    The expansion of maize cropping and the move to growing winter cereals in particular
    have contributed to soil erosion even further (Miller, 2007: 44–45). Such harmful
    practices have been driven and supported by EU policies. In past decades CAP subsidies
    have tended to favour crops with high water demands, such as maize, thus increasing
    the risk of water shortages under climate-uncertain conditions (Garcia-Vila and
    Fereres, 2012). Either as price-support or area-based, CAP subsidies likewise
    have ensured the profitability of some water-intensive crops such as cotton which
    otherwise would be phased out under a market-orientated scenario; likewise water-price
    subsidies. In some cases, water-price increases have induced farmers to adopt
    technology and appropriate practices for conserving water (Caswell and Zilberman,
    1985). Yet water-pricing policies often have been ineffective means to reduce
    water demand (Molle and Berkoff, 2007, Molle, 2008). Farmers experience rising
    water prices as an extra penalty. Rather than higher water prices, administrative
    water allocation or re-allocation lowering the supply often has led farmers to
    adopt water-efficiency practices (Molden et al., 2010). If agricultural water
    demand is inelastic, then policies which encourage changes in cropping patterns
    can be more effective than higher prices (Fraiture and Perry, 2007, Iglesias and
    Blanco, 2008, Kampas, 2012). Inelastic water demand results from farmers’ perspectives
    on water benefits. Water-use efficiency (WUE) and water productivity (WP) are
    often used interchangeably but have different meanings. WUE specifically means
    the ratio of biomass produced per unit of irrigation water used, i.e. the sum
    of transpiration by the crop and evaporation from the soil (Sinclair et al., 1984).
    By contrast, WP means the ratio of above-ground biomass per unit of water transpired
    by the crop (Steduto, 2007). Both terms have relevance to farmers’ economic goals.
    WUE interests mainly the water districts or management agencies, while WP interests
    more farmers and research community. WP better speaks to perspectives linking
    water usage with production levels and economic benefit (interview, COPA-COGECA,
    08.07.13). Yet even WP remains distant from farmers’ perspectives. They generally
    perceive ‘irrigation efficiency’ as maximising net revenue rather than saving
    water (Knox et al., 2012). Policies seek to lower water usage, and river basin
    managers try to allocate limited supplies, yet water-saving is not a priority
    for most farmers (Luquet et al., 2005). They manage labour and other inputs to
    get better economic gains (Molden et al., 2010). Towards that economic aim, most
    growers make irrigation decisions by relying on subjective judgements, based only
    on their practical experience and observation (Knox et al., 2012). Consequently,
    there have been limited benefits from irrigation technology, as well documented
    in the technical literature; the following examples compare various techniques.
    For example, mobile-laboratory evaluations compared the distribution uniformity
    and irrigation efficiency of various irrigation systems in California. Although
    microirrigation systems are seen as ‘efficient technologies’, they were performing
    less well than traditional surface irrigation methods such as furrows and borders.
    To gain the extra benefits of such technology, most important is adequate system
    design, alongside proper installation, operation and maintenance, regardless of
    the irrigation method used (Hanson et al., 1995). Howell (2003) and Irmak et al.
    (2011) reported the attainable application efficiencies for different irrigation
    methods, assuming irrigations are applied to meet the crops’ water needs. Microirrigation
    has the potential to achieve the highest uniformity (90%) in water applied to
    each plant, yet poor uniformity and application efficiency can result from various
    causes, e.g., inadequate maintenance, low inlet pressure or pressure fluctuations,
    emitter clogging and inadequate system design (Hsiao et al., 2007). Consequently,
    microirrigation technology has on-farm efficiencies varying from 0.7 to 0.95 (Howell,
    2003). As another example, a Spanish study compared various irrigation methods
    via the annual relative irrigation supply index (ARIS), i.e. a ratio of water
    applied versus water required. It found a greater efficiency of solid-set and
    drip than surface irrigation. But average annual figures conceal great variations
    in water applied to a given crop and irrigation efficiency at farm level, partly
    for lack of adequate knowledge. A remedy would be ‘actions to improve farmers’
    water management via a combination of irrigation advisory services and policy
    measures’ (Salvador et al., 2011: 586). 2.2. Reasons for those limitations and
    ways to overcome them Given the above water-efficiency limitations in applying
    irrigation technology, the literature has outlined some fundamental reasons. They
    include the following: irrigation equipment is promoted as if the technology per
    se brings various benefits, farmers seek to maximise net income rather than water
    productivity per se, innovative technologies can achieve the full potential benefits
    only through appropriate technical advice, and farmers lack a knowledge-system
    for anticipating effects of specific irrigation practices or for retrospectively
    evaluating their irrigation efficiency. Although research has developed technical
    scheduling procedures to improve agricultural water management, these have been
    little adopted, for many reasons. The one most frequently mentioned by growers
    is the lack of perceived [financial] benefits relative to their current practices,
    which they consider adequate. Ease of use and the expenses involved are also important
    grower considerations (FAO, 2012). Technical advice on irrigation scheduling is
    little used at farm level; at most, it helps retrospectively to evaluate seasonal
    approaches (ibid.). One obstacle is inadequate knowledge about proper irrigation
    levels and scheduling over a growing season. Farmers generally lack adequate assistance
    to develop and adopt better approaches for environmental sustainability, while
    also maintaining their financial and social objectives (Pereira et al., 2012:
    39). For example, sub-surface moisture sensors can improve knowledge about a crop''s
    need for water. But the technology has limitations, so farmers need technical
    advice to interpret the measurements; for example, ‘soil humidity sensors are
    still neither easy to handle nor reliable’ (WssTP, 2012: 33). Moreover, these
    sensors are not well adapted to all soil types; their installation and maintenance
    requires the employment of specialised technical staff. The same is true for the
    canopy sensors, whose proper application is limited to some crops and during specific
    growing stages, periods of day and climatic conditions. Improvements in irrigation
    practices depend on quantitative knowledge of farmers’ current practices in relation
    to actual and potential crop water use: Any effort to improve water use efficiency
    needs to start with the assessment of the actual and attainable efficiencies for
    the given situation, as quantitatively as possible. This information is fundamental
    for making rational improvements aiming at raising the overall efficiency to the
    attainable level (Hsiao et al., 2007: 228, 218). But such information is rarely
    available to farmers. Such difficulties arise for water-management improvements
    through expert systems. Decision Support Systems (DSS) have aimed to improve crop
    water use efficiency at farm and water basin scale, but few are widely applied,
    given the necessary specialised skills. For a DSS to be successful, the key elements
    have been: giving farmers a simple, timely, user friendly, free-of-charge, informative
    system helpful to decide how much to irrigate in everyday practice; tailoring
    the tools for a large number of crops; calculating the irrigation profitability;
    and assessing the economic benefit, especially its relevance to the next irrigation.
    Such benefits have been demonstrated by the Irrinet project in Italy''s Emilia
    Romagna (Battilani, 2012). Thus more reliable information systems and expert capacity
    are necessary to guide farmers in using water more efficiently (Battilani, 2013).
    This exemplifies the broader need for farmer training and education in order to
    improve modern irrigation management. As a way forward in the UK, expert support
    has been recently linking farmers’ responsibility, economic benefits and practical
    knowledge. A ‘pathway to efficiency’ improves the irrigation network, alongside
    better practices of soil and water management, e.g. by monitoring whether the
    right amounts are used at the right place and time. ‘Using financial criteria
    for water efficiency rather than an engineering one appears a sensible approach
    when assessing irrigation performance at the farm level, since any managerial
    (e.g. scheduling) and operational (e.g. equipment) inefficiencies associated with
    irrigation are implicitly included in the assessment’ (Knox et al., 2012: 3).
    In particular, ‘On-farm water auditing and benchmarking have the potential to
    provide useful information to farmer decision making, with respect to identifying
    operational and management changes to improve irrigation system performance and
    water productivity, and evaluating potential investments in new technology (and
    advanced practices) or infrastructures’ (ibid: 7). Such approaches have addressed
    various obstacles to water-efficiency measures. To exploit the full technological
    potential requires a broader dissemination of their benefits, specific training
    of farmers, and coupling properly-designed technological solutions with more precise
    operational practices to benefit farm economic performance (e.g. Tollefson and
    Wahab, 1994). In particular, advisory-extension services have enhanced irrigation
    practices which better fulfil potential benefits of irrigation technology (Hergert
    et al., 1994, Benham et al., 2000, Ahearn et al., 2003, Genius et al., 2014, Parker
    et al., 2000, Gold et al., 2013). Beyond the farm level, greater resource efficiency
    also depends on shared responsibility among stakeholders, according to the World
    Business Council for Sustainable Development: Business undoubtedly has many opportunities
    to increase its eco-efficient performance and thereby to help de-couple use of
    nature from overall economic growth… Establishing framework conditions which foster
    innovation and transparency and which allow sharing responsibility among stakeholders
    will amplify eco-efficiency for the entire economy and deliver progress toward
    sustainability (WBCSD, 2000: 6–7). Analogous issues arise for service-oriented
    irrigation schemes, designed so that farmers can flexibly obtain water at their
    convenience, e.g. through on-demand delivery schedules. Here responsibility has
    institutional complexities. For example, a water users’ organisation (WUO) bears
    largely fixed costs, as well as somewhat variable energy costs from drainage,
    excess water application, reuse, disposal, etc. If a WUO or water district relies
    on gravity-fed water conveyance and delivery systems, then its costs do not vary
    according to water-volume delivery. In such contexts, if farmers decrease water
    use, then the WUO must increase water prices to recover its fixed costs. Facing
    higher water prices, farmers may increase groundwater pumping, thus abstracting
    more water from aquifers, while distancing their individual practices from any
    group responsibility. Paradoxically, fostering greater water-use efficiency can
    generate a financial, environmental and institutional problem. Given those difficulties
    for water-efficient techniques, their effective adoption depends on several enabling
    conditions, especially a policy and institutional context aligning incentives
    of producers, resource managers and society. Significant synergistic effects can
    emerge when water-efficiency practices are combined with other agronomic practices
    such as maintaining soil health and fertility, controlling weeds and avoiding
    diseases (Molden et al., 2010). 2.3. Methods and sources: EcoWater project The
    above issues and earlier questions have been explored through two case studies
    of service-oriented irrigation schemes within a larger EU-funded research project,
    EcoWater (see Acknowledgements). It develops a methodology for assessing eco-efficiency
    at the meso level. The latter is defined as interactions among heterogeneous actors,
    e.g. between water-service users and providers. As generally understood, eco-efficiency
    means a ratio between economic advantage and resource burdens, as a basis to evaluate
    past or potential changes in a system. The project uses eco-efficiency indicators
    to evaluate potential innovative practices including technology adoption. The
    project aims to: assess various options for innovative practices within a specific
    system; analyse the factors influencing decisions to adopt such practices; and
    improve understanding of the socio-technical dynamics that influence such decisions.
    In the project''s two agricultural case studies, farmers and/or their organisations
    have already invested in water-efficient technology, going beyond state subsidy
    alone. The irrigation distribution systems were designed for on-demand water delivery.
    SCADA technology at hydrants allow farmers to abstract water on demand any time
    and charges them according to a volumetric tiered water pricing. Each case-study
    area has strong stimuli for farmers to improve water efficiency, yet the full
    potential benefits of the technology investment were not being realised, for reasons
    analysed in the next two sections. 3. Sinistra Ofanto case Dating from the 1980s,
    the Sinistra Ofanto irrigation scheme is among the largest multi-cropped irrigated
    areas in Italy. It is located in south-eastern Foggia province within the Apulia
    region. Irrigation is crucial for the region''s agricultural production and income,
    but it also generates resource burdens. Nearly 18.5% of Apulia''s agricultural
    area is under irrigation; consequently, irrigated crops have contributed 69% of
    the total value of regional agricultural production, recently quantified as 3.8bn
    Euros (Fabiani, 2010). The entire study area is characterised by a high number
    of small land-holdings with intensive, market-oriented practices. The main crops
    are vineyards, olives, vegetables and fruit orchards (in descending order). The
    pedo-climatic conditions are favourable for intensive cropping, but profitable
    farming is strongly dependent on irrigation, due to the scant rainfall and its
    uneven distribution across the year. The Sinistra Ofanto system commands an area
    of 40,500 ha stretching along the left side of the Ofanto River, of which 38,815
    ha are irrigable lands and 28,165 ha are serviced with irrigation distribution.
    Designed and constructed for pressurised on-demand delivery schedule, the irrigation
    system is managed by a large water users’ organisation (WUO), the Consorzio per
    la Bonifica della Capitanata (CBC, 1984, Altieri, 1995). The system diverts water
    from the Ofanto River and supplies it to growers both by gravity and lifting/pumping,
    ensuring a pressure head of at least 2 bar at each hydrant to enable farmers using
    micro-irrigation methods. The system is already equipped with modern technologies
    to deliver and use water efficiently. From the diversion structure on the Ofanto
    River, water is conveyed to the Capacciotti reservoir through concrete-lined canals
    and pipe conduits, along which the flow regulation devices are downstream-controlled,
    thus manually or automatically adjusted through calibrated control devices enabling
    Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The Capacciotti reservoir, supplies
    seven concrete-lined storage and compensation reservoirs equipped with downstream-control
    flow regulation devices that adjust inflows and outflows to feed the district''s
    piped distribution networks based on the downstream water demand. PVC buried pipes
    comprise the open-branched distribution networks. Each sector''s inlet has a control
    unit, equipped with flow and pressure metering-control devices. Water is supplied
    to farms on demand by means of multi-users’ electronically-fed hydrants that control
    and regulate the deliveries, as well as the discharges demanded and thus flowing
    in the pipe distribution network. These technologies installed along the main
    infrastructure help keeping conveyance and distribution losses within 5–10% of
    the total water abstracted from the Ofanto River, as reported by the WUO''s engineering
    staff. Although the main water supply is surface water, during recurrent water
    shortages farmers pump groundwater from medium-depth (100–150 m) aquifers, especially
    since the late 1990s (Portoghese et al., 2013). Furthermore, studies found qualitative
    degradation of groundwater resources, most likely resulting from seawater intrusion
    into the coastal aquifer and to deep percolation of pollutants, such as fertilisers
    and pesticides, from intensive farming activities. Given the urgent need to assess
    these processes and to avoid their adverse environmental impacts, what are the
    prospects for water-efficiency improvements of irrigated agriculture in the Sinistra
    Ofanto area? 3.1. Irrigation patterns and resource burdens The water users organisation
    (WUO), Consorzio per la Bonifica della Capitanata (henceforth the CBC), is the
    main irrigation management agency. It is responsible for all the sequential steps
    along the agriculture water supply chain, i.e. abstraction, conveyance, storage,
    distribution and final water delivery to farm gates. Established in 1933 by a
    national law of public interest, the CBC is by statute a non-profit organisation;
    it bears all the costs for performing its functions, and these costs are recovered
    through the water tariffs paid by farmers. The CBC enforces the principle of solidarity
    among the different service areas. Even though the costs for supplying irrigation
    water differ significantly among areas supplied by gravity and by pumping, the
    tariff structure does not make such a distinction. Rather, as a tool to manage
    water use, water fees vary according to demand: volumetric tiered water tariffs
    progressively increase with the seasonal cumulative volumes withdrawn by each
    farmer. This structure is enforced through individual water metering at the delivery
    points; all farm hydrants are equipped with an electro-mechanical delivery device
    allowing the supply of water only to authorised users and storing information
    of each irrigation event. Besides simplifying the network operations, this technology
    proved to be very useful for accurate monitoring and control of water distribution,
    and for achieving better understanding of the irrigation management practices
    followed by farmers, especially through the possibility to retrieve and analyse
    historical data series (Zaccaria et al., 2013). As an irrigation service provider,
    the CBC is composed of irrigation service users, i.e. farmers. In performing its
    daily activities, the CBC attempts to reconcile objectives which may be in conflict.
    Its technical and administrative choices aim to achieve high water-distribution
    efficiency in order to maximise the economic benefit to farmers. It aims to improve
    water distribution and use—at the farm level, through an effective operation of
    the delivery network, and at field and crop level through the technical support
    to growers aiming at improved water management skills (ibid). Technical support
    to farmers was effective in the 1980s–1990s but has declined in the last decade,
    due to WUO budget constraints and lower revenues from Italy''s farm activities.
    Irrigation water demand is driven mainly by farmers’ perceptions, by the climatic
    conditions, and by the economic value of crop yields and production factors. Even
    beyond periods of water shortage, in some areas farmers pump groundwater in order
    to avoid the following problems: (i) the restricted-flow demand delivery-schedule
    that prevents the quick completion of irrigation cycles in medium-large farms,
    (ii) the restricted-frequency demand-delivery often imposed by the CBC during
    water shortage periods, (iii) the need to arrange water withdrawals with neighbour
    farmers supplied by the same hydrants, or (iv) the tiered water fees enforced
    by the CBC. Also, many farmers still perceive groundwater pumping as somewhat
    cheaper than water supplied by the CBC, even though the contrary was shown by
    economic analyses (e.g. Portoghese et al., 2013). As a more fundamental problem,
    both the farmers’ perception and the CBC''s analyses ignore the ecological costs
    of groundwater degradation and remediation. The CBC accepts no responsibility
    for water-management practices beyond the farm gate. From the growers’ standpoint,
    groundwater pumping aims to increase and/or stabilise the economic benefits of
    farming activities. Often farmers combine surface water and groundwater for various
    reasons such as to maximise crop yields and farm net benefit, or to minimise the
    seasonal water fees payable to the CBC, or to prevent yield reduction arising
    from high salinity in the groundwater during peak-demand periods. However, this
    conjunctive use of surface and groundwater is based solely on farmers’ economic
    and technical considerations, regardless of environmental burdens such as aquifer
    depletion and degradation. Furthermore, fields close to the river banks are often
    irrigated by growers with water pumped out the river. In all these situations,
    return flows may result from run-off through the drainage networks, as well as
    from percolation through the soil profile, finally reaching the downstream reaches
    of the river, wetlands or the aquifer. Farm activities generate various pressures
    on land and water resources, including quantitative depletion and qualitative
    degradation, especially biodiversity loss in farmland and in the natural environment.
    This harm has several sources: (i) intensive farming and tillage practices, (ii)
    fertilisers and pesticides application on cultivated fields, (iii) water abstraction
    from the Ofanto River, (iv) return flows of degraded water to downstream wetlands
    and aquifers, (v) over-drafting of groundwater, (vi) salinity build-up in cultivated
    soils, (vii) energy consumption for water pumping, and (viii) increased CO2 emissions
    from the energy usage related to pumping, transport, machinery, etc. Relative
    to those ecological problems, much greater impetus for innovative practices comes
    from recurrent scarcity of water supply and the prospect of even greater future
    scarcity and uncertainty. Those problems in turn result from high water-demanding
    crops and from irrigation scheduling practices. Such decisions are often based
    solely on farmers’ perceptions; their systems and practices are not monitored
    to assess the actual performance and efficiency achievements. No systematic technical
    support is available to growers for their daily or seasonal irrigation planning
    and scheduling. Moreover there is detailed evidence of water-use inefficiency
    at farm level. According to a study of farmers’ irrigation practices in a nearby
    irrigated area with similar features, there were often mis-matches between crops’
    water demand and irrigation applications on several occasions during the season.
    Although the overall seasonal applied irrigation depths may match a crop''s water
    demand, farmers often under-irrigate during the early crop stages and over-irrigate
    during later stages; many choose inadequate timings and application depths. Such
    inadequate applications may be combined with uneven in-field water distribution,
    often due to the average low uniformity of irrigation systems—especially when
    not properly designed, evaluated and maintained; consequently, the farm may have
    up to 20% lower crop yields and income, along with inefficiencies between 20 and
    40% due to excessive water applications (Zaccaria et al., 2010). As the main reason
    for the mismatch, irrigation scheduling practices are based only on farmers’ perceptions
    and experiences; missing is status monitoring of soil or plant water, use of ET-based
    irrigation scheduling, or any other quantitative techniques (ibid). This study
    confirms a general problem of water-inefficient practices, as also found in the
    wider technical literature (e.g. Hanson et al., 1995, Hanson et al., 1996, Burt,
    2004, Salvador et al., 2011; see Section 1). 3.2. Innovative practices for stakeholders’
    consideration Resource-efficiency could be enhanced by properly utilising several
    innovative technologies and practices. As listed in Table 1, several feasible
    options are already installed and implemented in the Sinistra Ofanto area, i.e.
    along the water conveyance and distribution system or on some progressive farms,
    but require either some refinements or significant operational improvements to
    gain their full economic and environmental benefits. Table 1. Technologies, impacts

    Better visualisation of benefits Technical support and extension Irrigation advisory
    service Investment costs for the installed technologies were paid by the WUO either
    from budget surpluses (in years when water demand and delivery were high), or
    by funds obtained from different sources, and by some individual farmers at the
    farm level. Their maintenance and operational costs are paid by growers within
    the regular water fees. The improved irrigation methods, systems and practices
    are implemented only to a small extent by some farmers. The first two technologies
    were recently installed along the distribution networks to ease operation and
    flow control, and thus increase its efficiency, but they still need further testing
    and tune-ups to fully exploit their potential. For example, multi-user hydrants
    could be hooked up with soil moisture sensors or plant–water status sensors to
    schedule irrigation applications on the basis of needed or user-defined thresholds
    and frequency. Also, they could be set to cease water withdrawals and irrigation
    when the pressure-head values at delivery are insufficient to achieve the target
    level of efficiency and distribution uniformity. Moreover, relevant datasets from
    the field (on irrigation timings, flow rates, pressure heads, volume and duration)
    could be automatically transmitted to a central WUO workstation, thus easing the
    data-gathering necessary for billing farmers, for evaluating the irrigation delivery
    service provided and growers’ irrigation scheduling practices. These further adjustments
    of the available technologies could also enable the performance evaluation and
    benchmarking of irrigation at on-farm and project level. As indicated by those
    examples, upgraded technologies alone do not ensure the anticipated resource-
    efficiency improvements. Compared to less technology-intensive systems, the past
    investments incur extra costs but bring uncertain gains. The full potential benefits
    depend on adequate management practices, in turn dependent on better expertise,
    skill-gap assessment, auditing monitoring and evaluation, control systems and
    extension programmes, including mission-oriented research and outreach. The above
    technology options (in Table 1) were presented at the EcoWater project workshop,
    held in the case study area and attended by diverse stakeholders involved in the
    Sinistra Ofanto water-system value chain. These included: the River Basin Authority,
    the WUO, the Apulia Regional Administration, the regional Department of Water
    Resources, the Ente Irrigazione, ARPA Puglia, CNR-IRSA (Water Research Institute),
    University of Bari, etc. Stakeholders, decision-makers and experts were asked
    to share their visions about water management in the area. The discussion identified
    several issues, emphasising the need for measures to protect groundwater. As many
    comments there highlighted, in the last three decades contradictory interests
    have generated conflicts over water allocation and use. Surface-water availability
    for agricultural use has been reduced by several factors: expansion of the command
    areas, incentivised partly by irrigation systems and by regional policies; greater
    water demands of the municipal, industrial and tourist sectors; and adverse environmental-climatic
    changes. Participants mentioned several solutions, in particular: monitoring and
    control of water use should be strengthened throughout the Apulia region, especially
    in the study area, in order to avoid aquifer over-exploitation and uncontrolled
    withdrawals from water courses; deficit irrigation management, already practiced
    in the study area by some innovative growers, offers a feasible option to enhance
    water-use efficiency and productivity; and, finally, farmers should share their
    personal experiences and knowledge in order to help others to use irrigation water
    in a sustainable and efficient way (reported in Ecowater, 2013). In addition,
    CBC (local WUO) representatives emphasised the importance of using non-conventional
    water sources as an additional supply, especially the re-use of treated wastewater
    (TWW) as a valid alternative to aquifer exploitation for irrigation purposes.
    TWW re-use has several barriers: stringent quality criteria set by regulations
    for water reuse in agriculture; the high cost of treatment and water conveyance
    from the treatment plants to agricultural areas; and inadequate research dissemination,
    even disinformation; and reluctance by farmers. Consequently, TWW re-use should
    be fostered by several means – lowering the water-quality restrictions, installing
    the latest technologies available on the market for wastewater treatment to reduce
    costs of treatment plants, and broadly disseminating research findings to growers,
    especially through extension activities and farmers’ advisers – according to the
    WUO representatives (reported in Ecowater, 2013). No stakeholder raised concerns
    about aquifer characterisation, safe-yield assessment, groundwater recharge or
    agrochemicals’ fate in soil and aquifers, or farm-level performance assessment
    of agricultural water management practices. As emerged during the stakeholder
    discussion, some future visions may be based on doubtful assumptions. In particular
    the CBC staff and farmers’ representatives assumed that Sinistra Ofanto farmers
    already achieve high irrigation and water-use efficiency, simply on grounds that
    they use microirrigation methods. From this assumption, there would be little
    scope or incentive to growers for further improvement in farm-level water management.
    From CBC technical reports over at least a decade, no recent information is available
    on whether the farm irrigation systems are properly designed, installed, operated
    and maintained—nor on whether irrigations are adequately scheduled and conducted
    by growers. Likewise the WUO has not recently fostered irrigation systems evaluations
    regarding the actual application efficiency and distribution uniformity achieved
    by growers, or WUE/WP for the various crops and irrigation methods, on the basis
    of quantitative measurements. Agricultural extension activities have been significantly
    limited in the last decade by budget constraints. So the CBC lacks an empirical
    basis for its efficiency assumptions about current performance of on-farm water
    management. In all those ways, the CBC''s practical responsibility ends at the
    farm gate. Moreover, responsibility for water-supply problems is displaced onto
    public-sector agencies, especially for additional water supplies via wastewater
    reuse. This option is simpler and perhaps more profitable for farmers and the
    CBC, especially if public bodies carry the main financial burden. Water reuse
    involves complex issues needing careful investigation and management, in particular:
    different water qualities may be required, contingent on the final water uses.
    Water that needs to be buffered or stored for seasonal reuse (e.g. groundwater
    banking or surface storage) may have other quality requirements than water used
    for a direct agricultural reuse. And there are potential risks to health and environment
    (WssTP, 2013: 19–20). 4. Monte Novo case In Portugal''s Alentejo the Monte Novo
    irrigation perimeter provides abundant water for a rising number of farmers, served
    by the larger Alqueva reservoir and irrigation project. Dating from 2009, the
    scheme set initially low water prices to incentivise irrigation by farmers—but
    without their involvement in discussing implications for crop choices, irrigation
    practices, farming profitability and expected income. The highly-discounted water
    price has incentivised crops with high water demands as well as agrochemical inputs,
    thus creating pollution problems. As mandated by law, the water price will rise
    significantly towards full-cost recovery by 2017, thus potentially stimulating
    practices which need less water. What are the prospects for water efficiency improvements?
    4.1. Irrigation patterns and future price rise Since the 1960s Portugal has had
    plans to irrigate relatively arid areas of the Alentejo, especially to increase
    employment and livelihoods. Spain''s 1993 National Hydrologic Plan was proposing
    to abstract more of the shared water from the adjoining region, partly on grounds
    that Portugal was not using the water, but Portugal objected. To avoid such trans-border
    conflicts, the 1998 Albufeira Convention aimed to protect freshwater and groundwater,
    as well as the sustainable use of shared water resources, in the context of the
    negotiation process for the Water Framework Directive (Maia, 2000, Pulwarty and
    Maia, 2013). Under the Convention, for example, Spain guarantees annual stream
    flows to Portugal in normal years (Costa, 2003). The Albufeira Convention facilitated
    Portugal''s Alqueva Multipurpose Project—the Empreendimento de Fins Múltiplos
    de Alqueva (EFMA). The EU Structural Funds were expected to pay more than half
    the investment cost (Vergés, 2001). The 1993 EFMA plan combined a reservoir, hydroelectric
    dam and irrigation networks, thereby helping to justify Portugal''s claim on the
    water. The project aimed to promote the development of a poor, deprived region
    through irrigated agriculture, electricity production and tourism. Together these
    were meant to ensure the sustainability of the project in its early phase (Santos
    et al., 2011). From the start the EFMA was criticised as a hydrodinosaur—for accepting
    engineers’ assumptions about future water needs, requiring enormous electricity
    to transport water and so raising the full cost (Costa, 2003). Before EFMA''s
    operation, maize production had greatly risen alongside greater dependence on
    CAP subsidies for economic viability. The Agriculture Minister hoped that the
    Alqueva would irrigate industrial crops such as tomato and sugar beet (Vergés,
    2001: 7). By using cheap water from the Alqueva dam, some Alentejo farmers were
    expecting to capture greater payments from the CAP 1st pillar. So they opposed
    mid-term reforms decoupling such payments from production levels; so did the Portuguese
    government (Costa, 2003: 26). According to its promoters, the Alqueva system will
    foster significant regional development in Alentejo, both in social and economic
    terms, due to the strategic water reserve and the associated hydraulic infrastructures.
    The main objective is to guarantee an adequate volume and quality of water to
    users, especially irrigation water. Further objectives include the energy hydropower
    production, urban water supply, ecological conservation and recreational uses
    (EDIA, 2011). With its geographical topography and high elevation, the Alqueva
    scheme was an expensive investment (Costa, 2003), especially relative to the small
    number of farmers who initially joined the scheme. This arrangement resulted in
    a high unit cost for the water supply. This has high political-economic stakes,
    given that full-cost recovery of irrigation systems is required by the Water Framework
    Directive (EC, 2000). Irrigation delivery service is provided by the public company
    EDIA (Empresa para o Desenvolvimento das Infraestruturas de Alqueva), the agency
    responsible for the Alqueva project development and exploitation. Water is abstracted
    from the Alqueva reservoir and transported through a network of canals and ducts,
    from primary network to secondary network through hydrants to farmers. Within
    the larger Alqueva project, the Monte Novo irrigation perimeter is located in
    Alentejo district, near Évora municipality. The perimeter provides water for irrigation
    to an area of at least 7800 ha, while the Alqueva Project will have a total 115,000
    ha expected capacity by 2015. In the Guadiana region including Monte Novo, the
    tertiary sector has 76% of gross value added (GVA) and 67% of employment; the
    most important sources are tourist accommodation, catering and public services.
    The agricultural sector has 10% of the region''s GVA and about 15% of the jobs;
    average farm size is large (55 ha). These characteristics, associated with the
    high proportion of farmers in a company structure, indicate the region''s high
    potential to develop agricultural activities, especially with the full operation
    of the Alqueva project. But its agricultural activities have a very low competitiveness
    and a low productivity per unit area; incomes are greatly supported by public
    subsidies, which comprise about 65% of the total gross margin (ARH-Alentejo, 2011).
    In the study area, the major irrigated crops are olives, maize, arable crops (mostly
    pasture) and horticultures (mostly tomatoes). Farm size ranges from less than
    50 ha to more than 500 ha. The largest areas belong to important multi-crop farms,
    such as the ones owned by the Fundação Eugénio de Almeida (FEA), or the olive
    farms owned by Olivais do Sul (ODS); together they comprise more than 30% of the
    irrigated area in Monte Novo irrigation perimeter. Fertilisers and pesticides
    are applied to all crops, especially tomatoes and maize. Greater irrigation stimulates
    run-off, leach-outs of fertilisers and pesticides and soil erosion. Together these
    practices reduce soil organic matter, soil fertility and its capacity to retain
    water, in turn increasing potential irrigation inefficiencies and need for better
    water management for the same cultivation level as before. Indeed, land degradation
    and nutrient depletion significantly constrain opportunities to increase water
    efficiency (Molden et al., 2010, IST, 2013). In 2009 the WUO Associação de Beneficiários
    de Monte Novo (henceforth ABMN) was established, representing all farmers connected
    to the Alqueva water distribution system from EDIA. According to the regulatory
    Decree Law 84/82, the Association has formal recognition by the Ministry of Agriculture,
    Trade and Fisheries. The ABMN has the role to promote the administration of constructing
    the hydro-agricultural development. Nonetheless EDIA has carried out the management
    and operation of the irrigation perimeter, as well as the investments in constructing
    the irrigation network. Water prices are differentiated according to the pressure
    heads provided at farm-gate delivery. Prices are lower in low-pressure blocks,
    where water is conveyed and distributed by gravity, generally to larger farmers;
    irrigation inside farms is within farmers’ management. Prices are higher in high-pressure
    blocks, which are supplied by pumping stations; these reduce the need for farmers
    to bear the costs of farm-level booster pumps. However, in the high-pressure blocks
    some large farms need their own investment in irrigation equipment and distribution
    infrastructures. In some cases farmers already invested in important irrigation
    infrastructures prior to the construction of the Monte Novo irrigation perimeter.
    In both cases a higher water price is imposed on important farmers who will not
    necessarily benefit from higher pressure heads at hydrants (Rita and Capelo, 2005).
    Moreover, the difference in water prices between low-pressure and high-pressure
    blocks is insufficient for covering the necessary investments for constructing
    the main irrigation infrastructures within low-pressure farms’ areas, as well
    as the corresponding exploitation costs, mainly energy and maintenance (Froes
    and Rodrigues, 2005). Given those high costs, full-cost recovery would impede
    a full transition from rain-fed to irrigated agriculture. To attract farmers into
    the scheme, a 2010 law set the initial water price at only 30% of full cost. This
    initial price shifts more of the total cost onto the supplier, while incentivising
    maize cultivation, which demands relatively large amount of water but gains a
    higher market price. According to the ABMN (Monte Novo''s WUO), the discount price
    gives farmers ‘a certain hope’, but many have difficulties to obtain credit, which
    is necessary for farm-level investment to electrify the cultivated zones (Silva,
    2010). As originally set by law, the low water price will be increased by 10%
    per year towards full-cost recovery by 2017 (Nuncio and Arranja, 2011). This legislative
    requirement has become contentious. At its full-cost price, water would comprise
    13% of the total cost of maize production. Through their WUOs, farmers have been
    lobbying the authorities to delay the price rise. According to the Federação das
    Associações de Agricultores do Baixo Alentejo (regional federation of farmers’
    associations), the higher price will not allow farmers to be economically competitive,
    especially for a large proportion of maize cultivation, estimated as more than
    36,000 tonnes aimed at export markets. According to the former Agriculture Minister,
    however, the higher price will be competitive with nearby regions, as an adequate
    basis for more farmers to join the scheme (Maneta, 2010, Rosado, 2012). The future
    increase could stimulate water-conserving measures and alternative cropping patterns
    which would be more profitable and/or need less water, while also reducing other
    resource burdens. But continuous support measures would be necessary for growers
    to evaluate and implement such options. 4.2. Innovative practices for stakeholders’
    consideration The on-demand water-delivery system was meant to incentivise water-efficient
    practices by farmers and thus to reconcile tensions between various objectives
    of the Alqueva project. Such a strategy put great expectations upon a technological
    system. At the irrigation-perimeter level the eventual implementation of innovative
    practices is meant to be supported by the ABMN (WUO), with investment costs if
    necessary to be covered from budget surpluses. On the other hand, the farm-level
    water-use improvements are dependent on farmers’ own investment or eventually
    on government subsidies fostering efficiency increases. Some technologies have
    been applied at farm level, e.g. sub-surface irrigation at FEA and ODS farms,
    but only to a small extent. Buried drip-irrigation systems need even more careful
    design, monitoring and operation than surface-drip or other micro-irrigation systems.
    Beyond the technological investment, greater application would depend on applied
    research, demonstration activities, outreach, farmers’ training and skills development.
    The study team assessed various options for lowering input demands (of energy,
    water, agrochemicals) or for increasing farmers’ income per unit water used (Ecowater,
    2012), in two main categories as follows. At the irrigation perimeter level, i.e.
    the distribution network: • tiered volumetric water tariffs according to actual
    water use by growers; • tiered water tariffs according to timing of withdrawals
    and energy costs, e.g. lower rates at night-time; and • pressure head delivery.
    And at the farm level: • drip irrigation, reducing water evaporation (especially
    relevant to maize); • sub-surface drip irrigation, minimising soil evaporation
    and facilitating mechanical weed-control or conservation tillage or minimum-tillage
    methods (especially relevant to vineyards); • super-high density olive orchards;
    • variable-irrigation practices, e.g. through regulated deficit irrigation; and
    • alternative crops demanding less water. The study team presented the above options
    at an April 2012 workshop. It was attended by representatives and experts from
    relevant local bodies. They included: EDIA, farmers’ representatives (FEA and
    ODS), the ABMN (WUO), ARH-Alentejo, and the Centro Operativo de Tecnologia do
    Regadio (COTR), an advisory body for scientific research regarding agricultural
    development. Stakeholders’ comments converged around the following points: • All
    the proposed technologies could add value to the Alqueva scheme. • Farmers are
    interested in any technological configuration that might increase their profit
    margins, which are currently low. • Given the high investment costs of the irrigation
    scheme, a successful operation is important in order to lower the unit cost of
    water through access to more growers (Ecowater, 2013). Discussion focused on the
    knowledge lacking for farmers to minimise irrigation intensity and to conserve
    soil resources. In particular participants made these comments: • Irrigation intensity
    must remain within the carrying capacity of the soil (infiltration rate and water-holding
    capacity), especially in order to prevent surface run-off, leach-outs and erosion—significant
    environmental impacts that must be taken into consideration. • Without adequate
    knowledge for such judgements, farmers may intensify resource usage, thus increasing
    costs, leach-outs and soil erosion. • Root-zone soil moisture conditions are not
    measured to identify in-field variability and vulnerable areas, so most farmers
    base decisions on their past experience and daily observations of farm conditions.
    • Although a network of meteorological stations already exist in the area, relevant
    information is not available for irrigation planning and scheduling purposes;
    farmers’ access is still under development (Ecowater, 2013). Regarding the above
    point about the soil''s water-capacity, a COTR expert emphasised soil organic
    carbon (SOC) as an environmental indicator and objective. Greater irrigation flows
    undermine the soil''s capacity to retain water and nutrients, while also increasing
    GHG emissions. SOC conservation is more difficult for annual arable crops than
    for permanent pasture. To avoid further SOC loss and to enhance its role, farmers
    could incorporate crop residues into the soil and/or choose crops which need less
    irrigation and chemical inputs. Before any technological change, decision-makers
    should evaluate the implications for SOC, he argued. This issue was not taken
    up by other stakeholders at the workshop. The workshop discussion also considered
    whether the cultivation of organic crops could be an alternative option, along
    with bio-labelling to gain a higher market price. According to the ODS representative,
    farmers would use organic cultivation methods if they could be convinced that
    their profit would increase. But owners of small farms would not be easily convinced
    (Ecowater, 2013). Indeed, small-scale growers lack an advisory service and systematic
    support for linking organic methods with higher-value markets. This institutional
    gap illustrates wider difficulties for farmers adjusting to new challenges and
    gaining the full potential benefits of the EFMA. 5. Discussion and conclusions
    Innovative irrigation practices can enhance water efficiency, gaining an economic
    advantage for farmers while also reducing environmental burdens. Water-efficient
    methods and better irrigation scheduling could also integrate water and nutrient
    management, thus minimising agrochemical runoff and leaching problems. To help
    fulfil this potential, experts have developed various models of water efficiency
    and environmental benefits. Yet these models are little used for irrigation scheduling;
    at most, they help retrospectively to evaluate seasonal approaches (FAO, 2012).
    In that generally adverse context, our two case studies of irrigation schemes
    investigated options, stimuli and difficulties to improve water-efficient practices.
    In both cases, individual farmers and/or their organisations already made significant
    investments in irrigation technologies, but their implementation has not been
    systematically evaluated for effectiveness through better knowledge—regarding
    crops’ water use, soil-moisture conditions, irrigation scheduling techniques,
    crops’ yield response to different irrigation management strategies, etc. Farmers
    there have no formal responsibility to demonstrate efficient water use (unlike
    in the UK; Knox et al., 2012). Consequently, farmers pay higher water prices yet
    do not obtain the full potential benefits through water-efficient practices. Reasons
    why have been investigated by exploring perspectives of water users organisations
    (WUOs) and relevant agencies, especially through multi-stakeholder workshops.
    The two cases have strong stimuli for more water-efficient practices. In the Sinistra
    Ofanto case, a main stimulus is the prospect of greater water scarcity and erratic
    supply, leading some farmers to rely on groundwater, which may progressively become
    more scarce, over-drafted, more expensive due to higher pumping costs, degraded
    and/or saline. In the Monte Novo case, a water-abundant system, a main stimulus
    is the statutory rise in water price towards full-cost recovery; this would weaken
    the commercial viability of some crops with high water demand, such as current
    maize cultivation. Anticipating such future difficulties, stakeholders have discussed
    options for better practices. In each area, stakeholder representatives attended
    our project workshop on how farmers’ economic advantage could be combined with
    environmental benefits. Despite the stimuli for more water-efficient practices,
    however, actors’ responsibility has been somewhat displaced onto hypothetical
    prospects. In particular, for the two areas: At the Sinistra Ofanto workshop,
    stakeholder representatives emphasised problems of water scarcity and aquifer
    salinity. Their comments suggested various possible measures such as region-wide
    control and regulation, farm-level practices and farmers’ knowledge-exchange systems.
    At the same time, however, the WUO displaced responsibility onto the prospect
    of additional supply from wastewater reuse; this would depend on significant institutional,
    policy and technical changes, with an uncertain timescale and cost. At the Monte
    Novo workshop, stakeholder representatives expressed interest in farm-level technological
    improvements which could improve water efficiency. Yet WUO representatives also
    emphasised the need to maintain a low unit cost of water. Moreover, the WUO publicly
    advocates a longer-term low water pricing, which would depend on a legislative
    change contradicting the country''s EU obligations and the original mandate for
    the irrigation scheme. In both cases responsibility is displaced, thus complementing
    WUOs’ and farmers’ assumption that their agricultural water management practices
    already have adequate efficiency. This attitude arises by default—from seeing
    no systematic means or incentive for more water-efficient practices, beyond the
    modern technologies already adopted. Experts generally have sought to overcome
    such obstacle through better models of evapotranspiration and efficient water
    use (e.g. Pereira et al., 2012). Yet such models cannot reconcile stakeholders’
    different understandings of irrigation efficiency: farmers seek to maximise their
    economic benefits, while water experts or agencies seek to conserve water (Knox
    et al., 2012). Therefore a solution would need a continuous knowledge-exchange
    with three components: i. expert scientific knowledge of crops’ water needs, their
    yield-response to water and the actual on-farm versus attainable efficiency (Hsiao
    et al., 2007); ii. links between farmers’ perspectives, innovative practices and
    their income benefits (Knox et al., 2012); and iii. means to lower resource burdens
    from inputs and pollutants (Miller, 2007). Relative to such a solution, our two
    case-study areas have a nominal extension service which lacks the necessary resources,
    expertise and operational capability in agricultural water management; these services
    have no external auditing. A knowledge-exchange system does not exist in those
    areas, so farmers may miss the full potential benefits of the technological investment
    already adopted. Under current circumstances, irrigation practices will maintain
    the unknown efficiency level; along with their WUOs, farmers will have weak capacities
    to make extra efforts for more water-efficient practices, as well as weak incentives
    to pay for any further investments. An adequate knowledge-exchange system would
    depend on greater institutional responsibility for water-related policies and
    strategies, for example, through an extension service or a functional equivalent
    through a WUO. This in turn would provide an enabling condition and incentive
    for all relevant stakeholders (especially WUOs) to share greater responsibility
    for agricultural water management across the entire water-supply chain, including
    farm-level practices as well as drainage and leach-out management. On this basis,
    more water-efficient practices could combine wider environmental benefits with
    economic advantage for farmers. Acknowledgements This work was supported by the

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353  \n21 of 29 \ncontinuous assessment of crop stress and growth stage\
    \ throughout the growing season. This will be \ninstrumental in avoiding temporary\
    \ severe stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop \nyield or\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\
    \ rate water application systems is presently a \nconstraint to the wide-scale\
    \ adoption of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield \nimprovements\
    \ and water savings currently achieved through field-scale precision irrigation\
    \ may not \njustify the initial capital investment required for its adoption.\
    \ As fresh water resources become \nscarcer, it is expected that more premium\
    \ will be placed on water abstracted for irrigated agriculture. \nRegulatory agencies\
    \ may also require farmers to continuously demonstrate the efficient use of water.\
    \ \nThese factors may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers\
    \ [155]. \nA conceptual model-based decision support system that uses the full\
    \ range of plant, weather \nand soil data for irrigation management is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1. This is currently being developed \nby the authors. It involves\
    \ the integration of various sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine \nlearning\
    \ and model predictive control into an adaptive decision support system for precision\
    \ \nirrigation.  \n \n \nFigure 1. Conceptual model-based decision support system\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    and content Abstract Tomato production systems in Florida are typically intensively
    managed with high inputs of fertilizer and irrigation and on sandy soils with
    low inherent water and nutrient retention capacities; potential nutrient leaching
    losses undermine the sustainability of such systems. The objectives of this 3-year
    field study were to evaluate the interaction between N-fertilizer rates and irrigation
    scheduling on crop N and P accumulation, N-fertilizer use efficiency (NUE) and
    NO3–N leaching of tomato cultivated in a plastic mulched/drip irrigated production
    system in sandy soils. Experimental treatments were a factorial combination of
    three irrigation scheduling regimes and three N-rates (176, 220, and 330 kg ha−1).
    Irrigation treatments included were: (1) surface drip irrigation (SUR) both the
    irrigation and fertigation line placed underneath the plastic mulch; (2) subsurface
    drip irrigation (SDI) where the irrigation drip was placed 0.15 m below the fertigation
    line which was located on top of the bed; and (3) TIME (conventional control)
    with the irrigation and fertigation lines placed as in SUR and irrigation applied
    once a day. Except for the TIME treatment all irrigation treatments were soil
    moisture sensor (SMS)-based with irrigation occurring at 10% volumetric water
    content. Five irrigation windows were scheduled daily and events were bypassed
    if the soil water content exceeded the established threshold. The use of SMS-based
    irrigation systems significantly reduced irrigation water use, volume percolated,
    and nitrate leaching. Based on soil electrical conductivity (EC) readings, there
    was no interaction between irrigation and N-rate treatments on the movement of
    fertilizer solutes. Total plant N accumulation for SUR and SDI was 12–37% higher
    than TIME. Plant P accumulation was not affected by either irrigation or N-rate
    treatments. The nitrogen use efficiency for SUR and SDI was on the order of 37–45%,
    56–61%, and 61–68% for 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively and significantly higher
    than for the conventional control system (TIME). Moreover, at the intermediate
    N-rate SUR and SDI systems reduced NO3–N leaching to 5 and 35 kg ha−1, while at
    the highest N-rate corresponding values were 7 and 56 kg N ha−1. Use of N application
    rates above 220 kg ha−1 did not result in fruit and/or shoot biomass nor N accumulation
    benefits, but substantially increased NO3–N leaching for the control treatment,
    as detected by EC monitoring and by the lysimeters. It is concluded that appropriate
    use of SDI and/or sensor-based irrigation systems can sustain high yields while
    reducing irrigation application as well as reducing NO3–N leaching in low water
    holding capacity soils. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Abbreviations

    Tomato is the most important vegetable commodity in Florida in terms of planted
    area and crop value. Between 1998 and 2006, the planted area for tomato averaged
    17,300 ha, which translates to about 20% of the state-wide vegetable area. A high
    crop value is also attached to tomato production as the average tomato crop value
    for the same period was 537 million dollars, representing 38% of the total crop
    value of all state vegetables (FDACS, 2007). Plastic mulch and drip irrigation
    are common cultural practices for vegetable crops. On low water retention soils,
    these techniques can reduce evaporation and thereby increase crop water use efficiency
    (Simonne et al., 2007). Moreover, use of drip irrigation also facilitates frequent
    fertilizer application via injection in the irrigation system (fertigation), which
    allows growers to improve the synchronization between nutrient application and
    crop nutrient uptake. On Florida sandy soils, most of the N-fertilizer is applied
    via injection in the drip lines during the tomato growing season (Olson et al.,
    2005); however, excessively high N-fertilizer/irrigation rates greatly increase
    the risk of nitrate leaching. Currently, the recommended N-fertilizer rate for
    tomato is 224 kg ha−1 (Olson et al., 2005) although commercial growers may apply
    higher rates (Everett, 1976, Rhoads et al., 1996) to reduce the risk of yield
    reductions under unfavorable production conditions. Nitrogen fertilizer may be
    injected in the microirrigation systems using a number of different nitrogenous
    compounds including urea, ammonium, or nitrate forms (Boman and Obreza, 2002).
    Regardless of the applied compound, under conditions that prevail in the southeastern
    USA most of the soil N is rapidly converted into NO3–N (Jansson and Persson, 1982)
    which is more susceptible to leaching. Actual N distribution in the soil depends
    on N source and application rates, crop removal capacity, and water displacement
    below the active root zone. As the nitrate tends to accumulate towards the boundary
    of the wetted volume (Bar-Yosef and Sheikholslami, 1976, Li et al., 2003) the
    use of irrigation strategies that limit the wetted volume in the root zone may
    improve water and nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency (NUE) (Singandhupe et al.,
    2003), as well as reducing nitrate leaching. Solute transport through the soil
    profile is not easy to measure. Sampler solution, soil samples, and lysimeters
    are techniques that could be employed for this type of study; however, each method
    may have certain limitations (Zotarelli et al., 2007). In addition, the estimation
    of soil electrical conductivity (EC) and salinity through automated time domain
    reflectometry and capacitance methods has recently become an effective method
    to measure temporal solute movement in the soil (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005a,
    Amente et al., 2000). In the past 20 years, technological advances on soil moisture
    sensing have provided growers real-time feedback on the effect of irrigation management
    on the actual soil water status. Therefore, such approaches provide a powerful
    tool for improving irrigation scheduling and can greatly enhance crop water use
    efficiency. However, not all methods are suited for automatic irrigation systems.
    Smajstrla and Locascio (1996) used switching tensiometers to automatically initiate
    up to three daily irrigation events on fresh market tomato. The authors reported
    reduced irrigation by 40–50% without reducing yields compared to the fixed irrigation
    schedule of 3–5 times per week. Due to the constant maintenance required by tensiometers,
    they are not suited for automatic irrigation control in commercial settings. Similarly,
    although granular matrix resistance sensors have been used successfully to irrigate
    onion and potato on moderately heavy soil types (Shock et al., 2002), these sensors
    have been reported to perform erratically and did not reduce water application
    compared to a time-based schedule irrigation in sandy soils (Cardenas-Lailhacar
    et al., 2008, Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005b). Capacitance and frequency domain reflectometry
    based soil moisture measurement devices have been shown to measure soil moisture
    relatively accurately in sandy soils common to Florida (Irmak and Irmak, 2005).
    And unlike tensiometers, capacitance based soil moisture sensors do not require
    maintenance once installed. Dukes et al. (2003) used a capacitance soil moisture
    based control system to automatically maintain a relatively constant soil moisture
    content in the root zone of green bell pepper through high-frequency irrigation
    based on real-time soil moisture measurements. With such systems, irrigation rates
    could be reduced by approximately half of the value of manual irrigation treatments
    that were irrigated once or twice daily. Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) has
    also shown to be an efficient technique to control irrigation scheduling when
    controlled by sensor-based methods. The installation of drip irrigation tube below
    the soil surface potentially reduces water losses due to soil evaporation thereby
    increasing water use efficiency (Ayars et al., 1999). The increase of irrigation
    water use efficiency should inherently minimize NO3–N leaching for vegetable crops.
    The application of fertilizer above the irrigation drip in SDI system should further
    reduce NO3–N leaching by maintaining nutrients in the root system. Combining SDI
    with surface applied fertigation greatly reduced N-leaching, and resulted in higher
    NUE by zucchini squash, when the soil volumetric water content (VWC) was maintained
    within the field capacity threshold (Zotarelli et al., 2008). However, these findings
    need to be confirmed for other crops as well. Zotarelli et al. (2009) have evaluated
    marketable yield, plant biomass accumulation, root distribution and irrigation
    water use efficiency outcomes for same experiments reported in this paper. The
    use of soil moisture sensor-based irrigation systems significantly reduced the
    applied irrigation on tomato, with the surface drip irrigation (SUR) controlled
    by soil moisture sensor (SMS) treatment resulting in 67–216% less irrigation water
    applied compared to fixed time irrigation (TIME) treatments. Corresponding reductions
    in irrigation water application for SDI controlled by soil moisture sensor were
    7–42%. Tomato fresh marketable yield was also increased 11–26% for SDI and SUR
    treatments compared to the TIME treatment. Tomato roots were most concentrated
    in the vicinity of the irrigation/fertigation drip line and significantly higher
    concentration of roots was found in the upper 15 cm for the SDI treatment. The
    objective of this study was therefore to identify suitable irrigation scheduling
    methods and drip irrigation system configurations to reduce irrigation water application
    as well as to evaluate the effect on optimal N-fertilizer rate and tomato N accumulation.
    In addition, the use of capacitance probes to monitor soil electrical conductivity
    in vegetable production beds was evaluated. We hypothesize that use of soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation systems will reduce tomato irrigation water requirements
    and consequently reduce NO3–N leaching below the root zone and that such benefits
    may be demonstrated in real time with capacitance probes. 2. Materials and methods
    Field experiments were conducted during the spring of 2005, 2006, and 2007 at
    the University of Florida, Plant Science Research and Education Unit, near Citra,
    FL. The soil has been classified as Candler sand (Buster, 1979) containing 8.2
    and 3.0 g kg−1 soil organic matter in the 0–0.3 and 0.3–0.9 m soil layers, respectively.
    Soil texture is predominantly sand-sized particles (97% of sand, with predominance
    of uncoated sand, which is absence of coating formed by clay and silt particles
    which improve water retention capacity of the soil, Muchovej et al. (2006)) in
    the upper 1 m of the profile (Carlisle et al., 1988) with a field capacity in
    the range of 0.10–0.12 (v/v) at the 0–0.3 m depth (Icerman, 2007). Average initial
    soil nitrate content at beginning of the seasons was 1.8 ± 0.6, 2.6 ± 0.7 and
    2.7 ± 0.7 mg kg−1 for the 0–0.3, 0.3–0.6 and 0.6–0.9 m soil depths, respectively.
    The average nitrate content of the irrigation water was 0.4 ± 0.3 mg L−1. The
    implementation of the experiment, weather data, and irrigation data are described
    in detail in a previous paper (Zotarelli et al., 2009). Briefly, raised beds (0.30
    m height) were constructed with 1.8 m distance between bed centers. Granulated
    P2O5 fertilizer was incorporated into the beds at a rate of 112 kg ha−1. Beds
    were fumigated after placement of both drip tapes and plastic mulch in a single
    pass 13 days before transplanting. Irrigation was applied via drip tape (Turbulent
    Twin Wall, 0.20 m emitter spacing, 0.25 mm thickness, 0.7 L h−1 emitter−1 at 69
    kPa, Chapin Watermatics, NY). Tomato transplants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.
    var. “Florida 47”) were set on 7 April 2005, 10 April 2006, and 10 April 2007.
    Weekly fertigation consisted of injecting dissolved fertilizer salts into fertigation
    lines (Fig. 1) according to Maynard et al. (2003). All plots received 247 kg ha−1
    of K as potassium chloride and 12 kg ha−1 of Mg as magnesium sulphate. The experimental
    design consisted of a complete factorial arrangement of three N-rates and three
    irrigation treatments randomized within blocks. The plots were 15 m long. The
    N-rate treatments corresponded to 176, 220 and 330 kg ha−1 of N applied as calcium
    nitrate (Fig. 1). Weekly N application rates, expressed as a percentage of total
    N application, corresponded to 5.5% at weeks 1, 2 and 13; 7.1% at weeks 3, 4 and
    12; and 8.9% at weeks 5–11 (Maynard et al., 2003). Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Weekly NO3–N fertilizer applied as CaNO3 by fertigation for fresh
    market tomato. The irrigation treatments were differentiated by their arrangement
    of drip irrigation lines (Table 1). The treatments were identified as SUR, whereby
    both irrigation and fertigation drip lines were positioned on the soil surface
    distanced 0.05 m from the plant row. The second treatment was identified as SDI,
    with the irrigation drip line positioned at 0.15 m below soil surface while the
    fertigation drip line was positioned on the soil surface. For both treatments,
    irrigation events were controlled by a Quantified Irrigation Controller (QIC)
    system (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2008), which included a 0.20 m long ECH2O probe
    (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA) to monitor soil moisture. Probes were inserted
    vertically in order to integrate the soil water content in the upper 0.2 m at
    0.05 m from the irrigation drip line. The QIC irrigation controllers allowed a
    pre-programmed timed irrigation event if measured soil water content was below
    a VWC value of 0.10 m3 m−3 (translating to a 510 mV reading) during one of five
    daily irrigation events, with each potential irrigation event lasting 24 min.
    Based on these readings up to a maximum of five irrigation events could occur
    per day totalling 2 h. A reference treatment employed a fixed time-based irrigation
    (TIME) featuring one fixed 2-h irrigation event per day. Similar to the SUR treatment,
    the TIME treatment used twin lines, one for irrigation and one for fertigation.
    The twin line setup was due to the experimental convenience; however, a commercial
    grower would most likely have one drip line for irrigation and fertigation at
    the surface. Table 1. Outline and description of irrigation and fertilization

    nitrogen accumulation and NUE Maximum biomass accumulation was evaluated by harvesting
    one representative plant per treatment replicate at 84, 86 and 90 DAT for the
    2005, 2006, and 2007 trial, respectively. For the 2005 and 2006 trials, one representative
    plant per plot was also harvested throughout the entire growth period at bi-weekly
    intervals and used for nitrogen accumulation analysis. Vegetative and reproductive
    plant parts were separated. Fruits were harvested on 70, 77, and 84 DAT in 2005;
    on 70, 77, and 86 DAT in 2006; and on 76, 83, and 90 DAT in 2007. The harvested
    area for fruit yield consisted of a central 10.5 m long region within each plot.
    Shoot and fruit tissues were dried at 65 °C for subsequent dry weight analysis.
    Tissue samples were ground in a Wiley mill and passed through a 2 mm screen, with
    a thoroughly mixed 5 g portion of each sample stored. Tissue material was digested
    using a modification of the aluminum block digestion procedure of Gallaher et
    al. (1975) and analyzed for total Kjeldahl N (EPA method 351.2) and total P (EPA
    method 207.7) at the Analytical Research Lab (Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL,
    USA) using the Jones and Case (1991) method. Plant nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation
    was calculated by multiplying weights of stems plus leaves and fruit tissue by
    the corresponding N and P concentrations. NUE was defined as N uptake by the plants
    divided by the total amount of N supplied from weekly fertigation plus initial
    soil nitrate. In 2006, leaf samples were also taken at 35 and 50 DAT. The 12 most
    recently matured leaves were collected between 9 and 11 a.m. from each treatment
    plot. Immediately after the leaf collection, the petiole base was cut at 15 mm
    from the stem attachment and crushed in a stainless steel garlic crusher. Sap
    NO3− concentration in the sap was determined in the field by an ion electrode
    method using C-141 Cardy Nitrate Meter (Horiba, Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield,
    IL, USA). The remainders of the samples plus leaves were dried and ground to determine
    total leaf N content. 2.2. Monitoring soil water, soil electrical conductivity
    and soil nitrate Soil electrical conductivity of the soil solution and volumetric
    water content were measured simultaneously every 15 min by Stevens Hydra Probe
    II—SD12 (Stevens Water Monitoring Systems, Inc., Portland, OR, USA), with the
    manufacturer provided factory calibration for sand used in data collection. In
    2006, two matrices containing eight Hydra Probes each were installed, one in the
    SUR treatment and one in the TIME treatment. A 0.46 m long section of the entire
    bed width was removed from both installation locations, centered under an emitter.
    The section provided enough space for probe installation parallel to the surface.
    After installation the section was repacked with the original soil. The matrices
    were configured in a 2 × 4 formation (vertical × transverse), with a top row buried
    at 0.08 m and a bottom row at 0.23 m below the surface. The two center columns
    were spaced 0.06 m apart centered under an emitter. The two external columns were
    spaced 0.23 m apart from the center of the bed. In 2007, a sequence of 3 Hydra
    Probes was installed horizontally in the profile at 0.12, 0.37 and 0.67 m depths
    and 0.05 m from the irrigation drip line. The resulting contour maps were created
    using kriging method provided by Surfer 8 (Golden Software Inc., Golden, CO, USA).
    Zero tension drainage lysimeters were located 0.75 m below the surface of the
    bed (Zotarelli et al., 2007). The drainage lysimeters were constructed out of
    208 L capacity drums that were cut in half lengthwise with a length of 0.85 m,
    a diameter of 0.55 m, and a height of 0.27 m. A vacuum pump was used to extract
    the leachate accumulated at the bottom of the lysimeter. The leachate was removed
    weekly 1 day prior to the next fertigation event by applying a partial vacuum
    (35–40 kPa) using 20 L vacuum bottles for each drainage lysimeter. Total leachate
    volume was determined gravimetrically and subsamples collected from each bottle
    were analyzed for NO3–N and thus total N loading rates could be calculated. Samples
    were analyzed using an air-segmented automated spectrophotometer (Flow Solution
    IV, OI Analytical, College Station, TX, USA) coupled with a Cd reduction approach
    (US EPA Method 353.2, Jones and Case, 1991). 2.3. Statistical analysis Statistical
    analyses were performed using the PROC GLM procedure of SAS (SAS, 2002) to determine
    treatment and year effects for total plant biomass, N and P accumulation, petiole
    sap, and NUE. When the F-value was significant, a multiple means comparison was
    performed using Duncan''s multiple range test at a P-value of 0.05. For repeated
    measurements such as plant N accumulation, cumulative leached volume, and nitrate
    leaching, the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS with residual maximum likelihood estimation
    approach and least squares means of fixed effects were pair-wise compared. Orthogonal
    polynomial contrasts were also used to test for linear and/or quadratic responses
    to N-rate treatments for selected crop parameters. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Plant biomass, N and P accumulation The analysis of variance within each year
    revealed no interaction between irrigation and N-rate treatments for biomass,
    N and P accumulation of shoot and fruit, as well as NUE (Table 2). The lack of
    significance for the interaction indicated that under our experimental conditions
    irrigation and N-rate acted independently, therefore, both factors were analyzed
    separately. Table 2. Analysis of variance summary for plant dry biomass, N and

    between 1.28 and 2.49 Mg ha−1 over the 3 years, with no major variations of shoot
    dry weight between years. Contrary to the reproductive period, weather during
    vegetative periods was characterized by no heat stress conditions. In addition,
    between 0 and 40 DAT, cumulative growing degree days (GDD), cumulative solar radiation,
    and average temperatures were very similar across years (Zotarelli et al., 2009).
    Within irrigation treatments, the use of SMS to control irrigation generally increased
    shoot and fruit dry weight (Table 3). During 2005 and 2006, the TIME treatment
    showed the lowest shoot dry weight, while in 2007, there was no difference in
    dry weight between TIME and SDI, both treatments accumulated around 1.6 Mg ha−1,
    approximately 10% less than the SUR treatment (Table 3). Table 3. Tomato shoot

    average fruit harvest indices (HI = fruit dry weight/total above-ground dry weight
    at harvest) were 0.30, 0.55, and 0.67 for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively.
    Overall HI from 2006 to 2007 were in similar range of those reported by Scholberg
    et al. (2000) for north-central Florida conditions and slightly lower of those
    reported by Tei et al. (2002) for central Italy. Lower values during 2005 were
    related to unfavorable growth conditions hampering initial fruit set and canopy
    development while more vigorous growth during 2006 and 2007 also resulted in enhanced
    initial canopy development, greater water use (Table 1), and fruit dry biomass
    (Table 3). During the spring of 2005, hot and humid weather prevailed. The plant
    reproductive period of spring of 2005 was wetter and hotter compared to the subsequent
    seasons which resulted in premature blooming and flower abortion (Peet et al.,
    1997, Rao et al., 1992), consequently leading to lower yields. The average maximum
    and minimum temperature between 10 days before the first harvest and the last
    harvest were: 30.2 ± 1.7 and 20.9 ± 1.3 °C in 2005; 28.1 ± 2.6 and 14.5 ± 1.7
    °C in 2006; and 27.1 ± 2.1 and 14.5 ± 1.7 °C in 2007. In the same year order,
    the cumulative precipitation at the final harvest was 472, 357 and 323 mm. The
    high rain intensity and wetter condition in 2005 also promoted favorable condition
    to the appearance of bacterial spot disease (Xanthomonas campestris) at beginning
    of the crop season. The cumulative solar radiation at the end of tomato season
    was 1606, 1699 and 2022 MJ m−2 for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. More favorable
    radiation and temperature regimes thus may have resulted in a higher production
    potential in 2006 and 2007 compared to 2005. There was an increase in fruit dry
    biomass with the use of SUR and SDI irrigation treatments (Table 3). These two
    treatments yielded on average 37%, 17%, and 16% more compared to the TIME treatment,
    for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. For 2006 and 2007 conditions, the increase
    of N-rate from 176 to 220 kg ha−1 resulted in an increase of 7–13% of fruit dry
    weight, and from 220 to 330 kg ha−1 the increase in fruit dry weight was only
    3%. However, when fresh marketable yield was compared (Zotarelli et al., 2009)
    there were no differences between applied N-rates (Zotarelli et al., 2009). The
    lack of tomato yield response to N-rates above 224 kg ha−1 was also reported by
    Hochmuth and Cordasco (2000) for drip irrigated tomato production systems in Florida.
    In general, the use of a SMS to control irrigation statistically increased the
    dry weight of shoot and fruit (Table 3). The irrigation treatments controlled
    by a SMS were programmed to bypass irrigation if the probe read soil moisture
    at or above 0.10 m3 m−3 at the beginning of an irrigation window (Table 1). As
    a result, tomato plant N nutrition was drastically enhanced by SMS-based irrigation
    systems and N accumulation in fruits and shoots were significant (P ≤ 0.01) greater,
    except for shoot N values in 2007. The corresponding increase in shoot N uptake
    for SMS-based systems ranged between 17 and 52 kg N ha−1. Moreover, the overall
    N accumulation increased in the order of 2005 < 2006 < 2007, thus mirroring the
    overall plant dry weight accumulation and yield trends. The overall N harvest
    indices (NHI = fruit N/total above-ground N at harvest) for each year were 0.36,
    0.63, and 0.74, for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. Even with no differences
    in fruit dry weight between SDI and SUR in 2005, SDI treatments showed 15% higher
    fruit N concentration than SUR, which may be related to the higher NO3–N concentration
    in the 0–0.15 m soil layer of SDI measured by soil sampling (data not shown).
    During following years when both overall biomass production and NHI values were
    higher, there were no differences in fruit or shoot N accumulation between SDI
    and SUR treatments; while the control treatment consistently showed lower shoots
    and fruits N concentration. The observed decrease in plant N concentration was
    expected as related to more favorable growth conditions resulting in an increase
    of biomass production thus resulting in nutrient dilution in dry matter. Complementary
    measurements of plant N levels using petiole sap NO3–N status were taken at 35
    and 50 DAT. Petiole sap NO3–N concentration and leaf N content of SDI and SUR
    were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher than TIME treatment at 35 and 50 DAT (Table
    4), one exception was leaf N content at 35 DAT. The leaf N concentration found
    at 50 DAT was in the range of optimum leaf N concentration reported by Hartz et
    al. (1998) and Hochmuth (1994). Temporal trends in above-ground N-accumulation
    dynamics of tomato plants during 2006 were affected by both irrigation (Fig. 2A
    and B) and N-rate (Fig. 2C and D). Difference among irrigation treatments was
    most pronounced during the reproductive stage. During the first 30 DAT, the plant
    vegetative growth was characterized by the exponential increase of N-uptake rates
    (Fig. 2B). Overall maximum N-uptake rates peaked earliest for TIME-based treatments,
    around 33 DAT with a rate of 0.60 kg ha−1 of N day−1, while for SDI and SUR, N-uptake
    rate (both with 0.72 kg ha−1 of N day−1) peaked at 44 and 55 DAT, respectively.
    At 55 DAT the N-uptake rate was 0.72, 0.69, and 0.44 kg ha−1 of N day−1 for SUR,
    SDI and TIME, respectively. At 63 DAT, the total dry weight accumulation for control
    treatment was significantly (P ≤ 0.05) lower than SDI and SUR treatments. Since
    in tomato, adequate N availability promotes vegetative growth and delays fruit
    maturity (Scholberg, 1996), excessive N-leaching with the control, appeared to
    reduce crop N uptake, as reflected by low petiole nitrate values. In turn N limitations
    hamper full canopy development, light interception and thus crop yield (Scholberg
    et al., 2000). Table 4. Mean values of petiole sap NO3− and leaf nitrogen concentrations

    image Fig. 2. Main effect of irrigation treatments (A and B) and N-rates (C and
    D) on tomato above-ground N accumulation (kg ha−1) and calculated daily N uptake
    (kg ha−1 day−1) during the spring of 2006. Error bars represent ± standard error
    from the mean, n = 4. Shoot N accumulation was not affected by the N-rate (Table
    2). In other words, in the absence of excessive leaching, at N-rate of 176 kg
    ha−1 seemed to be sufficient to sustain the vegetative biomass production and
    initial shoot N accumulation. But, the analysis of variance revealed an effect
    of N-rate on the fruit N accumulation in 2006 and 2007, when total fresh marketable
    yields were above 47 Mg ha−1. In 2005, fresh yields averaged 32 Mg ha−1 and tomato
    fruit N accumulation under N-rate of 176 kg ha−1 was similar to that for the higher
    N-rates, and in this case, N-rate of 176 kg ha−1 was not a limiting factor for
    tomato yield. However, in subsequent more favorable growth conditions resulted
    in higher N uptake capacity and in this case, increasing the N-rate from 176 to
    220 kg ha−1 resulted in an increase of 21% (P ≤ 0.05) and 12% (non-significant)
    in N fruit accumulation, respectively. The increase of N-rate from 220 to 330
    kg ha−1 resulted in slight (non-significant) enhancement of fruit N accumulation
    as observed in 2006 and 2007. However, it is also important to note that there
    were no differences in fresh marketable yield between those three N-rates in all
    studied years and luxurious N-consumption thus may not result in higher production
    efficiencies and yields (Zotarelli et al., 2009). At 35 DAT, petiole sap NO3–N
    concentration showed no difference between N-rates of 176 and 220 kg ha−1; while
    petiole sap NO3–N concentration was 20% higher under N-rate of 330 kg ha−1. Although
    petiole sap NO3–N concentration declined after 35 DAT, the N-rate of 330 kg ha−1
    resulted in a lower reduction of petiole sap NO3–N concentration at 50 DAT compared
    to the other rates (Table 4). After 20 DAT, increases in N-rate resulted in an
    increase in daily N uptake. Maximum N uptake occurred between 40 and 45 DAT and
    the peaks were 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 kg ha−1 day−1 for N-rates of 176, 220, and 330
    kg ha−1, respectively. Results of petiole sap NO3–N concentration and leaf N concentration
    indicated that the N-rate of 330 kg ha−1 may be exceeding the N a tomato plant
    needs and possibly inducing N luxury consumption. Though, the extra consumption
    did not result in higher yields, in fact, for TIME treatment this N-rate showed
    higher NO3–N leaching (Table 5). Table 5. Cumulative NO3–N leached measured by
    drainage lysimeters under irrigation treatments and N-rates at end of tomato crop

    not determined. Nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency was significantly (P ≤ 0.01)
    higher with the use of SMS or when lower N-rates were applied (Table 2, Table
    3). Again, there was no interaction between N-rate and irrigation treatment on
    NUE. The NUE increased with the increase in yield level. The NUE values ranged
    between 27% and 51% in 2005; 38% and 61% in 2006; and 50% and 73% in 2007. Linear
    NUE values decreased with increasing N-rates (Table 3) may be related to limitation
    in uptake and sink capacities resulting in a saturation response (e.g. “law of
    the diminishing returns”). In other words, as N supply continues to increase,
    factors other than N limit growth and yield. Although higher N-tissue concentration
    was found at 50 DAT for N-rate of 330 kg ha−1, similar to reported by Huett and
    Dettmann (1988), this luxurious N uptake no longer contributes to physiological
    processes but may be accumulated in storage organs instead (Marschner, 1995).
    The TIME treatment showed consistently lower values of NUE, which was related
    to the higher irrigation volumes being applied, resulting in increased N dilution
    and displacement thus reducing N uptake efficiency (Scholberg et al., 2002). In
    addition, a significant increase in nitrate leaching was observed with the increase
    of N-rate. Plant phosphorus accumulation was not affected by irrigation or N-rate
    treatments. Total above-ground plant P accumulated (shoot and fruit) followed
    the same pattern of plant biomass accumulation. The relationship between total
    dry matter and total P accumulation can be described by a linear relationship:
    P = 5.3458 + 15.1791 × DM (r2 = 0.78); where P is total above-ground P accumulation
    in kg ha−1; and DM is total above-ground dry-matter accumulation in Mg ha−1 at
    harvesting. 3.2. Drainage, nitrate leaching and soil electrical conductivity During
    initial crop establishment, similar irrigation volumes were applied to all treatments
    (Table 1). Upon completion of this establishment phase, which lasted between 11
    and 14 DAT, irrigation treatments were initiated. The lowest volume of irrigation
    water applied was in the SUR treatment, followed by SDI and TIME treaments (Table
    1). Accordingly, the TIME treatment resulted in the highest volume of water percolated
    below the effective root zone (Fig. 3). The volume percolated ranged between 32
    and 56 mm (Fig. 3). Despite the relative high volume of irrigation applied for
    TIME in 2006 and 2007 compared to 2005, the fraction of the total amount of irrigation
    water that was being percolated (percolated volume/irrigated volume) was lower
    in 2006 and 2007. This likely due to large canopy sizes and climatic conditions
    resulting in increased evapotranspirative demand during the reproductive period
    thus increasing soil water extraction rates (Zotarelli et al., 2009). The cumulative
    crop evaportranspiration (ETc) between 55 DAT until the last harvest was 103,
    111, and 139 mm, for 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. As a result of higher
    plant water consumption and lower temperatures, the percolated volume was reduced
    and tomato yields were much higher during 2006 and 2007, respectively, than 2005.
    More specifically, with the exception of SDI in 2007, the SUR and SDI treatments
    resulted in a consistent reduction of water percolation compared to TIME treatment
    (Fig. 3). The volume percolated under SDI and SUR treatments ranged between 2%
    and 10% of the total irrigation water applied; however, for these treatments 20–30%
    of the water percolation occurred during the establishment phase, which is defined
    here as 11 DAT until approximately 14 DAT (Fig. 3). Correspondingly, the root
    length density (RLD) at 24 DAT were very low (<0.32 cm cm−3) which limited the
    capacity of water absorption by roots (Zotarelli et al., 2009). Download : Download

    spring of 2005, 2006 and 2007. Different letters indicate differences at the 95%
    confidence level. Error bars represent ± standard error from the mean, n = 4.
    The TIME treatment also resulted in the most leaching. Cumulative NO3–N leaching
    values were 62, 49, and 10 kg ha−1 for TIME treatment, in 2005, 2006 and 2007,
    respectively. The single high volume daily application of the TIME treatment is
    likely the cause of the appreciable drainage and NO3 leaching below the root zone.
    By comparison in 2005 and 2006, the SUR and SDI treatments reduced NO3 leaching
    on the order of 90%, representing a total load of 4 to 7 kg ha−1 of N (Fig. 4D
    and E). In 2007, the overall leached volume for SDI and SUR treatment was slightly
    higher than previous years; however, the N-loads below the root zone were drastically
    reduced (Fig. 4 and Table 5) due to the reduction in the NO3–N concetration in
    the leached volume. The analysis of NO3–N concentration in the leachate reduced
    in the order 2007 < 2006 < 2005 (Fig. 4). The lower N-load leaching and lower
    NO3–N concentration were directly related to the N-rate and irrigation treatments.
    In fact, PROC MIXED model showed a significant (P ≤ 0.05) interaction between
    irrigation and N-rate. Independently of the N-rate applied (220 or 330 kg ha−1),
    the use of SUR or SDI treatment resulted in similar NO3–N leaching rates. However,
    under TIME irrigation scheduling, the increase in N-rate from 176 or 200 to 330
    kg ha−1, significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased the NO3–N leaching in 2005 and 2006
    (Table 5). The exception was 2007, when higher plant N uptake reduced the risk
    of potential soil NO3–N leaching. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4.

    4. Soil EC was used to assess the effect of irrigation treatments on the movement
    of the weekly injected fertilizer solution. Fig. 5 shows EC of the upper section
    of the raised bed for the interval of 42 to 49 DAT in 2006 for SUR and TIME treatments
    under N-rate of 220 kg ha−1. This monitoring period represented the end of vegetative
    growth and beginning of the reproductive stage, when the maximum daily N-uptake
    rate was occurring (Fig. 2). The first snapshot of EC was taken 1 day before the
    injection of the fertilizer solution, therefore 6 days after the previous fertilizer
    injection. The EC for SUR treatment ranged between 0.4 and 1.2 dS m−1 with higher
    EC values were found in the central area of the bed section below 0.15 m depth
    (Fig. 5A1). The corresponding measurement of EC under TIME treatments revealed
    lower EC values than the SUR treatment. The central area of the bed section showed
    values of 0.1 dS m−1 and a gradual increase of EC values towards to the sides
    of bed area (Fig. 5A2). The injection of soluble fertilizer in the irrigation
    lines for that particular week consisted in the application of a rate of 19 kg
    ha−1of N (Ca(NO3)2 form); 23.5 kg ha−1 of K (KCl form) and 1.2 kg ha−1 of Mg (MgSO4
    form). The fertilizer injection occurred at 10 a.m., right after irrigation which
    applied 5.4 mm for TIME and 1 mm for SUR. It should also be noted that EC measurements
    were not ion specific in the soil solution; therefore, it is possible that other
    ions from the soil contributed or influenced the measured EC (Mmolawa and Or,
    2000). Another snapshot of EC taken 7 h after fertilizer solution injection is
    displayed in Fig. 5B1 and B2. Examination of Fig. 5 reveals a noticeable increase
    of EC in the 0.2 m radius from drip emitter in the TIME treatment. The EC raised
    from 0.3 dS m−1 before the fertilizer injection to 1.6 dS m−1 7 h after the injection,
    showing the fertilizer solution concentrated in the top of the bed. For SUR treatment,
    more uniform increase of EC in the central area of the bed (between −0.15 and
    0.15 m width and between 0 and 0.3 m depth) was observed 7 h after fertilizer
    injection. Due to an irrigation event of 0.8 mm right after the fertilizer injection,
    a greater displacement of the fertilizer solution occurred with SUR (Fig. 5B1)
    compared to TIME (Fig. 5B2). Other snapshots of EC were taken 1, 2, 3 and 6 days
    after the fertilizer injection. Fig. 5C1 shows EC patterns after two irrigation
    events (0.9 and 1.1 mm) for SUR treatment. These irrigation events resulted in
    a slight increase of EC at the lower right side of the bed. In the following days
    (Fig. 5D1 and E1) all the scheduled irrigation events were skipped by the SMS,
    maintaining the EC contours despite an increase in EC magnitude. This gradual
    increase in EC can be explained by reduction in soil moisture content due to crop
    evapotranspiration (average estimated ETc of 4 mm day−1 for day 2 and 3) and large
    concentration of roots on the top 0.15 m of soil profile (Zotarelli et al., 2009).
    Between the third and sixth evaluation day (Fig. 5E1 and F1), SUR treatments received
    two irrigation events per day with a total application of 8.7 mm in 3 days. As
    a result, some displacement and redistribution of the fertilizer solution below
    0.15 m occurred as evident by lower EC values compared to the values of 3 days
    before (Fig. 5F1) in the absence of drainage during the same period. Download

    Drip was located at 0 cm. For TIME treatments, a single daily event of 5.4 mm
    resulted in a different solute distribution patterns from that observed for SUR.
    The predominance of downward water movement led the displacement of the fertilizer
    solution occurring preferentially underneath the drip emitter in vertical direction
    with a gradual increase of EC in the laterals of the bed (Fig. 5C2). Two days
    after the fertilizer injection (Fig. 5D2) and after 10.8 mm of irrigation, there
    was an overall decrease of EC values exhibiting a drastic displacement of the
    fertilizer solution. After 6 days of the fertilizer injection, the EC in the area
    underneath the drip emitter dropped from 1.9 to 0.1 dS m−1 (Fig. 5C2 and F2).
    Li et al. (2003) reported a proportional increase in the surface wetted radius
    and the vertical wetted depth with irrigation water volume applied via drip. However,
    observations made by Li et al. (2003) revealed increasing the applied irrigation
    volume significantly increased the wetted vertical displacement depth, but had
    a little effect on lateral water movement. In addition, higher concentration of
    NO3–N was observed in the boundaries of the wetted area. In the present study,
    the EC patterns clearly showed the effect of high volume and low frequency of
    irrigation application on the displacement of the fertilizer below the root zone
    and in the end, that was captured in the drainage lysimeters (Fig. 3, Fig. 4).
    Conversely, SUR treatments applied a certain volume of irrigation water according
    to the soil moisture and plant requirement, which reduced water percolation and
    consequently maintained fertilizer in the root zone. In the spring of 2007, Hydra
    Probes were installed at 0.12, 0.37 and 0.67 m depth under all irrigation treatments
    receiving N-rate of 220 kg ha−1. Results of soil moisture and EC from interval
    between 56 and 70 DAT are presented in Fig. 6. There was a noticeable increase
    in soil moisture after each irrigation event as measured by the probe placed at
    the 0.12 m depth (Fig. 6A–C). Also the SDI and SUR treatments were irrigated frequently
    for short time intervals, which resulted in a relatively small increase in soil
    moisture, and consequently in minimal vertical displacement and leaching. As a
    result, oscillations in soil moisture at 0.37 m were minimal (Fig. 6B), indicating
    that very little of irrigation water reached this layer. For SDI treatment, soil
    moisture spikes at a soil depth of 0.37 m were related to the irrigation events
    (from the buried drip tube at 0.15 m). And finally, the TIME treatment was irrigated
    for a longer time period, which resulted in very pronounced soil moisture fluctuations
    (Fig. 6C). These spikes in soil moisture for TIME treatment reached values over
    0.20 m3 m−3, a value well above the soil field capacity, and as a result the excess
    soil moisture was rapidly drained to deeper soil layers, showing spikes of soil
    moisture at 0.37 and 0.67 m probes. This clearly demonstrates the mechanistic
    driving force behind the observed high NO3–N leaching values for the TIME treatment
    (Table 5) and the pronounced increasing EC in the soil layers below 0.3 m (Fig.
    6F). As an example, 1 day after fertilizer injection (as indicated by the arrows
    in Fig. 6F), values of EC spiked from 0.2 to over 2.0 dS m−1 before returning
    to the initial EC value within the following days at 0.12 m depth. Similar spikes
    were reported at 0.37 and 0.67 m depth, and both layer showed reduced EC values
    (<0.5 dS m−1) after 6 days. By comparison, irrigation management from the SUR
    and SDI treatments produced relatively constant soil moisture and EC values over
    time, as irrigation water was distributed more evenly across multiple irrigation
    events according to the soil moisture threshold and thus crop water demand. Therefore,
    high frequency low volume irrigation methods seems to be much better suited to
    effectively address the limitation of inherently low water storage capacities
    of sandy soils. In addition, SMS-based system showed no pronounced spikes in soil
    moisture and EC by probes at 0.67 m soil depth, indicating that the volume of
    water applied at the soil surface did not exceed root water extraction, consequently
    reducing NO3–N leaching thus facilitating more efficient water and nutrient use.

    indication of different patterns of water and fertilizer distribution in the soil
    profile for the same experiment was noted in Zotarelli et al. (2009). A consistently
    larger concentration of tomato roots in the upper soil layers was reported in
    the study, about 51–78% of root length found between 0–0.15 m of the soil profile
    and 15–28% at the 0.15–0.3 m soil layer. The SDI treatments showed increased RLD
    in the upper soil layer after 45 DAT compared to the SUR and TIME treatments,
    while higher root concentration were observed in the deeper layer for TIME. Higher
    root colonization at greater soil depth for TIME and in the shallower layer for
    SDI, shows the effect of water and soil nitrate availability on root proliferation
    (Bloom et al., 2003, Lecompte et al., 2008). It is also noteworthy that relatively
    high root concentrations at greater soil depths for TIME did not result in relative
    yield benefits nor improved water and N use efficiencies. In contrast, SUR and
    SDI treatments showed superior water and nutrients utilization as related to reduced
    displacement of both water and nutrients below the active root zone. 4. Conclusions
    Soil moisture sensor-based irrigation systems in tomato significantly reduced
    crop water requirements, water percolation, and nitrate leaching. For SMS-based
    SUR and SDI production systems, the total plant N accumulation increased 12–37%
    compared to TIME treatment. The treatments SUR and SDI reduced NO3–N leaching
    by 5 to 35 and 7 to 56 kg ha−1 for N application rates of 220 and 330 kg ha−1,
    respectively. Use of N application rates above 220 kg ha−1 of N did not result
    in fruit or shoot biomass of N accumulation benefits, but substantially increased
    NO3–N leaching with TIME treatments. The use of capacitance probes to monitor
    soil electrical conductivity provided a reasonable estimation of fertilizer movement
    in sandy soils. It is concluded that appropriate use of SDI and/or sensor-based
    irrigation systems can allow growers to sustain profitable yield while reducing
    irrigation application and reducing NO3–N leaching in low water holding capacity
    soils. Acknowledgements Research supported by Florida Department of Agricultural

    and content Highlights • Sensor positioning and accuracy effect on irrigation
    efficiency is investigated. • A mathematical model incorporating a system-dependent
    boundary condition is used. • Soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy considerably
    affect irrigation efficiency. • Models are efficient tools for irrigation scheduling
    characteristics investigation. Abstract Recent advances in electromagnetic sensor
    technologies have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art
    soil moisture sensing devices. However, many of the available guidelines for sensor
    placement were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments.
    Sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting irrigation efficiency.
    This study investigates how soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may
    affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling
    systems under various conditions. For this purpose several numerical experiments
    were carried out using a mathematical model, incorporating a system-dependent
    boundary condition in order to simulate soil moisture based irrigation scheduling
    systems. The results of this study provided clear evidence that soil moisture
    sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation efficiency
    in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. In specific cases the
    effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was as high as 16%; however, when
    nearby sensor positions were examined, the observed differences were generally
    low. The effect of sensors accuracy was even clearer. For the lower sensor''s
    error level studied (±0.01 cm3 cm−3) the effect on irrigation efficiency ranged
    between 2.5% and 6.4%, while for the higher error level (±0.03 cm3 cm−3) the effect
    ranged between 10.2% and 18.7%. These results highlight the importance of a detailed
    study taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation, and
    scheduling systems as well as soil moisture sensors in order to provide a sound
    basis for improved irrigation scheduling. The need for soil specific calibration
    of the sensors used in such systems is highlighted as well. Lastly, a significant
    outcome of this study is the ability of computer models to serve as efficient
    tools for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning and accuracy, or other
    automated scheduling system characteristics. Previous article in issue Next article

    sensors 1. Introduction Water conservation in agriculture has recently received
    much attention in the light of increasing competition for fresh water resources
    between the various users, especially in semi-arid and arid regions facing limited
    water availability and at the same time increased water needs. Among the most
    promising current strategies to increase irrigation water use efficiency is the
    use of drip irrigation systems, which facilitate water management due to the highly
    localized application of water and nutrients, and the improvement of irrigation
    scheduling, i.e. by applying the right amount of water to cropland at the right
    time over the growing season. Even though drip irrigation can be proven much more
    efficient than other irrigation systems since only the root zone of the cropped
    area is irrigated, improper management may lead to waste of water or leaching
    of soluble chemicals such as nitrate (Dukes et al., 2007, Zotarelli et al., 2011).
    However, efficient irrigation management is challenging, due to the many factors
    that should be considered, including climate, crop type, irrigation method, and
    system parameters (Dabach et al., 2013). The goal of irrigation scheduling is
    to make the most efficient use of water and energy by applying the right amount
    of water to cropland at the right time and in the right place, making sure water
    is available when the crop needs it (Tam, 2006). Scheduling maximizes irrigation
    efficiency by minimizing runoff and percolation losses. Proper irrigation management
    requires a sound basis for making irrigation decisions. Methods of irrigation
    scheduling can be classified as static or dynamic. According to the static approach
    the total amount of water for irrigation is allocated without specifying its temporal
    distribution along the growing season. By contrast, in the dynamic approach irrigation
    water is allocated at specific time steps along the growing season in order to
    achieve optimal soil water content conditions in the root zone at every growth
    stage (Shani and Dudley, 2001, Shani et al., 2004). Irrigation scheduling is normally
    based on environmental measurements such as evapotranspiration and soil water
    content or on monitoring plant stress. Many researchers have investigated the
    automation of irrigation systems and the use of soil moisture sensing devices
    such as tensiometers, gypsum blocks, granular matrix sensors (GMS), and electromagnetic
    (EM) sensors. An automated irrigation scheduling system generally consists of
    soil moisture or matric head sensing devises, a control system, and the irrigation
    system components (Dukes and Scholberg, 2005). The use of switching tensiometers
    to automatically control irrigation events has been studied among others by Smajstrla
    and Koo (1986), Clark et al. (1994), Torre-Neto et al. (2000). In most of these
    studies, significant water savings were reported without a negative effect on
    crop yield. However, the use of tensiometers to initiate irrigation is associated
    with several problems, such as entrapped air in the tensiometers, organic growth
    on the ceramic cups, and need for recalibration (Smajstrla and Koo, 1986, Dukes
    and Scholberg, 2005). GMS require less maintenance and can be more easily integrated
    in automated irrigation systems. However, they are very sensitive in soil salinity
    and they often need recalibration. Muñoz-Carpena et al. (2005) found that GMS-based
    irrigation behaved erratically. The above issues of the available matric head
    sensing devises limited the extensive use of automated irrigation scheduling systems.
    Recent advances in EM sensor technology, including their ability to be easily
    automated and the lower cost of recently developed capacitance and frequency EM
    sensors, have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art
    soil moisture sensing devices (Blonquist et al., 2006). Several studies investigated
    the use of EM sensors in novel automated irrigation management applications (Blonquist
    et al., 2006, Coates et al., 2006, Dukes et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2009, Kim and
    Evans, 2009, Miralles-Crespo and van Iersel, 2011). In these studies significant
    water savings in comparison with traditional irrigation scheduling approaches,
    as high as 60%, were reported. However, a still unanswered question is how sensor
    positioning and accuracy may affect irrigation efficiency in soil moisture based
    automated irrigation scheduling systems. The wetting profile in the root zone
    of irrigated crops is dynamic and influenced by crop and irrigation system parameters
    such as soil hydraulic properties, irrigation system characteristics (e.g. emitter
    flow rate), root length and structure, and even mulch type when mulches are used.
    Especially in the case of drip irrigation, the non-uniform water distribution
    patterns about drippers make soil water sensor placement a key factor in the performance
    of soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling schemes (Coelho and Or, 1996).
    More specifically, poor sensor positioning that is not representative of the soil
    moisture conditions in the root zone can result either in crop water stress, or
    in over-irrigation that negates the water saving capabilities of soil moisture
    scheduling (Stieber and Shock, 1995, Coelho and Or, 1996, Schroder et al., 2005,
    Wang et al., 2012). However, many of the available guidelines for sensor placement
    were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments. Soil moisture
    sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting the efficiency of
    soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling systems. Several recent studies
    on the performance of new electrical capacitance and frequency EM sensors extensively
    discuss issues of sensor-to-sensor variability and sensor accuracy (e.g. Seyfried
    and Murdock, 2004, Kargas and Kerkides, 2008, Kizito et al., 2008, Parsons and
    Bandaranayake, 2008, Kargas and Soulis, 2012). Regarding the sensor-to-sensor
    variability, variations as high as 0.04 cm3 cm−3 are being reported. In most cases
    the sensors accuracy when the factory calibration equations are used ranges between
    0.03 cm3 cm−3 and 0.04 cm3 cm−3. However, using soil specific calibration the
    accuracy can be significantly improved, reaching 0.01 cm3 cm−3 or even better.
    It should be noted that the above general figures may vary among the various sensors
    technologies and models. One of the most important aspects of studying soil moisture
    based drip irrigation scheduling schemes in the case of drip irrigation systems,
    is the determination of the soil moisture patterns formed under the emitter. Wetting
    patterns can be obtained either experimentally, which are case specific, or by
    simulation using suitable mathematical models. In most of these models, the Richards
    equation is used to simulate soil water matric potential or water content distribution
    during drip irrigation. Both numerical and analytical methods are used to solve
    the Richards flow equation (Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Several analytical solutions
    have been developed for the linearized form of the flow equation (Lomen and Warrick,
    1974, Warrick and Lomen, 1976, Ben-Asher et al., 1978). Chen et al. (2009) obtained
    a series of closed-form analytical solutions for the water content distribution
    during trickle irrigation under either a single line source flux or multiple line
    sources. However, the application of analytical solutions is limited given the
    various assumptions needed (Coelho and Or, 1996). Therefore, numerical simulation
    models are used more often to analyze soil water dynamics under surface drip irrigation
    (e.g. Šimůnek et al., 1999, Vrugt et al., 2001, Elmaloglou and Malamos, 2005,
    Šimůnek et al., 2006, Elmaloglou and Diamantopoulos, 2008a, Elmaloglou and Diamantopoulos,
    2008b, Diamantopoulos and Elmaloglou, 2012, Elmaloglou et al., 2013, Elmaloglou
    and Soulis, 2013). In a recent study Dabach et al. (2013) investigated irrigation
    scheduling by combining the results of HYDRUS 2D/3D simulations with experimental
    data for the case of matric head triggered drip irrigation systems in order to
    optimize their main operational parameters, i.e. irrigation thresholds and water
    amounts. In their study the merits of using numerical simulation models in studying
    sensor based irrigation management were highlighted as well. In this context the
    main objective of this study is to investigate how soil moisture sensors positioning
    and accuracy may affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation
    scheduling systems under various conditions (soil types, potential evapotranspiration
    rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths, drip line spacing). For this purpose
    several numerical experiments were carried out using a mathematical model, which
    incorporates hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve, evaporation from
    the soil surface, and water extraction by roots (Elmaloglou and Diamantopoulos,
    2008a, Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Furthermore, a system-dependent boundary condition
    was implemented into the mathematical model considering changing conditions in
    specific locations of the flow domain in order to simulate soil moisture based
    automated drip irrigation scheduling systems. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. The
    mathematical model In order to study how soil moisture sensor positioning and
    accuracy affects the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation
    scheduling systems, the soil moisture patterns formed under the emitters for various
    conditions and various configurations of the studied system were determined using
    the mathematical model presented by Elmaloglou et al. (2013), which simulates
    soil water dynamics under surface drip irrigation from equidistance line sources.
    This mathematical model incorporates hysteresis in the soil water characteristic
    curve, evaporation from the soil surface, and water extraction by roots. Furthermore,
    due to the fact that the code of the model was developed in-house, it was possible
    to implement a system-dependent boundary condition considering changing conditions
    in specific locations of the flow domain, which correspond to the soil moisture
    sensors positions. In this manner it was made possible to simulate the operation
    of an automated soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling system for several
    irrigation cycles. In Fig. 1a graphical representation of the three-dimensional
    physical model is illustrated. As it can be seen, surface drip irrigation is applied
    from horizontal line sources, of width 2x0. In the same figure, the laterals spacing,
    which in this study was selected equal to 60 cm and 80 cm, the crop rows, and
    the two-dimensional spatial distribution of the active root zone, are also shown.
    The width of the plant root system is minimal on the surface and increases with
    depth up to 20 cm, where it acquires its maximum width. Then the width is reduced
    up to 60 cm, which is equal to the root zone depth. The spatial distribution of
    the active root zone was selected to represent a normal rooting pattern for various
    crops suited by drip irrigation systems (e.g. beans, tomato, potato, cucumber,
    and other vegetable crops) (FAO, 1989, FAO, 1998, Machado and Oliveira, 2005).

    (a), and the discretization of the computational domain, which corresponds to
    the rectangle ABFE (b). This figure was created based on the corresponding figure
    presented by Elmaloglou et al. (2013). The plane flow symmetry allows for the
    physical model to be examined in one of the infinite vertical planes, which are
    perpendicular to the length of the line sources, and are determined from the x
    and z axes. In Fig. 1b, the discretization of the computational domain, which
    corresponds to the rectangle ABFE of Fig. 1a, is illustrated. The space steps
    Δx, Δz that were used for the numerical solution of the mathematical model were
    taken equal to 2 cm. The phenomenon of hysteresis in the soil water characteristic
    curve is incorporated in the mathematical model with the simplification made by
    Kool and Parker (1987) for the empirical model of Scott et al. (1983). More specifically,
    it was assumed that αd = αw/2, where aw and ad are the values of the a parameter
    in the relationship of van Genuchten (1980) for the main wetting and drying curve,
    as proposed by Kool and Parker (1987). Lastly, the mathematical model was successfully
    validated against an existing analytical solution and the Hydrus 2D numerical
    model as described in detail by Elmaloglou et al. (2013). 2.2. Simulation inputs
    In this study, the cases of two homogenous soil profiles consisting of loamy sand
    (LS) and silt (Si), respectively, were examined. The hydraulic properties of these
    soils were taken from the Rosetta database (Schaap and Leij, 1998). The soil hydraulic
    properties are modeled using the van Genuchten–Mualem constitutive relationships
    (Mualem, 1976, van Genuchten, 1980) as follows: (1) and (2) where Θs is the saturated
    water content (L3 L−3); Θr is the residual water content (L3 L−3); Ks is the saturated
    hydraulic conductivity (L T−1); and α (L−1), n (−), and m (−) are shape parameters.
    The Se is the effective saturation (dimensionless) (0 < Se < 1). The values of
    the parameters included in the van Genuchten equations are summarized in Table
    1. The unique K(Θ) relation for each soil type always follows from the parameter
    set (n, Θs, Θr, Ks) according to Eq. (2) (Kroes et al., 2008). The values of the
    initial volumetric water content Θi are 0.164 cm3 cm−3 for the loamy sand and
    0.198 cm3 cm−3 for the silt soil, respectively. The above values were chosen so
    that for time t = 0, both soils had the same value of effective saturation (Se
    = 33.7%). This Se value corresponds to initial hydraulic conductivity values small
    enough to minimize redistribution due to gravity. The corresponding pressure head
    values (−120 cm for the loamy sand and −756 cm for the silt soil) are well above
    the wilting point and are not related to significant crop water stress (water
    stress response according to Feddes et al. (1978), a(H) ≈ 1). More details can
    be found in Elmaloglou et al. (2013). Table 1. Values of the shape parameter (n),

    value at the respective sensor position reached the initial soil moisture value.
    Dabach et al. (2013) demonstrated the effect of irrigation thresholds on the irrigation
    efficiency of matric head triggered irrigation systems. Therefore, test simulations
    with different Se values were also performed. These tests provided similar results,
    at least as related to the effect of sensor positioning and accuracy, which are
    the main topics of this study. The potential evapotranspiration rate at any time
    point (mm h−1) , is calculated by distributing the daily potential evapotranspiration
    (mm day−1) over a 24-h period (Vellidis and Smajstrla, 1992). A sinusoidal type
    distribution is used: (3) where is the period of the cycle (h), in this case 24
    h, and is the current time on the 24-h clock minus the beginning time of the cycle
    (h). Early in the growing season, soil evaporation is the highest part of the
    total evapotranspiration, but it gradually decreases as the plants grow and the
    canopy closes. However, even under a fully closed canopy, some soil evaporation
    occurs. In fully developed crops, transpiration is the dominant part of the total
    evapotranspiration, ranging between 80% and 90% of the latter (Bufon et al., 2012).
    The actual transpiration rate of a given crop is influenced by many factors, including
    crop type, soil and plant management practices, irrigation regime, climatic conditions,
    plant growth stage, plant genetic characteristics, leaf orientation, leaf age,
    etc. Accordingly, the daily potential evapotranspiration was partitioned into
    daily potential evaporation and daily potential transpiration , so that the ratio
    have a value around 0.14, which corresponds to average real conditions for a fully
    developed crop in semi-arid regions. In this study, two different potential evapotranspiration
    rates were investigated. The higher rate was selected to be equal to 8.4 mm day−1,
    which is an acceptable value for a fully developed crop in the dry period and
    in semi-arid regions. The lower value was selected to be equal to 4.2 mm day−1
    in order to test the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy
    under intermediate conditions in comparison to the more extreme case of the higher
    potential evapotranspiration rate. 2.3. Numerical experiments As it was previously
    stated, recent progress in EM sensor technology promoted the broader application
    of automated irrigation scheduling using soil moisture sensing devices (Blonquist
    et al., 2006). Considering also the problems of matric head sensors that limited
    the wider application of automated irrigation scheduling up to now (Smajstrla
    and Koo, 1986, Dukes and Scholberg, 2005, Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005), the case
    of soil moisture based automated irrigation scheduling is examined in this study.
    Furthermore, soil moisture triggered drip irrigation systems can be more consistently
    modelled through the implementation of a system-dependent boundary condition when
    hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve is considered. In the case of
    matric head triggered drip irrigation systems the triggering matric head value
    corresponds to different soil moisture values in the drying and the wetting curves
    due to the phenomenon of hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve, thus
    complicating the modelling of such systems. Soil water distribution under drip
    irrigation is mainly affected by the hydraulic properties of the soil, the drip
    lines discharge rate, the irrigation depth, the drip lines spacing and the root
    water uptake spatial and temporal distribution. As it was already mentioned above,
    two soil types (loamy sand and silt) and two potential evapotranspiration rates
    (8.4 and 4.2 mm day−1) were investigated. Furthermore, the effect of soil moisture
    sensors positioning and accuracy was investigated for two discharge rates (2 and
    4 l m−1 h−1), for two irrigation depths (30 and 40 mm), and for two laterals spacings
    (60 cm and 80 cm). Usually, soil moisture sensing devices were used to initiate
    a preset timed irrigation event; therefore, the irrigation event was stopped after
    a preprogrammed irrigation time (corresponding to a specific irrigation depth)
    rather than after specific soil moisture conditions were met (Phene and Howell,
    1984, Smajstrla and Koo, 1986, Clark et al., 1994, Torre-Neto et al., 2000, Dukes
    and Scholberg, 2005). For the above combinations corresponding to various conditions
    and irrigation system configurations, the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning
    was investigated by simulating the operation of an automated soil moisture based
    scheduling system and by calculating the corresponding irrigation efficiency for
    different sensor positions. The simulated sensor positions are illustrated in
    Fig. 1a. The various positions were selected to represent a wide range of possible
    sensor placement options including the most commonly used practices (Stieber and
    Shock, 1995, Coelho and Or, 1996, Schroder et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2012). As
    it was already mentioned, soil moisture sensors accuracy may also be an important
    factor affecting the efficiency of soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling
    systems. Therefore, in order to investigate the magnitude of sensors accuracy
    impact a final set of numerical experiments was carried out. In these numerical
    experiments two levels of sensor errors were examined. A higher error level was
    selected equal to ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 so as to correspond to the accuracy of most EM
    sensors using the factory calibration equations under normal conditions, while
    the lower error level was selected equal to ±0.01 cm3 cm−3 so as to correspond
    to the accuracy of most EM sensors using the soil specific calibration equations
    (Seyfried and Murdock, 2004, Kargas and Kerkides, 2008, Kizito et al., 2008, Parsons
    and Bandaranayake, 2008, Kargas and Soulis, 2012). In this approach the previously
    described combinations of conditions and irrigation system configurations were
    simulated supposing a systematic error of +0.03, −0.03, +0.01, and −0.01 cm3 cm−3.
    In total more than 200 numerical experiments were carried out. The main combinations
    investigated are presented in Table 2. Table 2. The main simulated cases for the
    investigated characteristics in the performed numerical experiments. Characteristic

    investigated, a period corresponding to eight irrigation cycles was simulated
    in order to diminish the influence of the initial conditions on the result obtained.
    The length of each irrigation cycle varied according to the various conditions
    (soil types, potential evapotranspiration rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths,
    drip line spacings) and the various sensor positions and accuracy values simulated
    and it ranged between 72 h and 120 h for = 8.4 mm day−1 and between 140 h and
    232 h for = 4.2 mm day−1. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Suitable sensor positions
    The main parameters characterizing irrigation performance such as deep percolation,
    irrigation efficiency in terms of actual transpiration, and actual evaporation
    were calculated for each case investigated. In this process the variation of soil
    moisture below 60 cm plus the water drained out from the bottom boundary are considered
    as deep percolation. Furthermore, the irrigation efficiency is defined as the
    ratio of the depth of irrigation water that is beneficially used by the plants
    to the depth of irrigation water applied (On Farm Irrigation Committee, 1978,
    Irmak et al., 2011). The main results of the numerical experiments considering
    the high potential evapotranspiration rate of 8.4 mm day−1 and the high drip line
    discharge rate of 4 l m−1 h−1 are presented in Table 3, however, the following
    analysis is based on the results of all the numerical experiments described in
    Table 2. As it was expected, irrigation efficiency varies considerably according
    to the drip line spacing, the irrigation depth, and the soil type. More specifically,
    irrigation efficiency increases with decreasing drip line spacing (the observed
    difference ranges between about 2.7% and 8.8%) and with decreasing irrigation
    depth (the observed difference ranges between about 1.4% and 9.7%). As it can
    be also observed irrigation efficiency is lower for the coarse soil (loamy sand)
    in all cases studied due to the higher deep percolation losses. The above results
    are in agreement with results presented in other similar studies e.g. (Khan et
    al., 1996, Cote et al., 2003, Li et al., 2003, Souza and Matsura, 2003, Elmaloglou
    and Diamantopoulos, 2010, Selim et al., 2012, Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Furthermore,
    the observed differences in irrigation efficiency are more significant for the
    case of the coarse soil (loamy sand). By contrast, drip line discharge rate was
    found to have a limited effect on irrigation efficiency, therefore, only the results
    considering the high drip line discharge rate are presented in Table 3. Considering
    the main question of this study, which is related to the effect of soil moisture
    sensors positioning on irrigation efficiency, a notable variation of irrigation
    efficiency among the various positions investigated was observed. In many cases,
    this variation was greater than the variation among the various irrigation system
    configurations. As an example, the irrigation efficiency related to the various
    sensor positions in the case of the loamy sand soil, the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, and the 60 cm drip line spacing ranged between
    89.7% (sensor position X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) and 73% (sensor position X = 1 cm,
    Z = 30 cm), while the irrigation efficiency related to the various irrigation
    system configurations for the loamy sand soil and for the more suitable sensor
    position (X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) ranged between 89.7% and 77.9%. The corresponding
    irrigation efficiency values for the case of the silt soil ranged between 93.7%
    and 78.7% and 93.7% and 86.4%, respectively. This observation highlights the importance
    of the proper positioning of the soil moisture sensors driving automated irrigation
    scheduling systems. However, when nearby sensor positions are examined, the observed
    differences are lower and in some cases they are negligible. Table 3. Sensor positions

    rate of 4 l m−1 h−1 and the high potential evapotranspiration rate of 8.4 mm day−1.

    so as to be compatible. The irrigation efficiency variations observed among the
    investigated sensor positions noticeably vary among the irrigation system configurations
    and soil types studied. In order to quantify this variability, the standard deviations
    of the irrigation efficiencies corresponding to the various sensor positions for
    each irrigation system configuration and soil type were calculated (Table 3).
    The calculated standard deviations ranged from 5.8% for the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the loamy sand soil, for both drip line spacings
    to 2.8% for the 2 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 40 mm irrigation depth, for 60
    cm drip line spacing, for both soils. The higher standard deviations are observed
    in the case of the coarse soil (loamy sand) and especially for the case of the
    higher discharge rate. These observations may be attributed to the variation of
    the representativeness of the sensor readings according to its position, which
    is examined in more detail in the next section. Furthermore, higher standard deviations
    are related to conditions favoring the vertical movement of the wetting front
    through the soil profile e.g. coarse soils (Khan et al., 1996, Cote et al., 2003,
    Li et al., 2003, Souza and Matsura, 2003, Elmaloglou and Malamos, 2005, Elmaloglou
    and Diamantopoulos, 2010, Elmaloglou et al., 2013). Besides the above mentioned
    irrigation efficiency variability among the various cases studied, it was observed
    that the most suitable position was 11 cm from the drip line and 10 cm below the
    soil surface (X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) in all cases studied. Generally, sensor positions
    20 cm from the soil surface or deeper are related to noticeably lower irrigation
    efficiencies. When the sensors are positioned more deeply in the soil profile
    soil evaporation is reduced; however, this reduction cannot balance the increased
    deep percolation values due to increased soil water content values at the lower
    part of the root zone (Table 3), leading to more frequent irrigations. A characteristic
    example is presented in Fig. 2, where the soil water content spatial distribution
    patterns for a shallower (X = 11 cm, Z = 10 cm) and a deeper (X = 11 cm, Z = 30
    cm) sensor position for the case of the loamy sand soil, the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge
    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, and the 60 cm drip line spacing, in three representative
    times (last irrigation cycle, ti = end of irrigation, tend just before irrigation,
    tmid in-between time) are illustrated. Furthermore, it was observed that sensor
    positions directly under the emitters are also linked to lower efficiencies (Table
    3). It should be noted that in tests carried out for positions further away from
    the drip line or deeper in the soil profile than the positions presented here,
    irrigation efficiency drops considerably. Download : Download full-size image

    h−1 discharge rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the 60 cm drip line spacing, and
    the high potential evapotranspiration rate of 8.4 mm day−1 in three representative
    times (last irrigation cycle, ti = end of irrigation, tend just before irrigation,
    tmid in-between time). The main conclusions obtained for the lower potential evapotranspiration
    rate of 4.2 mm day−1 were similar to that of the higher potential evapotranspiration
    rate analyzed above. However, irrigation efficiencies are generally lower in all
    cases due to higher deep percolation losses. As it was expected, soil evaporation
    is reduced due to the lower potential evapotranspiration rate; however these reductions
    are generally low. Finally, noticeable irrigation efficiency variations between
    the investigated sensor positions are still present, but the calculated standard
    deviation values are lower. 3.2. Representative sensor positions At a second step
    of analysis, it was investigated how soil moisture sensors positioning influences
    the representativeness of their readings regarding to the average soil water content
    in the root zone. In this analysis the readings of hypothetical soil moisture
    sensors located in several positions in the root zone were compared with the corresponding
    average soil water content in the root zone. The results obtained for the case
    of the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, and the 80 cm drip
    line spacing for both soils studied and for both ETp rates are presented in Table
    4. As it can be clearly seen in this table, there is a considerable variability
    in the sensors’ representativeness according to their positioning. In the same
    table it can be seen that sensors’ representativeness may vary according to the
    soil hydraulic properties or the meteorological conditions. Additional numerical
    experiments data indicated that sensors’ representativeness may also vary according
    to the irrigation system configuration. This is an important finding as it highlights
    the significance of proper soil moisture sensors positioning according to each
    application''s requirements. This information could be proven valuable in irrigation
    management or in other applications requiring the monitoring of soil water content.
    The ability of computer models to serve as an efficient tool for the detailed
    investigation of sensors positioning schemes is a significant outcome as well.

    rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate, and the 60 cm drip
    line spacing for both studied soils is provided in Fig. 3. As it can be observed,
    in the case of loamy sand soil the most representative position was 11 cm from
    the drip line and 30 cm below the soil surface (X = 11 cm, Z = 30 cm). As it can
    be also observed, the readings of shallower sensor positions are characterized
    by steep rises and drops as they are influenced more directly by the soil surface
    conditions (irrigation, evapotranspiration), while conditions at the readings
    of deeper sensor positions are generally smoother. A similar behavior can be observed
    for the case of silt soil; however, in this case the most representative position
    was between the positions located 1 cm from the drip line and 20 cm below the
    soil surface and 11 cm from the drip line and 30 cm below the soil surface. Taking
    also into account the results for both soils presented in Table 4, it can be presumed
    that in conditions favoring slower water movement in the soil profile (e.g. finer
    soils or more uniform soil water content patterns) the most representative sensor
    positions are located nearer to the soil surface and to the plane of symmetry
    AE defined by the emitter (Fig. 1). A general observation considering the above
    results and the results regarding irrigation efficiency presented in the previous
    section is that in some cases the most representative sensor position is not necessarily
    linked to the best irrigation efficiency. As it was described in the previous
    section, deeper sensor positions are related to increased soil water content values
    at the lower part of the root zone. Therefore, in some cases that deep percolation
    is the most significant loss, the best irrigation efficiency is achieved for sensor
    positions a little higher than the most representative sensor position. On the
    other hand, irrigation efficiency is not the only decision parameter. As an example,
    crop stress as well as excessive irrigation may cause yield decreases relative
    to optimum irrigation amounts. Therefore, more representative sensor readings
    facilitate irrigation management as they provide more accurate information about
    the average conditions at the root zone. This observation highlights the complexity
    of the studied issue and the need for a detailed investigation for each particular
    application considering the specific conditions (e.g. soil, crop, irrigation system
    characteristics) and in relation to the applied irrigation management practices.

    4 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 30 mm irrigation depth, the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate,
    and the 60 cm drip line spacing, for (a) the loamy sand soil, and (b) the silt
    soil (Only the last irrigation cycle is presented). In practice a great variety
    of soil moisture sensor types with different characteristics (e.g. volume of influence,
    measurement range, accuracy) and configurations (e.g. number of sensors, placement)
    are used (Stieber and Shock, 1995, Coelho and Or, 1996, Schroder et al., 2005,
    Dukes et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2009, Zotarelli et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012,
    Miller et al., 2014). However, the above results highlight the need for a more
    detailed study for each specific case. Numerical modelling can be proven an additional
    valuable tool in this effort. 3.3. Sensor accuracy In order to investigate the
    sensors accuracy effect on the efficiency of soil moisture sensor based irrigation
    scheduling systems a set of numerical experiments was carried out assuming two
    levels of sensor errors as it was described in Section 2.3. The obtained results
    concerning the lower error level (±0.01 cm3 cm−3) indicated that there is a noticeable
    but generally limited effect. More specifically, the effect of this error level
    on irrigation efficiency ranged between 4.5% and 6.4% for the loamy sand soil
    and between 2.5% and 4.5% for the silt soil for the cases investigated. Similar
    results were obtained for the deep percolation and the evaporation losses. By
    contrast, more significant effects were observed in the case of the higher error
    level (±0.03 cm3 cm−3). More specifically, in the numerical experiments where
    the sensors underestimated soil water content by 0.03 cm3 cm−3 (i.e. the actual
    soil water contents were 0.03 cm3 cm−3 higher than the sensor readings), irrigation
    efficiency decrease varied between 15.7% and 18.7% for the loamy sand soil and
    between 10.2% and 12.9% for the silt soil for the cases investigated. On the contrary,
    in the numerical experiments where the sensors overestimated soil water content
    by 0.03 cm3 cm−3 (i.e. the actual soil water contents were 0.03 cm3 cm−3 lower
    than the sensor readings) deep percolation and soil evaporation losses dropped
    due to the lower soil water content values in the soil profile with positive results
    on irrigation efficiency. However, in this case, crop stress increased considerably
    (actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration ratios dropped) having
    as a possible effect serious crop production losses. Likewise, excessive irrigation
    may as well cause yield decreases relative to optimum irrigation amounts (Locascio
    et al., 1989, Sezen et al., 2006, Ngouajio et al., 2007). As an example, the soil
    water content spatial distribution patterns at the end of the final irrigation
    cycle for the case of the 4 l m−1 h−1 discharge rate, the 40 mm irrigation depth,
    the 60 cm drip line spacing, and the 8.4 mm day−1 ETp rate, for both soils studied
    are presented in Fig. 4 supposing a systematic error of +0.02 cm3 cm−3 (the actual
    soil water contents are 0.02 cm3 cm−3 higher than the sensor readings) and −0.02
    cm3 cm−3 (the actual soil water contents are 0.02 cm3 cm−3 lower than the sensor
    readings), which lies in-between the examined cases, in comparison to the standard
    case (no error). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Illustration of the

    sand soil, and (b) the silt soil, supposing a systematic error of +0.02 cm3 cm−3
    and −0.02 cm3 cm−3 in comparison to the standard case (no error). It should be
    noted that error levels of about ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 are generally optimistic for many
    EM sensors using the factory calibration equations under normal conditions and
    in specific cases it may even be as high as ±0.05 cm3 cm−3 (Seyfried and Murdock,
    2004, Kargas and Kerkides, 2008, Kizito et al., 2008, Parsons and Bandaranayake,
    2008, Kargas and Soulis, 2012). Therefore, taking also into consideration the
    above results, it can be concluded that soil specific calibration of the EM sensors
    used in soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems is a fundamental
    requirement. 4. Summary and conclusions In this study the effect of soil moisture
    sensors positioning and accuracy on the performance of soil moisture based surface
    drip irrigation scheduling systems under various conditions (soil types, potential
    evapotranspiration rates, discharge rates, irrigation depths) was investigated
    using a mathematical model, which incorporates hysteresis in the soil water characteristic
    curve, evaporation from the soil surface, and water extraction by roots. The use
    of a custom-made mathematical model allows the comparison of the obtained results
    with those of other similar models. Therefore, more reliable conclusions about
    important design and operation parameters of drip irrigation systems can be made.
    In addition, there is increased flexibility in the approach of the various irrigation
    problems due to the fact that the code of the model was developed in-house and
    therefore there is possibility for further development including the implementation
    of a system-dependent boundary condition into the mathematical model considering
    changing conditions in specific locations of the flow domain in order to be able
    to simulate soil moisture sensors based drip irrigation scheduling and to achieve
    the main goals of this study. The model was successfully validated against an
    existing analytical solution and the state of the art Hydrus 2D numerical model.
    The effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was investigated by simulating
    the operation of an automated soil moisture based scheduling system for a coarser
    and a finer soil, for a high and a low potential evapotranspiration rate, for
    two discharge rates, and for two irrigation depths. Furthermore, the effect of
    sensors accuracy was investigated for the same combinations of conditions and
    irrigation system configurations for two sensors accuracy levels. The results
    of the numerical experiments considering the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning
    on irrigation efficiency indicate that in many cases irrigation efficiency varies
    considerably among the different positions investigated. Furthermore, it was observed
    that in many cases, this variation was greater than the variation among the various
    irrigation system configurations. However, the observed irrigation efficiency
    variations for the investigated sensor positions noticeably differ for the irrigation
    system configurations and soil types studied. Generally, it was found that higher
    variations were related to conditions favoring the vertical movement of the wetting
    front through the soil profile. The above conclusions were valid for both potential
    evapotranspiration rates studied. However, irrigation efficiencies were generally
    lower in the case of the low potential evapotranspiration rate due to higher deep
    percolation losses. Furthermore, noticeable irrigation efficiency variations among
    the investigated sensor positions were observed for both potential evapotranspiration
    rates, but the variability is lower in the case of the low potential evapotranspiration
    rate. The above results highlight the significance of the proper positioning of
    the soil moisture sensors driving automated irrigation scheduling systems. Besides
    the above mentioned irrigation efficiency variability among the various cases
    studied, it was observed that the most suitable position was 11 cm from the drip
    line and 10 cm below the soil surface. Generally, sensor positions 20 cm from
    the soil surface or deeper were related to noticeably lower irrigation efficiencies.
    However, it should be noted that when nearby sensor positions were examined, the
    observed differences were generally low and in some cases negligible. When the
    influence of soil moisture sensors positioning on the representativeness of their
    readings regarding to the average soil water content in the root zone was considered,
    a clear effect was observed. It was also found that the effect of sensors positioning
    varies according to the soil hydraulic properties, the meteorological conditions,
    and the irrigation system configuration. These results further support the importance
    of proper soil moisture sensors positioning according to each application requirements
    (e.g. irrigation management or other applications requiring the monitoring of
    soil water content). Finally, concerning the effect of sensors accuracy on the
    efficiency of soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling systems, it was
    found that while the lower error level (±0.01 cm3 cm−3) had an obvious but generally
    limited effect (between 2.5% and 6.4%), the higher error level (±0.03 cm3 cm−3)
    had a critical effect (between 10.2% and 18.7%). Considering that error levels
    of about ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 are generally optimistic for many EM sensors using the
    factory calibration equations, the need of soil specific calibration of the EM
    sensors used in soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems
    is highlighted. Concluding, the results of this study provide clear evidence that
    soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation
    efficiency in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. More importantly,
    it was found that sensor accuracy could be a critical factor for the successful
    implementation of soil moisture sensor based irrigation scheduling systems. It
    should be also noted that in this study the effects of sensor positioning and
    accuracy were separately investigated. Therefore, even in cases that the observed
    errors for each of these two factors were not important, the synergistic effect
    of both factors could be more important. It was also found that a detailed study
    taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation systems,
    scheduling systems, as well as soil moisture sensors will provide a sound basis
    for improved irrigation scheduling. Lastly, the ability of computer models to
    serve as an efficient tool for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning
    schemes or other automated scheduling system characteristics is a significant
    outcome of this study as well. Acknowledgements The authors wish to sincerely

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: In California
    and other regions vulnerable to water shortages, satellite-derived estimates of
    key hydrologic fluxes can support agricultural producers and water managers in
    maximizing the benefits of available water supplies. The Satellite Irrigation
    Management Support (SIMS) project combines NASA''s Terrestrial Observation and
    Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery, and surface sensor
    networks to map indicators of crop irrigation demand and develop information products
    to support irrigation management and other water use decisions. TOPS-SIMS provides
    the computing and data processing systems required to support automated, near
    real-time integration of observations from satellite and surface sensor networks,
    and generates data and information in formats that are convenient for agricultural
    producers, water managers, and other end users. Using the TOPS modeling framework
    to integrate data from multiple sensor networks in near real-time, SIMS currently
    maps crop fractional cover, basal crop coefficients, and basal crop evapotranspiration.
    Map products are generated at 30 m resolution on a daily basis over approximately
    4 million ha of California farmland. TOPS-SIMS is a fully operational prototype,
    and a publicly available beta-version of the web interface is being pilot tested
    by farmers, irrigation consultants, and water managers in California. Data products
    are distributed via dynamic web services, which support both visual mapping and
    time-series queries, to allow users to obtain information on spatial and temporal
    patterns in crop canopy development and water requirements. TOPS-SIMS is an application
    framework that demonstrates the value of integrating multi-disciplinary Earth
    observation systems to provide benefits for water resource management. Published

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction In the western US, substantial year-to-year variability
    in weather conditions complicates planning for water managers and agricultural
    producers, and makes it difficult to apply standard rule-of-thumb approaches to
    agricultural water management. In California, the recent three year drought, from
    2007–2009, underscored the vulnerability of the state''s agricultural industry
    to variability in water supply, with hundreds of millions in economic losses and
    thousands of agricultural jobs lost [1]. Concurrent with the drought, groundwater
    levels in the Central Valley declined substantially [2] as growers pumped water
    to partially offset reductions in surface water deliveries. Inter-annual variability
    in water supply is common throughout the western U.S., where growing urban populations,
    increases in water allocations for endangered species, and climate change—with
    predicted shifts in precipitation and reductions in winter snowpack in the Sierra
    and Rocky Mountains [3]–[5]— will continue to constrain water supplies for agricultural
    users. Because agriculture is typically the largest user of water in the West,
    maximizing the benefits of available agricultural water supplies is central to
    the implementation of drought mitigation and climate adaptation strategies in
    western states. Low cost adaptation strategies for agricultural water users include
    the use of irrigation scheduling technologies that incorporate information on
    weather conditions and crop growth stage. Satellite measurements of water resources
    and hydrologic fluxes have great potential for supporting agricultural producers
    and water managers working to optimize agricultural water supply and use. When
    combined with biophysical models, satellite observations can be applied to scale
    point observations from surface observation networks across larger geographic
    areas. Evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture data are particularly relevant
    to both operational water management and long-term planning. Surface measurements
    of these parameters are often difficult and expensive to collect, and generally
    available only from sparsely distributed observation networks. Recent advances
    in modeling and measurement of ET using satellite observations now enable moderate
    resolution (30–1000m), spatially continuous estimates of ET over large areas in
    near real-time [6]–[9]. Integration of this information into current water management
    practices and operational models, however, requires the development of frameworks
    for synthesizing data from multiple sensor networks to drive models for estimating
    evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and other key hydrologic reservoirs and fluxes.
    New approaches are also required for delivery of satellite-derived data and information
    products to water managers and agricultural producers. Table I Summary of Key
    Terms and Abbreviations One water management challenge where integration of ET
    models and sensor network observations has immediate potential utility is in supporting
    agricultural producers and water managers working to optimize irrigation management
    by accounting for current weather and crop conditions when making irrigation management
    decisions. In scheduling irrigation, growers must account for multiple factors,
    including soil type, salinity and leaching fraction, weather conditions and crop
    growth stage. In water limited regions, it is particularly important for growers
    to maximize on-farm water use efficiency by accounting for weather conditions
    in estimating crop water consumption and associated irrigation demand. A common
    method of irrigation scheduling involves estimation of crop water use by multiplying
    weather-based estimates of reference evapotranspiration ( ET o ) by crop coefficients
    ( K c ) for a particular crop. (A summary of key terms and definitions related
    to agricultural irrigation management is included in Table I.) ET o is defined
    as the evapotranspiration from a reference crop, typically a well-watered, actively
    growing grass or alfalfa of uniform height. In the western U.S., agricultural
    weather networks such as the California Irrigation Management Information System
    (CIMIS), AgriMet, and the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET) provide hourly
    information on weather conditions and ET o . Within California, CIMIS [10] currently
    operates 139 stations across the state and provides data to growers and irrigation
    consultants on ET o and weather conditions. Spatial CIMIS daily ET o data derived
    using the methods developed by Hart et al. [11] are available from 2003 to present
    at 2km spatial resolution statewide. The method uses cloud cover estimates derived
    from the GOES weather satellites to estimate the daily solar insolation for each
    pixel, and thus represents an initial integration of satellite and surface observations
    within CIMIS. Guideline crop coefficients have been compiled for several crops
    and are available from sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization Irrigation
    and Drainage Paper 56, commonly known as FAO-56 [12], the University of California''s
    Basic Irrigation Scheduler, the California Department of Water Resources'' Consumptive
    Use Program, and the Wateright system developed by California State University,
    Fresno. K c is a dimensionless value representing typical crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET c ) for a given crop canopy relative to ET o , and it captures the effect
    of crop growth stage on evaporative demand. K c integrates the effects of both
    crop transpiration and soil evaporation. Many growers use a dual-crop coefficient
    approach, which separates the evaporation and transpiration components of ET.
    The basal crop coefficient ( K cb ) represents conditions for an unstressed crop
    on a dry soil surface, and a separate coefficient is used to calculate soil evaporation
    ( K e ) if required. K cb can be used to calculate basal crop ET ( ET cb ) as
    a measure of plant transpiration for a non-stressed crop plus a small diffusive
    soil evaporation component. As such, ET cb also provides a measure of potential
    crop water use, or biological water demand for well-watered crops. While useful
    for seasonal planning, one limitation of this standard approach to operational
    irrigation management is that it requires growers to derive crop coefficients
    from look-up tables and then correct them for site-specific conditions. In addition,
    many crop coefficients were developed decades ago and may not account for current
    farming practices or local and interannual variability in weather conditions and
    crop development rates. Previous research conducted in California quantified the
    observed benefits of using information on ET in irrigation scheduling. This research
    compared applied irrigation and yields reported by growers on 55 farms before
    and after use of ET o data from CIMIS. Results from the study reported an average
    increase in yields of 8%, and a reduction in total applied irrigation of 13% [13],
    [14]. While it is difficult to fully control for the effect of year-to-year variability
    in weather on crop yields in these types of studies, this result suggests that
    during key phases in crop development, some growers may be irrigating to the point
    that the root zone becomes saturated, reducing oxygen availability in the root
    zone and modestly suppressing crop growth. Across the 13 different crop types
    evaluated, including tree and vine crops, vegetable crops, and field crops, growers
    reported total economic benefits from increased yields and reductions in applied
    water ranging from 110to 1,700 per hectare. Due in part to these benefits, use
    of CIMIS data in California has grown from about 450 primary registered CIMIS
    data users in 1987, to nearly 40,000 today. In the year 2010 alone, for example,
    ∼2million reports were generated from the CIMIS database. However, the most recent
    farm and ranch irrigation survey conducted by the USDA indicated that only 12%
    of growers in California utilize reports on daily crop-water ET in scheduling
    irrigation [15], due in part to the barriers described above. Development of an
    automated system for mapping crop coefficients and delivery of data to users would
    enhance the use of ET data in irrigation management. The California Department
    of Water Resources (CDWR) identified statewide mapping of crop coefficients in
    near-real-time as one of the high priority, short term needs for CIMIS [16]. In
    addition to ET o , observations of other parameters related to agricultural water
    management are increasingly available from surface sensor networks and satellites.
    Soil moisture information is available for a limited number of sites from the
    USDA Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). As the cost of soil moisture sensors
    has declined, an increasing number of specialty crop producers are also deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks in their operations. Satellite and aircraft remote
    sensing observations of crop canopies over agricultural regions are used by the
    USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to map crop types and fallowed
    acreage on an annual, post-season basis, and increasingly by individual growers
    to identify and map variations in crop canopy conditions that may be indicative
    of pest infestations, variations in soil texture, or irregularities in irrigation
    systems. Seasonal estimates of evapotranspiration from satellite-driven energy
    balance models such as the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) [17]
    and the Mapping EvapoTRanspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [18]
    model have also been used by water managers for water rights accounting to resolve
    disputes over water resources [19]. Integration of these data sources into current
    management practices and operational models presents a number of challenges, especially
    for applications that require information in near real-time. In addition to typical
    issues associated with processing large volumes of data from heterogeneous sources,
    data from the Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensors
    onboard the Landsat satellites must be atmospherically corrected to minimize artificial
    scene-to-scene variability resulting from the effects of aerosols, ozone, and
    water vapor. A hardware failure on the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument produces regularly
    spaced data gaps that must be addressed. Differences in the spatial scale of different
    satellite sensors must be considered when fusing data from sensors such as Landsat
    TM and ETM+ (30 m–120 m) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) (250 m–1 km) to reduce data gaps due to clouds and improve data reliability.
    Data from surface sensor networks are valuable for calibrating and scaling satellite-driven
    models, but they must be retrieved and transformed into formats that can be ingested
    by various models. At present, a number of satellite-driven energy balance models
    (including SEBAL and METRIC) for estimation of ET also require manual intervention
    to select “cold” and “hot” anchor pixels that serve to constrain the calculation
    of ET, making it difficult to fully automate operation of these models, though
    work by Kjaersgaard et al. [20] shows progress towards resolving this problem.
    As a result of these issues, the full potential of satellite data for supporting
    water managers and agricultural producers has yet to be fully realized. The NASA
    Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) [21] provides a modeling
    and computing framework for integrating satellite and surface observations in
    near real-time to address many of the challenges described above. In the following
    sections, we describe an application of the TOPS framework to develop a system
    for near real-time mapping of crop canopy conditions and associated crop irrigation
    requirements at the resolution of individual fields. To support continued improvements
    in management of agricultural water supplies, the data processing system is designed
    to provide growers and water managers with frequent, accurate, and easily available
    information that includes key indicators of crop canopy development and crop water
    use requirements. SECTION II. A Framework for Satellite Irrigation Management
    Support Fig. 1. Overview of the TOPS-SIMS architecture with primary data inputs
    and outputs. Show All The TOPS Satellite Irrigation Management Support (TOPS-SIMS)
    framework integrates satellite observations from Landsat and MODIS with meteorological
    observations from CIMIS and ancillary data on crop type and site specific conditions
    (Fig. 1). The system employs a modular architecture to facilitate support for
    a wide range of models and data. The initial implementation provides a capability
    for mapping of fractional cover ( F c ) , associated basal crop coefficients (
    K cb ) , and evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) over 3.7 million ha of farmland in California''s
    Central Valley. F c and K cb are mapped every eight days, and ET cb maps are produced
    on a daily basis at spatial resolutions that are useful for irrigation management
    at the field level (30 m). Automated atmospheric correction and gap-filling algorithms
    are optimized for agricultural areas to provide a robust and reliable data stream.
    Information from TOPS-SIMS is distributed to water managers and agricultural producers
    via a browser-based irrigation management decision support system. Users may combine
    the supplied K cb or ET cb with formal or intuitive estimates of soil evaporation
    to derive total water consumption over the recent period at the field level. By
    accounting for the irrigation application rate, distribution uniformity, and any
    corrections for water replacement targets (e.g., intentional deficit irrigation
    or leaching requirement), users can translate TOPS-SIMS output into an irrigation
    management strategy. To evaluate the utility of the system for commercial farming
    operations, TOPS-SIMS estimates are compared against ET data collected by surface
    renewal stations [22] and information from wireless soil moisture sensor networks
    deployed in operational agricultural fields across California in cooperation with
    growers. The TOPS-SIMS architecture facilitates forecasting of potential consumptive
    use and associated irrigation demand with lead times of up to 1 week through integration
    of forecast data from the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted Reference
    Evapotranspiration system (FRET). This capability is particularly relevant for
    future extension of TOPS-SIMS to support both irrigation scheduling and water
    delivery planning. Finally, the TOPS-SIMS architecture is designed to support
    the future addition of other satellite-driven models for estimation of ET, soil
    moisture, and crop stress, all of which further the goal of improving water management
    and making irrigation scheduling more practical, convenient, and accurate. SECTION
    III. Methods TOPS, a NASA modeling and data assimilation framework developed to
    monitor and forecast environmental conditions, provides a range of capabilities
    for integrating observations from satellites and surface sensor networks via models
    including crop models, biogeochemical and carbon cycle models, ecological models,
    and numerical weather and climate models [21]. The TOPS framework has also been
    adapted to run on high-end computing resources in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing
    (NAS) facility as part of the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) [23]. NEX combines supercomputing
    resources, Earth system modeling, remote sensing data from NASA and other agencies,
    and a scientific social networking platform to deliver a complete work environment
    in which users can analyze large Earth science data sets, run modeling codes,
    collaborate on new or existing projects, and share results within and among communities.
    NEX provides direct access to the full archive of Landsat and MODIS data for the
    western U.S., as well as on-demand access to thousands of processing cores, facilitating
    rapid processing of both historic data archives and incoming satellite data. Leveraging
    these capabilities, TOPS-SIMS ingests Landsat-5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ , and MODIS
    satellite imagery for California''s Central Valley and other agricultural regions.
    Landsat provides the spatial resolution necessary to produce information at the
    scale of individual fields. The daily temporal resolution of MODIS provides a
    gap-filling capability to ensure data availability. Methods employed by the remote
    sensing community for satellite mapping of ET at field scales (30 m) rely primarily
    on energy balance models, e.g., [17], [18], [24], or reflectance-based mapping
    of crop coefficients, e.g., [25]–[28]; see also review by Gowda et al. [29]. Of
    these approaches, strategies for full automation at the scale of individual fields
    have only been developed for mapping of crop coefficients from surface reflectance,
    and thus the initial suite of algorithms implemented in the TOPS-SIMS framework
    relies on this approach. In the future, it may be possible to implement additional
    models, including energy balance models and models for downscaling of soil moisture
    estimates from satellite missions such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
    mission. Each Landsat scene is atmospherically corrected using software developed
    under the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) project
    [30]. LEDAPS incorporates the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer modeling approach
    of Vermote et al. [31], as included in the standard MODIS data processing chain.
    Landsat TM and ETM+ data are tiled onto a common grid to form an 8-day composite.
    This facilitates use of overlapping portions of each scene to increase the frequency
    of observations and reduce data gaps due to cloud cover. This compositing approach
    also reduces the effects of the ETM+ scan line correction error, as only the central
    portion of the Landsat 7 scenes are used, where the gaps are narrower. The next
    step is to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [32] from
    the composited Landsat scenes. NDVI is an index calculated from the red and near
    infrared wavelengths and provides a measure of photosynthetic capacity. At this
    stage, a suite of gap-filling algorithms are employed to ensure spatially continuous
    data over agricultural regions. Current algorithms include the use of moving window
    averages and linear interpolation to fill small data gaps over agricultural fields.
    Field boundaries available from many of the County Agricultural Commissioners''
    offices in California facilitate identification of MODIS 250 m NDVI pixels that
    are fully contained within agricultural field boundaries, and thus enable use
    of MODIS data to fill the majority of the remaining data gaps with reasonable
    accuracy. Use of the STAR-FM algorithm [33], as implemented within TOPS, can be
    employed to address any remaining gaps through fusion of Landsat and MODIS by
    disaggregating MODIS data to the Landsat scale. Prior to further processing, non-agricultural
    areas are masked out using the USDA NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL)1 [34] and field
    polygons from local County Agricultural Commissioner offices, when available.
    The CDL is also used to spatially differentiate annual crops from perennial orchards
    and vineyards. Following the compositing and gap-filling procedures, NDVI data
    are transformed to F c via empirical relationships developed by USDA and NASA.
    Johnson and Trout [35] and Trout et al. [36] collected field measurements of F
    c across multiple crop types in the Central Valley. These data were compared with
    satellite observations collected on the same day, and revealed a robust relationship
    between NDVI and F c (Fig. 2(a)). This approach is consistent with previous studies
    showing that various spectral vegetation indices, calculated from visible and
    near-infrared (NIR) reflectance data, are linearly related to canopy light interception
    [37]–[39]. To convert F c to K cb , TOPS-SIMS uses different approaches for retrospective
    versus near real-time mapping of K cb . For retrospective mapping of annual crops
    or for fields where information on the current crop type is available from the
    grower, F c is converted to K cb based on a physical description of the crop canopy
    [40]. A density coefficient ( K d ) , based on F c and estimated plant height,
    is calculated first to link increases in the crop coefficient with increasing
    vegetation amount. K d is then used to interpolate between the minimum and maximum
    K cb for a given crop type, as listed in FAO-56. Using methods described by Fig.
    2. Past studies conducted by USDA in collaboration with NASA [35], [36] provide
    the basis for linking NDVI to fractional cover using relationships that are robust
    across different crop types and canopy architectures ( R 2 =0.97) (a). In (b),
    use of a generalized equation (after methods of Allen and Pereira [40]) for converting
    fractional cover to FAO crop coefficients provides a robust approach for mapping
    K cb values for annual crops ( R 2 =0.90) . When the crop type at a particular
    location is specified or can be identified with confidence, crop specific equations
    may also be applied. Show All Allen and Pereira [40], a crop specific F c − K
    cb conversion can be applied retrospectively to a given field based on the CDL
    crop classification or information provided by the grower or farm manager. The
    CDL is not publicly available until after December 31 of each year, however, presenting
    a challenge for near real-time mapping of K cb using this approach. While the
    crop type for perennial fields (vineyards, orchards) can be reasonably determined
    from prior-year maps, the spatial distribution of annuals, such as lettuce, tomato,
    or cotton, is generally unknown within-season due to the complex and diverse nature
    of the agricultural cropping patterns throughout much of California. A generalized
    F c − K cb relationship representing a best-fit to crop specific relationships
    (Fig. 2(b)) is thus applied for near real-time mapping of fields deemed by CDL
    to contain annual crops. Use of this approach introduces K cb mean estimation
    uncertainty ranging from 3–14% across the major crop categories (vegetables, roots/tubers,
    legumes, fibers, oils, cereals). For perennial crops, results from multi-year
    studies recently performed on large weighing lysimeters at the University of California
    Kearney Agricultural Center are used for F c − K cb conversion [41], [42]. Both
    studies reported a strong relationship between mid-day canopy light interception,
    which is closely related to F c , and the crop coefficient. Finally, ET cb for
    both annuals and perennials is calculated as the product of K cb and ET o . For
    California, ET o is retrieved by TOPS-SIMS via FTP (file transfer protocol) from
    the standard Spatial CIMIS 2 km daily statewide ET o grids. Fig. 3. Examples of
    comparisons between profiles from TOPS-SIMS using generalized (solid blue line)
    and crop-specific (dashed blue line) relationships versus FAO-56 [12] (solid green
    line) for various crops during 2011. The comparisons highlight the ability of
    TOPS-SIMS to modify the idealized FAO-56 for observed crop cover and phenology
    as related to site-specific management practices and local weather conditions.
    Show All TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of deriving crop coefficients for estimating
    ET cb using an automated data integration and processing system, fully independent
    of contemporaneous crop type classification, and provides a framework for assimilating
    other sensor network observations and models to provide information on crop canopy
    conditions and ET. Crop coefficient values from the fully automated TOPS-SIMS
    compare well with crop coefficients derived from FAO-56 planning guidelines during
    initial growth and at near full cover, but can deviate during vegetative growth
    and maturation. Comparisons for individual fields highlight differences due to
    agronomic practices and crop response to site-specific weather conditions (Fig.
    3). For example, the seasonal profiles for tomatoes and cotton closely match the
    FAO-56 profiles when using a crop-specific formula to convert F c to K cb , while
    lettuce and watermelon were better characterized by the generalized F c − K cb
    conversion. Corn and wheat observations reveal different development rates and
    overall phenological progression than those of FAO. Johnson and Melton [43] also
    compared TOPS-SIMS ET cb estimates against ET c values from SEBAL, which employs
    a more complex energy-balance approach. SEBAL has been widely used to model ET
    over agricultural regions, but requires a highly trained analyst to manually perform
    the required calibrations and operate the model. TOPS-SIMS ET cb values compared
    favorably with SEBAL ET a estimates for unstressed crops for representative San
    Joaquin Valley crop types, with mean differences ranging from 0.4 to 0.85 mm/day
    (Fig. 4). SECTION IV. Integrating Satellite and Surface Sensor Networks With ET
    Models Automated integration of satellite observations of crop canopy development
    with surface observations of ET o is an important first step in developing a fully
    integrated sensor network or “system of systems” capable of providing estimates
    of ET and soil moisture derived from multiple data sources to water managers and
    agricultural producers. Integration of soil moisture observations from soil moisture
    sensor networks installed in agricultural fields is an important additional advance,
    as soil moisture observations can provide operational users with an independent
    check on a water balance derived from satellite ET cb estimates and field-specific
    irrigation and weather records. Integration of soil moisture data also provides
    a mechanism for future automation of model calibration to account for intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower. It is cost prohibitive to collect soil moisture
    observations across an entire field, but selective use of soil moisture sensors
    can increase confidence in satellite-derived estimates and facilitate use of satellite
    data to scale information derived from soil moisture observations over larger
    areas. Fig. 4. Comparison of daily water use estimates (mm) for unstressed San
    Joaquin Valley fields generated by two satellite-driven models (from Johnson and
    Melton [43]). Actual evapotranspiration ( ET a ) generated using the SEBAL surface
    energy balance approach. Basal evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Mean absolute error (MAE) in mm/day was calculated as a measure of model agreement,
    as shown. All dates 2009. Show All The cost of soil moisture sensors and wireless
    data loggers has declined substantially over the past decade, and there are now
    a number of commercially available options for growers interested in deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks. In addition, new cost effective techniques have
    been developed for measuring actual ET ( ET a ) in agricultural environments characterized
    by fields on the order of 10–40 hectares. While techniques such as the surface
    renewal approach [22] are still too expensive and complex for use by commercial
    farms growing specialty crops, field instrumentation has now become more cost
    effective, such that multiple sites can be monitored by water management agencies
    or small research teams providing important reference and validation data. To
    assist in understanding relationships between satellite estimates of ET cb and
    surface observations of ET a and soil moisture, we deployed soil moisture sensor
    webs on 12 commercial farms in the Central and Salinas Valleys, in research fields
    located at California State University Fresno in Fresno, CA, and at the University
    of California West Side Research and Extension Center in Five Points, CA. Sensors
    deployed included capacitance probes for volumentric soil water content measurement,
    soil water potential sensors, passive capillary lysimeters for measuring deep
    drainage, in-line flow meters for measuring total applied irrigation, aboveground
    pheno-cams (which record digital images of the field once per day), and meteorological
    stations. In collaboration with CDWR, we also deployed and operated above-ground
    surface renewal stations at seven sites in a range of crops to provide measurements
    of each component of the surface energy balance, facilitating calculation of ET
    a for each site. In surface renewal analysis, ET is calculated as the residual
    of a surface energy balance equation using measured net radiation, ground heat
    flux, and high-frequency measurements of air temperature [22]. These temperature
    traces exhibit low-frequency ramp-like structures which are used to calculate
    sensible heat flux. Surface renewal makes no assumptions regarding atmospheric
    stability, and is here combined with sonic anemometer data to account for unequal
    heating of air parcels across heterogeneous landscapes [44]. Integration of data
    from these sources has clear value for understanding spatial and temporal patterns
    in ET and soil moisture. Integration of satellite derived ET cb data with observations
    of volumetric soil water content and soil water potential has particular value
    for optimization of irrigation scheduling. Fig. 5(a) provides an example for a
    sub-surface drip irrigated cotton field located near Huron, CA. The satellite
    data provides information on the day-to-day crop water use under well-watered
    conditions, while the soil moisture sensors assist in identifying the onset of
    water stress and magnitude of deficit irrigation. The net water balance, or change
    in total estimated soil water content ( SWC e ) , is calculated as: Δ SWC e =P+I−D−
    ET cb View Source Fig. 5. To illustrate the benefits of integrating satellite
    estimates of ET cb with soil moisture measurements from surface sensor networks,
    measures of ET and soil moisture from different sources are plotted for a cotton
    field near Five Points, CA. Cumulative TOPS-SIMS ET cb (green line), combined
    total irrigation and precipitation (light-blue dashed line), net water balance
    (dark-blue dotted line), and observed volumetric soil water content (VWC, brown
    line) are plotted together in (a). On June 8, daily ET cb begins to exceed daily
    precipitation and applied irrigation as indicated by the negative slope of the
    net water balance line. By July 4 the cumulative water balance turns negative
    (indicating potential onset of plant water stress), and deficit irrigation is
    sustained through August. In (b), incorporation of a crop stress coefficient (
    K s ) of 0.85 to account for soil water limitations on plant transpiration from
    July 4 onward (solid green line) substantially improves agreement between ET cb
    estimates from TOPS-SIMS (dashed green line) and ET a measurements from a surface
    renewal station located in the field (solid dark-blue line). Show All where P
    is precipitation in mm measured by the on-site weather station; I is irrigation
    in mm, calculated as the average flow measured in two drip laterals and divided
    by effective irrigated area; D is drainage below the rooting zone measured with
    a Gee capillary lysimeter installed at a depth just below the rooting zone (120
    cm); and ET cb is the basal crop ET in mm. The daily measured volumetric soil
    water content (VWC) is calculated as the average of the volumetric water content
    measured using capacitance probes (Decagon 10 HS) installed at three depths (0–10
    cm, 35–45 cm, and 70–80 cm) at each of eight locations throughout the field. ET
    a is the measured ET from the surface renewal station located in the center of
    the field. As shown in Fig. 5(b), ET a and ET cb agree well during the early stages
    of crop development when the crop is well-watered. After June 8, 2011, daily ET
    cb exceeds total applied irrigation and after July 4, the cumulative water balance
    turns negative. This is reflected in the observed VWC which declines from June
    8 onwards. The sustained negative net water balance also reflects intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower, and this deficit is captured by the difference
    between the surface renewal ET a measurements and the satellite-based ET cb estimates.
    Plants respond to water stress by reducing transpiration, and under the FAO-56
    approach, a crop water stress coefficient ( K s ) based on soil water content
    is used to account for this reduced transpiration in calculating ET c [12]. The
    addition of a K s coefficient of 0.85 to account for the deficit irrigation results
    in close agreement between the satellite-derived and surface renewal ET a estimates
    (Fig. 5(b)). This example illustrates the potential benefits of using surface
    observations of soil water content or soil water potential measurements in coordination
    with estimates of ET cb that integrate satellite and surface observations. The
    satellite-derived information can assist with tracking the daily irrigation demand,
    while soil moisture sensor networks provide an important check to ensure that
    the timing and magnitude of irrigation deficits are in-line with targets set by
    the grower. SECTION V. Data Distribution via Web Interface and Web Services While
    TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of integrating satellite and surface observations
    to map K cb and ET cb values, distribution of data and information via intuitive,
    easy to use interfaces is critical to facilitating use of the information by water
    managers and agricultural producers who may not be familiar with the specialized
    data formats used by the remote sensing science community. A web-based user interface
    providing access to visualizations of TOPS-SIMS information eliminates the barriers
    to data access, as only a web browser is needed to view and query the information,
    and no knowledge of specialized data formats is necessary. The TOPS-SIMS web-based
    front-end relies on an open-source software stack that utilizes the Open Layers
    JavaScript library to display maps and execute queries on map data from within
    web browsers (Fig. 6(a)). To facilitate geographic searches by users and provide
    a spatial context for the TOPS-SIMS information products, the interface combines
    TOPS-SIMS overlays with a selection of open-source and commercial base map layers,
    including maps of streets, land use, and aerial imagery. NDVI, F c , and K cb
    overlays are updated on nominal 8-day intervals; ET cb is updated daily. In addition
    to providing views of TOPS-SIMS data at the native 30 m resolution, the web interface
    also allows users to retrieve quantitative information from any variable by specifying
    a point or polygon and requesting the most current values or a time-series summary
    (Fig. 6(b)). Fig. 6. The TOPS-SIMS web interface provides capabilities for visualization
    and data access, including support for geographic queries and selection of data
    for visualization by date. The map in (a) shows ET cb (mm/day) for 3.7 million
    hectares of farmland in the Central and Coastal Valleys on 02-Aug-2011. Retrospective
    time-series for TOPS-SIMS output can be generated, as shown by the K cb graph
    for 2011 for a location near Huron, CA (b). Time-series data can be downloaded
    from the interface in CSV format directly into a spreadsheet for further analysis.
    Show All The TOPS-SIMS web interface relies on data services provided by an open-source
    software stack running a Python-based web server. Tools from the Geographic Data
    Abstraction Library (GDAL) generate the tiles used in the web maps. The server
    responds to map queries by retrieving data resting on an OPeNDAP web service (Open-source
    Project for a Network Data Access Protocol; http://opendap.org) and generates
    time-series charts from the resulting data using the Matplotlib graphics library.
    OPeNDAP is a software framework that facilitates remote access to local data regardless
    of local storage format, and thus simplifies the process of making scientific
    data sets available for other applications via web services. A working beta-version
    of the interface and associated web data services are available at http://ecocast.arc.nasa.gov/sims/,
    and are currently being evaluated by commercial growers, irrigation consultants,
    and water managers in California through a series of ongoing pilot studies. SECTION
    VI. Extending the TOPS-SIMS Framework The current TOPS-SIMS K cb and ET cb mapping
    capabilities demonstrate the potential utility of a modeling framework to integrate
    observations from satellite and surface sensor networks to provide new data and
    information services to the agricultural and water resource management user community.
    However, the TOPS-SIMS modular architecture also allows for a number of extensions
    that can be rapidly implemented to expand the data and information services. Key
    short term objectives include: i)linking TOPS-SIMS to ET o forecasts to provide
    forecasts of irrigation demand at various lead times; ii) use of web services
    and a model web approach [45] to integrate TOPS-SIMS outputs with operational
    and planning models utilized by water managers; iii) incorporation of site specific
    information provided by growers to include generation of customized reports; iv)
    expansion of inputs to include observations from a constellation of moderate resolution
    satellite sensors to increase observation frequency and improve the reliability
    and accuracy of data and information products from TOPS-SIMS; and v) incorporation
    of additional publicly available models for estimation of ET, including satellite-driven
    energy balance models for estimation of ET. At present, managers of agricultural
    water supplies generally rely on historic climate data and static estimates of
    irrigation demand when making decisions about the volume of water to release from
    reservoirs. For agricultural water delivery systems such as the Central Valley
    Project (CVP) and the California State Water Project (SWP), which together provide
    water for 3.75 million acres of California farmland, water managers must rely
    on this historical data to time water releases up to a week or more in advance
    to meet the needs of growers. While water managers must also consider a range
    of other factors, including environmental constraints and hydropower production,
    new sources of data on forecasted irrigation demand could support improvements
    in the ability to anticipate periods of particularly high demand in response to
    high temperatures or sustained winds, while conserving water during cooler periods
    with lower irrigation demand. The recent development of two experimental ET o
    forecasting systems provides the possibility of using forecasts of short-term
    water consumption in place of estimates derived from historic climate data and
    maps of cropping patterns. The NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted
    Reference ET (FRET) system2 forecasts ET o with a lead time of up to seven days.
    The FRET forecasts for California are driven by outputs from the Weather Research
    and Forecasting model (WRF) [46], and utilize WRF forecast fields to parameterize
    the Penman-Monteith equation for ET o as adopted by the Environmental Water Resources
    Institute, American Society of Civil Engineers [47]. Experimental 8-day forecasts
    and seasonal ET o outlooks are also being developed by the National Center for
    Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Bureau of Reclamation, and employ statistical
    forecasting methods to provide probabilistic ET o outlooks3. Data from the NOAA
    NWS FRET system are already being ingested by TOPS-SIMS via a web service, and
    can be directly integrated with K cb maps to provide estimates of weekly irrigation
    demand over California at the scale of individual fields. Pending the outcome
    of ongoing analyses to identify biases and quantify uncertainty in these forecasts
    relative to observed ET o values from CIMIS, data from these forecast systems
    will be applied to produce and distribute ET cb forecasts to agricultural producers
    and water managers to assist in quantification of local, regional, and statewide
    crop water consumption and irrigation demand. Improved data on current and forecasted
    irrigation demand that incorporates satellite observations of crop conditions
    can also be incorporated into operational models utilized by the CDWR such as
    CALSIM [48], and planning models such as Cal-SIMETAW [49], [50]. Incorporating
    recent historic data into these models has potential utility for evaluating past
    decisions on water releases, identifying opportunities for future improvement
    in delivery of water to growers, and developing strategies for implementation
    of water markets during drought years. In cases where forecasted demand is significantly
    higher or lower than historic demand for a given period, water operations managers
    could adjust management practices and improve their ability to deliver water to
    growers when and where it is most needed. Satellite derived K cb and ET cb maps
    are also potentially valuable as inputs into longer term planning models, and
    the development of a 10+ year record of observed crop canopy conditions and K
    cb values could lead to improvements in models used for long term planning, such
    as Cal-SIMETAW. Because TOPS-SIMS is implemented on NEX and data products are
    already distributed via an OPeNDAP web service, integration with other models
    is straight-forward, as data can be requested via existing web services, and data
    not already available in the NEX archive can be rapidly generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Incorporation of site-specific information from growers can assist in eliminating
    sources of uncertainty in estimating ET associated with crop type, the timing
    and amount of irrigation applied, and the irrigation system configuration. Research
    is ongoing to extend the TOPS-SIMS framework to allow growers to specify this
    information for individual fields, facilitating use of crop-specific relationships
    for mapping K cb from satellite data, and allowing growers to specify correction
    factors to account for intentional deficit irrigation or a leaching fraction.
    Grower information on precedent irrigation schedule and irrigation system type
    would allow estimation of soil evaporation and conversion of ET cb to ET c . Allowing
    growers to input information on irrigation system type and application rates would
    also allow TOPS-SIMS to translate ET cb into recommended irrigation system run
    times. TOPS-SIMS algorithms for deriving K cb from NDVI currently rely on data
    from the Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ , and MODIS satellite sensors, but NDVI can
    also be derived from observations from multiple other satellite sensors currently
    collecting data in the red and near-infrared wavelengths at resolutions from 20
    m to 60 m. Data from the SPOT-5 satellite instruments, the Indian Resource Satellite
    Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), and the upcoming Landsat Data Continuity Mission
    (LDCM) and Sentinel-2 satellite mission offer the potential for integration of
    observations into a “system of systems” to provide field-scale observations of
    crop canopy development multiple times per week, reducing data latency and data
    gaps resulting from cloud cover. While issues associated with inter-sensor calibrations
    must be fully resolved [51] and open data policies have not yet been finalized
    for all of these missions, TOPS-SIMS provides a framework for ingesting and compositing
    data from a constellation of moderate resolution (30–250 m) sensors to provide
    robust and reliable data and information services to agricultural producers and
    water managers. Finally, TOPS-SIMS is designed to support multiple models for
    estimation of ET from satellite observations, including energy balance models
    that incorporate information from the thermal bands on Earth observation satellites.
    The initial suite of algorithms implemented within TOPS-SIMS relies on the use
    of spectral information in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths to map F
    c and K cb values since this approach can be fully automated. As research progresses
    on automation of the internal calibration procedures for energy balance models
    [20], TOPS-SIMS is designed to support integration of these models, and to facilitate
    use of a suite of publicly-available models to provide a robust capability for
    automated, frequent, field-scale mapping of ET over regions the size of the western
    U.S. SECTION VII. Summary TOPS-SIMS employs a “system of systems” approach and
    applies the TOPS modeling framework to ingest observations from satellite and
    surface sensor networks to provide new data and information products to agricultural
    producers and water managers via easily accessible web interfaces and web services.
    The current framework supports near real-time mapping of indicators of crop canopy
    development and crop water consumption at field scales over 3.7 million ha of
    California farmland. Integration of satellite-derived estimates of basal crop
    evapotranspiration with observations of soil moisture from surface sensor networks
    offers promise for supporting agricultural producers and water managers working
    to optimize management of agricultural water resources. Use of the NEX computing
    architecture enables rapid processing of large volumes of satellite data and facilitates
    implementation of TOPS-SIMS over regions potentially as large as the western U.S.
    TOPS-SIMS is designed to integrate additional models and data services to support
    forecasting of crop irrigation requirements at weekly to seasonal lead times,
    and concurrent modeling of potential and actual crop evapotranspiration. Future
    integration of observations from a constellation of moderate resolution satellites
    would support further improvements in the frequency and long-term operational
    reliability of satellite-derived estimates of evapotranspiration and crop water
    requirements. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The energy-balance comparison data were generated

    Zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) is an economically important vegetable crop
    in Florida. Typically, it is intensively managed with high inputs of fertiliser
    and irrigation water. Our objectives were to evaluate the interaction between
    fertilisation rates and irrigation treatments, and to quantify nitrate leaching
    in a plastic mulched/drip irrigated zucchini squash production systems. Three
    studies were carried out. The first study evaluated different depth placement
    of drip and fertigation lines on plant growth and fruit yield. Treatments included
    SUR (both irrigation and fertigation drip lines placed on the surface); S&S (both
    lines buried 0.15 m deep); and SDI (irrigation line placed 0.15 m below the fertigation
    line on the surface). The second and third studies compared three different N-rates
    and different soil moisture sensor-based irrigation strategies. Nitrate-N leaching
    was monitored by zero tension drainage lysimeters and soil samples. N leaching
    increased when irrigation and N-rates increased, with values ranging from 2 to
    45 kg ha−1 of N. Use of SDI increased yields by 16% compared to the S&S treatment,
    and reduced nitrate leaching by 93% while increasing the water use efficiency
    by 75% compared to a fixed 2-h irrigation event per day treatment. Application
    of N above the standard recommended rate of 145 kg ha−1 did not increase yield,
    although yields were reduced at the lowest N-rate. The use of soil moisture sensors
    for automatic irrigation control reduced irrigation application and minimized
    nitrogen leaching. In addition, combining the soil moisture controlled SDI system
    that had surface applied fertigation resulted in similar or higher yields, while
    reducing both water use and potential N leaching because of improved nutrient
    retention in the root zone. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    leachingSubsurface drip irrigationCucurbita pepo 1. Introduction Squash (Cucurbita
    pepo L.) is an economically important vegetable with a U.S. crop value of $210
    million (USDA, 2006). In 2006, Florida accounted for 15% of the total harvested
    U.S. squash acreage and 23% of the overall U.S. crop value (FASS, 2006, USDA,
    2006). Squash production is typically intensely managed with high inputs of fertilisers
    and irrigation water, which increases the risk of groundwater nitrate contamination.
    Nitrate contamination in Florida areas is likely the result of a combination of
    factors such as N application in excess of crop demand, excessive irrigation and
    sandy soils. To address N pollution concerns, various crop management practices
    have been suggested, such as the use of plastic mulch to improve irrigation water
    use efficiency (IWUE) and reduce rainfall-induced N leaching losses (Romic et
    al., 2003). Plastic mulching in combination with drip irrigation and frequent
    injection of nutrients can be used in the irrigation system (fertigation) to enhance
    water and nutrient use efficiency (Bowen and Frey, 2002). In particular, the use
    of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) may be the best system for increasing yield,
    maximizing water and nitrogen use efficiencies and thereby minimizing nitrate
    leaching (Al-Omran et al., 2005, Lamm and Trooien, 2003). However, the use of
    plastic mulch and/or SDI as such, does not reduce the risk of groundwater contamination,
    unless environmentally sound irrigation and nitrogen application practices are
    also implemented. Irrigation management plays an important role on nitrogen use
    efficiency (NUE) and IWUE for vegetable crop production. The use of frequent but
    low water application volumes is superior to the more traditional scheduling of
    few applications of large irrigation volumes (Locascio, 2005). Because the former
    systems may be viewed as labour intensive and/or technically difficult to employ,
    automated irrigation systems which make use of soil moisture sensing devices may
    greatly facilitate the successful employment of low volume–high frequency irrigation
    systems for commercial vegetable crops (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005, Dukes et al.,
    2006). For example, Dukes and Scholberg (2005) reported a 11% reduction in water
    use when using a soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system for sweet
    corn as compared to sprinkler irrigation several times each week without affecting
    yield. Similarly, Sharmasarkar et al. (2001) reported that increased irrigation
    frequency reduced sugar beet crop water requirements and net drainage when using
    drip irrigation. As critical as irrigation management, both the timing and amount
    of N applied to the crop must be managed in a way that supplies sufficient N for
    crop yield without leaching N to the groundwater. Several studies have reported
    that fertigation, applying fertiliser via the irrigation lines, may facilitate
    matching crop N needs with fertiliser applications so that any risk of N leaching
    is minimized (Mohammad, 2004a). For example, Mohammad (2004b) concluded that squash
    yield, NUE and IWUE increased with the use of fertigation compared to dry fertiliser
    being applied directly to a fine-loamy soil followed by irrigation. However, information
    is lacking about the interactive effects of water management on crop N utilization
    for drip irrigated squash production in Florida (Hochmuth and Cordasco, 2003).
    The objective of this study was to identify an appropriate irrigation scheduling
    method and N-rate to maintain or enhance zucchini squash yield and IWUE while
    reducing nitrate leaching. We hypothesized that alternative irrigation designs
    and improved irrigation management would reduce N leaching associated with intensive
    zucchini squash production systems. 2. Materials and methods During the fall of
    2004 and 2005 three studies were conducted at the University of Florida, Plant
    Science Research and Education Unit, near Citra, FL, USA. The research plot soils
    were classified as Candler sand and Tavares sand (Buster, 1979). These soils contain
    97% sand-sized particles in the upper 1 m of the profile (Carlisle et al., 1978)
    with a field capacity range of 0.10–0.12 (v/v) in the 0–30 cm depth (Icerman,
    2007). Two weeks before zucchini squash (C. pepo L. cultivar “wildcat”) sowing,
    raised beds were constructed with 1.8 m between bed centres. Beds were fumigated
    (80% methyl bromide, 20% chloropicrin by volume) at a rate of 604 kg ha−1 before
    placement of both drip tape and silver plastic mulch in a single pass. In the
    fall of 2004, two studies were conducted (Studies 1 and 2) at the same time. Seeds
    were sown on 16 September 2004. During the second year all treatments were integrated
    in a single study (Study 3). The sowing date was 26 September 2005. Plots were
    15 m long, and a tractor mounted hole puncher was used to make approximately 0.025
    m wide square openings at 0.45 m intervals along the centre of the production
    bed. Plants were direct seeded by hand at a soil depth of 0.015 m. A weather station
    located within 500 m of the experimental site provided hourly temperature, relative
    humidity, solar radiation and wind speed data and this information was used to
    calculate reference evapotranspiration (ET0) according to FAO-56 (Allen et al.,
    1998). Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was based on the product of ET0 and the crop
    coefficient (Kc) for a given growth stage (Simonne et al., 2004) and values were
    reduced by 30% to account for the effect of plastic mulch on crop ET (Amayreh
    and Al-Abed, 2005) until the plant canopy was 80% full cover of raised bed area.
    Irrigation was applied via drip tape (Turbulent Twin Wall, 0.2 m emitter spacing,
    0.25 mm thickness, 0.7 L h−1 at 69 kPa, Chapin Watermatics, NY, USA). Water applied
    by irrigation and/or fertigation was recorded by positive displacement flowmeters
    (V100 16 mm diameter bore with pulse output, AMCO Water Metering Systems Inc.,
    Ocala, FL, USA). Meter readings were recorded weekly and data from transducers
    that signalled a switch closure every 18.9 L were collected continuously by data
    loggers (HOBO event logger, Onset Computer Corp. Inc., Bourne, MA, USA) connected
    to each flow meter. Pressure was regulated by inline pressure regulators to maintain
    an average pressure in the field of 69 kPa during irrigation events. Drip tape
    was located within approximately 0.08 m of the plant row. The fertiliser applications
    were based on IFAS (Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of
    Florida) recommendations (Maynard et al., 2003). The fertigation consisted of
    injection of dissolved fertilisers into fertigation lines with a peristaltic pump.
    The experimental design consisted of a randomized complete block design with four
    replicates. · Study 1: The aim of Study 1 was to test three different arrangements
    of drip irrigation and fertigation lines on squash growth and fruit yield. The
    drip position treatments included: (1) SUR, irrigation and fertigation drip lines
    positioned on the soil surface; (2) S&S, irrigation and fertigation drip lines
    both positioned 0.15 m below the soil surface; and (3) SDI, the irrigation drip
    line was positioned 0.15 m below soil surface and the fertigation drip line positioned
    on the soil surface (Table 1). Irrigation events were controlled by a Quantified
    Irrigation Controller (QIC) system (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2007) which included
    a 0.20 m long ECH2O probe (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) to measure
    soil moisture. Probes were inserted vertically for the SUR treatment in order
    to integrate the soil water content in the upper 0.2 m of the soil profile. The
    QIC irrigation controllers allowed irrigation if measured soil water content was
    below a soil volumetric water content (VWC) value of 0.15 m3 m−3 (translating
    to a 525 mV reading) during one of five daily irrigation windows. This study received
    164 kg ha−1 of N. Table 1. Outline and description of irrigation and fertilisation

    similarly. The objective of this study was to investigate irrigation water use
    and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by squash for soil moisture sensor-based production
    systems. The experimental design consisted of a complete factorial design including
    three N-rates and two soil moisture sensor-based systems. Treatments were replicated
    four times in completely randomized blocks. Nitrogen rates corresponded to 82,
    164 and 246 kg ha−1 of N. The irrigation treatments were controlled via a QIC
    irrigation control system as described for the first study (Table 1). However,
    in this study two different target thresholds of VWC were tested, SUR1 with a
    VWC value of 0.13 m3 m−3 (set at 475 mV, see Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2007 for details)
    and SUR2 with a VWC of 0.15 m3 m−3 (set at 525 mV). · Study 3: The third study
    was conducted during the fall of 2005, which integrated treatments from the first
    two studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the interactive effect
    of three N-rates, 73, 145 and 217 kg ha−1 of N and five different irrigation scheduling
    regimes on zucchini squash yields, NUE and IWUE. The irrigation treatments were:
    SUR1 and SUR2 (as described under Study 2); SDI where this system featured subsurface
    drip tape positioned 0.15 m below the surface placed fertigation line controlled
    by a QIC system using a 525 mV (0.15 m3 m−3 VWC) target threshold; and 4 SURtime
    a time-based irrigation treatment with one fixed 2-h irrigation event per day,
    similar to producer irrigation management (Table 1). 2.1. Plant growth and yield
    Harvest occurred weekly between 15 November and 1 December 2004 for Studies 1
    and 2, and 17 November and 12 December 2005 for Study 3. The harvested area was
    the central 10.5 m region within each plot and plots were harvested two times
    a week. Total weight and number of squash fruits were recorded. IWUE expressed
    in kg of fruits per m3 of irrigation applied was calculated by the quotient of
    marketable yields (kg ha−1) and the total seasonal irrigation applied (m3 ha−1).
    For all studies two representative squash plants were harvested from each plot
    at 2-week intervals and used for growth analysis. Vegetative and reproductive
    (fruit) plant parts were separated. Shoot and fruit tissues were dried at 65 °C
    for subsequent dry weight determination. Afterwards, tissue samples were ground
    in a Wiley mill to pass through a 2 mm screen, and a thoroughly mixed 5 g portion
    of each sample was stored. Tissue material was digested using a modification of
    the aluminium block digestion procedure of Gallaher et al. (1975) and analysed
    for total Kjeldahl N at the Analytical Research Lab (University of Florida, Gainesville,
    FL, USA) using EPA method 351.2 (Jones and Case, 1991). Nitrogen accumulation
    by the plant was calculated by multiplying weights of stems plus leaves, and fruit
    tissue by the corresponding N concentrations. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was
    defined as N uptake by the plants divided by the total amount of N supplied from
    weekly fertigation plus initial soil nitrate. 2.2. Monitoring soil water and N
    leaching The volumetric water content on the top soil of the bed was monitored
    by coupling time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes CS-615 with a datalogger CR-10X
    (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA). The TDR probes were installed vertically
    to measure the soil moisture in the 0–0.3 m range across all irrigation treatments.
    In 2005 (Study 3), to monitor the soil nitrate which was not taken up by plants,
    soil samples were collected with a 0.05 m diameter soil auger every 2 weeks in
    each plot 6 days after the previous fertigation event and 1 day prior to the following
    fertigation event. Treatments sampled included the two higher rates of N for the
    SUR2, SDI and SURtime irrigation treatments and the first soil sampling was taken
    before the first fertigation event. Composite samples were taken at the 0–0.3,
    0.3–0.6, and 0.6–0.9 m soil depths and placed on ice and refrigerated until further
    analysis. A 10 g subsample was extracted with 50 mL of 2 M KCl and filtered within
    1 day of soil sampling. Zero tension drainage lysimeters were installed 0.75 m
    below the surface of the bed (Zotarelli et al., 2007). Briefly, drainage lysimeters
    were constructed out of 208 L capacity drums that were cut in half lengthwise
    and had a length of 0.85 m, a diameter of 0.55 m, and a height of 0.27 m. A vacuum
    pump was used to extract the leachate accumulated at the bottom of the lysimeter.
    The leachate was removed weekly one day prior to the next fertigation event by
    applying a partial vacuum (35–40 kPa) using 20 L vacuum bottles for each drainage
    lysimeter. Total leachate volume was determined gravimetrically and subsamples
    collected from each bottle were analysed for NO3-N and thus total N loading rates
    could be calculated. Soil solution and soil core extracts were stored at −18 °C
    until nitrate and nitrite analyses were conducted. Samples were analysed using
    an air-segmented automated spectrophotometer (Flow Solution IV, OI Analytical,
    College Station, TX, USA) coupled with a Cd reduction approach (modified US EPA
    Method 353.2). Statistical analyses were performed using PROC GLM of SAS (SAS
    Inst. Inc., 1996) to determine treatment effects. When F value was significant,
    a multiple means comparison was performed using Duncan''s multiple range test
    at a P value of 0.05. For nitrate concentration in the soil profile, a multiple
    means comparison was performed using Tukey''s studentized range test. 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Climatic conditions and evapotranspiration patterns The cumulative
    rainfall at the final harvest was 173 and 228 mm for 2004 and 2005, respectively.
    In the presence of plastic mulch and the absence of a perched water table, the
    contribution of rainfall to crop water requirements and drainage measurements
    was considered to be negligible. Plastic mulched systems on coarse sandy soils
    have very limited lateral flow. In addition, water was not observed in the drainage
    lysimeters after a rainfall event (Fig. 1B) and TDR measurements showed no significant
    contribution of rainfall to the soil moisture at the 0–30 cm depth (Fig. 2). The
    fall growing season of 2005 was cooler than 2004. In both years, overall temperatures
    decreased over time and temperature fluctuations increased as the season progressed.
    During 2004, temperatures dropped below 10 °C on several occasions, while in 2005
    three frost events occurred during the harvesting period. Since the crop was not
    protected, in 2005 the frosts reduced the number of harvesting events, plant growth
    and yield, compared to the 2004 season. Calculated total ETc for each year was
    108 mm for 2004, and 171 mm for 2005 (Fig. 1A). For all treatments, irrigation
    rates during the season exceeded cumulative ETc curve, except for SUR1 in 2004
    which accumulated a water deficit of about 43 mm. Download : Download full-size

    1 the use of different drip position arrangements significantly affected the IWUE
    and yield (Table 2). The cumulative irrigation volume applied to Study 1 was 163
    mm for all treatments. The treatment ranking for marketable yields and IWUE was
    as follows: SDI ≥ SUR ≥ S&S with SDI resulting in significantly (P < 0.05) higher
    yields compared to S&S (Table 2). The SDI treatment increased yield by 16% (7.1
    Mg ha−1) compared to S&S treatment. There was no difference between SUR and SDI
    yield, similar to the results reported by Camp et al. (1993). The S&S treatment
    had a lower IWUE value (22.2 kg m−3) compared to the SDI treatment, which produced
    26.6 kg fruit m−3 of water applied (Table 2). Average fruit size and above ground
    dry matter accumulation were not significantly affected by drip position (data
    not shown). However, not only plant and fruit N accumulation but also overall
    NUE was significantly higher for SUR and SDI treatments compared to S&S irrigation
    system (Table 2). According to Ells et al. (1994), more than 60% of C. pepo roots
    were located in the top 15 cm of soil throughout the season, and for this reason
    S&S may have reduced IWUE and NUE. Conversely, the use of buried drip irrigation
    (SDI) resulted in an increase of 45% on NUE due to improved nutrient retention
    in the upper soil layer where most of the roots were located. Overall, SDI had
    numerically higher values for most production parameters, but differences were
    not significant compared to the SUR treatment at the P < 0.05 level. Table 2.

    3.3. Study 2—effect of nitrogen rate under two different irrigation threshold
    of VWC The crop establishment period was characterized by application of similar
    irrigation volume to all treatments during the first 15 days after sowing (DAS).
    After this phase, the irrigation treatments were initiated. Use of a higher set
    point (SUR2 vs. SUR1) with the QIC sensor control system resulted in a slightly
    wetter top soil of 0.010–0.015 m3 m−3 increase in VWC. The dry treatment (SUR1)
    received 0.9 mm day−1 and corresponding values for the wetter treatment (SUR2)
    were 2.1 mm day−1. At the end of the season, SUR2 resulted in application of 97
    mm more water compared to SUR1 (Table 1). The leachate collected in the drainage
    lysimeters on SUR2 was 31 mm. Cumulative NO3-N leaching values for SUR2 at end
    of the season were 6, 8 and 13 kg ha−1 of N for rates of 82, 164 and 246 kg ha−1of
    N, respectively. However, no differences at the P < 0.05 level between the N-rates
    were observed. There were no interactions between irrigation and N-rate treatments,
    but soil water availability had an important effect on IWUE and yield. Overall
    yield for SUR2 was 12.4% higher compared to SUR1 (Table 3). The lower yield of
    SUR1 may be attributed to the water stress due to the reduced amount of water
    applied throughout the entire season, which was below the calculated crop evapotranspiration
    demand 60 DAS (data not shown). The final dry matter accumulation (shoots and
    dry fruits) was similar across N and irrigation treatments. The effect of N-rate
    in yield response was 246 ≥ 164 ≥ 82 kg ha−1. The increase of N-rate from 82 to
    246 kg ha−1 resulted in a significant increase of 9% on marketable yield and promoted
    an accumulation of 32% more N in the plant above ground. Table 3. Irrigation and

    A detailed analysis of plant N influx showed the relationship between soil water
    availability and N-rate application (Fig. 3), and the effects on the total N accumulation
    by plants. As no interaction between N rates and irrigation treatments were observed,
    both factors were analysed separately. From germination until 28 DAS, the cumulative
    irrigation was 29 and 62 mm for SUR1 and SUR2, respectively. The irrigation scheduling
    slightly affected the N-uptake rate. At 28 DAS the N-uptake rate was 1.6 and 1.2
    kg ha−1 of N day−1 for SUR1 and SUR2, respectively; but no effect of N-rates within
    each irrigation schedule was observed. Between 25 and 50 DAS, the plant vegetative
    growth was characterised by the exponential increase of N-uptake rates. The maximum
    N-uptake rate occurred earlier for SUR1, between 42 and 46 DAS for SUR2, which
    may be a physiological indication of water stress under SUR1. In fact, at 46 DAS,
    SUR2 had received 52% more water than SUR1 (54 mm), which resulted in slightly
    higher total above ground N accumulation (49 and 39 kg ha−1 of N for SUR1 and
    SUR2, respectively). However, at end of the season, both irrigation treatments
    accumulated about 104 kg ha−1 of N above ground. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Calculated daily N uptake rate (kg ha−1 day−1) (symbols) and plant
    N accumulation (kg ha−1) (symbol and line) under two irrigation schedules (A)
    and three N-rates (B) for Study 2. Nitrogen uptake patterns and N accumulation
    were similar for N-rates of 163 and 246 kg ha−1, with a N uptake peak at 3.0 and
    3.4 kg ha−1 day−1, respectively. However, the lowest N-rate (82 kg ha−1) attained
    a plant N-uptake of 2.5 kg ha−1 day−1, resulting in 27–36% less N accumulated
    in the plant above ground at end of the season (Fig. 3 and Table 3). The average
    of NO3-N concentration in the soil solution at 0–30 cm depth at 30, 37, 44 and
    51 DAS was 43 ± 5; 113 ± 38 and 274 ± 143 mg L−1 for N-rates of 82, 163 and 246
    kg ha−1, respectively. However, these differences in soil nitrate concentration
    between N-rates of 163 and 246 kg ha−1 did not result in a yield increase, but
    increased the NO3-N leached by 73% (data not shown). The irrigation treatments
    did not affect N uptake rates and plant N accumulation but significantly affected
    marketable yield. The reduction in yield under SUR1 was due to the increase in
    water demand by the plants during fruit development, which is a very critical
    time period for water stress. For zucchini squash yield, soil water availability
    was a primal component of the plant production, even under higher soil N concentration
    conditions. This hypothesis was confirmed by comparing the NO3-N concentration
    in the soil solution at the 0–30 cm depth between 44 and 65 DAS. The soil nitrate
    concentration under SUR1 was 277 ± 56 mg L−1, while under SUR2 it was 56 ± 10
    mg L−1, which clearly showed the dilution effect under higher irrigation rates.
    3.4. Study 3—effect of nitrogen rate, drip position and irrigation scheduling
    Similar to Study 2, the establishment period lasted until 20 DAS. After this period,
    the average irrigation rates for SUR1 and SUR2 treatments were 2.2 and 4.3 mm
    day−1, respectively (Table 1). Corresponding values for SDI and SURtime treatments
    were 2.1 and 6.3 mm day−1 (Fig. 1). Use of a higher soil moisture set point of
    SUR2, compared to SUR1 with the QIC sensor, showed a slightly wetter top soil
    (Fig. 2). Treatments SUR2 and SURtime had similar overall average VWC values (Fig.
    2). However, SURtime and SDI had higher oscillation of VWC compared to SUR treatments.
    The fluctuations in VWC for the SURtime treatment were associated with a high
    volume of water applied during a single irrigation application, which also resulted
    in substantial drainage below the rootzone (Fig. 1B). However, on soil moisture
    sensor-based treatments, the water was applied only when the VWC dropped below
    the set point during one of the five daily irrigation windows, reducing the amount
    of water being applied, and decreasing VWC fluctuations and potential water percolation
    considerably. In particular, the average VWC in the SDI treatment (the irrigation
    drip positioned at 15 cm below the soil surface) decreased by 60%, from 0.115
    m3 m−3 at the beginning of the season to 0.068 m3 m−3, on average, 30 DAS (Fig.
    2). The oscillations of VWC in SDI were related to spikes in the mV read by the
    dielectric capacitance probes (QIC) after the weekly fertigation events, caused
    by salt concentrations on the top soil (Hagin et al., 2002, Schroder, 2006). Different
    irrigation schedules used for SUR2 and SURtime resulted in similar volume leached,
    about 62 mm. The volume leached on the SDI treatment was 14 mm, which occurred
    until 27 DAS (Fig. 1B). The combination of reduced irrigation rate and drip irrigation
    position in the SDI treatment directly affected the volume leached and increased
    the residual soil nitrate concentration in the 0–0.3 m depth layer. In this treatment,
    at the end of the season, the total cumulative NO3-N leached was 1.7 and 2.4 kg
    ha−1 of N for N-rates of 145 and 217 kg ha−1, respectively (Fig. 1C). Conversely,
    SUR2 and SURtime resulted in higher nitrate leaching: 20–26 and 35–45 kg ha−1
    of NO3-N for applied N-rates of 145 and 217 kg ha−1, respectively. A high volume
    of irrigation induced dilution and/or displacement of N-fertiliser (SURtime and
    SUR 2) and reduced NUE by plants. Increasing N fertiliser rates from 145 to 217
    kg ha−1, increased residual soil N values by 100–350% (data not shown). Although
    this increase did not result in additional yield benefits, it did increase N leaching
    for the SUR2 and SURtime treatments by 36 and 126%, respectively. Regardless of
    the fact that there was no interaction between irrigation and N-rate treatments,
    lower irrigation rates showed higher IWUE and NUE. In terms of yields, SUR1 and
    SDI were similar, while SUR2 and SURtime were 21% lower than other irrigation
    treatments. Reduction in fruit yield was related to the volume of water applied
    and the irrigation method used. Treatments SURtime and SUR2 received approximately
    two to three times more irrigation water compared to SUR1, increasing N displacement
    in the soil profile (Fig. 4) and decreasing dry matter and N accumulation (Table
    3). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Soil nitrate concentration as
    measured by soil coring for the SUR2, SDI and SURtime irrigation treatments fertilised
    with 217 kg ha−1 of N at 7, 21, 35, 49, 63 and 79 days after sowing (DAS) for
    three soil depth layers in Study 3 (2005). Bars represent minimum significant
    difference according to Tukey''s test; ns = non-significant; *significant at P
    = 0.1. The plants showed a positive response in fruit yield, NUE, and plant N
    accumulation with increasing N-rates (Table 3). The fertilisation with N-rates
    of 145 and 217 kg ha−1 resulted in similar fruit yield, plant N accumulation and
    NUE, but N accumulation in the fruits was higher for the highest N-rate (Table
    3). Appreciable reduction of yields, dry matter and N accumulation occurred due
    to the application of 73 kg ha−1 of N. The crop N uptake decreased with increasing
    N-rate following the “law of the diminishing returns”. Although higher N-rates
    increased tissue-N concentrations (Huett and White, 1991), overall NUE values
    decreased with higher N-rates. Similar trends were noted by Mohammad (2004a),
    who reported that under N-limiting conditions squash plants extracted more mineralized
    nitrogen in order to sustain crop N demand. 4. Conclusions The use of soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation allowed more efficient use of irrigation water resulting
    in a reduction in irrigation water use by 33–80% compared to a SURtime treatment
    which mimicked typical grower irrigation practices. A soil moisture sensor-based
    subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system combined with surface applied fertigation
    in zucchini squash, resulted in a reduction in water applied and N leaching, an
    increase in the nitrogen uptake efficiency, and similar or higher yields compared
    to other treatments. Combining subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) with surface applied
    fertigation greatly reduced N leaching, and resulted in higher NUE by zucchini
    squash. The use of soil moisture sensor-based irrigation may contribute to a consistent
    reduction of leaching when the soil volumetric water content is maintained within
    the field capacity threshold. There were no yield benefits with N-rates over 145
    kg ha−1. It was concluded that appropriate use of SDI and/or sensor-based irrigation
    systems can allow growers to sustain profitable yield while it can greatly save
    irrigation water and reduce the potential nitrate leaching in susceptible soils.

    \ the challenge of feeding a growing population with limited or depleting\nfresh\
    \ water resources. Advances in irrigation systems and technologies allow site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nof irrigation water within the ﬁeld to improve water use efﬁciency\
    \ or reduce water usage for\nsustainable crop production, especially in arid and\
    \ semi-arid regions. This paper discusses recent\ndevelopment of variable-rate\
    \ irrigation (VRI) technologies, data and information for VRI application,\nand\
    \ impacts of VRI, including proﬁtability using this technology, with a focus on\
    \ agronomic factors\nin precision water management. The development in sprinkler\
    \ systems enabled irrigation application\nwith greater precision at the scale\
    \ of individual nozzle control. Further research is required to evaluate\nVRI\
    \ prescription maps integrating different soil and crop characteristics in different\
    \ environments.\nOn-farm trials and whole-ﬁeld studies are needed to provide support\
    \ information for practical\nVRI applications. Future research also needs to address\
    \ the adjustment of the spatial distribution of\nprescription zones in response\
    \ to temporal variability in soil water status and crop growing conditions,\n\
    which can be evaluated by incorporating remote and proximal sensing data. Comprehensive\
    \ decision\nsupport tools are required to help the user decide where to apply\
    \ how much irrigation water at\ndifferent crop growth stages to optimize water\
    \ use and crop production based on the regional climate\nconditions and cropping\
    \ systems.\nKeywords: variable-rate irrigation; precision agriculture; irrigation\
    \ scheduling\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the largest consumer of the world′s\
    \ available fresh water, as plant growth largely\ndepends on the availability\
    \ of water. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\ncurrent\
    \ world irrigated area is approximately 300 million ha, and projection to 2050\
    \ suggests growing\nscarcities of water resources for agriculture, although water\
    \ is a renewable resource. This situation has\nampliﬁed the intensity of global\
    \ food insecurity, climate change, and poverty. The greatest challenge\nto agriculture\
    \ is to provide food and ﬁber for almost 8 billion people around the world in\
    \ the advent of\ndepleting freshwater resources [1].\nThe challenge is more prominent\
    \ in the arid and semi-arid regions, where underground water\nsources, especially\
    \ aquifers are used for irrigation, as rainfall provides only a portion of the\
    \ total\nrequirement for crop evapotranspiration (ET) demand [2]. Heavy irrigation\
    \ has caused rapid depletion\nof many aquifers. For instance, comparing the water\
    \ level of the Ogallala aquifer in the 1950s to that\nof 2013, in some wells,\
    \ up to 78 m of water was depleted in the Texas High Plains area [3]. This is\n\
    almost 12 times the average decline of 4.5 m for the whole area of the aquifer.\
    \ Given this depletion rate,\nscientists have predicted that 35% of the Southern\
    \ High Plains will not be able to support irrigation in\n30 years. Many other\
    \ water resources in the world are depleting rapidly in recent years with negligible\n\
    recharge, indicating the need for water conservation solutions in agriculture\
    \ [4,5]. More effective and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87; doi:10.3390/agronomy9020087\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n2 of 21\nefﬁcient management\
    \ of water is required to better conserve water and improve water use efﬁciency\n\
    for sustainable crop production.\nConventional farming practices manage an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld uniformly without incorporating\nthe intrinsic variability in topography,\
    \ soil, crop growth conditions, and other agronomic factors.\nThis can result\
    \ in nutrient leaching, environmental contamination, and reduced proﬁtability\
    \ especially\nwhen applying high inputs in low yielding areas and vice versa [6,7].\
    \ Precision agriculture can be\nadopted to divide the ﬁeld into small management\
    \ units for optimized production [8]. There are\nseveral deﬁnitions for precision\
    \ agriculture, and it keeps evolving with emerging technologies and\nunderstanding\
    \ of what is achievable [9]. The idea of precision agriculture or site-speciﬁc\
    \ management\nstarted around the early 1980s with the development of various technologies\
    \ to assess ﬁeld variabilities\nsuch as soil survey, soil testing and mapping,\
    \ and crop yield monitoring [10–13]. Precision agriculture\ndepends on detailed\
    \ spatial information, information technology, greater information processing\n\
    capability, and better decision aids [14]. Precision agriculture is a management\
    \ system that measures\nand responds to the spatial and temporal variability of\
    \ soil and crop growth at the sub-ﬁeld level\nwith the aim to enhance proﬁtability\
    \ and reduce environmental impact [15,16]. Major technologies\ninvolved in precision\
    \ agriculture include geographic information systems (GIS), remote and proximal\n\
    sensing, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), yield monitoring and the variable\
    \ rate technology.\nGeoreferenced information about soil and plant characteristics\
    \ can be obtained efﬁciently using GIS,\nproximal sensors and remote sensors [17].\
    \ Application of yield monitors provides the capability to\nprecisely characterize\
    \ yield variability at large scales in the ﬁeld. Moreover, the variable rate technology\n\
    provides the ability to site-speciﬁcally apply irrigation water in the ﬁeld to\
    \ achieve potential water\nsavings [18]. This enables the timely and accurate\
    \ water application incorporating the spatial and\ntemporal soil properties and\
    \ plant demand at different growth stages [15]. In other words, the variable\n\
    rate irrigation (VRI) technology can help to apply the right amount of water in\
    \ the right area of the\nﬁeld at the right time resulting in water savings.\n\
    Recent research suggests site-speciﬁc management of water or VRI could be a solution\
    \ to conserve\nwater and improve water use efﬁciency (WUE), which is the ratio\
    \ between effective water use and\nactual water withdrawal in the ﬁeld [19]. VRI\
    \ can support water and energy conservation with a\npositive inﬂuence on crop\
    \ water productivity and the environment [20]. This is possible by applying\n\
    irrigation at rates that vary to appropriately match ﬁeld variability based on\
    \ speciﬁc water needs\nof individual management zones rather than applying a uniform\
    \ rate throughout the ﬁeld [21].\nThe magnitude of soil water content (SWC) varies\
    \ with time and location, but the pattern of spatial\nvariability usually remains\
    \ similar. This temporal stability of SWC is associated with properties of the\n\
    ﬁeld such as topography, soil texture, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa)\
    \ and drainage patterns\nthat insigniﬁcantly change over time [22,23]. The feasibility\
    \ and effectiveness of VRI depend on the\nsize of the ﬁeld, crop species under\
    \ consideration, weather, and the underlying ﬁeld properties such as\nelevation,\
    \ slope, soil texture, and ECa that inﬂuence soil moisture content and irrigation\
    \ requirements\nfor the crop [24,25]. Hence, understanding the inﬂuence of agronomic\
    \ factors such as topography and\nsoil properties on soil water and ultimately\
    \ yield can provide a basis for application of VRI in the ﬁeld\nto achieve potential\
    \ water savings together with yield optimization.\nToday, site-speciﬁc water management\
    \ has been made easier with several precision agriculture\ntools, such as GNSS,\
    \ GIS, yield mapping, soil survey and remote sensing [26]. Several decision support\n\
    tools and strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawal without reductions in irrigated\
    \ land area or\ncrop productivity have been developed [4]. The measures to optimize\
    \ the use of irrigation water in\nthe ﬁelds include increasing weather-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling, converting gravity-based irrigation\nto center pivot irrigation,\
    \ subsurface drip irrigation, replacing high water to low water demand\ncrops,\
    \ and deﬁcit irrigation based on evapotranspiration replacement using various\
    \ water-balance\nmodels [27]. Several studies have been done to understand the\
    \ possible water savings with VRI.\nA review on VRI across different crop and\
    \ weather regimes of the world concluded that VRI could save\n10%–15% of water\
    \ [28]. Although the use of VRI seems to be a reasonable measure to improve water\n\

    \ it because limited research is done at the ﬁeld scale\nto understand its reliability\
    \ and economic potential [25]. A better understanding of ﬁeld variability and\n\
    how it affects crop yield is needed for effective implementation of the new technologies.\
    \ A review for\nsite-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation [29] focused on the technology\
    \ and challenges for adoption. Another\nreview of 20 years’ research on increasing\
    \ crop productivity with sprinkler and micro-irrigation\ndiscussed the importance\
    \ of understanding the crop response to VRI [30]. The study emphasized the\nneed\
    \ for continuous effort towards management zone delineation based on ﬁeld properties\
    \ integrated\nwith dynamic information from real-time monitoring of climatological\
    \ and crop data. However,\nthis study focused more on the technological aspect\
    \ of irrigation management than the agronomic\naspect of water conservation with\
    \ VRI. The agricultural science behind VRI is equally crucial for\nthe successful\
    \ implementation of this technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\
    \ review the\nscientiﬁc background and technologies in precision water management,\
    \ with the focus on agronomic\nfactors and strategies for site-speciﬁc water management.\n\
    2. Variable-Rate Irrigation Technologies\nThe irrigation system changed from gravity-based\
    \ furrow irrigation in the 1950s to sprinkler\nirrigation in late 1990s. Initially,\
    \ the high-pressure sprinkler irrigation system was available in the\n1980s which\
    \ later developed to low-pressure sprinklers and low-energy precision application\
    \ (LEPA)\nin 1990s [31–33]. About 49% of total irrigated land in the United States\
    \ is irrigated with center pivot\nsystems, out of which 44% is irrigated at low\
    \ pressure under 30 psi [34]. The basic requirements for the\nVRI technology are\
    \ sensors and spatial information, prescription maps and a system to incorporate\
    \ VRI\nprescription (e.g., LEPA, lateral irrigation, etc.) to apply in the ﬁeld\
    \ [35]. At present, there are several\nirrigation technologies for conservation\
    \ irrigation, such as sprinkler, drip, and other micro-irrigation\nsystems but\
    \ limited site-speciﬁc studies have been done [30,36–38]. For example, a study\
    \ of the\nvariable-rate drip irrigation system on vineyard found up to 17% increase\
    \ in yield and a 20% decrease\nin water consumption compared to uniform irrigation\
    \ [39]. Researchers in the UK assessed the potential\nof hose-reel boom irrigators\
    \ for precision irrigation in vegetables [40]. Automatic gravity-fed irrigation\n\
    systems in Europe decreased manual labor and supported adoption by innovative\
    \ farmers [41].\nVariable-rate irrigation using center pivot in rice showed better\
    \ performance compared to uniform\nﬂooding irrigation [42]. In this review, we\
    \ will focus more on those irrigation technologies that have\nbeen used for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management more frequently around the world, such as variable-rate\nlateral\
    \ irrigation systems and center pivot irrigation systems.\nThe components of a\
    \ variable-rate lateral irrigation system commonly consist of a GPS or GNSS\n\
    receiver, custom software-controlled relays and valves, which can apply variable\
    \ water utilizing the\nnozzle-pulsing technique and a variable speed control system.\
    \ This system can control the irrigation\nrate and forward speed with high accuracy\
    \ [43]. Similarly, the components of a center pivot VRI system\ninclude a pivot\
    \ control panel, a VRI control panel, solenoid valves, control nodes, a GNSS system,\n\
    a variable frequency drive and a remote-control system [21]. The pivot control\
    \ regulates the operation\nand speed of the pivot, while the VRI control panel\
    \ regulates the irrigation application rate in response\nto the prescription map\
    \ and the pivot location. Solenoid valves regulate the ﬂow of sprinkler heads.\n\
    The GNSS system at the end of the center pivot provides the pivot position. The\
    \ control nodes along\nthe length of the pivot determine when the valves are open\
    \ or close. The variable frequency drive\n(VFD) helps to regulate the pressure\
    \ while instantaneously changing the rate of irrigation at different\npositions\
    \ of the ﬁeld. The VFD controls the rotation speed of the pump impeller by receiving\
    \ the input\nfrom a pressure switch installed on the pump outlet pipe. This keeps\
    \ water pressure stable within\npreset maximum and minimum thresholds and thus\
    \ saving water and energy. The remote control\nsystem allows to view and control\
    \ the center pivot and the pump from a distance via a smartphone or\na computer\
    \ using the internet [21]. Further, research and development are striving to control\
    \ irrigation\namount with VRI controllers using real-time information from plant\
    \ and soil sensors in the ﬁeld [44].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n4 of 21\nCurrently,\
    \ several companies work on the manufacture and application of this technology.\n\
    The commercially available VRI control resolution varies with the manufacturers.\
    \ VRI systems\ncan apply zero water to speciﬁc nozzles and as much as 200% of\
    \ the standard application rate\nto other nozzles by opening or closing individual\
    \ nozzles and by changing the speed of the\npivot [45]. Some companies provide\
    \ the ability to control zones of sprinklers, while others can\ncontrol each sprinkler\
    \ independently [46]. For example, Valley (Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley,\
    \ NE,\nUSA) provides variable speed control and variable zone control technologies\
    \ for site-speciﬁc water\napplication. The variable speed control system uses\
    \ an advanced control panel that can slow down or\nspeed up the pivot to vary\
    \ water input in different areas (sectors) of the ﬁeld, but the overall pivot\
    \ ﬂow\nrate remains constant. This system does not need additional hardware on\
    \ the existing pivot irrigation\nsystem. The variable zone control system can\
    \ vary the speed of the center and change the application\nrate along the pivot\
    \ lateral. This system applies different irrigation depths to different areas\
    \ of the ﬁeld\nby turning sprinklers on and off for various amounts of time. Trimble\
    \ (Trimble Navigation, Sunnyvale,\nCA, USA) has developed the Irrigate-IQ Variable-Rate\
    \ Irrigation System. This system incorporates\nthe VFD and variable speed drive\
    \ (VSD) into the recent optimal ﬂow VRI that works with standard\npump equipment\
    \ on wells with limited capacity. This system is capable of individual nozzle\
    \ control,\nwhich can apply the right amount of water in the right place more\
    \ accurately [47]. Currently, it is\npossible to achieve sector control with very\
    \ small resolution, and zone control can add irrigation zones\nfurther to the\
    \ sector at the small scales of lateral spans (Figure 1) [48]. A study conducted\
    \ in Canada to\nevaluate the performance of VRI found that the accuracy of water\
    \ application was up to 90% in the\ncenter pivot system [49]. However, the performance\
    \ of these irrigation systems in ﬁeld applications is\naffected by many factors,\
    \ such as ﬁeld attributes, the spatial resolution of the sensors used in irrigation\n\
    management and temporal resolution of data inputs, as well as unexpected environmental\
    \ conditions.\nHence, adaptive irrigation management strategies and active research\
    \ support are required to enhance\nthe adoption and application of VRI [20,50].\n\

    topographic properties combined can explain 28% to 85% of yield variability [51].\
    \ Hence, it is critical\nto quantify the variability of terrain attributes and\
    \ soil properties for VRI applications.\n3.1. Topography\nTopographic variation\
    \ is a common characteristic of large agricultural ﬁelds that result in spatial\n\
    variability of soil water and ultimately crop yield [52]. Topography or terrain\
    \ has two types of attributes,\nprimary and secondary attributes [53]. Primary\
    \ attributes include elevation, slope, aspect, curvature,\nﬂow length, and upslope\
    \ contributing area. Secondary attributes are derived empirically from several\n\
    primary attributes to characterize speciﬁc processes manifesting in the landscape,\
    \ mainly including\nsediment transport index (STI), stream power index (SPI),\
    \ ﬂow direction, ﬂow accumulation, distance\nto ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL),\
    \ and wetness index [53,54]. Topographic properties affect soil physical\nand\
    \ chemical properties such as texture (sand, silt, and clay content), pH, CaCO3,\
    \ extractable Ca and\nMg, available K, base saturation, organic matter, and cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC). Topography also\ninﬂuences hydrologic properties and\
    \ processes and can account for up to 50% of water availability\ndifferences in\
    \ the same ﬁeld [52]. Elevation, slope and surface curvatures directly affect\
    \ inﬁltration and\nrunoff as they inﬂuence the surface and subsurface ﬂow of water\
    \ in the ﬁeld [55,56]. This can have a\nsigniﬁcant effect on crop growth and yield,\
    \ resulting in differences in crop production of up to 69% at\ndifferent positions\
    \ in the ﬁeld [57–59].\nA study conducted in central Illinois and eastern Indiana\
    \ showed that topography alone could\nexplain about 20% of yield variability [60].\
    \ Corn yield variability was consistently correlated with\nelevation and slope\
    \ in a three-year study in Southern Portugal [53]. This study showed that topographic\n\
    indices, such as distance to ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL), were negatively correlated\
    \ with yield,\nhence could be used to evaluate spatial yield variability. A research\
    \ conducted on a 7.4-ha ﬁeld in the\nSouthern High Plains of Texas showed cotton\
    \ lint yield was negatively correlated with site elevation.\nThe lint yield and\
    \ nitrogen (N) uptake was higher in bottom slope positions than in upslope, possibly\n\
    due to the accumulation of run-off water and NO3-N eroded from the upper slope\
    \ areas. However,\nthis trend depended on weather conditions. For a wet year when\
    \ there was over accumulation of water\nin bottom slopes, lower yield in bottom\
    \ slopes and higher yield in upper slopes were observed [61].\nRelative elevation\
    \ explained up to 49% of water content variation in the soil and 32% of lint yield\n\
    variation in the ﬁeld. The negative correlation between crop yield and elevation\
    \ could be in part due\nto the effect of erosion and topographical attributes\
    \ on soil properties that inﬂuence inﬁltration and\nstorage of water. Slope length\
    \ also affects crop yield by inﬂuencing N denitriﬁcation, soil N, P, K,\nCa and\
    \ Mg distributions, soil carbon storage, and nitrate distribution, as well as\
    \ the inﬁltration rate of\nwater in the ﬁeld [62].\nThe curvature of the ﬁeld\
    \ surface determines the concentration or dispersion of surface water\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld [55]. Concave surface with negative curvatures concentrates water ﬂow,\
    \ while convex\nsurface with positive curvature disperses water ﬂow [63]. For\
    \ example, SWC was found strongly\ncorrelated with soil surface curvature (r =\
    \ 0.9) [64]. Soil surface curvature can explain up to 15% of\nvariations in the\
    \ crop yield [65]. Corn yield was negatively correlated with surface curvature\
    \ in another\nresearch [53]. In this study, corn yield was 14% higher in concave\
    \ curvatures than convex areas. In a\nsix-year study [55], corn yields were negatively\
    \ correlated with elevation, slope, planar curvature and\nproﬁle curvature for\
    \ the wet years. The impact of surface curvature on crop yield also depends on\n\
    weather conditions and the location to some extent. Weather factors have the largest\
    \ effect on grain\nyield at locations with large curvature values. In some cases,\
    \ surface curvature is positively related to\ncrop yield at locations or years\
    \ with higher precipitation [60]. The magnitude of curvature also has\nan impact\
    \ on crop yield. The effect of curvature on crop yield between wet and dry years\
    \ are highly\ndifferent at locations with small curvature [66]. Hence, understanding\
    \ and incorporating topographic\nattributes of the ﬁeld, such as elevation, slope\
    \ length and aspect, surface curvature and their inﬂuence\non water dynamics can\
    \ be an important input for site-speciﬁc water management to achieve potential\n\
    water savings and optimized production.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n6 of 21\n3.2. Soil\
    \ Properties\nSoil functions as a medium for plant growth, a regulator of water\
    \ ﬂow and nutrient cycling.\nIt is a dynamic entity where complex interactions\
    \ occur among its physical, chemical and biological\nproperties to enable these\
    \ functions [67]. Soil forming factors such as parent material, biota, topography,\n\
    climate, and time are variable in time and space and explain most of the soil\
    \ variability besides the\nmanagement induced variability [11]. Spatial variability\
    \ of chemical properties including nutrients,\norganic matter, and pH can result\
    \ in within-ﬁeld variation in available water content and crop\nproductivity [68].\
    \ Complex spatial patterns of soil physical properties also affect soil water\
    \ availability\nand rooting of a plant, resulting in variability in crop growth\
    \ and yield [69]. Soil texture, organic matter\ncontent, apparent electrical conductivity,\
    \ and biological properties are relatively stable properties of\nthe ﬁeld that\
    \ are usually considered for site-speciﬁc management of the ﬁeld.\n3.2.1. Soil\
    \ Texture\nSoil texture, the relative content of sand, silt, and clay particles,\
    \ is an important soil physical\nproperty that affects crop growth and yield.\
    \ Soil texture determines the rate at which water drains\nthrough saturated soil\
    \ and inﬂuences available water-holding capacity. Therefore, it affects the\n\
    distribution of available water for plant growth and irrigation requirements in\
    \ the ﬁeld. Fine sandy\nloams and silts tend to have the highest water-holding\
    \ capacity, while an increase in either clay\nor sand content in the soil proﬁle\
    \ decreases the water-holding capacity [70]. The matric potential\nof soil, which\
    \ depends on soil particle size, inﬂuences the availability of soil water. For\
    \ example,\nclay particles have higher matric potential and lower soil available\
    \ water compared to sand and silt\nparticles [71]. Soil texture also affects the\
    \ spatial variability of residual NO3-N and the leaching of N.\nMore residual\
    \ was found in sandy loam soils compared to loamy sand, and leaching was higher\
    \ in\nloamy sand compared to sandy loam [72]. Soil texture also affects the pore\
    \ sizes and porosity of the soil,\nwhich ultimately affects crop root growth and\
    \ yield by limiting the water available to the plant and the\ngrowth space for\
    \ the roots [73]. In general, soils with high clay content are more difﬁcult to\
    \ manage\ndue to lack of porosity and water available for plant growth. On the\
    \ other hand, well-drained soils\nhave good soil aeration for healthy root and\
    \ crop growth [74]. The clay content can also inﬂuence soil\nwater and nutrient\
    \ content and result in crop yield variability across the ﬁeld [61,75]. A study\
    \ showed\nthat clay content in the soil could explain up to 17% variability in\
    \ winter wheat yield by affecting\nthe water available in the soil for crop growth\
    \ [76]. A study conducted in the Southern High Plains\nshowed that a very sandy\
    \ soil (the Brownﬁeld soil series) with high slope consistently had low yield\n\
    when given the same amount of irrigation water, fertilizer, seed population, and\
    \ other management\npractices [56]. A cross-correlation study conducted between\
    \ cotton lint yield, soil water, clay, sand and\nelevation in a 45-ha ﬁeld in\
    \ Texas High Plains also showed that correlation among these factors varied\n\
    between 0.72 and 0.63 and cotton crop and soil physical properties could be correlated\
    \ within 60 to\n80 m across the ﬁeld [77]. In summary, soil texture inﬂuences\
    \ variability in water availability and crop\nyield, and hence should be considered\
    \ in VRI planning and implementation [78].\n3.2.2. Soil Organic Matter (SOM)\n\
    The role of SOM in VRI lies in its inﬂuence on water-holding capacity because\
    \ the afﬁnity SOM has\nfor water [74]. SOM has a positive inﬂuence on yield, and\
    \ the inﬂuence is more prominent in soils with\nlow organic matter content [60].\
    \ SOM distribution in the ﬁeld is variable depending upon topography\nand other\
    \ soil properties. Accumulation of SOM often occurs at the bottom of slopes, possibly\
    \ due to\nthe run-off of organic matter from higher areas and increased plant\
    \ growth at low-lying wet areas of the\nﬁeld [60,61]. SOM generally increases\
    \ with increasing clay content. The organic matter in ﬁne-textured\nsoils such\
    \ as clay can be two to four times that of coarse-textured sandy soils under similar\
    \ climatic\nconditions, which in turn, can inﬂuence soil water holding capacity\
    \ [79]. Therefore, understanding the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n7 of 21\norganic matter\
    \ distribution in the ﬁeld can help in estimation of irrigation requirements for\
    \ the ﬁeld\nand hence should be incorporated in developing site-speciﬁc water\
    \ management.\n3.2.3. Soil Biological Properties\nMost site-speciﬁc studies did\
    \ not consider spatial variability of soil organisms, but recent studies\nhave\
    \ shown that the spatial distribution of soil organisms inﬂuence plant growth\
    \ and possibly yield [80].\nSpatial and temporal distribution of microorganisms\
    \ at the landscape scale is complicated by the\ninteractions among topography,\
    \ soil type and distribution of water in the ﬁeld [81]. The management\nactivity\
    \ in the ﬁeld can inﬂuence the distribution of soil biological components and\
    \ this, in turn,\naffects the efﬁciency of agricultural management [82]. The soil\
    \ has the greatest microbial diversity\namong all ecosystems that support soil\
    \ conditioning and plant growth [83]. A study conducted in\nFrance [84] showed\
    \ that microbial indicators expressed a high spatial heterogeneity at the ﬁeld\
    \ level,\nwhich masked the effects of several soil and crop management treatments.\
    \ The results also showed\nthat the spatial variability due to biological variables\
    \ was similar in magnitude as compared to that\nexhibited by physicochemical parameters,\
    \ which indicated the feasibility of site-speciﬁc management\nof biological variability\
    \ in the ﬁeld using management zones. Such site-speciﬁc management can be\neffective\
    \ since organisms such as earthworms, protozoa, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and\
    \ different\narthropods play a vital role in soil fertility and productivity [71].\n\
    3.2.4. Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity (ECa)\nObtaining accurate information\
    \ about the spatial and temporal variability of SWC and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ is one of the important challenges in site-speciﬁc water management.\nECa is\
    \ a\nmeasurement of ﬁeld variability that can be applied to precise water management\
    \ because it is\neasy to measure and facilitates the spatial understanding of\
    \ the soil-water-plant relationship [85].\nECa is a function of several soil properties,\
    \ such as soil salinity, texture, bulk density, ion concentration,\ntype and amount\
    \ of clay, topsoil thickness, and water content [86]. The effect of ECa on crop\
    \ yield is\nthrough its relation to soil properties, which depends on climate,\
    \ crop type and other speciﬁc ﬁeld\nconditions [87]. In general, high ECa is associated\
    \ with high clay content in the soil [88]. For example,\na study conducted near\
    \ Lamesa, Texas, showed that in four of the six sites, shallow ECa measured\n\
    with a Veris mapping system was positively correlated with clay content. Clay\
    \ content was negatively\nrelated to shallow ECa at one site due to the low bulk\
    \ density of the calcic horizon [89]. Most of the\nresearch conducted did not\
    \ consider the spatial correlation of soil characteristics when evaluating\ntheir\
    \ distributions. However, spatial autocorrelation of soil properties can be more\
    \ important than\nsoil properties themselves in explaining ECa. Therefore, future\
    \ studies need to incorporate the\nspatial correlation of soil characteristics\
    \ in evaluating the impact of ECa on crop yield [90]. ECa has\nthe potential to\
    \ differentiate between soils when the soils have enough water content and can\n\
    be used as an indicator of SWC. In general, areas with high ECa are associated\
    \ with high water\ncontent [91]. Several studies have shown a higher correlation\
    \ of crop growth characteristics and yield\nwith ECa [92,93]. A study showed that\
    \ ECa in combination with topographic attributes and bare soil\nbrightness could\
    \ explain up to 70.1% of the variability in cotton yield [56]. Hence, understanding\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal variability of ECa provides information for site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management\nfor optimized yield.\nThe association between crop yield\
    \ and soil physical and chemical properties and landscape\nprocesses provide opportunities\
    \ to improve water management at the landscape scale [61].\nSoil properties and\
    \ topography inﬂuence crop yield from microscales to watershed scales and the\n\
    magnitude of complexity increases with the scale due to an increase in soil and\
    \ topographical variability,\nas well as variability in rainfall, temperature\
    \ and other climatic factors [60]. A study showed lower\ncorn grain and stover\
    \ yield in depositional and ﬂat areas which retained water for longer periods,\n\
    and high yield at well-drained summit positions [94]. In the same research for\
    \ alfalfa and poplar,\nthe results showed higher productivity at a site with a\
    \ relatively steep slope and potentially erosive\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n8 of 21\n\
    soils. This relationship was attributed to the above-normal rainfall in both years\
    \ of study. In a six-year\nstudy to understand corn yield in relation to terrain\
    \ attributes, two years with more than normal\nprecipitation showed a positive\
    \ correlation between yield and slope. For the other four years, yield was\nnegatively\
    \ correlated with slope [55]. Crop yield in relation to soil properties and topography\
    \ depends\non different soil management and climate conditions. The correlation\
    \ was found to be stronger for\ndry years in degraded soils and attributed to\
    \ differences in water availability. This suggests that\nvariable-rate irrigation\
    \ strategies might require adjustments in different crop seasons with different\n\
    climatic and management conditions and hence more researches on VRI are needed\
    \ [95].\n4. Crop and Soil Monitoring for Precision Water Management\nWater requirement\
    \ varies with the crop and crop growth and development status, soil water status,\n\
    as well as environmental conditions. Closely monitoring soil water status, crop\
    \ growth conditions and\ntheir spatial and temporal patterns can aid in irrigation\
    \ scheduling and precise water management.\nAmong many tools, remote sensing can\
    \ serve an effective basis by providing images with spatial\nand temporal variability\
    \ of crop growth parameters and soil moisture status for input in precision\n\
    water management.\n4.1. Crop Coefﬁcient and ET\nVRI aims at increasing WUE and\
    \ stabilizing yield, which can be improved by scheduling\nthe irrigation of crops\
    \ using physical and agronomic principles in irrigation management strategy.\n\
    WUE (kg/m3) can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of target product of the\
    \ crop to the amount\nof water applied to produce that output. The amount of water\
    \ used for crop production is the amount\nrequired to overcome the water lost\
    \ by ET from plant and soil surface, and it varies spatiotemporally\naccording\
    \ to weather and vegetation cover conditions [96,97]. Climatological parameters\
    \ such as\nsolar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and crop\
    \ and soil water characteristics,\nincluding management and environmental aspects,\
    \ are important parameters inﬂuencing ET in\nagricultural ﬁelds. Since ET is difﬁcult\
    \ to measure, reference ET from a hypothetical grass reference\nsurface is commonly\
    \ calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation based on meteorological\n\
    parameters [98]. The equation is expressed as follows,\nET0 = [0.408 ∆ (Rn − G)\
    \ + γ {900/(T + 273)} u2 (es − ea)]/[∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 u2)]\nwhere, ET0—Reference\
    \ evapotranspiration [mm day−1], Rn—Net radiation at the crop surface [MJ\nm−2\
    \ day−1], G—Soil heat ﬂux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T—Air temperature at 2 m height\
    \ [◦C],\nu2—Wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es—Saturation vapor pressure [kPa],\
    \ ea—Actual vapor pressure\n[kPa], es—ea saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit [kPa],\
    \ D—Slope vapor pressure curve [kPa ◦C−1],\nγ—Psychrometric constant [kPa ◦C−1].\n\
    Crop-speciﬁc evapotranspiration needs are calculated based on crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (Kc). By using\nthe FAO Penman-Monteith deﬁnition for ET0, crop coefﬁcients\
    \ at research sites could be calculated by\nrelating the measured crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) with the calculated ET0, i.e., Kc = ET/ET0. The crop\ncoefﬁcient differs\
    \ widely between crops and among growth stages for the same crop. This Kc factor\n\
    serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological differences among crops\
    \ and averaged\neffects of evaporation from the soil [98]. Several spatial models\
    \ have been developed for ET estimation,\nwhich showed that accurate spatial ET\
    \ and water-balance models could be of great importance in VRI\napplication [61,99,100].\n\
    4.2. Remote and Proximal Sensing\nBesides crop coefﬁcient and ET, mapping soil\
    \ properties in a ﬁeld, such as ﬁeld capacity and\nroot zone water availability,\
    \ is also important for site-speciﬁc water management [101]. Information\nregarding\
    \ variability of plant conditions such as water stress, growth parameters, ground\
    \ cover can also\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n9 of 21\nprovide a basis for VRI. Remote\
    \ sensing using various sensors and platforms is often used to estimate\nseveral\
    \ soil and crop characteristics during the growing season that can provide important\
    \ information\nin decision support. The near-real-time information from several\
    \ sensors, such as spectral reﬂectance\nsensors and infrared thermometers have\
    \ been used to develop ﬁeld maps for water, vegetation,\nand nutrient status [50,102].\
    \ Remotely sensed images can be useful in determining leaf area index and\nground\
    \ cover for a ﬁeld and thus help in yield forecasting [103]. Remote sensing can\
    \ also help estimate\nET more reliably from individual ﬁelds [104]. A study in\
    \ Nebraska evaluated remote-sensing-based\nET and a water-balance model for irrigation\
    \ management [105]. In this study, four irrigation treatment\ncombinations were\
    \ tested: VRI based on water-balance model using remote sensing, VRI based on\n\
    water-balance model using neutron probe, uniform irrigation based on neutron-probe\
    \ measurement\nand rainfed. Landsat 7 and 8 imageries were used for model input\
    \ in a remote sensing-based\nmodel, which included reﬂectance-based crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for ET estimation. The result showed\nthat remote sensing-based treatment had\
    \ the greatest mean prescribed irrigation, which was attributed\nto water-balance\
    \ drift. The study concluded that the remote-sensing-based model might perform\n\
    better when coupled with SWC measurement. This can be helpful in site-speciﬁc\
    \ management of\nirrigation water, as well as weedicide, pesticide and other chemicals\
    \ [106–108]. Various indices\nderived from thermal and multispectral images, such\
    \ as crop water stress index (CWSI), perpendicular\nvegetation index (PVI), normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reﬂectance\nindex (PRI),\
    \ can predict soil or plant water status and drought stress as a basis for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water\nmanagement [109,110]. Use of digital infrared thermography to measure\
    \ canopy temperature can\nhelp producers to detect early crop water stress and\
    \ avoid yield declines as well as saving water\nwith site-speciﬁc irrigation management\
    \ and irrigation scheduling [111,112]. Recent improvements in\nremote and proximal\
    \ sensing technologies such as wireless soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\n\
    systems (UAS) have increased the efﬁciency for farmers to exercise site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management.\nIndices derived from high-resolution UAS imagery have\
    \ shown the potential to predict crop water\nstress indicators such as water potential\
    \ and stomatal conductance [113]. Such information can aid in\nimproving irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Although soil\n\
    moisture sensors are found to be more proﬁtable in the present context, with the\
    \ increasing number\nof manufacturers and clear regulations, UAS-based sensor\
    \ technology for soil moisture estimation\nis gaining momentum [114]. This explains\
    \ the importance of remote sensing as a low-cost tool to\nimprove water management\
    \ in crops.\n5. Precision Water Management Strategies\nSeveral precision irrigation\
    \ technologies have been developed to improve crop productivity under\nwater-limited\
    \ conditions. However, appropriate precision irrigation strategies are equally\
    \ important for\nincreased efﬁciency and proﬁtability for site-speciﬁc technologies.\
    \ The development and application\nof management zones using spatial and temporal\
    \ information of various agronomic factors have\nbeen practiced for site-speciﬁc\
    \ management for several decades. In recent years, the use of artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ in prescription map development for site-speciﬁc water management is also increasing.\n\
    5.1. Management Zones\nVRI is often implemented in the ﬁeld by dividing it into\
    \ a number of sections, or management\nzones with the aim to save water and other\
    \ inputs together with yield optimization [25]. A management\nzone is a subﬁeld\
    \ area that is relatively homogeneous in soil and topographic attributes. The\
    \ use of\nmanagement zones can be a convenient means to capture the spatial distribution\
    \ of yield-inﬂuencing\nfactors within the season. The information on spatial and\
    \ temporal development of abiotic and\nbiotic stresses can be linked with site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation systems via dynamic prescription maps\nto help producers improve\
    \ irrigation WUE, agricultural sustainability and the environment [102].\nVarious\
    \ factors such as soil properties, landscape attributes, crop properties, sensor-based\
    \ information,\nmanagement practice, weed, and pest management as well as crop\
    \ modeling have been considered\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n10 of 21\nin delineating\
    \ management zones for VRI application since several years [115]. Soil properties\
    \ such\nas soil organic matter, texture, nutrient content, pH, color, soil moisture\
    \ content and water-holding\ncapacities, ECa, etc. have been used effectively\
    \ in management zone delineation [116–119]. Landscape\nattributes such as elevation,\
    \ slope, aspect, curvature, and others have also been an important part\nof management\
    \ zone delineation in several studies [118,120–122]. Numerous studies have used\
    \ crop\nproperties such as yield maps and ground-based leaf area index to delineate\
    \ management zones\nfor VRI application [116,117,123,124]. The management zones\
    \ delineated based on yield data from\nmultiple years can effectively capture\
    \ nutrient variability in the ﬁeld [125]. However, the application of\nyield maps\
    \ for site-speciﬁc management can be challenging because spatial and temporal\
    \ variation in\nyield is affected by the interactions among several biotic and\
    \ abiotic factors [126,127]. Information from\nproximal and remote sensing such\
    \ as satellite and airborne imagery, normalized difference vegetation\nindex,\
    \ digital photography, etc. can be a powerful approach for delineation of relative\
    \ productive\nareas [128–131]. The zone information together with early season\
    \ environmental indicators and\ncrop response models can also be used to determine\
    \ the action decisions throughout the season [132].\nSimilarly, the selection\
    \ of factors for management zone delineation is equally important in management\n\
    zone delineation. A study was conducted to compare the site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ with conventional\nuniform irrigation management for potatoes in Idaho [25].\
    \ The available water-holding capacity of soil\nwas used to delineate a 2.9-ha\
    \ ﬁeld into nine management zones. The results showed that six out of\nnine management\
    \ zones produced a higher yield with site-speciﬁc management. However, the study\n\
    suggested that management zones were only based on available SWC and in some management\
    \ cases,\nother non-measured factors unrelated to soil texture or available water\
    \ content could have an impact\non the yield of crops. The study pointed out the\
    \ importance to take into consideration all the known\nfactors affecting yield\
    \ and include them in delineating irrigation management zones for site-speciﬁc\n\
    irrigation management. The optimum number of zones for a ﬁeld depends on the scale\
    \ of the ﬁeld,\neconomical and logistical practicality, and agronomic response\
    \ to irrigation amounts. For example,\nthe quantity and placement of soil moisture\
    \ sensors for determining irrigation amounts may vary\nwith ﬁeld size, cost of\
    \ the sensors and manageability, which, in turn, can inﬂuence the number of\n\
    management zones in the ﬁeld [133].\nThere are several methods to delineate management\
    \ zones, including unsupervised clustering,\nsupervised clustering, user-deﬁned\
    \ thresholds, etc. The clustering technique groups similar data\npoints into different\
    \ classes using algorithms such as k-means, fuzzy k-means, fuzzy c-means [127,134],\n\
    Ward′s method, and Jenk’s optimization procedure [125]. The appropriate factors\
    \ to be considered for\nmanagement zone delineation could be prioritized using\
    \ several methods such as principal component\nanalysis (PCA) [118]. It is equally\
    \ important to determine the number of optimum management\nzones for the ﬁeld\
    \ and their production and economic justiﬁcation [20]. A software program (MZA\n\
    software [135]) was developed for creating management zones using the fuzzy k-means\
    \ method.\nThis program determines the appropriate number of zones for a ﬁeld\
    \ by evaluating the clustering\nresults. Many studies have used management zones\
    \ for VRI and other site-speciﬁc crop management.\nFor example, a study conducted\
    \ in a 4.8-ha ﬁeld in Colorado assessed the effectiveness of ECa in\ncharacterizing\
    \ the spatial distribution of soil water [136]. This study found that SWC was\
    \ signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among different ECa derived management zones using MZA\
    \ software. This justiﬁes the\nimportance of characterizing management zones for\
    \ site-speciﬁc water management.\n5.2. Development of Site-Speciﬁc Water Management\
    \ Strategies\nTo enable the VRI technology in practice, the irrigation management\
    \ strategy is equally important.\nThe use of technology in the ﬁeld may not always\
    \ be effective in terms of ﬁnal yield or proﬁtability.\nFor example, research\
    \ has shown that the use of VRI technology may not be cost effective where\nthere\
    \ is high rainfall throughout the growing season [29]. Several strategies could\
    \ be applied to\nsave water and energy in the ﬁeld to gain yield beneﬁts in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Some of the strategies include\nskipping irritation in non-cropped areas,\
    \ planting different crops in the same ﬁeld, rainfall harvesting\nAgronomy 2019,\
    \ 9, 87\n11 of 21\nin areas with high water-holding capacity, and lowering irrigation\
    \ to areas with low water use (ET) [46].\nNew irrigation strategies such as modifying\
    \ the current irrigation system for site-speciﬁc water and\nchemical applications\
    \ are required to sustain modern irrigated agricultural cropping systems [102].\n\
    Management strategies including placement and timing are crucial in optimizing\
    \ irrigation\nthroughout the growing season. About 9%−19% of irrigation water\
    \ savings were achieved with VRI\ncompared to the uniform application in a research\
    \ conducted in variable soil, which was possible\nwith several strategies such\
    \ as withholding irrigation during speciﬁc growth stages and in particular,\n\
    non-cropped areas of the ﬁeld [137]. Further, the study suggests that areas where\
    \ the optimized or\nincreased irrigation does not produce an increase in yield,\
    \ less water can be applied while the areas\nwith high yield potential can be\
    \ applied optimum irrigation and gain higher returns. A study showed\nthat restricting\
    \ irrigation during the peak water-demand time of cotton (80−100 days after planting)\n\
    from 100% to 60% of potential ET conserves 2.6 inches of water [138]. The VRI\
    \ trial was conducted\nin three farms in New Zealand to compare the VRI to uniform\
    \ rate irrigation (URI) [139]. The URI\ntreatments were provided with the same\
    \ level of irrigation at the same time as the most drought-prone\nsoil zone, but\
    \ VRI treatment was achieved by either delaying the irrigation or reducing the\
    \ amount\nand intensity of irrigation comparing to that with a drought-prone area.\
    \ The results showed that there\nwas a two to three-fold difference in total available\
    \ water-holding capacity at each site, which justiﬁed\nthe decision to use VRI\
    \ systems. Although the study found no signiﬁcant impact of VRI on crop yield,\n\
    water savings of 8 to 36% were achieved in three sites with less drainage. Hence,\
    \ critical management\nstrategies adopted in a decision support system that uses\
    \ real-time monitoring and feedback to\nirrigation control make water conversation\
    \ possible [28]. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is a complementary\nmethod that uses irrigation\
    \ scheduling at strategic times of less critical growth for irrigation water\n\
    conservation. In this method, irrigation is applied during the drought-sensitive\
    \ growth stages of a\ncrop. During less drought-sensitive stages, irrigation is\
    \ applied based on rainfall and availability of\nwater for maintenance [140].\n\
    The use of technology and strategies can also affect the level of proﬁt achieved\
    \ from the VRI\ntechnology itself. A study was conducted in a 20-ha wheat ﬁeld\
    \ in Southern Alberta, Canada on\nmodeling economic returns at different levels\
    \ of control [141]. A total of 62 management scenarios\nwere studied, including\
    \ (1) no irrigation, (2) uniform irrigation management, (3) speed control with\n\
    two angular increments of 2 and 10 degrees, and (4) zone control with a combination\
    \ of two angular\nincrements and a different number of independent irrigation\
    \ zones, ranging from 2 to 30. The study\nconcluded that the highest proﬁt was\
    \ obtained with 30 control zones. However, considering the cost\nof the technology,\
    \ the case of ten control zones along the central pivot system was found to be\
    \ the\nmost proﬁtable. Hence, it is essential to set forth effective site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management strategies for\nincreased agricultural sustainability and proﬁtability.\n\
    5.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Deep Learning\nExisting site-speciﬁc management\
    \ utilizes several control strategies such mathematical modeling\nof crop yield\
    \ or the plant-soil-atmosphere environment, optimizing irrigation application\
    \ timing,\nlearning sensor feedback to control the site-speciﬁc ﬂow of water as\
    \ well as using predictive model\ncontrol that executes a model repeatedly to\
    \ determine optimum input. The use of artiﬁcial intelligence\nor neuro-dynamic\
    \ programming that integrates machine learning to determine the water application\n\
    parameter for optimized irrigation is also increasing [50,142–145]. Hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing\nimaging along with machine learning has been in use in agricultural\
    \ industry, and it is estimated that\nmachine learning/deep learning-based classiﬁcation\
    \ has a signiﬁcant potential for high-dimensional\nbig data produced in agriculture\
    \ [146].\n6. Impact of Variable-Rate Irrigation\nVRI can be highly effective in\
    \ reducing water use and increasing water use efﬁciency (WUE) of\ncrops [147].\
    \ A review on VRI across different crop and weather regimes of the world concluded\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n12 of 21\nVRI could save 10%−15% of water [28].\
    \ A study in a 7-ha sugar beet ﬁeld in Germany reported that\n13% of water was\
    \ saved compared to the uniform application [15]. This was achieved by utilizing\n\
    stored soil moisture and in-season precipitation. In a study in New Zealand comparing\
    \ VRI with\nconventional irrigation system, 9%−19% irrigation water was saved\
    \ with VRI in pasture and corn\nﬁelds, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching\
    \ [137]. Similarly, the application of VRI by manipulating\nits several components\
    \ can reduce water runoff by avoiding excess water application in the ﬁeld [28].\n\
    At a large scale, water pumpage and use can be reduced by adopting VRI. A geospatial\
    \ method has\nbeen provided for potential VRI technology adopters to achieve potential\
    \ water savings in the ﬁeld\nusing freely available datasets such as soil survey\
    \ data from the Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) [48]. In this study,\
    \ the difference in application depth between conventional irrigation\nand VRI\
    \ was estimated based on root zone available water capacity. The undepleted soil\
    \ water from\neach management zone was mined using prescription maps allowing\
    \ 50% depletion. VRI in this\nstudy resulted in a reduction in irrigation depth\
    \ of up to 18 mm, pumping reductions, and improved\nwater distribution throughout\
    \ the ﬁeld. In addition, higher VRI control resolution increased energy\nsavings.\
    \ VRI was found to reduce pumpage in more than 13% of center pivot irrigated ﬁelds\
    \ by 25 mm\nper year compared to the conventional irrigation system in Nebraska\
    \ [99]. Another study for VRI\nmanagement based on soil water spatial variation\
    \ was conducted in a 1.64-ha ﬁeld with center pivot to\nunderstand the yield and\
    \ water-saving effects of VRI [148]. In this study, the ﬁeld was divided into\
    \ four\nmanagement zones based on available water-holding capacity and each management\
    \ zone was further\ndivided into two sections for VRI and URI management. The\
    \ results from this study indicated that the\nimpact of VRI on water savings within\
    \ zones depended on weather conditions. Water savings with\nVRI management was\
    \ higher for summer maize when the rainfall was high compared to winter wheat\n\
    grown in no-rainfall weather. The study suggests that although VRI management\
    \ had no signiﬁcant\ninﬂuence on crop growth parameters and yield within a management\
    \ zone, managing the zones with\ndifferent available water-holding capacity might\
    \ improve the uniformity of crop growth, maximize\ncrop yield and gain potential\
    \ water savings.\nCompared to the uniform application, VRI increases crop productivity.\
    \ The results comparing\nthe water productivity of sorghum and corn showed that\
    \ there was more than 20% increase in water\nproductivity for both crops using\
    \ VRI [35]. Another study conducted in a 4-ha ﬁeld, VRI resulted in\na signiﬁcant\
    \ difference in corn yield in a dry year. However, the results were not signiﬁcant\
    \ for the\nyear when the rain was sufﬁcient [100]. Another study was conducted\
    \ in New Zealand to understand\nthe impact of variable-rate irrigation based on\
    \ soil moisture status [139]. This study showed that\nalthough the yield was not\
    \ signiﬁcantly different among different irrigation treatments, water savings\n\
    of 27–55 mm was achieved by limiting irrigation in soil with adequate plant available\
    \ water and\nnon-irrigating poorly drained, wet soil zones. VRI has been found\
    \ effective to reduce water and\nenergy use even in humid areas of the world with\
    \ uncertain and unpredictable rainfall [40]. This study\nshowed that potential\
    \ water savings of 20mm/year could be achieved using VRI in these regions.\nHowever,\
    \ the feasibility and effectiveness of VRI depend on the magnitude of the ﬁeld,\
    \ crop under\nconsideration, weather and the underlying ﬁeld properties [24,25,40].\
    \ The accurate determination of\nwater requirement and its management is crucial\
    \ for crop yield stabilization and improved average\nyield [53]. Several VRI research\
    \ projects attempt to enhance the control scenarios as well as model and\nproduction\
    \ function to improve water savings and reduce pumpage [40,99,141,149,150]. Further,\
    \ it is\nnecessary to understand the impact of soil water availability on crop\
    \ growth to manage irrigation in\nspatial and temporal scales using variable-rate\
    \ irrigation technologies and appropriate strategies.\n7. Challenges and Research\
    \ Requirements\nData collection and management tools, such as yield monitors,\
    \ sensors and sensing systems,\nGIS, GNSS, and decision support systems are available\
    \ today to enable site-speciﬁc management of\nirrigation water for optimized crop\
    \ production. Steady development in irrigation control systems\nprovides the user\
    \ with various options to implement VRI. Many studies have investigated and\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n13 of 21\ndeveloped irrigation strategies, prescription\
    \ methodologies, and proﬁtability optimization involved in\nVRI. However, there\
    \ are some challenges in the implementation and application of this technology.\n\
    Further research and development are required to improve the understanding, implementation,\n\
    and adoption of precision water management strategies and technologies.\n(1)\n\
    Research is required on the integration of technology, agronomy, and proﬁtability\
    \ with VRI\nAlthough several studies have reported the potential of adopting VRI\
    \ system to optimize crop\nproduction and proﬁtability [29,70], some studies conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds have concluded\nthat the VRI technology may not be economically\
    \ viable for all crops under all growing conditions\nand environments [24]. This\
    \ is not because of the yield-related beneﬁt, but due to the cost of the\ntechnology\
    \ itself. For example, research conducted in a 12.6-ha ﬁeld in southwest Georgia\
    \ showed that\nVRI generated $16/ha more return than URI. Although this return\
    \ is not signiﬁcant for this small ﬁeld,\nthe study suggested that proﬁts could\
    \ be ampliﬁed for large ﬁelds and beneﬁt farmers [151]. From the\nagronomic perspective,\
    \ a better understanding of the extremities of ﬁeld variability and how it affects\n\
    crop yield is needed for the effective implementation of new technologies [152].\
    \ In an experiment\nconducted in Tennessee, the same level of irrigation did not\
    \ result in the same cotton lint yield in all\nparts of the ﬁeld due to differences\
    \ in texture and available water-holding capacity [153]. In some cases,\nthe incorporation\
    \ of other crops in a rotation in VRI can make this technology economically viable\
    \ [25].\nAdditionally, most of the VRI studies are concentrated on the control\
    \ scenarios of VRI [149,150].\nAlthough a few studies [40,99,141] determined water\
    \ and energy savings using VRI due to managerial\nlimitations, they were either\
    \ based on some model and production functions or arbitrary in irrigation\nrate\
    \ determination. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive study on VRI integrating\
    \ the agronomic,\ntechnical and managerial aspects of VRI to determine its proﬁtability,\
    \ sustainability, and adoptability\nfor various conditions.\n(2)\nOn-farm and\
    \ whole-ﬁeld research\nProducers are more likely to adopt VRI if the beneﬁts are\
    \ shown on a “real farm.” Most of the\nprevious studies on VRI were conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds or in small ﬁelds that cannot represent\nthe commercial\
    \ farming practice [28]. Experimental design and implementation in large ﬁelds\
    \ are\nchallenging. This type of research requires close communication and collaborative\
    \ management\nbetween the researcher and the farm owner to ensure the alignment\
    \ of management practices and study\ngoals. Acquiring data and information from\
    \ large ﬁelds is costly and time-consuming. In addition,\nthe statistical analysis\
    \ of on-farm data is challenging due to the lack of adequate tools that integrates\n\
    classical statistical methods and spatial analysis. This creates challenges in\
    \ the understanding of the\nrelationship between crop growth and its environment\
    \ in site-speciﬁc irrigation. More on-farm studies\nare needed to provide information\
    \ for practical VRI applications. In addition, insufﬁcient recognition\nof temporal\
    \ variation and environmental impact are several other factors that hinder the\
    \ adoption of\nprecision agriculture technology [9].\n(3)\nPrescription map development\n\
    The majority of previous studies for prescription maps (management zone delineation)\
    \ are for\nvariable-rate application of fertilizers and seeds and are static [20,133].\
    \ Limited research has addressed\nthe need for dynamic prescription map development\
    \ that could incorporate seasonal changes in\ncrop growth and conditions [133].\
    \ More research is required to evaluate VRI prescription maps or\nmanagement zone\
    \ development integrating different soil and crop characteristics under different\n\
    environments. Use of remote and proximal sensing such as infrared sensors, near-infrared\
    \ and thermal\nimages, along with weather data can provide information on crop,\
    \ soil, and environmental conditions\nin irrigation scheduling and developing\
    \ dynamic prescription maps [97]. Further research needs to\ninvestigate how to\
    \ integrate such data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of such prescription\n\
    maps during the growing season.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n14 of 21\n(4)\nOptimal\
    \ spatial and temporal scale\nFew studies have evaluated the appropriate spatial\
    \ and temporal scales for VRI application.\nMany studies have explored the use\
    \ of sensors in acquiring information for modeling crop\nevapotranspiration, SWC,\
    \ irrigation needs including the nutrient requirements [97,105,152,154,155].\n\
    Most of these studies indicated the high potential of remote and proximal sensing\
    \ technologies in\nunderstanding spatial and temporal variations in crop growth\
    \ conditions in the ﬁeld. Temporal\nvariability in soil water status and crop\
    \ growing conditions require dynamic adjustment of irrigation\namount and spatial\
    \ distribution. Therefore, simulation models or on-farm studies might be considered\n\
    to assess the effectiveness of VRI at different spatial and temporal scales.\n\
    (5)\nComprehensive decision support tools\nPrecision irrigation management requires\
    \ data and information from crop growth conditions,\nsoil physical and chemical\
    \ properties, weather factors, and the interaction among these factors.\nEffective\
    \ implementation of precision irrigation requires a comprehensive decision support\
    \ system to\nprocess and integrate different layers of data and information [48].\
    \ The challenge for the application\nof VRI still exists in the lack of user-friendly\
    \ decision support tools such as for developing dynamic\nprescription maps [105].\
    \ Several decision support systems such as AgriDSS are available [16,156],\nbut\
    \ producers are reluctant to use them to their full potential due to their complexity.\
    \ Also, these tools\nare based on what scientists and developers consider as necessary\
    \ knowledge that should be\nimplemented in the decision support system. However,\
    \ in a real-world situation, they fail to utilize\nthe implicit knowledge of farmers\
    \ and address their needs. The complexity, lack of observability and\nconﬁdence,\
    \ poor user interface design, lack of incentive to learn are some of the other\
    \ reasons behind\nthe hindrance of adoption of different decision support tools\
    \ [16]. The system or tool should help the\nuser decide where to apply how much\
    \ irrigation water at various crop growth stages to achieve the\nhighest proﬁt\
    \ based on the regional climate conditions and cropping systems.\n(6)\nIntegrating\
    \ VRI with other inputs\nFew studies have integrated variable-rate application\
    \ of nutrients with water. Crop yield response\nto water and N are not the same\
    \ at different parts of the ﬁeld [157], indicating the need for studying\nthe\
    \ interaction of water and fertilizer in variable-rate irrigation. Site-speciﬁc\
    \ application of N together\nwith irrigation using remote sensing can help reduce\
    \ N inputs by 50% and leaching by 85% without\nreducing yields [155]. Further\
    \ studies are needed to investigate the interaction between VRI fertilizers\n\
    and other inputs to improve the efﬁciencies of water and fertilizers while reducing\
    \ the environmental\nimpact of fertilizer application and enhancing production\
    \ sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed equally to the\

    73 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Dwindling water supplies, increasing drought
    frequency and uncertainties associated with a changing climate mean Europe''s
    irrigated agriculture sector needs to improve water efficiency and produce more
    ''crop per drop''. This paper summarizes the drivers for change, and the constraints
    and opportunities for improving agricultural water management through uptake of
    precision irrigation technologies. A multi-disciplinary and integrated approach
    involving irrigation engineers, soil scientists, agronomists and plant physiologists
    will be needed if the potential for precision irrigation within the field crop
    sector is to be realized. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry Introduction In
    many European river basins where irrigated agriculture is concentrated, there
    is increasing competition for water.1 Climate change threatens to exacerbate the
    situation with a reduction in resource availability,2 a wider spectrum of crop
    production risks3 and an increase in agricultural water demand.4 Despite its economic
    importance, the sustainability of irrigated production is under threat due to
    increasing water scarcity5 and concerns regarding the impact of over-abstraction
    on the environment.6 The total irrigated area in Europe is 12 × 106 ha, which
    represents 5% of the global irrigated area.7 Irrigation water demand varies depending
    on temporal and spatial variations in soils and agroclimate, crop requirement
    and access to water resources of appropriate quality. For Europe as a whole, irrigation
    accounts for 24% of abstractions,6 but in central and northern Europe are typically
    small (<5% of total abstractions), although they can still can have significant
    environmental impacts, particularly in drier catchments in the driest months and
    driest years when resources are most constrained. Here supplemental irrigation
    is used, most notably on high-value field-scale (outdoor) horticulture, where
    it serves to maximize yield and quality of fruit and vegetables for retailers
    (supermarkets) and processors.8 In contrast, in parts of Mediterranean Europe,
    irrigation accounts for over 80% of total abstractions6 and is used in intensive
    and extensive cropping, including field and protected horticulture. Clearly, securing
    adequate water for agriculture will be essential to meet future food demands for
    a growing population. Any changes in water allocation should account for the multifunctional
    nature and diversity of benefits that agriculture provides in addition to food
    production.3 Agriculture in Europe, like other parts of the world, faces a major
    challenge: supplying more food to meet increasing demands while simultaneously
    reducing its environmental impact.9 Under a scenario of reduced water availability,
    increasing drought frequency and uncertainties associated with a changing climate,
    Europe''s irrigated agriculture sector needs to do more with less. This implies
    a need to increase water productivity (t−1 ha−1). Although irrigation has been
    practised for centuries, only recently has the sector had to respond to societal
    demands for reductions in water allocation and improvements in efficiency. A major
    gap still exists between research and on-farm irrigation practice, which is reflected
    in large differences between actual and potential yield: the ''yield gap''.5 In
    most cases, such gaps can be attributed to suboptimal management, inappropriate
    technology and/or lack of training. In this context, precision irrigation, defined
    as site-specific irrigation management that relies on the variable application
    of water (adapted from Cassman10), emerges as a potential solution to increase
    the productivity, and reduce the environmental impact, of irrigated agriculture.
    A committed international effort will be needed to implement technologies that
    are appropriate for different farming systems to reduce both water and energy
    use, while improving crop yield and quality. This paper discusses the drivers
    for change and highlights the constraints and opportunities for improving agricultural
    water management through precision irrigation. Drivers For Change Agricultural
    intensification has required growers to become more specialized and for many growers
    an investment in irrigation has provided the basis for increasing profitability.
    Rising labour and energy costs, coupled with consumer demands for premium quality,
    mean farmers now have to consider the impacts of non-uniformity of irrigation
    application on crop yield and, particularly, quality. For some crops, such as
    potatoes, the size, colour, shape and skin finish of the harvested product all
    impact on price and marketability. Quality criteria are increasingly specified
    as a condition of contract and sale, and failure to meet quality standards can
    lead to large price discounting, and possibly to rejection and loss of contract.
    In high-value sectors such as salads the premia are high and it can be difficult
    to secure contracts without guaranteed access to irrigation. Crop assurance schemes
    are also playing a key role in promoting precision irrigation since these require
    growers to manage and audit irrigation practices and links these to traceability
    and accountability in support of public health and environmental protection regulation.
    European irrigated agriculture also needs to respond to environmental regulation
    challenges – most notably through the Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/E).
    The WFD provides the major driver for achieving sustainable water management across
    all EU member states.11 It applies to all fresh waters and includes aims to tackle
    diffuse pollution ranging from fertilizer and pesticide applications in irrigated
    agriculture to urban run-off. owing to their dependence on fertilizers, irrigated
    farms need to ensure that diffuse pollution does not contribute to water pollution
    at the catchment scale. Here precision irrigation could play an important role
    in mitigating such risks by matching irrigation to soil type, its inherent permeability
    and nutrient retention capacity and by using liquid fertilizer matched with variable
    irrigation applications. The rising cost of fertilizer will also act as an industry
    incentive to match inputs to plant growth and requirement. Reduced water availability
    and reliability for irrigation abstraction are also likely to be important drivers
    for change, as member states implement new abstraction control measures. In some
    countries, abstraction regimes are already in place, but in others new frameworks
    for abstraction regulation need to be implemented.12 In future, farmers will need
    to demonstrate more efficient and sustainable use of water to secure rights (permits)
    for irrigation abstraction1 and to comply with industry protocols regarding food
    safety and crop assurance.13 Developing innovative approaches to combine better
    spatial and temporal knowledge of soil properties, crop requirements and improved
    equipment practices are prerequisites for improving water productivity through
    precision irrigation – whether driven by market, regulatory or public demands
    for greater environmental sustainability. Constraints And Opportunities On most
    farms, making best use of stored soil moisture and rainfall, knowing precisely
    where and when irrigation has to be applied, and then applying it accurately and
    uniformly, are fundamental steps in the pathway to water efficiency.1 Although
    irrigation is usually justified by increased production, there is growing evidence
    that optimized irrigation regimes under temperate and humid conditions can also
    lead to improved post-harvest quality, resulting in reduced crop waste through
    the food supply chain. Presently, farmers are restricted in their ability to match
    the timing and frequency of irrigation applications to inherent spatial and temporal
    variations in soil moisture and crop growth. They generally have only limited
    information on plant water status, rely on limited in situ point measurements
    of soil as a proxy for field-scale soil moisture availability, and use outdated
    irrigation application systems that lack the necessary flexibility and control
    for variable water application. A combination of improved application technology,
    monitoring systems and understanding of crop responses will be needed to enable
    growers to utilize precision irrigation in field crops for commercial and environmental
    benefit. A brief perspective of the innovations in relevant technologies is given
    below. The paper focuses specifically on outdoor field-scale production where
    most water in agriculture is abstracted and used; precision irrigation for indoor
    (protected) production systems is also important, but is not specifically considered
    here. Developing variable-rate irrigation technology Most of the land irrigated
    in Europe relies on overhead irrigation, using sprinklers, high-pressure rain
    guns, centre pivots or booms. These can be inefficient in both energy and water
    use. There is a tendency to view micro (drip or trickle) irrigation as the solution
    to improving water efficiency, which partially explains why micro irrigation has
    been heavily promoted, often by regulators and governments. Compared to traditional
    surface methods, trickle irrigation offers the potential for much greater water
    use efficiency,14 though the benefits against good overhead irrigation are smaller.
    Despite higher costs, trickle is an attractive option in regions where water resources
    are scarce and/or expensive. Globally, micro irrigation accounts for less than
    5% of all irrigated farmland.7 In Europe, the proportion is not dissimilar; the
    dominance of low-value irrigated production having contributed to a relatively
    slow rate of growth but there are notable exceptions, such as in Spain (28%) and
    Italy (14%). Precision irrigation through the subdivision of control zones and
    increasingly sophisticated electronic controllers may provide the way forward
    there. Wider user of micro irrigation is limited beyond arid areas by the cost
    of installing and operating systems around sequential plantings, rotational cropping
    and sporadic uses where irrigation is supplementary. Indeed, many growers in such
    areas are reconsidering sprinkler systems as an alternative to micro (drip) irrigation,
    using semi-permanent (seasonal) solid-set systems rather than conventional portable
    systems. It is likely that the greatest short-term improvements in water efficiency
    there will be achieved through developing precision irrigation for overhead systems.
    Most overhead irrigation technologies used in field-scale agriculture fail to
    apply the same depth of water across a field uniformly. Sprinkler irrigation systems
    are adversely affected by pressure variation along and between laterals and, due
    to ground slopes, inadequate overlap of the application patterns between sprinklers
    and wind distortion.15 Similarly, hose reel systems fitted with guns, which account
    for most agricultural irrigation in northern Europe, are notoriously susceptible
    to wind.16 Hose reel systems using booms, which are increasingly popular for field-scale
    horticultural irrigation, provide more uniform application than guns but are still
    sensitive to pressure variation, inconsistent pull-in speed and wind distortion.
    None of the current systems provides sufficient flexibility to cope with spatially
    varying water application. Combining the technologies for individually valved
    sprinklers and computer control developed within the sports turf (golf) industry
    with semi-permanent solid-set sprinkler systems offers great potential to produce
    a cost-effective and highly controllable method of applying water variably across
    a field with controlled volumes applied to individual cropping zones. Optimization
    of which sprinklers operate simultaneously will also allow smaller pipe sizes
    and operating pressure, thus reducing capital and/or pumping (energy) costs. A
    number of researchers have tested variable applications systems using centre pivot
    systems on field crops.17 To date, centre pivot systems have been the focus of
    much of the variable-rate technology research given their ease and suitability
    for installing spatial crop-monitoring equipment and for modifying sprinkler discharge
    packages. The transfer of such technology into portable overhead systems, including
    sprinklers and hose reels fitted with booms, is technically possible but implementation
    of precision irrigation requires a greater understanding of heterogeneity of irrigation
    need across a field. Understanding heterogeneity of soil water content across
    a field The capability of adding variable volumes of irrigation needs to be matched
    to an understanding of the variability of soil and soil water content across a
    field.5 Yield mapping and/or traditional soil sampling can help identify different
    soil zones, and it is now possible to map spatial soil variability using electromagnetic
    induction (EMI) or near-infrared (NIR) systems on a field scale. Researchers are
    also using satellite imagery and imaging devices mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV) over larger areas. The greatest efficiency gains from variable-rate irrigation
    will be realized where growers know how little water they can apply without impacting
    on the commercial return from their crop. This requires an understanding of the
    level of water ''stress'' the plant is experiencing and the critical level of
    stress for onset of yield or quality responses. Increasingly, growers are relying
    on soil moisture sensors, utilizing a range of technologies, each with relative
    advantages and disadvantages.18 In general, they only measure soil moisture status
    near to the sensor and, in order to understand the irrigation requirement across
    a field, particularly where soil properties are heterogeneous, multiple readings
    or networks of sensors will be needed. With the increasing availability of cheap
    soil moisture sensors and low-energy data logging/transmission has come the possibility
    of semi-permanent sensor arrays in situ generating real-time soil water data.19
    Knowing where to place the sensors then becomes a critical question (which may
    be solved through identifying areas of a field that have different water-holding
    properties). Using crop sensors to match irrigation to crop needs Monitoring soil
    moisture status is a proxy for measuring plant water status, with the underlying
    assumption that soil moisture content correlates to some extent with plant water
    status.20 However, plants are plastic in their response to reduced water availability,
    changing root and shoot growth, and the relationship between soil water status
    and the threshold for irrigation is not constant through crop development. If
    it were possible to routinely schedule irrigation from plant responses rather
    than direct measurements of soil water status, this may allow greater precision
    in matching irrigation quantity to crop need. Potentially useful plant responses
    to water stress have been well reviewed;21 these include measures of diurnal tissue
    expansion, tissue water content sensors, relative growth rates, sap flow and stomatal
    conductance. To date, physiological responses have been used to supplement knowledge
    for irrigation scheduling predominantly in production in semi-arid environments
    with little or no rainfall, e.g. tree crops,22 vines23 and glasshouse crops.24
    This approach can also be moved from the whole plant to the whole field or crop
    scale with the development of high-resolution and high-frequency remote sensing
    (e.g. MODIS) technology which can monitor spatial changes in crop cover, informing
    growers on variation in crop water use and evapotranspiration.7 Novel irrigation
    management: regulated deficit irrigation and partial root drying Precision irrigation
    also has the potential to be used in new irrigation management techniques that
    manipulate plant growth rather than just prevent the crop from being exposed to
    a level of water stress that leads to economic loss. It is well known that roots
    in drying soil generate abscisic acid (ABA) and this is one of the pathways controlling
    stomatal aperture.25 By manipulating soil water content in the root zone, crop
    transpiration can be manipulated through ABA-mediated stomatal closure following
    transient drought stress imposed at stages in the crop cycle, known as regulated
    deficit irrigation (RDI) or through alternating portions of the root zone that
    dry down, termed partial root zone drying (PRD) . These techniques have been successfully
    implemented in tree fruit26 and vine crops27 with some commercial success in South
    America, southern Europe and Australia, and work through reducing leaf growth,
    redirecting resources to fruit growth and/or increasing radiation interception
    by the fruit.28 However, techniques designed to increase ABA signalling by exposing
    crops to periods of drought stress are more difficult to implement with field
    vegetable crops such as lettuce29 that rely on an increase in leaf biomass for
    yield increases. However, drying soil can stimulate deeper rooting30 and there
    may be benefits in reduced irrigation at the early, less yield-sensitive, stages
    of crops that produce deeper-rooting plants, enabling access to water lower in
    the soil profile and conferring greater resilience to midsummer drought events.
    Another area of plant physiological response to managed water stress is that of
    improved post-harvest quality, for example, water deficit imposed close to head
    maturity improved broccoli head colour and stem turgor and subsequent post-harvest
    quality.31 Benefits are also reported in lettuce, where long-term mild deficit
    treatments produced lettuces less prone to post-harvest enzymatic browning.32
    In contrast, post-harvest quality decreased in stored onions where deficit treatments
    were imposed during bulbing.33 There are also biochemical changes that may improve
    human nutritive value which are associated with water stress, such as increased
    content of bioactive compounds in cabbage,34 broccoli35 and lettuce.36 Nevertheless,
    the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying post-harvest benefits
    are not well understood and further work is needed in this area to quantify these
    potential benefits. Summary And Way Forward Water is becoming an increasingly
    scarce resource and a limiting factor in intensive production of irrigated field
    vegetable crops, both in supplementary and continuous irrigation systems. There
    is pressure on growers from governments and the supply chain to maximize the commercial
    utilization of irrigation water by the crop. Precision irrigation may offer a
    solution but there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed before
    the benefits of this approach will be realized practically. Current research demonstrates
    that there is potential for significant improvements for irrigated field crops
    in both water use efficiency and crop quality. This may be achieved through managing
    water use by variable-rate application aligned with a greater understanding of
    heterogeneity of soil water distribution. A multidisciplinary research approach
    involving irrigation engineers, soil scientists, agronomists and plant physiologists
    will be needed to realize the potential of precision irrigation in field crops.

    growth places greater demands on dwindling water supplies. This is especially
    the case in arid and semi-arid areas like Australia, which is known as the driest
    inhabited continent on earth. Sustainable irrigation management necessitates better
    understanding of water requirements in order to decrease environmental risks and
    increase water use efficiency. Although the water requirements of agricultural
    crops are well established in field and laboratory studies, little research has
    been conducted to investigate the water requirements of urban green spaces. In
    addition, most previous research investigations have focused on the water requirements
    of turf grasses and not on other landscape plant species. Landscape plants can
    include various species of trees, shrubs and turf grasses with different planting
    densities and microclimates. Such complicated environments make measuring the
    water requirements of urban landscapes difficult. This paper reviews previous
    studies and techniques for measuring the water requirements of urban landscapes
    and describes how optimum irrigation management strategies for urban landscape
    vegetation can assist in better water conservation, improved landscape quality
    and reduced water costs. The authors conclude that WUCOLS is a practical approach
    that can provide an initial estimate of urban landscape water demand but ideally
    this should be further refined based on the health and aesthetic condition of
    the urban vegetation. The authors recommend calibration of the WUCOLS estimates
    with an in-situ method such as a soil water balance. Keywords: evapotranspirationurban
    vegetationremote sensingWUCOLSnormalized difference vegetation index 1. Introduction
    A plant''s water requirement is very complex to predict in practice. For agricultural
    crops, in order to achieve optimum yield, irrigation and rainfall should replace
    the total water lost through evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the
    sum of evaporation and plant transpiration. Evaporation is the movement of water
    to the air from sources such as soil, vegetation interception and water bodies.
    Plant transpiration is the movement of water within a plant and the subsequent
    loss of water as vapour through stomata in its leaves (Rothfuss et al. 2010).
    In many agricultural systems, there is a uniformity of plant density, height,
    vigour and water availability which provide a straightforward approach for evapotranspiration
    measurement, although estimating the water requirements of such environments is
    not without challenge. Various methods of ET measurement, their applications,
    device requirements, advantages, disadvantages and sources of errors have been
    discussed by Rana and Katerji ( 2000) and Allen et al. ( 2011). Rana and Katerji
    ( 2000) categorised three main methods for ET measurement: hydrological approaches,
    micrometeorological approaches and plant physiology approaches. Hydrological methods
    include soil water balances and lysimeter measurements. Micrometeorological techniques
    include eddy covariance and Bowen ratio energy balances. Plant physiological techniques
    usually consist of chamber systems and sap flow measurements. It should be noted
    that all of the above mentioned techniques have been mainly applied in agricultural
    fields or forests with little emphasis on or data collection from urban landscapes.
    In the case of non-agricultural systems and particularly urban landscape vegetation
    systems, the heterogeneous nature of vegetation is the rule rather than the exception.
    A wide variation in vegetation type including trees, shrubs and turfs with different
    densities and leaf area has significant effect on evapotranspiration and water
    loss. This introduces more complexity and uncertainty because of different vegetation
    heights, microclimates, spatial and temporal variability of soil and water characteristics
    and water accessibility. It should be noted that in landscape irrigation, the
    aim is to achieve sustainable health, appearance and growth of plants. In some
    species, irrigation also improves plant defence systems, density, colour of canopy
    and flowers and fruit production. If the landscape is not producing a harvestable
    crop, irrigation volume or frequency can be adjusted to lower levels than those
    otherwise needed for agricultural production (Costello et al. 2000). Also when
    water conservation is an objective, lower level irrigation may also be desirable.
    This review briefly describes the most common methods of evapotranspiration measurement
    and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each method for estimating plant
    water requirements. The review shows that many of the methods have been developed
    for agricultural crops with a focus on adaption of methods for urban ET assessment.
    With the growing interest in and need for urban green space development, there
    is a need to estimate more accurately ET from urban vegetation to better understand
    water balances in urban systems. In particular, ET estimations for green infrastructure
    (GI) including green roofs, rain gardens and bioretention systems are rare. The
    feasibility and appropriateness of the available methods for urban vegetation
    conditions are therefore discussed and practical methods are recommended. 2 Water
    consumption challenges for urban green spaces The assumption of fully replacing
    water lost to ET has underpinned traditional agricultural irrigation management
    philosophies and practices. A key problem therefore arises for urban vegetation
    because there is essentially no irrigation reference point. At one end of the
    spectrum communities may decide that urban vegetation should only be rain-fed
    and not irrigated and that during dry periods the plants may be allowed to wilt
    or even die. At the other end of the spectrum, it may be desirable to irrigate
    for zero plant stress in much the same way as for agricultural crops. Between
    these two extremes, there is a wide range of possibilities that will be influenced
    by the role of the urban vegetation and its location. For example, obvious signs
    of plant stress may be more tolerable further away from the home or from culturally
    important locations. In the future, sustainable irrigation management in urban
    areas may have to focus on moisture stress management. An insight into this future
    has been experienced across Australia in recent years through mandated water restrictions
    in response to the longest and severest drought on record (Fam et al. 2008). Urban
    green spaces consist of public parks, private gardens, sporting ovals, golf courses,
    residential gardens, street trees, green roofs and other vegetated open areas
    (Barnett et al. 2005). The environmental, social and economic benefits of urban
    green spaces have been widely discussed (van Kamp et al. 2003, Jim and Chen 2006,
    Barbosa et al. 2007, Fam et al. 2008, Millward and Sabir 2011). Urban green spaces
    enhance the environment by modifying air temperature, air quality, building energy
    consumption, micro-climate, biodiversity and soil stabilisation. The social benefits
    of urban green spaces include enhancement of mental and physical health, childhood
    development, social equality, social cohesion and general reduction of crime,
    including juvenile delinquency (Fam et al. 2008). Increasing population density
    and climate-dependent water sources have recently led to water restrictions in
    several countries. This, together with rapid urbanisation increases the necessity
    for water savings in urban green spaces. An efficient water conservation program
    certainly needs a better understanding of urban landscape irrigation requirements.
    In the USA, garden watering is the largest single water consumption accounting
    for between 40% and 70% of total household use (Hilaire et al. 2008) with the
    higher requirement generally being in summertime. The Water Corporation of Perth,
    Australia has surveyed residential water use in 2008–2009 (Murphy 2009). Garden
    irrigation, measured by irrigation controllers, has the highest rank of consumption,
    accounting for 39% of total urban water use. Accordingly, the efficient and precise
    irrigation of urban landscape plants needs to focus on water conservation. Australia
    is highly urbanised, with almost 90% of the population living in cities and towns.
    It consequently has relatively large areas of urban vegetation. However there
    is surprisingly little information on the irrigation requirements of urban green
    spaces and a practical method of measuring the water demand of urban green spaces
    is still lacking. Deficit irrigation is an agricultural water management system
    in which less than 100% of the potential ET can be provided by a combination of
    stored soil water, rainfall and irrigation during the growing season. The successful
    practice of deficit irrigation in agriculture inspired Sachs et al. ( 1975) to
    employ it for urban vegetation as well. They found that the aesthetic quality
    of urban vegetation was not affected by reduced irrigation level although canopy
    size was affected. With water shortages experienced by many countries in recent
    years, the sustainability of urban vegetation has become a priority for urban
    green space management. Optimum irrigation efficiency for urban landscape vegetation
    can be achieved through water stress management of the plants, which considers
    in an integrated way the variability in the soils, microclimates, rooting systems,
    hydraulic conditions, diversity in the plant species and their different water
    requirements. Increasing the efficiency of urban irrigation could also be achieved
    using deficit irrigation, installing “smart” controllers, alternative water resources
    (e.g. recycled waste water or storm water), subsurface irrigation, or efficient
    pressurised systems. But in order to employ any of these approaches, the first
    step is to estimate the water requirements of the plants. From this, combinations
    of the above water conservation techniques can be employed to manage water stress
    and evaluate the sustainability and health of the vegetation (Beeson 2006, Scheiber
    and Beeson 2007). In order to select the appropriate techniques for measuring
    urban landscape water requirements, available methods from agriculture and forestry
    are briefly reviewed. Their advantages and disadvantages for implementation in
    urban conditions are discussed and the practical techniques of ET evaluation in
    urban green space are recommended. 3 Techniques for measuring plant water requirements
    in urban landscapes Measurement of plant water requirements based on plant evapotranspiration
    (ET) principles is categorised here into field measurements, hydrological models
    and remote sensing-based techniques. A variety of methods including soil water
    balances, lysimeter measurements, sap flow measurements, eddy covariance, Bowen
    ratio energy balance method, remotely-sensed energy balances, satellite-based
    ET using Vegetation Indices (VI), chamber systems and scintillometer systems are
    all employed to assess plant evapotranspiration. The advantages and disadvantages
    of the most common methods relating to urban landscape water requirements are
    discussed. The methods have been ordered based on the history and origin of their
    application from the oldest to the most recent ones. 3.1 Soil Water balance Natural
    water circulation, which is quantified by a water balance equation, is the fundamental
    principle for water management (Thornthwaite 1948). A temporal change in soil
    moisture is an indirect approach to determine evapotranspiration as the residual
    term of the soil water balance equation. Measuring changes in soil moisture content
    over periods of time was the main source of evapotranspiration measurement before
    the 1950s (Jensen 2010) but there are few reliable peer-reviewed articles describing
    this early work. Soil sampling and gravimetric analyses are primary techniques
    which have been improved gradually by application of electromagnetic devices or
    modern soil water sensors (Charlesworth 2000). Plant water requirement is supplied
    through soil water storage (ΔS) which is the residual of precipitation (P), irrigation
    (I), upward contribution from the water table or capillary rise (W), surface runoff
    (R) and drainage (D), as shown in Equation 1 (Rana and Katerji 2000, Testi et
    al. 2004, Kizito et al. 2007, Zhang et al. 2008, Scott 2010, Allen et al. 2011).
    This method involves some sources of inaccuracy such as lack of irrigation uniformity,
    spatial variability of soil properties and soil moisture conditions, neglect of
    deep percolation or capillary rise, inaccuracy in sensor calibration and challenges
    in the selection of appropriate sample points. In particular a systematic selection
    of representative sample positions is required. To increase the reliability of
    this technique, care is required for installing monitoring system, and for example,
    the lysimeter for drainage measurement, establishing a local weather station for
    accurate meteorological data collection (particularly for precipitation, solar
    energy and wind function) and ensuring soil moisture measurements are undertaken
    in the active root zones of plant communities. 3.2 Lysimeter A lysimeter is a
    container with a soil volume and a given depth that is either filled with undisturbed
    or disturbed soil (Bhantana and Lazarovitch 2010). It is fully visible, easy for
    inspection and can be automated. The first practical lysimeter was developed in
    1688 in France by De la Hire (Kohnke et al. 1940). Nevertheless it is exceedingly
    sensitive to environmental factors and particularly to different vegetation heights
    inside and outside of the effective drainage area of the lysimeter (López-Urrea
    et al. 2006, Vaughan et al. 2007, Allen et al. 2011), which is characteristically
    high in urban landscapes. An important drawback of lysimeters is that they are
    generally unsuitable for mixed vegetation conditions (García-Navarro et al. 2004).
    The characteristics of local fetch (the distance surrounding a measurement site
    for which response is relatively uniform) are another disadvantage of lysimeters
    (Ben-Gal and Shani 2002, Bhantana and Lazarovitch 2010). Also, the effect of a
    lysimeter on plant root development is quite important. A shallower soil profile
    inside a lysimeter (if the lysimeter is not deep enough) compared to the surrounding
    area results in different volumes of available water inside and outside and subsequently
    different impacts on root development (Allen et al. 2011). Moreover, lysimeters
    are not practical for trees and plants at large spacing due to the difficulty
    in representative sampling. In addition, lysimeters are a point-based measurement
    system and should not be extrapolated. Extrapolating a small sample to be representative
    for the whole area further reduces the accuracy especially for heterogeneous vegetation.
    Moreover, it is complicated to allow for a significant edge-flow effect (Allen
    et al. 2011, Castellví and Snyder 2010). Cameron et al. ( 1990) stated that the
    edge-flow of water in a lysimeter can lead to a significant error in the calculation
    of hydraulic conductivity and leaching rates. However, if the lysimeter is large
    enough, the edge-effect could be negligible. Due to the presence of heterogeneous
    plant communities, geometries, maintenance requirements and other factors, this
    technique is not very practical. 3.3 Sap flow Almost 60 years ago Huber proposed
    using heat as a tracer. In 1937, Huber and Schmidt developed a version of the
    compensation heat-pulse method (Green 1998). The sap flow method is based on a
    source of low grade heat to the plant''s trunk or branch. It determines the water
    flow in the xylem as a result of heat pulse movement or heat energy convection
    in stems (Williams et al. 2004, Allen et al. 2011). This in situ method is inexpensive,
    is easily automated to monitor water stress and is a precise technique to study
    plant eco-physiology and water scheduling. The most important weakness of sap
    flow measurement as applied to landscape vegetation is that it is a point-based
    measurement of evapotranspiration and is rarely representative of mixed vegetation
    conditions. Moreover, the space between probes, the geometry of stems, the variation
    of heat ratio and uncertainty in measuring soil and understory evaporation are
    other sources of errors in sap flow measurements. Although it is a suitable approach
    to determine plant coefficients for individual plants it is generally unsuitable
    for mixed plantings (Rana and Katerji 2000, Wilson et al. 2001, Sellami and Sifaoui
    2003, Kumagai et al. 2005, González-Altozano et al. 2008, Madurapperuma et al.
    2009, Cameron and Mills 2010, Kume et al. 2010, Allen et al. 2011). 3.4 Eddy covariance
    Eddy covariance is a micrometeorological technique to measure high speed fluxes
    of water, heat, gas and momentum in the atmospheric boundary layer. Emission and
    exchange of fluxes is characterised from a fixed in-situ measurement point like
    a tower, or a movable point like an airplane. Field et al. ( 1982) employed traditional
    tools to assess net carbon exchange and this was developed further by Denmead
    et al. ( 1993) for chamber and forest. It is a suitable direct method to study
    mixed vegetation due to the opportunity that a tower (or airplane) provides to
    measure the exchanged fluxes of water, gas, heat and etc between the surface of
    the Earth and the atmosphere in a large area up to 100 hectares. Also it appears
    feasible to predict ET by eddy covariance because it is integrative and does not
    require a species-specific equation so ET can be estimated across the species.
    One disadvantage is that technicians generally need to be well-trained in electronics,
    turbulence theory and biophysics to operate the instruments and to produce quality
    data. Also, a monitoring tower with adequate elevation above the canopy and a
    known uniform fetch are needed. This makes eddy covariance systems expensive,
    particularly since covariance requires accurate measurement of vapour pressure,
    and air temperature or wind speed at different levels above the surface. Also
    they often require corrections including closure errors in the energy balance
    equation (Kosugi et al. 2007, Scott 2010). The high heterogeneity and temporal
    variability of vegetation canopy characteristics in urban areas results in variability
    of emission sources. Anthropogenic heat release (e.g. from buildings and cars)
    is a distinct urban addition to the surface energy balance, which enhances the
    available energy for turbulent fluxes particularly in the transport of heat and
    moisture in urban vegetation. Including consideration of anthropogenic emissions
    when estimating ET of urban landscapes is very challenging (Kotthaussue and Grimmond
    2012). Due to a number of assumptions, instrument problems and physical phenomena,
    measurements are affected by frequency response, sensor time delays, noise, band
    broadening and density fluctuations are other drawbacks of the eddy covariance
    technique (Allen et al. 2011, Burba and Anderson 2007). Instrument calibration
    (Billesbach 2011) and temporal variability in energy fluxes for a planted area
    (Nagler et al. 2005) can be other sources or error. 3.5 Bowen ratio energy balance
    The Bowen ratio energy balance is an automated indirect method of ET determination.
    The concept of the Bowen ratio was developed by Bowen several decades ago but
    practical application of this technique was only common by the 1990s (Malek et
    al. 1990, Fritschen 1993). The method measures the latent heat flux energy budget
    of a surface covered with an actively growing crop. The method is based on Equation
    (2): where λE represents ET in terms of the available energy due to the radiation
    balance, Rn is net radiation, G is soil heat flux and H is sensible heat flux.
    However, it is a simple and inexpensive approach that requires uniform fetch for
    accurate measurement of net radiation and soil heat flux. It also requires an
    adequate elevation above the canopy to collect the required meteorological data
    (Perez et al. 2008, Villa Nova et al. 2007, Yunusa et al. 2004). Sensitivity of
    the instrument bias for gradient and energy balance measurements is another source
    of uncertainty (Todd et al. 2000). The accuracy of ET determination depends considerably
    on the accurate measurement of net radiation and soil heat flux (Allen et al.
    2011, Angus and Watts 1984, Perez et al. 1999). The Bowen ratio energy balance
    method has served as one of the most important methods for forest studies because
    of the ability to measure ET even from non-watered plantation surfaces. Also there
    are fewer problems with energy balance closure, fetch and some other mechanical
    and technical issues compared with more advanced diagnostic procedures and technologies
    (Silberstein et al. 2001, Tanaka et al. 2008). In the urban context, differences
    in vegetation height lead to inaccuracy in gradient measurements above the canopy.
    Another source of error for this method in urban environments is uncertainty in
    measuring net radiation and soil heat flux in heterogeneous conditions. 3.6 Water
    Use Classification of Landscape Plants (WUCOLS) Measuring the total amount of
    water lost through evapotranspiration provides an estimation of the amount of
    water that should be partially or fully replaced by irrigation. Given the formula
    ET crop = Kcrop × ET0, the evapotranspiration rate for any crop can be readily
    calculated from the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient (Kcrop),
    which is a coefficient corresponding to the effect of crop characteristics on
    water demand of the crop. These two parameters are readily available from in-situ
    measurements or modelling for most agricultural crops. For agricultural crops
    these values are well established from field and laboratory studies. In contrast,
    it is very difficult to determine evapotranspiration values for mixed landscape
    vegetation. Unlike agricultural crops, landscape plants can include various species
    of trees, shrubs and turf grasses with different planting densities and microclimates.
    Establishing a crop coefficient for landscape vegetation in such complicated and
    heterogeneous environments is very challenging. This makes estimation of water
    demands equally difficult. Because of this difficulty, Costello and Jones ( 1994)
    developed the WUCOLS (Water Use Classification of Landscape Plants) method for
    estimating the water requirements of landscape plants. This method assigns numerical
    values to three major factors influencing evapotranspiration from mixed vegetation
    in urban landscapes, namely crop factors, environmental aspects and management
    practices. The resulting calculation produces an estimate of the landscape vegetation
    coefficient, KL. WUCOLS was described in detail by Costello et al. ( 2000). This
    method has been applied in several research studies (Bitar 2004, Pittenger and
    Henry 2006, Mitchell et al. 2009, Spano et al. 2009, Pittenger and Shaw 2010,
    Salvador et al. 2011). According to WUCOLS principles, landscape evapotranspiration
    (ETL) is a function of a landscape coefficient (KL) and reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0), as shown in Equation (3): Unlike crop fields or turf grasses, landscape
    plants are generally a combination of different species of trees, shrubs and turfs
    that are inter-spread with each other. This mixed vegetation with has different
    water requirements but is most often irrigated uniformly or site-specifically.
    To produce a reliable estimation of plant evapotranspiration, a dimensionless
    coefficient for landscape plants as shown in Equation (4) is required to account
    for such variations in species (Ks), density (Kd) and microclimate (Kmc). Certain
    species require significantly more watering than others to maintain their health
    and aesthetic appeal. The species factor explains the differences in water demands
    of various species. Costello and Jones ( 1999) categorised the most common landscaped
    plants in terms of water requirement into four groups, namely high, moderate,
    low and very low water demand and then assigned a numeric value from less than
    0.1 to 0.9 to each of them. The species factor is based only on water use studies
    for landscape species regardless of vegetation type (e.g. tree, shrub, herbaceous
    and mixed plantings). The density factor refers to vegetation density that can
    be measured from the collective leaf area and its specific water losses. Differences
    in vegetation density or canopy cover have a significant effect on the evapotranspiration
    rate and water loss. To account for the differences in canopy cover, three categories
    of low, average and high density were introduced and assigned numeric values of
    0.5 to 1.3 (Costello and Jones 1999). Immature plants with less leaf area and
    canopy cover lose less water in the process of evapotranspiration and are categorised
    as low density while a mixed vegetation of trees, shrubs and turf have more leaf
    area and canopy cover and lose more water so this is assigned a high category
    value. Landscape microclimate is an important factor that may cause different
    environmental conditions. Buildings and paving are typical urban landscapes that
    strongly affect the temperature, wind speed and direction, and humidity. These
    different environmental factors in a specific area with the particular climate
    conditions combine to create a specific microclimate (Bitar 2004). The effect
    of microclimate in plant water loss is estimated through factors that affect the
    energy balance. Kmc is usually attributed a value in the range 0.5 to 1.4. Although
    this approach mostly fulfils the requirements of measuring urban landscape water
    requirements, it is quite subjective particularly in specification of the density
    factor. In order to diminish the subjectivity of density factor determination,
    it is essential to use a reliable technique for considering the size, shape and
    orientation of a vegetation canopy. As a main variable of evapotranspiration estimation,
    due to its key role in energy exchange between the atmosphere and the vegetation,
    several research studies have examined both direct and indirect approaches for
    measuring leaf area index (LAI) (MacFarlane et al. 2000, Kato et al. 2004, MacFarlane
    et al. 2007a, MacFarlane et al. 2007c). Direct methods include destructive sampling,
    the model tree method and litter traps. These three techniques of leaf collection
    combined with planimetric or gravimetric techniques, are more accurate and involve
    stripping and measuring the foliage of plant canopy samples, which on the other
    hand is destructive (especially to smaller plantings) and time consuming. Indirect
    methods include inclined point quadrat, allometric techniques, Multiband Vegetation
    Imagery (MVI), digital photography (hemispherical/fisheye or cover photos), LAI
    2000 canopy analyser, ceptometer, DEMON and Tracing Radiation and Architecture
    of Canopies (TRAC). In contrast, indirect methods are quicker, can be more easily
    automated, and are generally applicable for large areas (MacFarlane et al. 2000,
    Jonckheere et al. 2004). To select appropriate techniques which suit urban landscape
    conditions, several research papers were reviewed. Most recent researchers recommend
    cover digital photography as an uncomplicated, inexpensive, fast, handy and accurate
    technique for measuring crown porosity, crown cover, foliage cover, foliage clumping
    index and leaf area index (López-Serrano et al. 2000, Peper and McPherson 2003,
    Weiss et al. 2004, MacFarlane et al. 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, Fuentes et al. 2008,
    López-Lozano et al. 2009, Osmond 2009, Pekin and MacFarlane 2009, Behera et al.
    2010, Heiskanen et al. 2011, Sprintsin et al. 2011). Digital photography combines
    photography, modelling and image processing techniques to improve canopy modelling
    and vegetation architecture measurement and accordingly vegetation density estimations.
    Fuentes et al. ( 2008) introduced an automated procedure using script written
    in MATLAB (LAIM) to analyse the images. 3.7 Remote sensing It is important to
    estimate vegetation factors accurately since foliage density accounts for almost
    80% of ET (Dalmago et al. 2004). Moreover, the spatial variation of foliage coefficient
    in different sampling positions results from the available species, their maturity
    levels and canopy covers and also the availability of urban landscape features
    such as buildings or paving. These all make the task of measuring vegetation factors
    from the ground surface difficult. Temporal variation of different conditions
    of landscape vegetation also occurs in different seasons e.g. dormancy in winter
    or decreasing chlorophyll pigment production in autumn present some challenges
    in measuring the landscape vegetation factor. However, a satellite image can handle
    this issue by providing the ability to look at the vegetation from above the ground.
    Methods using satellite imagery and energy balance concepts to estimate ET were
    developed around 1990 (Allen et al. 2011). Simpler relationships between ET and
    vegetation indices (VIs) were used from 2005 by Tasumi et al. ( 2005). They asserted
    that the recent development of remote sensing energy balance-based ET models facilitated
    estimation of evapotranspiration and crop coefficient for large areas. They declared
    a strong relationship between crop coefficient factor and Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the mid-season. Remote Sensing (RS) can be used to
    estimate the geographical distribution of evapo-transpiration and water demand
    in large and mixed vegetation areas. The spatio-temporal distribution of surface
    heat flux, evaporation fraction, vegetation index (VI) and diurnal changes in
    land surface temperature are some of the parameters that can be estimated using
    remote sensing techniques (Wang et al. 2007). RS techniques estimate ET through
    satellite imagery of mixed vegetation over large areas. RS can be more economical
    compared with point source measurements with higher spatial resolutions and applicability
    in variable environments (Allen et al. 2011). Tsouni et al. ( 2008) reviewed three
    different RS approaches for ET measurement, namely empirical direct methods, residual
    methods and indirect methods. The stress degree day approach is an empirical direct
    method based on applying RS data into semi-empirical models to characterise vegetation
    water demand from ground measurements for micro-scale areas, while satellite measurements
    are used for macro-scale areas. Residual methods combine empirical models and
    physical components such as METRIC, SEBAL, Sebi, etc. These estimate input parameters
    and evapotranspiration (Courault et al. 2005, Tsouni et al. 2008). Indirect methods
    generally rely on complex modelling of energy budgets. Contreras et al. ( 2011)
    provided another category to estimate evapotranspiration from RS images using
    a physically-based algorithm, surface temperature/vegetation indices and a numerical
    process model of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere relationshipThe surface temperature/vegetation
    index method, which is known as the triangle-trapezoidal method, focuses on the
    spatial distribution of evapotranspiration coefficients. The numerical process
    model of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere relationship (SVAT) involves weather and
    radiation parameters. Allen et al. ( 2011) divided RS approaches for estimating
    ET into two main groups of energy balances and satellite-based ET estimation using
    vegetation indices. The former evaluates energy balances via sensible heat flux
    through different models such as METRIC and SEBAL, mostly coupled with ground
    measurements for calibration. The latter technique simply employs vegetation indices
    to estimate crop coefficients due to the close relationship of vegetation (NDVI,
    VI or LAI) and transpiration. They claimed that the basal coefficient (evaporation
    from soil surface) has a more consistent relationship with NDVI. Allen et al.
    ( 2011) asserted that RS-based or in-situ measurement of energy balance techniques
    is time consuming and requires extensive skills. Torut et al. (2008) used a multi-spectral
    camera to measure canopy cover directly from crops in horticultural sites and
    then compared the results with remotely-sensed NDVI. They asserted that there
    was a high correlation and linear relationship between crop canopy and NDVI and
    they recommended application of remotely-sensed NDVI to predict vegetation water
    demand. Later, O''Connell et al. ( 2010) determined the irrigation demand of citrus,
    grape and almond irrigation sites in Australia by evapotranspiration measurement
    using the SEBAL model. Then the relationship of ET and NDVI was investigated and
    the results showed a strong relationship in all three crops. Trout et al. ( 2010)
    compared two RS techniques of energy balance (SEBAL) and an indirect method using
    vegetation indices in order to predict ET. They recommended that vegetation cover
    can be estimated from satellite-based NDVI for a large variety of crops (Trout
    et al. 2010, Trout 2011). For those areas where in-situ measurements are difficult,
    Sobrino et al. ( 2007) suggested a methodology to estimate evapotranspiration
    from low spatial resolution RS data using an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
    (AVHRR). This method involves retrieving ET from low spatial resolution remote
    sensing data and is based on the evaporative fraction concept (Zhou et al. 2006).
    Disadvantages of RS-based methods include the time lapse between satellite captures,
    the high expense to get high resolution images, the uncertainty in estimating
    aerodynamic components and some errors in narrow vegetation areas such as riparian
    corridors (Rana and Katerji 2000, Chen et al. 2005, Courault et al. 2005, McCabe
    and Wood 2006, Min and Lin 2006, Stisen et al. 2008, Boegh et al. 2009, Jiang
    et al. 2009, Mutiga et al. 2010, Wu et al. 2010, Allen et al. 2011). Combining
    satellite image ET estimation methods and ground ET measurement techniques have
    generally enhanced the accuracy of ET measurements (Kustas and Norman 1994, Courault
    et al. 2003, Tsouni et al. 2008). 4 Water requirements of urban systems Sustainable
    urban development necessitates employing an integrated and systematic approach
    to water management for urban vegetation. The social, economic and environmental
    benefits of urban green spaces are undeniable. However, the management of urban
    landscapes should also involve conservation of natural resources, and particularly
    greater efficiency in the use of water. Quantitative estimation of the water requirements
    of landscape plants is very limited but is improving rapidly (Testi et al. 2004,
    AZMET 2005, Pittenger and Henry 2006, Pittenger and Shaw 2007, Dukes 2009, Al-Kofahi
    et al. 2010, Pittenger and Shaw 2010, Schuch et al. 2010, Sun and Kopp 2010).
    However, in urban landscape studies, most attention has focused on turf grasses
    rather than other landscape species (Davis and Dukes 2010, Kilgren et al. 2010,
    AQiser et al. 2011). Available research studies of water requirements of non-turf
    landscape plants are limited to applying the WUCOLS method, focusing on a mixture
    of plant species in California (Costello et al. 2000). Such studies have mainly
    focused on a limited number of species (typically 5–6 species) and were mostly
    conducted in greenhouses, containers or lysimeters. They often considered factors
    such as soil moisture status, plant appearance, gardeners’ judgement and modelling
    but have often not examined other parameters like vegetation canopy cover and
    meteorological effects. These latter parameters will now be considered in more
    detail. Mitchell et al. ( 2001) modelled the urban water cycle using the Aquacycle
    software, substituting stormwater and wastewater for irrigation water resources
    in urban areas including private gardens and public open spaces. In order to quantify
    urban vegetation water requirements, they relied on plant appearance and water
    costs. The decision to irrigate was based on modelled minimum soil wetness. The
    model values that were used to trigger irrigation were 0 for an empty pervious
    store, and 1 for a full pervious store. White et al. ( 2004) stated that using
    potential evapotranspiration modified by landscape coefficient and landscape size
    results in a realistic water budget and this consequently provides a good opportunity
    for water conservation. In another approach for estimation of urban landscape
    water demand, Haley et al. ( 2007) employed an automatic in-ground irrigation
    system. They found that using irrigation controllers, either on a timer-based
    irrigation schedule or triggered by soil moisture sensors, resulted in significant
    water savings. Rosenberg et al. ( 2011) presented a model for estimating the water
    usage of residential and commercial landscapes to encourage property owners to
    save water. The water requirements of non-turf plants were estimated by multiplying
    the average crown diameter of a single plant (or uniform plantation) by evapotranspiration
    (20–80% of ET0). Lowry Jr. et al. (2011) estimated outdoor residential urban water
    requirements using meteorological data to measure the reference evapotranspiration
    and using a plant coefficient of 0.6. Salvador et al. ( 2011) studied the irrigation
    performance of household landscapes involving a mixture of trees, shrubs and turf
    grasses. They employed the WUCOLS method involving species, density and microclimate
    factors multiplied by reference evapotranspiration. They recommended applying
    night sprinkler irrigation and designing different irrigation schedules for different
    landscape areas to be able to save water. 5 Results A number of techniques and
    methods for measuring ET and the water requirements of urban landscape plants
    have been reviewed. These are summarised in Table 1. Some of these are more accurate,
    cost effective or particularly appropriate for certain scales of space and time.
    Mixed plantings of trees, shrubs and turfs, because of their different microclimates,
    species, densities, maturity and size, often have greatly different water requirements.
    Based on effectiveness, accuracy, cost and time limitations and safety, the recommended
    methods are remote sensing and the WUCOLS method with some modification to decrease
    subjectivity. These two approaches provide area-based estimations of ET considering
    mixed vegetation types with different species and densities. Using a local weather
    station will increase the accuracy of the meteorological data and this will improve
    the estimation of water demand. For remote sensing, a simple, quick and easy method
    of soil water balance can be used to validate the satellite image data. Table

    CSVDisplay Table 6 Conclusion Landscape vegetation is an important aspect of the
    urban environment that has many environmental, social and economic benefits (Barbosa
    et al. 2007). In environmental terms, urban landscape vegetation provides biodiversity
    enhancement, as well as habitat and food sources for a broad range of urban fauna.
    Urban vegetation also prevents soil erosion and improves drainage (Barnett et
    al. 2005). It is an air purifier and an air temperature adjuster that can reduce
    the urban heat island effect and can also reduce noise pollution (Millward and
    Sabir 2011). In terms of social advantages, urban landscape vegetation provides
    enhanced recreational amenities. It fosters a connection between residents and
    the natural environment that surrounds them and contributes significantly to sustainable
    and liveable cities. Economic benefits can include increased property prices and,
    in properly designed systems, reduced urban flash flooding (Bitar 2004, Jim and
    Chen 2006, Fam et al. 2008). To achieve these benefits, it is important that more
    attention is focused on sustainable water management of urban landscape vegetation.
    This is particularly the case in situations of water scarcity, where irrigation
    requirements for urban vegetation compete with other water demands. Reviewing
    the available literature on non-agricultural water requirements has revealed a
    limited understanding of irrigation requirements for urban green spaces. This
    could present a significant limitation to the emerging interest in green infrastructure,
    including green walls, green roofs, rainwater gardens and bioretention systems.
    This is beginning to be realised and recent designs of bioretention systems have
    incorporated underlying storage to provide plant roots with access to water between
    irrigation and rainfall events. The authors conclude that WUCOLS is a practical
    approach that can provide an initial estimate of urban landscape water demand
    but ideally this should be further refined based on the health and aesthetic condition
    of the urban vegetation. The authors recommend calibration of the WUCOLS estimates
    with an in-situ method such as a soil water balance. Acknowledgement The authors

    Get rights and content Highlights • A soil moisture/EC sensor-based system automatically
    controlled irrigation of soilless basil. • Drought stress occurred at −30 kPa
    matric potential and 0.0005 cm day−1 hydraulic conductivity. • Photosynthesis
    and leaf water status fully recovered after rewatering. • 0.40, 0.30 and 0.20 m3 m−3
    irrigation set-points resulted in similar basil growth. • Real-time sensing of
    soilless substrates is an effective tool for precision irrigation. Abstract Dielectric
    moisture sensors are particularly suitable for irrigation management in greenhouse
    soilless production. Identifying the practical effects of substrate water content
    set-points on crop performance is crucial for successful sensor-based irrigation.
    We designed and constructed a prototype cloud-connected system for wireless, sensor-based
    irrigation management, and tested it on basil, grown in a perlite-coco (1:1 v:v)
    soilless substrate under greenhouse conditions. Dielectric moisture/salinity sensors
    (GS3, Decagon Devices, Pullman – WA, USA) were used. The study, with two subsequent
    experiments, assessed i) the effects of a progressive decline in substrate water
    availability, corresponding to moisture levels from water holding capacity to
    ≈0.10 m3 m−3, on the gas exchange parameters and leaf water status of basil plants;
    ii) the short-term recovery response of plants when re-watered after substrate
    water content has decreased to different levels; iii) the effects of different
    irrigation set-points (0.40, 0.30 and 0.20 m3 m−3) and leaching rates (≈8% or
    ≈18%) on the basil crop performance over a complete growing cycle. No physiological
    stress responses were observed on basil plants when moisture level was higher
    than approximately 0.20 m3 m−3, while plants showed drought symptoms at approximately
    0.17 m3 m−3, corresponding to a substrate matric potential and hydraulic conductivity
    of −300 hPa and 0.0005 cm day−1, respectively. Photosynthesis and leaf water potential
    recovered to values similar to non- stress conditions following a short drought
    (with moisture level as low as ≈0.10 m3 m−3). Basil growth was similar when plants
    were grown with irrigation set-points of 0.40, 0.30 or 0.20 m3 m−3 for the complete
    growing cycle. Fresh weight tended to increase when a higher leaching rate was
    used, probably because leaching lowered substrate EC. Water use efficiency (basil
    fresh weight/unit water used) was similar at different irrigation set-points and
    leaching rates. Our results indicate that the use of a wireless sensor network
    for real-time sensing of substrate water status, combined with precise information
    on the effects of water availability levels on plants, is an effective tool for
    precision irrigation management of greenhouse soilless basil. Previous article

    in horticulture, because of its implications on the economic and technical aspects
    of this agricultural sector (Fereres et al., 2003). Irrigation management affects
    crop performance. In the case of vegetable production, optimal irrigation may
    lead to qualitative and quantitative improvements (Dukes et al., 2010), while
    both under- and over-irrigation may compromise the success of the crop (Pardossi
    et al., 2009). Beside the direct effects on crop performance, irrigation practices
    also impact the environment and society. In both developed and developing countries,
    decreased water availability for irrigation is expected in the near future, due
    to urbanization and industrialization (Playán and Mateos, 2006; Levidow et al.,
    2014). Irrigated agriculture is the greatest water user and a potential source
    of pollution in many countries, due to the release of agrochemicals into the environment
    through the leaching and runoff associated with excessive irrigation. It is therefore
    necessary to adopt agricultural practices, such as efficient irrigation management,
    which minimize pollution to meet societal goals, satisfy government regulations,
    and promote sustainable use of resources in agriculture (Blackstock et al., 2010).
    Greenhouse production of vegetables has increased in importance in recent decades,
    especially in areas with suitable climatic conditions, such as the Mediterranean
    region (Baudoin et al., 2013). Greenhouse vegetable production may decrease the
    environmental impact compared to open-field cultivation (Stanghellini, 2014).
    However, to achieve this goal, rational and efficient practices need to be adopted.
    In this framework, making tools available for efficient irrigation management
    is a key factor (Montesano et al., 2015). One of the most disruptive innovations
    ever introduced in the greenhouse sector is soilless cultivation. It includes
    any method of growing plants without the use of soil as rooting medium, in which
    the nutrients are supplied via the irrigation water, referred to as nutrient solution
    (NS) (Savvas et al., 2013). A significant amount of greenhouse vegetables, particularly
    in Europe, U.S. and Canada, are produced using soilless substrates. The main advantages
    of this system are a better control of fertilization and irrigation and prevention
    of soil-borne diseases, generally resulting in increased yield, high quality and
    more efficient use of resources, especially water and fertilizers (Raviv and Leith,
    2007; Valenzano et al., 2008). Beside vegetables for which soilless cultivation
    is already well established (such as tomato), producers are exploring soilless
    greenhouse herb (i.e., basil) production systems as a means to grow high quality
    crops in an efficient manner (Treadwell et al., 2011). Irrigation in soilless
    cultivation is a highly repetitive task, and can be automated to reduce labor
    costs. However, automatic irrigation does not necessarily mean efficient irrigation.
    For instance, automation based on timers, in which NS is automatically supplied
    based on fixed schedules, may not be efficient, because irrigation is not based
    on crop water requirements. A promising approach for improved irrigation management
    and automation in greenhouse consists of making objective decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling based on real-time measurements of the growing substrate
    water status through sensors (van Iersel et al., 2013). Soil moisture sensors
    are a dynamic and constantly developing area of technology for both technical
    and commercial reasons (Montesano et al., 2015), and interest in using sensors
    for practical irrigation management has grown in the last decade (Pardossi et
    al., 2009; Lichtenberg et al., 2013). A number of reliable and affordable sensors,
    principally based on Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR), to measure volumetric
    water content (VWC) and electrical conductivity (EC) in growing substrates have
    become available in the last decade. Readers are referred to van Iersel et al.
    (2013) for a more in-depth review on this topic. The use of those sensors proved
    to be particularly suitable for soilless conditions (Nemali et al., 2007). Irrigation
    based on those sensors may considerably reduce water consumption and increase
    the overall water use efficiency (WUE) compared to timer-based irrigation. Based
    on a recent analysis, it has been estimated that the average water use by US ornamental
    crop producers who adopt wireless sensor irrigation networks would decline by
    approximately 50% (Majsztrik et al., 2013). A significant amelioration of WUE
    was observed with sensor-based compared to timer-based irrigation in soilless
    lettuce, with WUE increasing from 25 to 70% depending on the irrigation set-point
    (Montesano et al., 2016a). The automation of irrigation based on root-zone moisture
    sensing relies on a simple principle: the moisture level in the growing substrate
    decreases because of evapotranspiration; sensors detect this change and automatically
    activate irrigation when the level reaches a predetermined set value, resulting
    in on-demand irrigation (van Iersel, 2015). This is in accordance with the assumption
    that an optimally-designed irrigation system will provide water (and fertilizers)
    to the plants just when the plants require it. This way, all provided water is
    used by the plants and none is wasted, with the possible exception of a certain
    leaching fraction used to prevent salt accumulation in the substrate, thus maximizing
    WUE (Lieth and Oki, 2008). By using substrate-specific water retention curves,
    it is possible to correlate the substrate VWC, sensed by FDR sensors, with matric
    potential, a parameter used to estimate whether water in the substrate is available
    to plants. This information can then be used to determine VWC set-points for precise
    irrigation (Montesano et al., 2016a). In soilless growing substrates, water is
    considered readily-available for plants at substrate matric potentials from −10
    to −100 hPa (pF of 1–2), while water is considered progressively less available
    at matric potential values lower than −100 hPa (pF > 2) (De Boodt and Verdonck,
    1972; Raviv and Blom, 2001). However, little work has been done to correlate the
    commonly defined concept of water availability with plant growth (Altland et al.,
    2010), and to identify the practical effects of irrigation set-points on crop
    performance, taking into account that the response could be highly dependent on
    species. Recently, a number of studies focused on the implementation of prototype
    systems for automatic irrigation of greenhouse crops based on soil moisture sensors,
    possibly integrated with other types of sensors. Goumopoulos et al. (2014) described
    an adaptable decision support system integrated with a wireless sensor/actuator
    network to implement autonomous zone-specific irrigation. An automated system
    for irrigation control, based on low-cost open source microcontrollers and soil
    moisture sensors, was proposed by Ferrarezi et al. (2015). Navarro-Hellín et al.
    (2015) tested a system based on an innovative wireless sensor architecture to
    help growers manage irrigation in different agricultural systems, including greenhouse
    soilless culture. Significant advances have been made in the development of wireless
    technology in the last few years, so new tools for irrigation control in commercial
    greenhouses, based on wireless sensor networks, are now available to growers (Kohanbash
    et al., 2013; Lea-Cox et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2016). Based on the above-mentioned
    considerations, we designed and constructed a new prototype cloud-connected system
    for wireless, sensor-based irrigation management. We aimed to use data from a
    wireless network of soil moisture sensors placed in a greenhouse for automatic
    control of irrigation. The system was used in two consecutive experiments with
    soilless basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), an important high-value greenhouse crop
    (Mininni et al., 2015). Basil was used because of the popularity of this herb,
    common in the Mediterranean diet to enhance the flavour of food, and because of
    its recognized antioxidant effects (Puccinelli et al., 2017). The objective of
    Experiment 1 was to study the effects of progressive substrate drying, and the
    consequent decline in VWC and water availability, on the gas exchange parameters
    and leaf water status of basil plants. The study also looked at the short-term
    recovery of plants when re-watered after VWC had decreased to different levels.
    The objective of Experiment 2 was to study the effects of different irrigation
    set-points and of different leaching rates, on the performance of greenhouse-grown
    soilless basil. We also tested the ability of the sensor-based irrigation system
    to fully automate irrigation over a complete growing cycle. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Irrigation system description The Greenhouse Irrigation Control Kit (GICK)
    used in this research is made up of hardware, firmware and software components
    able to acquire, store, plot and process data generated by soil moisture sensors,
    and consequently activate solenoid valves based on a reconfigurable set of conditions.
    In this section, a general description of the system is provided. For technical
    details, see the extended version of the system description, provided as supplemental
    material. The GICK is composed of a Main Networking and Control Unit (MNCU) and
    multiple Wireless SDI-12 (Serial Digital Interface at 1200 baud) Host Nodes (WSHNs)
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The GICK can accommodate 62 WSHNs, the maximum number of unique
    addresses allowed by the SDI-12 protocol. In this implementation, the number of
    WSHNs is 2, serving twelve SDI-12 sensors. The MNCU and the WSHNs are both based
    on low cost, general purpose hardware and open source software, and on some custom-made
    Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), scripts and firmware. By taking advantage of the
    cloud computing model and of modern web technologies, the prototype was designed
    with a strong focus on its ease of use, so that even untrained users can interact
    with the system through a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI). In this implementation,
    every operation that can be performed by the user is present in a graphical user
    interface, hosted in the cloud, and can be accessed by any web-browser (on desktop,
    smartphone and tablet devices). This means that a centralized set of software
    services processes user requests (such as a change in a configuration) and relays
    them to the MNCUs; the same way, a centralized set of software services handles
    the information acquired or produced by the MNCUs (such as a solenoid valve status)
    and shows them to the users. On the other hand, critical operations (such as actual
    irrigation decisions) are performed locally on the MNCU to avoid malfunctions
    due to a network failure. Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download

    Irrigation Control Kit (GICK). The Main Networking and Control Unit (MNCU) (A),
    and a wireless SDI-12 Host Node (WSHN) (B) are shown. The system can operate irrigation
    based on a manual, sensor- or timer-based approach. With specific reference to
    the sensor-based approach, the operator is required to interact with the system
    through the web-based dashboard interface, in order to: - select an irrigation
    zone to be configured; - select the specific sensors in the network and the related
    measured parameter, whose readings will be used to verify the conditions for the
    irrigation occurrence in the zone; - select the data (mean, maximum, minimum value)
    and the condition (<, >, =, ≠) options; - define the set-point value; - define
    the duration of the irrigation event; the duration can be divided into pulses
    by enabling the “pulsed irrigation” function and defining the duration of pulses
    and pauses; - enable, if considered appropriate, an emergency configuration: in
    case of network failures (typically due to faulty sensors) the system sends an
    e-mail alert and starts to supply irrigation according to a preset schedule until
    the sensor-based mode is activated again. 2.2. Greenhouse experiments Two experiments
    were carried out from April to July 2016 in a plastic (polymethacrylate) greenhouse
    at the experimental farm “La Noria” of the Institute of Sciences of Food Production
    − National Research Council (ISPA-CNR) in Mola di Bari (BA), southern Italy (41°
    03′ N, 17° 04′ E). 2.2.1. Experiment 1 Basil seedlings [cv Gigante italiano classico,
    Tesoro della Terra – Francesco Fuscello Selection, Andria (BT), Italy] were grown
    for 39 days after sowing in polystyrene plug trays (91 cells per tray) filled
    with peat, and then transplanted on April 29 2016, at the third true leaf stage,
    into 1 m long grow bags (33 L volume) containing a growing substrate based on
    a 1:1 (v:v) mixture of perlite (2–6 mm grain-size) and washed coco coir [‘Agripan
    cocco-perlite’, Perlite Italiana, Corsico (MI), Italy]. Ten plants were transplanted
    into each grow bag. Bags were placed on troughs covered with polyethylene film
    and with a 1.5% slope, in double rows spaced 0.25 m between twin rows and 0.7 m
    between each double row. Plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design
    with three replications, each experimental unit containing 3 grow bags with a
    total of 30 plants per experimental unit. The NS was prepared using well water
    with a pH of 7.6. Final macronutrient concentration (mM) of the NS was: N (14.3),
    K+ (10.1), P-H2PO4− (1.2), Mg2+ (1.7), Ca2+ (4.1), S-SO42− (2) resulting in an
    electrical conductivity (EC) of ≈3.0 dS m−1. Micronutrients were supplied according
    to Johnson et al. (1957). The pH of NS was adjusted to 5.5 using 5 M H2SO4. Plants
    were irrigated using five pressure-compensated drip emitters (2 L h−1; Netafim,
    Fresno, CA) per grow bag, placed at approximately 20 cm spacing along the bag,
    at equal distance from the lateral edges of the bag. In this experiment, the automatic
    irrigation system was set to supply irrigation according to pre-set schedules,
    while the sensor-network was used for VWC monitoring, as described in more detail
    below. Plants were kept well-watered using a pre-set irrigation schedule (one
    minute of irrigation per hour from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm) to prevent drought stress
    and to allow abundant leaching to avoid salt accumulation in the substrate. All
    plants were grown under those conditions up to the start of treatments. Treatments
    were imposed on June 6 2016, 38 days after transplant (DAT), and consisted of:
    i) ‘Well watered’ treatment, used as a control, in which plants were irrigated
    up to the end of the experiment with a schedule set to maintain the substrate
    VWC close to the maximum water holding capacity; ii) ‘Permanent irrigation suspension’,
    in which watering was permanently stopped, with the aim to expose plants to a
    progressively drying substrate; iii) ‘Recovery after 3 days without irrigation’,
    in which watering was suspended and restarted three days later, when plants started
    to show symptoms of drought stress according to the measurements performed on
    that day; iv) ‘Recovery after four days without irrigation’, in which watering
    was suspended and restarted 4 days later. In the last two treatments, the maximum
    water holding capacity of the growing substrate was restored when irrigation was
    resumed. The experiment was terminated 5 days after the start of the drought conditions,
    when plants in the ‘Permanent irrigation suspension’ treatment showed severe water
    stress symptoms. Environmental conditions inside the greenhouse were measured
    using a CS215-L temperature and relative humidity probe (Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT, USA) and a LI-190R quantum sensor (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA), both
    connected to a CR1000 datalogger (Campbell Scientific). Average daily mean, minimum
    and maximum air temperatures inside the greenhouse during the whole growing cycle
    were 22.8, 11.2 and 38.9 °C, respectively. Average daily mean, minimum and maximum
    air relative humidity values were 60, 19 and 94%, respectively. The daily light
    integral (DLI) during the experiment ranged from about 3 to 22 mol m−2 d−1, with
    a mean value of 15 mol m−2 d−1. One soil moisture and EC sensor (GS3, Decagon
    Devices, Pullman − WA, USA) per experimental unit was used to monitor the VWC
    during the experiment. Each sensor was installed in the middle part of the central
    grow bag, at equal distance between emitters, and was fully inserted into the
    substrate. Sensor output was measured and stored by the GICK at a scan interval
    of 30 min, which calculated VWC from the measured bulk dielectric permittivity
    (ε) using a substrate-specific calibration equation (VWC = −0.0004·ε2 + 0.0296·
    ε − 0.0334 , r2 = 0.99), developed using the methodology described by Nemali et
    al. (2007). The hydraulic properties of the substrate were determined on an unused
    perlite-coco mixture sample, using the evaporative method. The instrument (Hyprop,
    UMS, Munich, Germany) has a soil sample ring with two precision mini-tensiometers
    at different heights to measure the matric potential gradient within the substrate.
    The soil sample ring is placed on a balance to measure evaporation from the substrate
    surface. Weight measurements are also used to determine the changes in VWC of
    the substrate throughout the measurement period. The 250-mL soil sampling ring
    was filled with substrate, which was subsequently saturated with water. Data collection
    started after the tensiometers were inserted into the perlite-coco mixture and
    the soil sample ring was placed on the balance. Data collection was performed
    using software specifically designed for this purpose (TensioView, UMS). Matric
    potential data are expressed both in hPa and as the pF (log10 of the absolute
    value of the matric potential in hPa). Data collection took 12 d, after which
    data were analyzed using curve-fitting software (Hyprop-Fit, UMS). This software
    determines a moisture release curve for the substrate and can also determine hydraulic
    conductivity of the substrate, but only when the substrate is relatively dry and
    a measurable matric potential gradient is present in the substrate (VWC less than
    0.25 m3 m−3). For more details on this technique, see Peters and Durner, 2008a,
    Peters and Durner, 2008b. Gas exchange and leaf water potential (Ψ) measurements
    were taken every day of drought conditions around midday on plants in the ‘Well
    watered’ and ‘Permanent irrigation suspension’ treatments, to follow the plant
    responses to different substrate water conditions. Those measurements were also
    taken on day 4 and 5, the day following the restarting of irrigation, on plants
    of ‘Recovery after 3 days without irrigation’ and ‘Recovery after 4 days without
    irrigation’, respectively. Net leaf photosynthesis (Pn), stomatal conductance
    (gs) and transpiration rate (Tr) were measured using a LI-6400XT Portable Photosynthesis
    System (Licor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), which provided a photosynthetic photon
    flux (PPF) of 800 μmol m−2 s−1 and a CO2 concentration of 400 μmol mol−1. The
    measures were performed on two plants per replications on two fully-developed
    young green leaves per plant exposed to sunlight, for a total of twelve replicated
    measurements per treatment. The Ψ was measured using a Scholander-Hammel type
    pressure chamber (Scholander et al., 1965). For each replication, two leaves were
    collected from two different plants, for a total of twelve replicated measurements
    per treatment. At the time of measurements, a note was also taken on the visual
    appearance of plants (i.e. presence or absence of visual symptoms of stress).
    On the 4th day after the start of the drought conditions, chlorophyll (a, b and
    total) and total carotenoid content were determined spectrophotometrically using
    the extraction procedure reported by Bonasia et al. (2013) with some modifications.
    Briefly, leaf discs (≈0.3 g) were punched from young, expanded leaves of two plants
    per replication. The leaf discs were placed in 80% acetone for the extraction
    and the absorbance of the extract was measured at 470, 645 and 662 nm, using a
    UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The amount of chlorophyll
    a and b, total chlorophyll and total carotenoids, expressed on a fresh weight
    basis (μg g−1), were calculated using the following Eqs. (1)–(4) (Dere et al.,
    1998): (1) Chlorophyll a (CHLa) = 11.75 × A662 − 2.350 × A645; (2) Chlorophyll
    b (CHLb) = 18.61 × A645 − 3.960 × A662; (3) Total chlorophylls (CHLtot) = CHLa + CHLb;
    (4) Total carotenoids = [1000 × A470 − 2.270 × (CHLa) − 81.4 × (CHLb)]/227. 2.2.2.
    Experiment 2 Basil seedlings were transplanted on June 20 2016, in perlite-coco
    grow bags. The experimental layout (basil variety, grow bags and substrate types
    used, planting layout, irrigation materials and the NS composition) was the same
    as reported in detail for the Experiment 1. Treatments started 9 DAT and consisted
    of: i) ‘VWC 0.4′: the system supplied irrigation as soon as VWC measured by sensors
    dropped below 0.4 m3 m−3; in this treatment, each irrigation event provided an
    amount of NS allowing a low leaching fraction (<10% as a target), by setting the
    irrigation event duration (roughly 7–9 min per irrigation event) based on preliminary
    observations, and with small adjustments during the growing cycle when needed;
    ii) ‘VWC 0.3′: the system supplied irrigation with little leaching (roughly 13–15 min
    per irrigation event) as soon as VWC dropped below 0.3 m3 m−3; iii) ‘VWC 0.3HL’:
    the system supplied an irrigation event as soon as VWC dropped below 0.3 m3 m−3;
    each irrigation (roughly 18–19 min per irrigation event) provided enough NS to
    allow high leaching (≈20% as a target); iv) ‘VWC 0.2′: the system supplied irrigation
    with little leaching (roughly 30–32 min per irrigation event) as soon as VWC dropped
    below 0.2 m3 m−3. Plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with
    three replications, each experimental unit containing 3 grow bags with a total
    of 30 plants per experimental unit. Three GS3 sensors per treatment were used
    to measure substrate VWC and EC. Each sensor was installed in the middle part
    of the central grow bag in each experimental unit, at equal distance between emitters,
    and was fully inserted into the substrate. At each scan (30 min), the system collected
    standard sensor readings [ε, temperature and bulk electric conductivity (ECb)]
    and calculated VWC using the equation reported in Section 2.2.1, and pore water
    EC (ECp) according to Hilhorst (2000) Eq. (5): (5) where: εw is the real portion
    of the dielectric permittivity of the soil pore water, calculated using the soil
    temperature (Tsoil) using the formula εw = 80.3 − 0.37 (Tsoil − 20); ECb is the
    bulk electric conductivity measured directly by the sensor; ε is the dielectric
    permittivity; εECb = 0 is the real portion of the dielectric permittivity when
    ECb = 0 and assumed to be 6, based on recommendations for soilless substrates
    by the manufacturer. After every scan, the system checked the average (out of
    the three sensors) VWC for each treatment, representing an irrigation zone, and
    irrigation took place for the treatment when VWC was lower than the specific irrigation
    set-point (Hagen et al., 2014; Valdés et al., 2015). The system stored information
    (time of start and stop) of every irrigation event. Flow meters [GSD5, B Meters,
    Gonars (UD), Italy] were used to record the amount of supplied NS. NS leachate
    from the grow bags was collected in buckets placed at the lower end of each experimental
    unit and was measured approximately every two days. No pesticide applications
    were needed during the growing cycle, which ended on July 13 2016, 23 DAT. Average
    daily mean, minimum and maximum air temperatures inside the greenhouse during
    the crop cycle were 30.5, 22.0 and 40.3 °C, respectively. Average daily mean,
    minimum and maximum air relative humidity were 53, 30 and 77%, respectively. The
    daily light integral (DLI) during the experiment ranged from about 12 to 21 mol m−2
    d−1, with a mean value of 19 mol m−2 d−1. On 22 DAT, gas exchange parameters were
    measured using the same equipment and methods described for Experiment 1. The
    same day, relative chlorophyll content of the leaves was measured non-destructively
    with a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (Minolta, Ramsey, N.J.), which measures chlorophyll
    content in arbitrary units (here referred to as SPAD units). The measurements
    were performed on three plants per experimental unit (10 measurements per plant
    on the upper part of the canopy). On 23 DAT, plants were harvested. Total fresh
    weight of shoots (yield) was measured on all 30 plants of the experimental unit,
    while leaf area and number of leaves were measured for 6 selected representative
    plants. WUE was calculated as a function of the yield and the applied irrigation
    water (WUE = total fresh weight of shoots/irrigation volume applied). Color analysis
    of leaves was conducted with a colorimeter (CR-400, Konica Minolta, Osaka, Japan)
    equipped with illuminant D65, in reflectance mode and in the CIE L* (lightness),
    a*(redness) b* (yellowness) color scale. For each replication, color parameters
    were measured on two plants, using five expanded leaves from both plants, and
    two measurements per leaf. Before the measurements, the colorimeter was calibrated
    with a standard reference. 2.2.3. Statistical analysis Data were subjected to
    analysis of variance (ANOVA). Treatment means were separated by Tukey test when
    there was a significant effect at the P < 0.05 level. The statistical software
    STATISTICA 10.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA) was used for the analysis. 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Experiment 1 The VWC in the substrate of the ‘Well watered’
    treatment remained close to the maximum water holding capacity, with a small decrease
    in VWC overnight, when the plants were not watered (Fig. 3). In contrast, VWC
    decreased progressively in the other treatments. In the ‘Permanent irrigation
    suspension’ treatment, VWC was approximately 0.40, 0.26, 0.18, 0.10 and 0.07 m3 m−3
    around midday on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively (Fig. 3). On day 3 and 4,
    after taking measurements for that day, irrigation was reactivated in the two
    VWC recovery treatments. Until irrigation was reactivated, VWC values in these
    treatments were similar to the ‘Permanent irrigation suspension’ treatment. After
    reactivating irrigation, VWC was restored to the maximum water holding capacity
    of the substrate, as was evident from the appearance of leaching. However, VWC
    values at the maximum water holding capacity in the substrates subjected to drying
    and then re-watered did not reach the same VWC as the substrate of the ‘Well watered’
    treatment (Fig. 3). This may be due partly to the typical hysteresis that most
    growing substrates exhibit during drying/wetting cycles, affecting their hydraulic
    properties and inducing rewetting difficulties (Valat et al., 1991; Naasz et al.,
    2009). Download : Download high-res image (252KB) Download : Download full-size

    sensors in perlite-coco substrates subjected for 5 days to normal irrigation conditions,
    permanent irrigation suspension, and irrigation reactivation after 3 or 4 days
    of suspension. Data points are the mean of three replications with bars representing
    ±SE (reported for measurements every 12 h). According to the substrate hydraulic
    properties analysis, the pF increased from 0.69 to 2.59 as the substrate VWC decreased
    from 0.59 to 0.16 m3 m−3. At substrate VWCs of 0.40, 0.30, and 0.20 m3 m−3, the
    pF was 1.49, 1.98, and 2.34, respectively (corresponding to matric potentials
    of −31, −95, and −221 hPa) (Fig. 4A). Hydraulic conductivity measurements depend
    on a gradient in matric potential between the two tensiometers of the HyProp and
    could only be determined for substrate water contents from 0.30 to 0.16 m3 m−3.
    Figs. 4B and C show the hydraulic conductivity over a range of VWC and matric
    potential (expressed as pF) in the perlite-coco substrate used in the experiment.
    Within this relatively narrow range of substrate water content, the hydraulic
    conductivity decreased 690-fold. At a substrate VWC of 0.30 m3 m−3, the hydraulic
    conductivity was 0.076 cm day−1, while at a VWC of 0.20 m3 m−3 it was reduced
    to 0.0025 cm day−1, approximately 30 x lower. This rapid decrease in substrate
    hydraulic conductivity can slow the mass flow of water towards the root system
    and may limit water availability in highly porous, dry substrates (O’Meara et
    al., 2014). Download : Download high-res image (247KB) Download : Download full-size

    scale) as a function of VWC and matric potential. For the first two days following
    irrigation suspension, the plants showed no visible or physiological stress symptoms
    (Fig. 5). On day 3, plants subjected to drought conditions had much lower gs,
    Pn, and Tr than well-watered plants (0.03 vs 0.12 mol m−2 s−1, 2.27 vs 7.88 μmol m−2 s−1
    and 1.51 vs 3.63 mmol m−2 s−1, respectively) (Fig. 5A–C). In addition to physiological
    effects, symptoms of water stress became visible in drought-stressed plants on
    day 4, and became more severe on day 5. On day 4, gas exchange of plants that
    were re-watered after 3 days without irrigation recovered to values similar to
    the control plants, higher than drought stressed plants (Fig. 5A–C). Similarly,
    on day 5 non-irrigated plants had lower gs, Pn, and Tr than control. Plants irrigated
    after 4 days of drought recovered to values similar to control plants on day 5
    (Fig. 5A–C). Closing stomata to reduce transpiration and prevent tissue dehydration
    and potential damage to the leaf, is a typical response of plants to decreasing
    water availability (Sperry et al., 2002). Download : Download high-res image (346KB)

    3 days without irrigation’ and ‘Recovery after 4 days without irrigation’, respectively.

    and significant at P ≤ 0.05, P ≤ 0.01 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively. Vertical bars
    represent standard errors (n = 3). The Ψ was similar for all plants up to day
    3, while on days 4 and 5 plants subjected to permanent water stress had lower
    Ψ than control plants (−1.4 vs −0.8 and −1.4 vs −0.77 MPa, respectively on day
    4 and 5) (Fig. 5D). In general, plants subjected to drought and subsequent irrigation
    had Ψ values similar to the control (Fig. 5D). The contents of CHLa, CHLb, CHLtot,
    and total carotenoids were similar in all treatments (on average 1037, 325, 1362
    and 216 μg g−1 fresh weight, respectively; data not shown). Kordi et al. (2013)
    reported reduced photosynthetic pigment concentrations in drought-stressed basil
    grown in a mixture of fine sand, leaf mould and garden soil, subjected to drought
    ranging from 60 to 30% of field capacity for the entire growing cycle. On the
    other hand, Khakdan et al. (2016) found that under severe water-deficit stress
    conditions (25% of field capacity in a sandy loam soil, for 29 days), basil CHL
    content increased while carotenoid content decreased. In our study, the absence
    of responses in terms of CHL and carotenoids content is probably due to the short-term
    focus of the study. The drought conditions had clear effects on gas exchanges
    and water status of plants, but stress was not severe enough to affect pigment
    concentrations. Based on substrate VWC during the experiment and observations
    on plants, no physiological stress responses were observed when VWC value was
    higher than approximately 0.20 m3 m−3 (day 1 and 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 5), but when
    VWC dropped below this value, as observed on day 3 at a VWC of approximately 0.17 m3 m−3
    (Fig. 3), photosynthesis started to decrease (Fig. 5). However, all basil plants
    exposed to a VWC well below 0.20 m3 m−3, although for a short period, survived,
    while clearly showing symptoms of water stress, consistent with previous studies
    with plants in soilless substrate exposed to drought for a short- (O’Meara et
    al., 2014) or long-term period (Burnett and van Iersel, 2008; van Iersel et al.,
    2010). In our experiment, water availability in the drought-stressed treatment
    could be considered a limiting factor to normal plant gas exchange and water status
    from day 3 on, as confirmed by the drastic reduction in photosynthetic parameters
    and, starting from day 4, by Ψ. Based on the substrate moisture release curve
    (Fig. 4A), the matric potential corresponding to the VWC observed on day 3 at
    the time of measurements (approximately 0.17 m3 m−3) was −315 hPa. Water in soilless
    growing substrates is generally considered readily-available for plants with substrate
    matric potentials of −10 to −100 hPa (pF of 1–2), while water is considered progressively
    less available at matric potential values lower than −100 hPa (pF > 2) (De Boodt
    and Verdonck, 1972). Plant-available water in soilless substrates traditionally
    has been defined based on substrate matric potential, but it recently has been
    suggested that substrate hydraulic conductivity may be the real factor controlling
    water availability to plants in soilless growing substrates, and should be considered
    in the assessment of plant response to substrate water status variations (Raviv
    and Blom, 2001; Wallach, 2008; O’Meara et al., 2014). Low hydraulic conductivity,
    in fact, may slow water movement in drying substrates and thus limit plant water
    uptake (van Iersel et al., 2013). In the present study, drought symptoms in plant
    basil appeared approximately at a hydraulic conductivity of 0.0005 cm day−1 (Fig.
    4C). The results of this experiment show the short-term physiological effects
    of low VWC on soilless basil plants, but also indicate that photosynthesis and
    leaf water potential can recover following a short drought (with VWC as low as
    ≈0.10 m3 m−3). It is also interesting to note that leaf gas exchange was reduced
    before visual stress symptoms or a reduction in Ψ were detected. This confirms
    that irrigation management based on visual assessment of plants may not be able
    to prevent drought stress, while real-time sensing of substrate water status is
    an effective tool, if combined with precise information on the effects of substrate
    water availability on plants (Nemali et al., 2007). However, it is necessary to
    also test the growth response of plants exposed to different VWC levels for the
    entire growing cycle to determine how well short- and long-term response correlate.
    3.2. Experiment 2 The sensor-based irrigation system automated irrigation successfully
    over the 14 days of this study. In all treatments VWC fluctuated between the maximum
    water holding capacity of the substrate (as evident from the presence of leaching;
    Table 1) and the specific irrigation set-point for the treatment (Fig. 6). The
    first sensor-based irrigation event occurred in ‘VWC 0.4′ on the first day after
    treatments were started (9 DAT, Fig. 6A), and in ‘VWC 0.3′ and ‘VWC 0.3 HL’ treatments
    on the following day (10 DAT, Fig. 6B), while it took 4 days (12 DAT) for the
    substrate of the ‘VWC 0.2′ treatment to dry out to the irrigation set-point (0.20 m3 m−3)
    (Fig. 6C). The VWC fluctuations were greatest in the ‘VWC 0.2′ treatment, in which
    the irrigation frequency was the lowest (Fig. 6C). As in Experiment 1, substrates
    subjected to the lowest VWC set-point (0.20 m3 m−3) showed rewetting difficulties
    following severe drying, as evident from the lower VWC values after irrigation
    events compared to the initial VWC measured at the start of treatments (Fig. 6C)
    (Valat et al., 1991; Naasz et al., 2009). Table 1. Total applied nutrient solution

    Fig. 6. Substrate volumetric water content (VWC) and pore water electrical conductivity
    (ECp) in perlite-coco growing bags with basil plants irrigated at 0.40 (A), 0.30
    with minimum or high (HL) leaching (B), and 0.20 m3 m−3 (C). DAT = days after
    transplanting. Total applied NS was similar in ‘VWC 0.4′, ‘VWC 0.3′ and ‘VWC 0.2′
    treatments, while the highest total applied NS was recorded in ‘VWC 0.3HL’ (Table
    1). Leaching was similar (8.3%, on average; Table 1) for treatments where a low
    leaching rate was targeted, regardless of irrigation set-point, while it was higher
    (18.4%) in the high leaching treatment (Table 1). Adjusting the irrigation event
    duration combined with the sensor-based control of substrate moisture was an effective
    strategy for precise control of leaching. The use of GICK allowed for a reduction
    in leaching to values considered a goal for efficient irrigation management in
    free-drain (open) soilless culture, i.e., <10 − 15% (Pardossi et al., 2009). The
    ECp generally increased over time in all treatments, from ≈2.5 to ≈4.5 dS m−1
    (Fig. 6), thus confirming an accumulation of salts in the growing substrate (from
    fertilizers added and salts present in the irrigation water). Such increase in
    ECp commonly occurs in commercial soilless growing conditions (Lieth and Oki,
    2008). However, the behavior of the ECp differed among treatments. When the set-point
    was 0.30 or 0.40 m3 m−3, the ECp generally fell after irrigation events, as an
    effect of salt leaching and dilution in the growing medium, and increased on average
    during the interval before the next irrigation, reaching the maximum value just
    before the next irrigation (Fig. 6A and B). Similar patterns were reported by
    Valdés et al. (2015). On the other hand, when the set-point was 0.20 m3 m−3, the
    ECp tended to decrease during the time between two consecutive irrigation events
    and sharply increased after an irrigation (Fig. 6C). It is possible that the longer
    period between consecutive irrigation events in this treatment allowed plants
    to take up salts from the substrate solution, lowering the ECp, before the next
    application of NS increased ECp again. Such fluctuations in ECp were less pronounced
    in other treatments, where NS was applied more frequently. However, we cannot
    rule out that this decrease in ECp between irrigation events was an artefact of
    the way ECp was calculated, since ECp calculations tend to be less accurate at
    low VWC (Scoggins and van Iersel, 2006). The higher leaching rate imposed in the
    ‘VWC 0.3HL’ treatment led to less salinity build up compared to ‘VWC 0.3′. The
    ECp in these two treatments was similar in the first half of the growing cycle,
    but in the second half (approximately from 16 DAT) the ECp was higher with minimum
    leaching (‘VWC 0.3′) than with high leaching (‘VWC 0.3HL’) (4.5 vs 3.7 dS m−1,
    respectively, on average) (Fig. 6 B). The desired leaching rate typically is a
    function of how quickly salt-build-up is likely to occur as well as crop sensitivity
    to salinity. Leaching may be desirable when the irrigation water has high salinity,
    as leaching will help move salts out of the root zone. If the water is of good
    quality and fertigation results in little salt build-up in the root zone, then
    the leaching rate can be minimized (Lieth and Oki, 2008). Growers may adjust the
    duration of irrigation events, with the optimal duration dependent on the volume
    of water that needs to be supplied to restore the substrate water holding capacity
    starting from a specific water content, plus the amount of leaching that is needed.
    Measuring salinity and water status of substrates is essential to determine appropriate
    leaching amounts. In conventional irrigation approaches, the leaching fraction
    should range from 0 to 20% under well-controlled conditions; in rare instances,
    higher leaching fractions are targeted (i.e. when saline irrigation water is used)
    (Lieth and Oki, 2008). However, it is common in substrate systems to apply 30–50%
    more water than that used by the crop (Kläring, 2001), and often growers do not
    have a clear and precise record of the leachate amounts. The availability of new
    sensors that combine the measurements of substrate water content and EC offers
    new possibilities for management of irrigation and leaching, especially when saline
    water is used for soilless cultivation (Incrocci et al., 2010). Those sensors
    have been successfully integrated in the automatic irrigation system designed
    for the present study, resulting in precise control of leaching. Using GICK, growers
    could monitor ECp and increase the leaching rate when ECp exceeds crop-specific
    thresholds. Photosynthetic parameters and SPAD did not differ among treatments
    (Table 1). This is consistent with our findings in Experiment 1, which showed
    that photosynthesis of basil plants can recover fully after exposure to VWC as
    low as 0.20 m3 m−3. With similar leaching rates, plants irrigated at 0.20, 0.30,
    or 0.40 m3 m−3 set-points had similar fresh weight (Table 1). Based on the hydraulic
    properties of the substrate (Fig. 4A), water is readily available to plants at
    VWC > 0.30 m3 m−3 (pF > 2). The absence of an effect on yield between plants irrigated
    at 0.30 and 0.40 m3 m−3 seems to confirm this. On the other hand, exposing plants
    repeatedly, although briefly, to a VWC of 0.20 m3 m−3 did not significantly reduce
    growth. Fresh weight tended to be highest when a higher leaching rate was used
    (‘VWC 0.3HL’, Table 1), probably because leaching lowered ECp during the final
    part of the growing cycle and may thus have reduced salinity stress (Fig. 6B).
    Similar to fresh weight, water use was similar in the three treatments with low
    leaching fraction. As expected, water use was higher with more leaching (‘VWC
    0.3HL’), but because fresh weight was greatest in this treatment, WUE was similar
    in all treatments (≈21 g fresh weight per liter; Table 1). At the crop level,
    WUE indicates how efficiently applied water is used to produce yield, and optimal
    irrigation scheduling has been recognized as a major factor affecting WUE. However,
    due to the high economic value and productivity per unit of applied water compared
    to other crops, commercial vegetable growers tend to over-irrigate with a consequent
    reduction in WUE (De Pascale et al., 2011). Sensor-based, on-demand scheduling
    proved to be effective in reducing irrigation water use and, as a result, in improving
    WUE in ornamental crops, without risking adverse consequences from under- or overwatering
    (Lea-Cox et al., 2013; Hagen et al., 2014). When tested in vegetable production,
    the use of soil moisture sensors for irrigation management resulted in improved
    WUE (De Pascale et al., 2011; Montesano et al., 2016a). The color of food is one
    of the main quality parameters evaluated by consumers, influences their choices,
    and is critical to product acceptance, since food appearance is the first impression
    consumers get before either accepting or rejecting food (Leon et al., 2006; Montesano
    et al., 2016b). In the present study, the irrigation set-points did not influence
    the visual quality of basil in terms of color (Table 1). Similarly, Bekhradi et
    al. (2015) found that irrigation treatments corresponding to 100, 75 and 50% of
    the field capacity did not influence color parameters of basil ‘Genovese’, ‘Green’
    and ‘Purple’ genotypes, grown in peat substrate under greenhouse conditions. 4.
    Conclusions The sensor-based irrigation system, designed and constructed for the
    present study, automated irrigation successfully, and was suitable for assessing
    the physiological responses of plants to different water availability levels in
    the growing substrate. Thus, our results indicate that the use of a wireless sensor
    network for real-time sensing of substrate water status is an effective tool for
    precision irrigation management of basil in greenhouse soilless conditions. The
    findings of the present study revealed that drought symptoms appeared in basil
    at a moisture level well below the commonly accepted matric potential-based limit
    for the easy available water in soilless substrates, confirming that more work
    is needed to identify the practical effects of irrigation set-points on crop performance.
    This approach to irrigation may be adapted to other species if combined with precise
    information on the effects of water availability levels on those species. Founding

    This paper is concerned with multi-objective fuzzy stochastic model for determination
    of optimum cropping patterns with water balance for the next crop season. The
    objective functions of the model is to study the effect of various cropping patterns
    on crop production subject to total water supply in a small farm. The decision
    variables are the cultivated area of different crops at the farm. The water requirement
    of the crops follows fuzzy uniform distribution and yields in the objective functions
    are taken as a fuzzy numbers. The model is solved by using fuzzy stochastic simulation
    based genetic algorithm without deriving the deterministic equivalents. Similar

    Land and water are the lifeline of agriculture and proper utilization of these
    resources is essential. Irrigation plays an important role in agriculture as it
    ultimately decides the fate of the crops under cultivation where enough water
    is not available. There is an increasing demand to raise agricultural production
    to feed the growing population of the world, which can be achieved by either increasing
    cultivation area or by using improved mechanism & tools for cultivation. Matanga
    and Mariño (1979) developed an area allocation model which maximizes gross margin
    from yields of crops under consideration subject to total water supply. The author
    also considered the maximum amount of water that can be delivered for irrigation
    purpose and labour constraint. Mayya and Prasad (1989) presented tank irrigation
    system to optimize the grain yield of rice in the semiarid region of India. Dudley
    (1988) presented an integral consideration of the up-farm and on-farm aspects
    for a river valley irrigation system controlled by a single decision maker. Bras
    and Cordova (1981) considered the intraseasonal stochastic variation of the crop
    water requirements and the dynamics of the soil moisture depletion with optimal
    temporal allocation of irrigated water. Singh et al. (2001) formulated a linear
    programming model to maximize net return and optimal crop patterns under different
    level of water availability, farmers’ socio-economic conditions and crop preference.
    Kipkorir et al. (2001) developed an optimization model to aid in decision making
    in real time for deficit irrigation taking water demand and supply for multiple
    crop irrigation. Sethi et al. (2002) developed two models: (i) Ground water balance
    model and optimum cropping and (ii) Ground water management model to determine
    optimum cropping pattern and ground water allocation from private and government
    tubewells according to different soil type, type of agriculture and seasons. Benli
    and Kodal (2003) developed a non linear model with objective function as crop
    water benefit functions, to determine the optimum cropping pattern, farm income
    and water allocation under limited and inadequate water supply conditions. Sahoo
    et al. (2006) presented a fuzzy multi-objective and linear programming based management
    models for optimal land-water crop system planning for the Mahanadi-Kathajodi
    delta in eastern India. Tsakiris and Spiliotis (2006) presented cropping pattern
    planning under water supply from multiple sources aiming at maximizing the revenue
    from irrigation activities. Sarker and Ray (2009) presented three different approach
    for solving multi-objective crop planning model and analyzed the solution to give
    better insight from the point of view of a decision maker. Mishra et al. (2009)
    developed a multi-objective optimization model to determine the optimal crop pattern
    and optimal size of auxiliary storage reservoir. Also, Fasakhodi et al. (2010)
    used a multi-objective fractional goal programming approach method to determine
    the optimal cropping pattern and sustain water availability in a rural farming
    system. Along with surface water, ground water also act as a vital source for
    irrigation. Karamouz et al. (2010) developed a model to determine net benefits
    of agricultural products using genetic algorithm considering water allocation
    priorities and surface and ground water availability. Márquez et al. (2011) solved
    a multi-objective crop planning problem using a Pareto based Multi-objective Evolutionary
    Algorithms (MOEAs). Noory et al. (2011) presented a linear and a mixed-integer
    linear model to maximize net benefit with multi-crop planning and irrigation water
    allocation using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Regulwar and Gurav
    (2011) presented a multi-objective fuzzy linear programming irrigation planning
    model for deriving the optimal cropping pattern for Jayakwadi project in the Godavari
    river in Maharashtra, India. Wang et al. (2011) presented a GIS frame work for
    changing cropping pattern under different climate conditions and irrigation available
    scenarios. Sahoo and Panda (2012) presented a simulation modeling for sizing lined
    on-farm pond for various crop substitution ratios in rainfed uplands of Eastern
    India. Sahoo and Panda (2014) presented rainwater harvesting option for rice-maize
    cropping system in rainfed upland through root zone water balance simulation.

    food production with minimum allocation of available water at watershed scale
    after meeting human, livestock and environment needs under different scenarios.
    Zhang et al. (2014) presented a virtual water assessment methodology to assess
    strategies of saving water by identifying products which would be better as imports
    rather than producing them. Kaviani et al. (2015) presented a constraint-state
    equation optimization model and beta function considering the stochastic variable
    in nonnormal state and uncertainties for both irrigation depth and soil moisture.
    This model uses the soil moisture budget equation for the specific plant on a
    weekly basis. Karandish et al. (2015) presented an application of virtual water
    trade to evaluate cropping pattern in arid region by considering three indices
    including VW, unit blue water value, and the ratio of required blue water to the
    total water allocation for the agriculture. Srivastava and Singh (2015) presented
    a multi-objective optimization problem taking crop area, soil properties, use
    of fertilizer, and local socio-economic conditions as constraints which is solved
    using fuzzy programming approach with linear, exponential and hyperbolic membership
    functions. Singh (2016) presented a model incorporating the ground water component
    to maximize the net farm revenue of an irrigated area located in northwest India
    by optimally allocating the available water and land resources. Fuzzy stochastic
    programming is concerned with optimization problems in which some or all parameters
    are treated as fuzzy random variables in order to capture randomness and fuzziness
    under one roof. Mohan and Nguyen (1997) developed the idea of fuzzifying approach
    to multi-objective stochastic programming problem. Dubois and Prade (1987) proposed
    the linear programming with constraints having fuzzy interval co-efficient. Luhandjula
    (1996) generalized robust programming with interval co-efficient to the fuzzy
    constraints into fuzzy inclusion constraints. Recent developments in fuzzy stochastic
    problem can be found in: (Acharya and Biswal 2011; Sakawa et al. 2011; Wang and
    Watada 2012; Mousavi et al. 2013; Sakawa and Matsui 2013; Aiche et al. 2013; Acharya
    et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014). Montes and Montes (2015) studied the properties
    of fuzzy ranking and generalized their definition as compared with fuzzy random
    variables by means of stochastic orders. Due to the complexities of agricultural
    systems, the mathematical models are generally manipulated by imposing selective
    constraints which reduces the impact and effects of the model. To capture such
    ambiguity and uncertainties fuzzy stochastic model proves beneficial. Lu et al.
    (2008) presented an inexact two stage fuzzy stochastic programming method for
    water resources management under uncertainty with fuzzy punishment policies under
    different water availability condition. Zhang et al. (2009) proposed a robust
    chance constrained fuzzy possibilistic programming model for water quality management
    within an agricultural system, where solutions for farming area, manures/fertilizers
    application amount, and livestock husbandry size under different scenarios are
    obtained and interpreted. Guo et al. (2010) presented a fuzzy stochastic two stage
    programming approach for water resources management under multiple uncertainty
    within an agricultural system. Li et al. (2014) presented a hybrid fuzzy stochastic
    programming method for water trading under uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness.
    The method developed is applied to a water trading program within an agricultural
    system. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are based on the concept of the biological process
    of natural selection, developed by Holland (1975). Development of this field is
    mainly due to John Holland and his students. GA provides a set of efficient domain
    independent search heuristics which are a significant improvement over other traditional
    methods. The model most commonly investigated is a GA with a binary alphabet,
    multiple bit mutation, one point crossover and proportional fitness selection.
    Liu and Iwamura (2001) formulated a fuzzy simulation based genetic algorithm for
    solving chance constrained programming models with fuzzy decision. Deb (2001)
    formulated a nonlinear goal programming using multi-objective genetic algorithm.
    (Jana and Biswal 2004; 2006) used GA in a stochastic simulation in order to solve
    stochastic programming problem. More detail on genetic algorithms can be found
    in (Liang and Leung 2011; Loghmanian et al. 2012; Ruiz et al. 2015; Lu et al.
    2013; Mitchell et al. 2014; Miseviċius 2015). Particularly, in agriculture sector
    GA can play a vital role in providing a better alternate solutions which will
    help the decision maker in taking proper decision. Kuo et al. (2000) presented
    a model based on on-farm irrigation scheduling and simple GA method for decision
    support in irrigation project planning. The proposed model is applied for optimizing
    economic profits, simulating the water demand, crop yields and estimating the
    related crop area percentages with specified water supply and planted area constraints.
    Nagesh Kumar et al. (2006) presented a genetic algorithm (GA) model for obtaining
    an optimal operating policy and optimal crop water allocation from an irrigation
    reservoirs. The objective is to maximize the sum of the relative yields from all
    crops in the irrigated area. Ines et al. (2006) proposed an innovative approach
    to explore water management options in irrigated agriculture considering the constraints
    of water availability and heterogeneity of irrigation system properties. Fallah-Mehdipour
    et al. (2012) compared total net benefit of the water resources system and multi
    cropping patterns rules by three evolutionary algorithm genetic algorithm, particle
    swarm optimization and shuffled frog leaping algorithm. This research paper proposes
    a multi-objective fuzzy stochastic model for proper allocation of agricultural
    land and the optimum use of water from surface runoff, with water balance for
    turn in period (turn-in indicates a time period that extends from harvesting of
    the first crop to sowing of the second crop. During this period the farmer prepares
    his land and makes it ready for sowing of the second crop.) or increasing the
    area of the farm using genetic algorithm. The paper highlights the use of a fuzzy
    random variable along with a fuzzy random numbers to represent the water requirement
    and yields of the different crops to deal with uncertain and imprecise data occurring
    in real world as compared with other researchers where uncertainty and impreciseness
    are handled separately. This paper also highlights the concept of turn in period
    which was not used before. The study is carried out in the region where sufficient
    rainfall occurs to fulfill the needs of the irrigation water which is different
    from other researchers work, i.e. other works are related to reservoir or where
    sufficient water for irrigation are not available. The water requirement of the
    crops is satisfied from the rainfall and surface runoff, which greatly reduces
    the investment cost, comparing with the other researchers works where additional
    cost is incurred as water pumping cost and use of ground water to fulfill the
    demand of irrigation water. Cropping and irrigation water are mainly characterized
    by uncertainty due to randomness of hydrological variables such as rainfall, evapotranspiration,
    soil moisture. The uncertainty in crop response lead us to take the water requirement
    as a fuzzy uniform distribution and yield as a fuzzy numbers. The problem was
    then solved using a genetic algorithm to find the Pareto solution and to analyze
    the minute change in cultivated area or to use the balance water for the land
    preparation in the next crop season. The combining affect of using fuzzy stochastic
    model with genetic algorithm clearly gives a better picture and also interpret
    the result in a better way. The paper is organized as follows: Following this
    introduction, the Study Area is described in Section 2. The mathematical model
    formulation is provided in Section 3. Methodology is described in Section 4. Data
    Implementation is presented in Section 5. Results are provided in Section 6. Finally,
    the conclusions are provided in Section 7. 2 Study Area The study area chosen
    for the case study is the Balasore district located in the northeast coastal plain
    of Odisha, India, which lies between 21∘3′ to 21∘59′ N latitude to 86∘16′ to 87∘2′
    E longitude. It is surrounded by Medinipur district of West Bengal in its northern
    side, Bay of Bengal in its east, Bhadrak district in its south and Mayurbhanj
    and Kendujhar district lies on its western side. The climate is characterized
    by high temperatures and humidity, with mean summer temperature of 30.4∘C and
    mean winter temperature of 21∘C. The average annual rainfall is 1700 mm which
    is received normally in two parts, June to September (South-West Monsoon) and
    October to December (North-East Monsoon). Two important rivers, Budhabalanga and
    Subarnarckha pass through this district from west to east before flowing into
    the Bay of Bengal. The district has three main types of soil, (i) Laterite Soils
    (uplands), (ii) Alluvial Soils (medium-lands), (iii) Coastal Alluvial Soil (lowlands).
    The major crops of this region are rice, wheat, maize, cereals, pulses, oilseeds,
    fibres, vegetables, spices, sugarcane and others (Figs. 1 and 2). Fig. 1 Map of

    Model Formulation A multi-objective fuzzy stochastic programming model has been
    developed for optimum production under different crop patterns and water balance
    (water remaining after the first growing season) in a farm considering the following
    terminology: Area under cultivation for different types of crops Rainfall in growing
    season for each allocated area Runoff from catchment area Crop yields 3.1 Model
    Description A multi-objective fuzzy stochastic programming model has been formulated
    for obtaining optimal production under different crop patterns with water remaining
    after the first growing season. Parameters (i)   Cultivated Area: x i ,i=1,2,⋯
    ,n: is the area under cultivation of different crops, measured in hectare. (ii)   Yield:
    Y i ,i=1,2,⋯ ,n: is the yield of different crop under cultivation, measured in
    kg/hectare. (iii)   Water Requirement: w i ,i=1,2,⋯ ,n: is the water requirement
    of different crops, measured in millimeter (mm). (iv)   Rain Water: w a i ,i=1,2,⋯
    ,n: is the water available from rainfall to different cultivated area, measured
    in millimeter (mm). (v)   Water from Catchment Area: W: is the total water available
    from catchment area, measured in millimeter(mm). (vi)   Water Balance: W b j ,j=1,2,⋯
    ,m: is the water remaining under different crop pattern after the growing season,
    measured in millimeter(mm). (vii)   Decision variables: x i ,i=1,2,⋯ ,n: is the
    amount of area under cultivation for different crop. 3.2 Formulation of Objective
    Functions The Production functions of different crops can be formulated using
    the cultivated area and their yields. As yields of various crops differ from year
    to year, so we took yield as fuzzy triangular number. If P is the production function
    then, P can be given by:P = Yield X Cultivated Area.Mathematically, the above
    expression can be expressed as: \(\large {{\sum }_{i=1}^{n} \tilde {Y_{i}} x_{i}}\).This
    objective is known as the maximization of crop production. 3.3 Formulation of
    Constraints (i)   Better crop yields depends on many factors, including, timing
    of rainfall and/or irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides, good variety seeds, etc,.
    As water plays a vital role in farming, the water requirement of the crops can
    be incorporated as constraints, is divided into two parts, (a) water received
    from the rainfall and, (b) water received by means of irrigation. (ii)   Rainfall
    is a hydrological phenomenon, so, how long it will rain, with what intensity,
    and by how much is uncertain. The information regarding water absorbed by the
    soil, evapotranspiration, seepage loss, etc, can be imprecise. This lead us to
    consideration of water availability to the soil as a fuzzy variable. The condition
    of the soil in a day period do not change abruptly, so the water requirement by
    the crop is taken uniform over a small area. Under this concept, water available
    to crops by rainfall can be assumed to follow a fuzzy uniform distribution. So,
    the requirement of water by different crops can be given by: (iii)   Water requirement
    = Cultivated Area X (Water Requirement of the crops - Water Available (rainfall)).
    The above constraints for different crops can be mathematically expressed as:
    $$\large{\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} (\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai})}. $$ The fulfillment
    of water requirement depends upon the total water available. Mathematically, the
    constraint can be expressed as: $$\large{\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}(\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai})\leq
    W} $$ The water balance after the crop season under different crops can be given
    by: Water Balance = (Total Water Available - Total Water needed by different crops
    under different allocated area). Mathematically, the above expression can be expressed
    as: $$Wb_{j}= W - \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}(\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai}), j = 1, 2,
    \cdots, m $$ Affinity Constraints: Depending on the regions or states, there is
    the tendency of farmers to grow paddy or wheat in the Kharif season (The cropping
    season in India during which crops are grown amidst monsoonal rains is called
    as kharif season in local parlance. In other words, this is also called as the
    rainy season in the country. This season continues for four months, starts from
    mid-June and continues up to mid-September of the year.) and pulse or mustard
    in the Rabi seasons (This season continues for six months, starts from October
    till end of March) for the basic food security. So, water for turn in period plays
    a vital role as it can save investment on water supply. The affinity constraints
    puts upper limits on the cultivated area for food supply.To summarize the objective
    function and constraints derived above, the problem can be modeled as a multi-objective
    fuzzy stochastic programming problem which is given below: $$ \max :(Z_{j})= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}
    \tilde{Y_{i}}x_{i}, j= 1,2,\cdots,m $$ (3.1) Subject to $$ \tilde{P}(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}
    (\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai})\preceq W)\succeq\tilde{\beta_{i}} $$ (3.2) $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}}
    Wb_{j}&=& W - {\sum}_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}(\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai}), j = 1,2, \cdots, m
    \end{array} $$ (3.3) $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} x_{i}&\geq& 0, i = 1,2, \cdots,
    n \end{array} $$ (3.4) where \(0\leq \tilde {\beta _{i}} \leq 1\) , \(\tilde {w_{i}},
    i = 1,2, \cdots , n\) follows fuzzy uniform distribution. In order to solve the
    above problem, we formulated an equivalent mathematical multi-objective fuzzy
    stochastic programming model, which is described in the next section. 4 Methodology
    A Multi-objective probabilistic programming (MOPP) problem is of the form: $$
    \max :(Z_{j})=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}x_{i}, j = 1, 2,\cdots, m $$ (4.1) Subject
    to $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} P(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} (w_{i}-w_{ai}) &\leq&
    W)\geq{\beta_{i}} \end{array} $$ (4.2) $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} x_{i} &\geq&
    L_{i}>1, i = 1, 2,\cdots,n \end{array} $$ (4.3) where 0≤β i ≤1 and w i ,Y i ,i=1,2,⋯
    ,n are random variables. A multi-objective fuzzy probabilistic programming (MOFPP)
    problem is an MOPP problem of the above form where at least one of the weighted
    objectives w i ,Y i is a fuzzy random variable (FRV) and β i is a positive fuzzy
    number.In a MOFPP problem, fuzziness may be present in constraints or in the objective
    function or in both. Therefore, at least one of the following situation is possible.
    At least one of the constraints has a fuzzy inequality Objective function has
    a certain type of fuzziness Co-efficient present in the constraint, in an objective
    function, or in both are fuzzy random variables. A multi-objective fuzzy stochastic
    programming problem where fuzziness and randomness are considered in the objective
    function as well as in the constraints can be expressed as: $$ \max:(Z_{j})=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\tilde{Y_{i}}
    x_{i} , j = 1, 2,\cdots,m $$ (4.4) Subject to $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} \tilde{P}(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}
    (\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai}) \preceq {W}) \succeq\tilde{\beta_{i}} \end{array} $$ (4.5)
    $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} x_{i}\geq L_{i}\geq 1, i=1,2,\cdots,n \end{array} $$
    (4.6) where \(\tilde {w_{i}}\) are fuzzy random variables, and \(\tilde {Y_{i}}\)
    are fuzzy random number, L i is the constant, ∀ i. To handle the fuzziness, let
    \(\tilde {w_{i}},i=1,2,\cdots , n \) are independent FRVs distributed uniformly
    with \(\widetilde {FU}\)(\(\tilde {\mu } ,\tilde {\sigma }^{2}\)) where \(\tilde
    {\mu }\) and \(\tilde {\sigma }^{2}\) are mean and variance of \(\tilde {w_{i}}\),
    i=1,2,⋯ ,n The α-cut of the probabilistic constraints can be expressed as: $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}}
    \tilde{P} (\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} (\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai}) &\leq& {W})[\alpha]
    \end{array} $$ (4.7) $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} = \tilde{P}(\tilde{A_{i}}&\leq&
    {W})[\alpha] \end{array} $$ (4.8) $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} \text{where}~\tilde{A_{i}}&=&
    \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} (\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai})\\ &=&{P(W\geq A_{i})|A_{i}\in
    \tilde {A_{i}}[\alpha]} \end{array} $$ (4.9) Using fuzzy inequality, the α-cut
    of the fuzzy constraint (4.5) is expressed as: $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} \tilde
    {P}(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} (\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai}) &\leq& {W})[\alpha]\succeq
    \tilde{\beta_{i}}[\alpha] \end{array} $$ (4.10) $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} &=&
    1- \tilde{P}(W < x_{i} (\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai})) \end{array} $$ (4.11) $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}}
    &=& 1- P(W < A_{i*})\geq {\beta_{i}}^{*} \end{array} $$ (4.12) where \([w_{i*}[\alpha
    ],w_{i}^{*}[\alpha ]]\in \tilde {w_{i}}[\alpha ]\) and \([\beta _{i*}[\alpha ],\beta
    _{i}^{*}[\alpha ]]\in \tilde {\beta _{i}}[\alpha ]\). 4.1 Fuzzy Stochastic Simulation
    Based GA The fuzzy simulation based GA is designed to solve the fuzzy probabilistic
    programming problems. The steps of the algorithm is described as follows: The
    Flow Diagram of Fuzzy Stochastic GA is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Flow Diagram of
    Fuzzy Stochastic GA Full size image Representation and Initialization A population
    of potential solutions is generated and initialized. If x 1,x 2,.....x n be n
    decision variables, then each chromosome can be represented as X p =(x 1,x 2,.....x
    n ) p , where p=1,2,......p_s i z e, while p_size is the size of the population.
    To search the domain space, the p_size plays an important role which can be chosen
    by the user. The value of x i (i=1,2,......n) is typically chosen between 0 and
    the upper bound of the decision variables. Constraints Checking by the Fuzzy Simulation
    The constraints of the model are represented as fuzzy probabilistic constraints.
    Consider the fuzzy probabilistic constraints $$ \tilde {P}({\sum}_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}
    (\tilde{w_{i}}-w_{ai})\leq {W})\succeq \tilde{\beta_{i}^{*}}. $$ (4.13) The constraint
    of Eq. 4.13 are defuzzyfied using the α-cut and inequality conditions, so that
    the constraint reduces to $$ 1- {P}(W < A_{i*})\geq \beta_{i}^{*}, $$ (4.14) i=1,2,......,n
    as discussed before.The above inequality can be represented by $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}}
    {P}(W- A_{i*}< 0)\leq (1- \beta_{i}^{*}) \end{array} $$ (4.15) $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}}
    = {P}(t_{i}(x,s)< 0)\leq (1-\beta_{i}^{*}) \end{array} $$ (4.16) where s=(w 1,w
    2,.......,w n ,W∗) is a (n+1) dimensional continuous probability distribution,
    x=(x 1,x 2,x 3,.......,x n ) is the decision variable. We generate N independent
    random vectors as \(s^{r} = ({w_{1}^{r}}, {w_{2}^{r}}, ...... {w_{n}^{r}})\),
    r = 1,2,....N, i = 1,2,....,n.Let N i (≤N),i=1,2,.....,n be the number of times
    the following relation satisfies: t i (x,s r)<0,i=1,2,.....,nThen by the definition
    of probability, (4.16) will hold if \(Ni/N< (1-\beta _{i}^{*}), i=1,2,\cdots ,n\).
    Fitness The fitness value are the values of objective function which satisfies
    the given constraints. Selection Binary Tournament Selection is a robust selection
    mechanism which is based on fitness value from a pool of chromosomes. We randomly
    pick k individuals and compare their fitness, replacing the lower with higher
    fittest individuals. The winners are chosen for mating. The process is repeated
    until the desired number of individuals are achieved. Here, k is called the tournament
    size, which controls the selection pressure. If k = 2, then the tournament selection
    is called binary tournament selection. The obtained individuals by this process
    is treated as new population with same p_size as initial population. Crossover
    This is a genetic operator which used in varying the individuals from one generation
    to next generation. When it is done at a particular point, it is known as single
    point crossover. A random number ‘r’ is generated within (0,1) for each pair of
    chromosomes, which act as the crossover point. We assign the probability of crossover
    as pc, if r ≤ pc, the given pair is selected for crossover. Mutation To maintain
    the diversity of population from one generation to another, mutation operator
    is used. Mutation is a process of modifying the genetic material of a chromosome
    from its initial state. When the variation is done bitwise in a sequence, it is
    called bitwise mutation. It creates a random small diversion and stay near to
    the area of parents. A random number ‘r’ is generated from the interval [0,1]
    for every bit in the population. If r ≤ pm then the parents are selected for mutation
    operation, where pm is the probability of mutation of the genetic system. Termination
    The process is stopped as the desired accuracy is attained or the maximum generation
    fixed is completed. 5 Data Implementation Maximizing agricultural production has
    become an important aspect for farmers, states or the Nation. The government provides
    necessary facilities required for the better production such as good varieties
    of seed, better irrigation, fertilizers, etc,. On the other hand, if uncultivated
    land can be brought under cultivation then it can add to production. In order
    to achieve this, a better planning and detailed study of the area is required.
    In this case study, we studied the effect of cropping pattern and water balance
    for turn in period simultaneously, keeping in view the production factor as well
    as farmers tendency to grow basic food crops of that region. The upper limit of
    area under paddy or maize cultivation were kept as 73 % of total irrigated area.
    This study should help to determine how much the command area can be increased
    where less irrigation facilities are provided. To study the cropping pattern and
    water balance, a command area of 0.8 hectares and a catchment area of 0.7 hectares
    (grassland) are assumed. Annual rainfall data was collected for 30 years and the
    yield of various crops data were collected for ten years. From the collected information,
    the pattern of rainfall data was studied and found to follow a log-normal distribution
    with different percentage of significance level. As the significance level was
    low, so we did not followed this distribution. A particular year was chosen with
    a sufficient amount of rainfall to study the case. Runoff and Antecedent soil
    moisture are calculated by the Curve number formula is given below. $$Q=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    0, \qquad \text{ for }P \leq I_{a}\\ \frac{(P-I_{a})^{2}}{P-I_{a} + S} \qquad
    \text{ for }P \leq I_{a} \end{array}\right. $$ where Q is runoff, P is rainfall,
    S is the potential maximum soil retention after runoff begins, I a is the initial
    abstraction. The runoff curve number is calculated using the formula $$S = 254(\frac{100}{CN}-1)
    $$ where, CN is the curve number. For our study purpose, we took I a = 0.3 S.
    As this value has been recommended for most of the watersheds in India especially
    which are not in black soil region and under A M C I I&I I I conditions (Bhattacharya
    et al. 2003). The water requirement and yields of different crops are provided
    in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. Table 1 Water Requirement of Crops Full size table
    Table 2 Yields of Crops Full size table To study the effect of cropping patterns
    and water remaining for the land preparation in the next growing season, a multi-objective
    fuzzy stochastic programming problem was considered. We chose five different crops:
    rice, maize, cotton, gram, and groundnut. Water requirement of different crops
    was assumed to follow a fuzzy uniform distribution as water requirement do not
    vary in a small farm area for a day with a hydrological conditions. The agricultural
    yield per season of different crops are taken as fuzzy number as it depends on
    many factors such temperature, climates, soil condition, etc,. The mathematical
    model of the case study can be expressed as follows: $$\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}}

    simulation based GA is coded in C++ in VB2010 Professional. The population size
    is taken as 100. When the population size is increased, it does not yield better
    results as compared with the population size 100 and the computational time is
    also increased. When we decrease the population size it affects the result and
    the accuracy too, although, the computational time is less than compared with
    the population size 100. As we increased the number of generation then also computational
    time is increased with no improvement in the results. The population size is normally
    taken as twice the number of decision variables in the problem. In this study,
    we have five decision variables each with 10 bits. So, the size of the population
    is taken 100. Computational time is one of the factor which needs to be taken
    care while solving a problem so that we can handle large and complex problems.
    It is seen from the table that as we increase the value of α the objective value
    keeps on increasing. Optimum solution (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11)
    obtained for different values of probability of crossover(pc), mutation(pm) and
    α over 300 generation are given in Appendix. It is clearly seen from the Fig.
    4, that the availability of water in (W 2,W 4,W 6) are more as compared to the
    availability of water in (W 1,W 3,W 5,W 7). Therefore, the patterns of the crop
    can be easily chosen for better planning so that more farm area can be included
    to obtain maximum return in that region. Fig. 4 Water Balance for Different Crops
    Pattern Full size image From the Fig. 5, we find that the production is more in
    (Z 1,Z 3,Z 5,Z 7) than in (Z 2,Z 4,Z 6) under the given set of constraints. From
    Table 2, we see that the combination of rice, cotton and groundnut and the combination
    of rice, gram and groundnut are almost same as the yield of cotton and gram are
    same. Similarly, the case of maize, cotton and groundnut and the combination of
    maize, gram and groundnut. The water requirement and the yield of rice crop is
    more than of maize crop. So, the production is more and water availability is
    less in Z 1 as compared to Z 2. As water requirement of cotton and gram are slightly
    different with same yield, so any one crop can be chosen with rice crop. But,
    when we compare groundnut with cotton or gram then we find that the water requirement
    of groundnut is less and yield is more than cotton and gram. In (Z 2,Z 4,Z 6),
    the yield of the maize crop plays an important role in the production value. Since,
    the yield of maize crop is less than of rice crop, so, the production value is
    less in (Z 2,Z 4,Z 6) than in (Z 1,Z 3,Z 5,Z 7). Fig. 5 Production for Different
    Crops Pattern Full size image The graphical representation of the Pareto Solution

    fuzzy stochastic model was developed to study the crop patterns and the optimal
    use of available water resources in a small farm. The methodology presented incorporates
    maximization of crop production under different combination of crops. In the objective
    functions where fuzziness has been incorporated as a fuzzy numbers to obtain the
    production of the crops under different crop patterns subjected to the availability
    of the irrigated water. The yield of the crops in the objective function is treated
    as a fuzzy numbers and imprecise data are taken from Table 2. The irrigated water
    provided to the soil for the growing season are from rainfall and surface runoff
    generated from it. The water requirement by the crops follow a fuzzy uniform distribution.
    The data from Table 1 is used for generating a fuzzy uniform distribution for
    different crops. The multi-objective fuzzy stochastic programming problem is then
    handle with Fuzzy Stochastic GA based approach. This study help us to know that
    by how much the area of the farm can be increased under the condition of availability
    of water and the patterns of the crop. As different crops have different water
    requirement, so under which pattern, how much irrigated area can be increased,
    or the remaining water can be used in preparing the land for the next crop season
    can be known from the study above. From the result section, we find that the crops
    pattern in (Z 1,Z 3,Z 5,Z 7) shows better production than (Z 2,Z 4,Z 6). In terms
    of water balance, we see that (W 2,W 4,W 6) leaves a significant amount of water
    for turn in period than (W 1,W 3,W 5,W 7). So, a small amount of cultivated area
    can be increased for (Z 1,Z 3,Z 5,Z 7) and a good amount of area can be increased
    for (Z 2,Z 4,Z 6) in terms of water balance. From the above crop patterns, appropriate
    decisions can be made by taking into consideration the price of grains, i.e, which
    crop area should be increased and by how much, so that it will fetch more profit
    with less investment. The advantage of using GA is that the Pareto solution helps
    in analyzing the effect of small change in terms of cultivation area which will
    help the decision makers in taking appropriate decision. The present model can
    be extended to study the reservoir area model including different objective functions
    with more constraints such as labour constraints, cost related issues, under different
    crop season, etc. The model can also be extended to tank irrigation optimization
    model, ground water resources model. References Acharya S, Biswal MP (2011) Solving
